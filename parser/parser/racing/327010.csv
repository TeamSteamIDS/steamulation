												I bought this game out of an obsession with old American cars and hot rodding. In the screenshots it looked as if there were some convincing recreations of classics like the '59 Fairlane, '61 Thunderbird and first generation Corvette. The last time I can recall a notable racing game focusing on this subject was EA's shortlived MMO ""Motor City Online"" back in 2001 which only survived a couple of years before the servers were shut down. So what do you get for your money with this game? Well, not a lot really. The cars, it seems, have not been officially licenced, so although they look convincingly enough like the real things, the names of their manufacturers have been changed. However, their actual model names are in many cases preserved. For example, there is a '53 Chevy 210 which is actually called a '53 210 but supposedly built by ""Oceanic"". There is a '53 Cadillac Eldorado called a '53 Eldorado but by ""Belvedere"". The models have Chevrolet and Cadillac badges, respectively, and have ""Chevrolet"" and ""Eldorado"" lettering, respectively. Perhaps it costs big bucks to actually use the manufacturers' names in a game, even when the vehicles depicted are sixty years old. So maybe we should not be too hard on the developer about this. What we can be hard on them for is the rest of the game. The actual gameplay itself is not very interesting. The driving challenges are rather boring, the AI of the drivers you race against is horrific and the game is beset by bugs. There are fewer now than at launch, owing to a patch, but others remain. The developer stopped engaging on the community hub after releasing the patch, so it looks like those bugs are here to stay. The aforementioned car models are quite pretty, but the car handling physics are awful and you might be stopped in gameplay by invisible objects on the road.Your AI competitors can collide with each other and with you, and you can collide with AI traffic. However, the AI competitors do not appear to have any sort of collision detection with traffic and just drive straight through it. The AI cars get a headstart over you in each race, with you always lagging behind to start but, then again, they also find it difficult driving down a straight road without spinning off.There is a progression system, where you gain levels by earning points for winning races and for ""style"" by doing things like overtaking, driving closely behind a competitor (called ""slipstream"", but why bother with this acheivement?), cornering ""perfectly"" (although you can be awarded this even for massive imperfections), ""drifting"", and ""speed threshold"". The progression seems capped at the end of level 10 (i.e. you do not progress on to 11, although it is apparent that you are supposed to be able). However, thereafter you continue to get the end-of-level-10 rewards after earning even a single point in any race, which include a special vehicle. I have now more than twenty such vehicles in my ""garage"". This would not be so bad, if there was a facility in the game to sell these cars, but there is not, so I keep accruing them. The car awarded is a ""1936 Emperor"", which itself has a rather buggy 3D model and which is at odds with the quality of the other vehicle models. It looks as though its suspension has collapsed, and it has wheel hubs appearing lower than the wheel centres when you change the rims.The biggest let down for me was the customization of the vehicles. Vehicles are presented as having four different performance characteristics: ""Acceleration"", ""Speed"", ""Handling"" and ""Grip"". Each one is awarded a percentage. There are eight ways to increase the performance of each vehicle: ""Carburetor"", ""Supercharger"", ""Engine"", ""Torsion Bars"", ""Transmissions"" [sic], ""Suspensions"" [sic], ""Brakes"" and ""Tires"". Each component you can change has three levels of improvement over stock. ""Carburetor"" and ""Engine"" improvements affect ""Speed"", but not ""Acceleration"" (who knows why). ""Brakes"" improvements affect ""Grip"" but not ""Handling"" (again, don't ask me why). This is too simplistic to be in any way interesting, and pales in comparison to the customization options in Motor City Online more than a decade ago (which were not perfect by any means).There are also visual customization options: each car has available four each of ""Front Bumper"", ""Rear Bumper"", ""Side Skirts"", ""Hood"" and ""Muffler"". Changes cost in-game money earned in races, but for some reason have escalating prices, despite not offering a performance benefit, and the most expensive part not necessarily being the best looking. Some of the changes, like ""Side Skirts"" are too all-encompassing. This option also changes the front and rear fenders and door panels, and is available regardless of whether the car model you are modifying actually has side skirts or not. It would be better if you could change aspects, like the front and rear fenders seperately, or the front bumper without changing the grille, for greater customization. You cannot chop the roof of your '49 Merc (or '49 Belvedere Bonanza, as it is known in the game), or lower its suspension. You can change the paint, but the range of paints is not very pleasing, and some body panels are frustratingly unpaintable if the car has a two-tone trim, which is quite common.There are options to change the wheels and tyres (called ""Rims"" in the game, seemingly an anachronism), but this does not always work, despite the fact that a lot of wheels have been unlocked, they just cannot be selected. Some of the wheel models are broken or missing, so when you do select them the car's wheelrims disappear or they appear incorrectly.There is no drag racing. There is no option to just drive. There is no damage modelling. There is no dashboard camera, views being restricted to either the front bumper or a chase view. When you change the speedometer reading to miles an hour (instead of the default kilometres an hour, in a game set in 1950s America!), the distances remain given in metres. The music is a few tracks of boogie woogie instrumentals. Derivative modern compositions, obviously, and nothing faithfully from the era. These are played repetitively and there seems to be one track for the main menu, one for driving in game, one for finishing a race and looking at the score board, etcetera. At first I thought the music was by default a bit too loud, but when I turned it down to hear the dreadful sound of the engines I was glad for it. The engine noises are another major disappointment. The engines sound more like four-cylinder Datsuns than American V8s in this game. The only exception, so far as I can tell, is the Corvette, which does actually have a V8 sound.This would not be such a bad game if it was available at a much lower price. The full price as of this writing is £14.99. This is what I would call a premium price range and this is a long way short of being a premium game. I have had plenty of better games through Steam for a lot less money.To cut a long review short, I would not recommend buying this game unless, like me, you must have virtual representations of classic American vehicles on your computer which you can race, albeit in a limited fashion. [13/12/2014: In light of a patch, I have re-written parts of this review. The game is, however, still in a broken state owing to the level cap bug and its awarding you the same car again and again which the patch did not address.][07/04/2015: The devs implied that the patch released in December of 2014 was only the first, but it now looks like it was also the last. Game abandoned by developer maybe? Significant bugs remain and no announcement of a fix.]			"

												Motorama is hands-down one of the literal worst racing games that I have ever played. And it's all because of the physics engine it uses. Every little input, the game percieves as 100x stronger, giving out the feeling that the road is at all times made of damn solid ice. Please keep in mind that you are given 2 car choices at the beginning and I took the one with less speed and MORE HANDLING. Your car will always, somehow, end up spinning on the road. Oh, and when you try to turn the wheel and get back into the race? You do another spin. That forces you to restart the race and play it over and over and over until you learn to do millimetric movements of the controller's bumper. Fu*king incredible work.Also, I encountered a lot of bugs in just 30 minutes of playing. Apparently sometimes when I press forward, the game thinks I pressed reverse. I tried it on both keyboard and controller, to make sure it was not an external input fault. Guess what: it wasn't. That and a lot of clipping through texture, visual bugs, the npcs you are racing against can pass through the cars in the trafic like ghosts while you have to avoid them.   TL;DR: Physics engine is the worst, you can't complete a single race because the road will seem like it's made out of ice. Also, the game itself is a buggy mess. Don't buy, under any circumstance.UPDATE: After writing this review, before uninstalling the game I just HAD to create a new category in my library, titled ""Never to play again"". This game is the ""proud"", first, and as of now, only member of this category.			"

												Motorama is, quite frankly, one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of playing. I saw the bad reviews beforehand, but the theme seemed appealing and I figured that as a budget purchase it couldn't be that bad. Oh how wrong I was.The game fails in its execution of basic concepts from step one, step two, and and all other steps therein. For starters, options are as barebones as barebones gets. Surprisingly they did manage to implement separate music and sound effects sliders, which is always something I look for in games (most games have the music mixed too high for my liking), however they don't work. Anytime you finish a level, the game reverts to its deafening full volume until you go back to the options and select the sliders again. This is a major annoyance and is one of the reasons this game no longer takes up valuable space on my hard drive.After going through the options, the game railroads you through some poorly-designed dialog. When you press A to clear the dialog, it'll act as pressing A for whatever happens to take focus when it goes away, forcing you to do things you may not want to. Once you've been unceremoniously dumped into a match, you are given no instruction whatsoever on how to play. I still don't quite understand what all the buttons do (Y seems to make the screen flash for a second, for instance), and I had to work out myself that the boost only works when you're at a certain speed (at least I hope that's why it doesn't work half the time I press the button).And to top it off, the handling is atrocious. Sometimes driving in a straight line will send you careening out of control. Making controlled turns, or even worse, a drift, is next to impossible. The car just constantly wants to spin. And best as I can tell it's literally impossible to win the first match because the other cars are just better than yours in every single way, so short of being an expert with the drift and boost system (and what new player to this impossible-to-control game is going to be?) to make up for the massive speed difference, you're going to lose. And then be told you won, because third place is good enough, and there are only three cars. Just...why?I'm familiar with games where the cars take some effort to keep on the road; Driver San Francisco is one of my favorite games of all time, but the cars are definitely tricky to handle until you get to know them. And I've played Early Access games like Super Toy Cars that lack polish but have good ideas, and eventually get patches until they're in a fully released state. But this game is just so bad on its first impression that I cannot stand another moment to even see if different cars handle better. All I know is I bought a speed upgrade and my car instantly became even less drivable. The game seems more half-baked than your average Early Access affair, but is supposedly a fully released product. Just avoid it all costs; it's not even worth it on sale. It's got bugs that will never be patched, and deep issues with the mechanics that will never be fixed. Spend your time on better games instead.			"

	Motorama is 'classic racing' game in a 1950's theme with the same singlepiece of music playing throughout; over and over again.  There has been some graphical bugs in the form of cars or terrain flickering, or drivers floating in the air, and even unsee-able maps that render the game unplayable at times.	You earn rewards as you play the game, and there are a decent amount ofcar selections and upgrade performance options, but the cost of purchasing performance upgrades plus the cost of purchasing new vehicles does not balancewith the cash awards for winning in races.  This leads to a lot of grinding justto get enough money to buy upgrades (which are necessary), to progress forward.There is also a lot of selection for cosmetic upgrades for those that like topimp out their vehicles.	Overall I found that if you didn't establish a big lead in the first 20 seconds of gameplay, you have little to no chance of winning.  If you are leadingthe race, your competitors magically catch up in the one straight segment of roaddespite you holding a significant lead throughout the rest of the track.  Hitting a wall or going off road most of the time guarantees a loss, which makes the game more restrictive than enjoyable.	The different types of missions are done very well.  The racing elementis pretty decent and is somewhat enjoyable, and I wanted to like this game.  The more I played, the more I found the bugs,the annoying UI, the grinding and the discrepancy in balance throughout gameplaymakes this game not one I would recommend.  	This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												While the car models look nice, Motorama is a broken game. I would suggest not purchasing it unless you are specifically looking for a buggy and broken gaming experience.

												Main reason for writing a review in this case? That game is better than ""Mostly Negative"" and I would have missed 5 hours of fun if I´d given a damn about those negative reviews.I bought the game for about 5 € and ended the game in 5 hours:1€/h is ok.There haven´t been any major bugs. Driving is ok (getting better with the upgrades that you aquire in the game). Gfx are ok. If you know what you are doing the game is easy and since there are still levels that you have to repeat with better equipment later on it seems reasonable to me.An option to switch to harder difficulty would be as nice as the game remembering that you´ve turned the music off before the race - those are the only ""negative"" things imho (considering that I bought it for 5 €).p.s. if I would have bought it for the full price I would be as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as all the other negative reviewers ^^			"

												It's not bad for a Unity game at it's current price point.  I'll definitely get my  money's worth out of Motorama.The Good:  The cars are interesting.  There is a lot of customization for each and every car.  The game definitely pushes all my nostalgic Street Rod buttons.  Can't wait to build up a garage of custom classics!   You definitely need brakes to take corners, so it's not 100% arcade racer.The Bad:  Music is loud and repetative (volume seems to reset after races).  Controls are awkward to set (prelaunch menu w/o labels) and default setup is strange (shoulder buttons for manual shift).  Sound effects are mediocre, definitely missing the rumble of leaded fueled V-8s (in the early game, anyway).  AI opponents clip through NPC traffic but you do not (!!!).  ""Drifting"" was called ""powersliding"" in the 60's.  ;)The Ugly:  Being a Unity game, graphics settings are bare bones (resolution and low/med/high).  Cars do not shade when driving through tunnels.  Controller vibration does not work with 360 controller, so there is very little feedback or road feel compared to other racers.  Only two camera views (bumper and 3d person), but camera controls (left stick for pan, Y for look back) are sufficient.  No car damage.Bottom line:  Yeah, pick it up.  Play it a weekend.  Then give the developer constructive feedback (as I hope I've done here).			"

												I just played some Motorama. It wasn't too bad on the first track, the AI is a little weird but when it moved onto the Beach track things went to ♥♥♥♥. You're in a race with 3 other cars and there's traffic on this coastal road. The other cars in the race just drive right through the traffic, literally right through them. As well as being quite stupid, this also makes it much harder for you to dodge traffic since this makes it harder to see oncoming cars and you don't pass through them like the AI cars do.I can't recommend this game at all unless this bug is fixed.

												Can I recommend this game for full price? Hell no!Can I recommend this game in 90% sale? No way!Can I recommend to take this game if they were giving it for free? Still no.Only logical reason for buying this is if you wanna teach your children to not play video games: - Buy this, - tell your children to play it, - tell them that all video games looks simillar, - ... - They will never touch video game again.I started with summary because even reading full reviev for this game is a waste of time. If you still want to know more, continue reading.Even this piece of garbage have some possitives: - great idea for game, - graphics are not that bad.Unfortunatelly it's terrible because: - game looks unfinished (it looks like early alpha stage!), - horrible physics, - unfairly fast AI opponents, driving through the traffic, this won't be a problem though because in 50% AI will drive out of the road and sometimes even disappear, letting you win by commiting suicide xD, - abandonned by developers (last update - year ago, they fixed some minor bugs and didn't touch big problems), - you can use arrows or wasd to control you car... but it's random - in some races you will have to use WASD, sometimes arrows and sometimes you will have to restart it because nothing will work, - soundtrack: it's only one track, badly looped. After few races you start to hate it. You can turn off background music, but only for one race (after each race music restarts and you have to go back few steps to turn it off again).For achievement hunters: - game is possible to complete in less than 5 hours, no bugged achievements, - developer have really bad taste - looks like you get ""free girl"" to every car you won: ""Defeat <insert boss name here> and take away his girlfriend"".

												Pros:- Game looks good.Cons:- The driving is awful- The AI are always faster than you, even if you boost. It's damn near impossible to catch up.- If you try hitting ramming an AI to pass them, it spins you out of control while they just drive on.- The boost system is terrible. It doesn't really do anything.- The drifting is awful- This game is $20- Apparently AI can drive right through traffic (haven't witnessed it myself because I haven't been able to bring myself to play past the first race)In the end, you have an overpriced, broken piece of crap.

												this game is like an unpolished gem ( racing game with old cars kinda  remind me of nfs Porsche 2000 or corvette ps2 ) and should still be in early access ( if the lazy devs stopped playing too much cs go and start working on this game)but what bother me the most is that when i compare thee game to the steam store page of the same game i see lies ( false advertisement ) why ?!! well i will explain in details in this review.- first of all the plot , there is no actual plot you're just a man that love racing and your main objective is to beat your rivals , ok here is the first lie , the 3rd pic in store shows you 10 rivals (each one has 5 races that you need to win ) but actually there is only 5 rivals.-graphicly ?!!! mediocre at best , i know its an indie game but it could be better much better then this , and this is the second lie ,if you see the pics in the game store you will notice that each car has its own interior design and color , the sun effect and all of that good graphics ( the pics are photoshopped to make the game look good) but sadly all the cars has the same red and white interior design ( i have a screenshot to prove it)  and the graphics are bad even on ultra ,i saw better than this in indie games.-from the gameplay i can say that this game was going to a simulation racing game ( driving feels more stimulation than arcade) , the cars are hard to control (( you will see the IA struggling to maintain control during races) but after upgrading your cars its get a bit easier to handle, also the IA cars drive to other cars like it's nothing ( it's like cheating), the price of the cards is too high.- the game has the weirdest control , for me i had to plug the controller + the keyboard so i can navigate in the menu ( hard to configuration the controls).- the game is full of glitches and bugs , flickering textures ,frame drop in some areas of the map, cant select rims, sound get back in the menu even after you mute the game,IA cars struggling to race normally , car get stuck in invisible obstacles, IA cars becomes OP even with your upgraded car...ect-no voice acting except for the racing countdown , 3 music tracks in loop ( very annoying i had to mute it and play my own music in the background),engine sound sucks , turbo/nitro sounds like a grinding coffee machine ( lol no joke ).-achievements work perfectly ( surprisingly but they pop up after you close the game) and easy to get them all except for one that need some grinding (less than 1h).-no steam trading cards-did i have fun playing this game ?!! it would be a lie if i say no , i struggled but i did enjoy and had fun cause i took the game as a challenge so i guess it's depend on you.well finally i can say that this game feels like it's an abandoned and unfinished project ( from the pics and lack of contents ) and that the devs rushed to read to get some of the cashthat they wasted on the development that they wasted on the development ( also they rather prefer playing cs go then do real work on there game),if this is the maximum that they can do in games development industry then it's understandablebut no way this game deserve the 19.99$ price tag in this state it should be 4.99$ at max.so if you get mad quickly and rage quit easely don't play this gamein the other hand if you want to try it and see how bad it is you can wait for sales but don't pay more than 5$ or you will regret it 5/10 "

												Driving around in classic American cars and areas from the 50's, sounds pretty neat, right ? Motorama tries to bring back those days and succeeds quite well in doing so, if you look at it from a distance. Graphically, the game looks quite nice, even though there are better looking racing games out there. I did encounter some shadow glitches, but it could be my machine. Also, in game modes with 'traffic', the A.I. cars seem to be able to drive through the traffic cars...The areas are pretty well done and really capture that 50's feeling. Since there are only like 5 different areas, you've seen them all very quickly into the game, which should not be a problem, if there tracks were well done, which they are not. The tracks are mostly straightforward with a few corners and lack originality, do not expect shortcuts but expect invisible walls. Most tracks are just rehashed tracks, so you often have to race the same tracks, which have some minor variations. The gameplay is not that bad but nothing special either. Obviously, cars were slower back then, still the creators added some nitro to boost up your speed. I personally never heard of cars using nitro in the 50's, but then again I'm no genius on the subject. The difficulty accompanied with the terrible A.I. , are probably the reasons why real racing fans would not like this game. Motorama is a very easy game, even for me. As long as you upgrade your car from time to time, you should have no problem winning a race. The bot A.I.'s , sometimes drive around like they're drunk or think they are playing Carmageddon. Perhaps, this game is only interested for real classic American car lovers, right? Well, even though there are some nice looking classic cars, the developers do not own the license for cars that really exist(ed). They do look a lot like them though and personally, I did not really care but I think the fans would mind. The upgrades you can perform on your car are pretty standard aswell. Upgrading your motor, different set of wheels,... we've pretty much seen it all, even the visual upgrades aren't that special.Overall, Motorama is an OK game but it just feels like it could've been way more. The races are not fun enough and the game lacks content to be fun for more than a few hours. "

Teal DeerGenre tags: RacingValue Proposition: This is not worth $20 but I think it's getting a lot of undeserved hate. If it were $5-$10 in the store I'd feel a lot differently BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): A very mediocre 1950's version of PGR Initial Release Nov 2014Exposition, Concurrence and SummationMotorama is a very run of the mill, very mediocre, slowly paced racing game set in the 1950's. And it's overpriced. But in the interest of full disclosure I paid $1.49USD on Bundlestars and used the key activation. The game has some semi-wonky physics that adhere to the laws of inertia ten fold. It's very slow to get going and even more difficult to get something to stop moving or to go in a different direction. I get that the cars were heavier back then and the engines weaker but it may be taken to bit too far here. But again, at a lower entry point I wouldn't expect much more. They aren't terribly bad physics that can't be overcome through adaptation and it's nothing that improving the cars can't make feel a lot better. However, the E-brake will make the game become an uncontrollable ridge racer offshoot so don't use it unless you have no other choice. There is a slowly paced progression in career mode (which is the only mode). Very few cars to choose from. However, there are quite a few options to customize those cars cosmetically in regards to bumpers, wheels and paintjobs. You can upgrade performance here as well though all the stats are described as percentages making comparisons between the cars specs impossible without testing them yourself. The career mode is broken into what are essentially rival races. You have a set number of tasks to complete before each rival race is unlocked. For example, 3 clean overtakes, win 2 races with different cars or stay in the slipstream for some duration (drafting in otherwords). And it goes on this way. There are some style points very reminiscent of something like kudos from PGR or something that made your nitro charge faster in Burnout for driving into oncoming traffic or having near misses and it does make use of a turbocharger function that effectively acts as a nitro. THE GISTIts not a great game, it's not even very good – especially for what they are asking. So I can't recommended it. But if you like classics cars and can find it cheaply it's not the worst thing ever.Follow my curation page for more. "

												I don't like writing reviews about how bad a game is. I usually try to find the positive in any game I play. This game has the potential to be a good, decent budget racing game but with the current problems it has at the moment keep it from being that. First off its a simulation game that thinks its a arcade racer at times. I played this with a PC controller that’s shaped like a Xbox controller and a wired Xbox One controller. And with both controllers the steering is a little too sensitive at low speed. Even with a car fully upgraded its still real sensitive. No matter which car it was it would want to run off the road with just a slight push. Speaking of off road, when did dirt and grass feels like driving on ice? The road itself the game is fine. But once you go off-road, it feels like you're taking your car with street tires onto a frozen lake. There’s absolutely no traction at all once you're off the road. Even with one of the tracks having what looks like short cuts, they offer no traction at all. So its best just to stay to the road. The AI in this game are as smart as a box of rocks. Starting with the first race all the way to the end, the AI makes some REALLY dumb mistakes. Almost all the time one of the 3 AI in a race will just swerve itself into a wreck and the other 2 will wreck each other while you cruise to a win. This happens in all the Sprint, Race, Knockout, and Escape. And don't expect the AI get wreck by the cars on the track. They just drive through every single one that isn't a race AI or you. But don't expect yourself to run through them because most of the time if you even tap a car, it would almost put you in a dead stop. That’s right, you can be doing 160 and tap a car and you're down to 0. As for the race types, you have the 4 I have mention, you also have Stunt Trial (which appears 1 time) and Lap Record (Time Trial). So you have a good set of race types for the 5 levels in the game. For each level you have 4 races you have to do but you have to complete 4 objectives to compete against the boss of the level. So for the 5 level its rinse and repeat 5 times. And for the simulation part, you have a level system that gives you ""upgrades"" to nitro and special cars. I never noticed any nitro upgrades and the special cars are nice till you hit the level 10 bug. Then you will get the level 10 car over and over and over after every race. And with no option to sell cars in the game, you are stuck with a lot of the level 10 cars. The game is imbalance in a way that I took the first car you get, upgraded all the way, and won races all the way up to level 5. They game isn't worth the price they want for it in its current state. But with some work and some spit shine, this could become a decent budget racer.			"

												I usually stick to writing only positive reviews but when I saw the price of this game I had to do this. I like racing games, and I like old cars. Looking at the screenshots this game looked appealing to me and I immediately wanted to revive the nostalgic experience I had with games like Street Rod back in the day. Street race for money and then upgrade and customize your car, sounds great.Luckily this game was in bundle so I at least don't feel ripped off but I'm writing this for people who might think about buying this for 17,99€ (or whatever equivalent) or even anything more than 2-3 bucks.There's so much wrong with this game I don't know where to start...1. ContentI won every race in this game within 3 hours. The content in this game is simple math. There's around 10 cars, 5 race tracks and 8 racing modes, which sounds like a good variety factor but it's not... you go forward, you win, you crash, you lose. Career mode is build of 5 events, each containing 5 races. That's it. I finished whole game with the very first car I upgraded becase it was best (yea). Customization is very limited. Basically contains 2 categories: performance and visual upgrades. Visual upgrades are kinda nice but you won't care about them. You will save money for performance upgrades and cars and then you will finish the game and propably upgrade visually just for the achievement. Other than this Career mode there's nothing else to do. There's no multiplayer. No challenges. No other playmodes. No difficulty setting. No nothing... Thankfully. Why? Let's get to the next point...2. GameplayI don't know if I am even capable of describing how horribly this game handles. Controls are simply laggy and unresponsive. Thankfully you just go straight forward most of the time. Sometimes you had to slow down not so you won't crash while turning which would transform your car into unhandleable mess. The very first car is only one that handles ""not so bad"" when it's fully upgraded... the ""better"" cars goes crazy during turns and some even starts slipping just because they go fast. Even AI has constant problems handling the cars. I'm not even kidding, it's hillarious. Propably only positive thing I came upon while playing. But I digress. The so-called Career Mode is basically this: you find first race you're able to win, you repeat it for cash, buy upgrades until you're superior and win just because you go faster. Colission model is a joke as well as physics, there's no destruction model, no weather changes or any other features you might be used to in racing games. Instead of features, there are bugs.3. Bugs, glitches and constant nonsensical behaviour of this gameOn Steam, this is propably closest you can get to infamous Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. It's not nearly as bad but as I said... I haven't been able to buy racing game on Steam that would be even remotely broken as this one. Your opponents go through the traffic (you don't), you can't disable music in menu (you can but after every race it's on again), you go trough trees, controls sometimes don't work and stuff like that... my favorite was when I started a Knockout race which starts with animation of you and your car setting off. But instead of going forward, the animation made me go backwards which resulted of me going reverse and giving my opponents headstart.4. VisualsI don't care about graphics and talking about how this game looks would be beating a dead horse. I can say that some of the screenshots on Store page with the sunlight effects looks edited because the game don't look appealing like that in reality. The visuals are not awful. They're functional (no graphic settings btw. ... was this a mobile phone game?) but it just doesn't matter at all because everything else is horribly done.VERDICTI wouldn't recommend this to anybody unless you're achievement hunter in which case optimal price would be 2$. Price tag of 17,99€ for this is an insult to Steam users.			"

												Initial look is that this is a good fun game. Very simple graphics and simple game play put together to give a fun game. There is similarities to the very old Street Rod game and this is actually the reason why I purchased the game in the first place.After playing for a few hours you get tired of the glitching graphical bugs, the game possibility of a game breaking bug that gives you a negative 214,000,000 points for a progression acheivement. And of course putting all that behind to realise that not only is the game very very short (3 to 4 hours repetitive game play, but it is impossible to complete. There is a race map with a graphical glitch where you cannot see the road or ground at all. And of course the game will not let you progress until you place in the race without ground.Also a note on the full controler support. This game was built around a controler so much so all the menu options are ""A"", ""B"" or ""X"" with each not actually corrisponding to actual keyboard keys. I would be shocked is this game was not a direct port (cheeply done) from a games console. You do NOT neet a Joystick or Game Pad to use the game at all. You just need to use the force to find where the keys are.ConclusionThis is not a Need for Speed, but an old school racing game with some very cool cars to play with. A little over priced but so full of bugs that the game is unplayable. Do not purchase this game at all.NOTE I have changed my review to an initial positive to an out right DO NOT BUY.			"

												This might be one of the worst games I have ever played.  The cars handle like they were from Crusin USA or some other early 2000s game.  The physics are almost non-exsitant and there are absolutely no damage models.  The soundtrack gets on your nerves after a few minutes.  Also it never feels like you are traveling very fast.  150 feels like 50.  Oncomming traffic appears to be moving at a SNAILS pace when you blow by them.  If I were in one of those cars, maybe I could get to work in 10 hours at that rate...This game might be worth it, if it was advertised as a cute little 4.99 arcade racer.   There are lot's of costumization options and the visuals aren't terrible for a Unity game.  However, overall I would give this a 1.5/10			"

												By far the single worst racing game I have ever played.The physics are so bad it's laughable.The controls are inconsistent and offten the car will just randomly dive to one side or the other, often right as you are approaching traffic.AI cars go right through the traffic like it's not even there so if you are drafting you suddenly find yourself face to face with an oncoming car that the AI driver just passed through.Prizes are not in line with costs of upgrades and opponent cars are always faster off the line no matter how much you upgrade.I found myself having to resort to using the pit manoeuvre to spin opponents out to get past them.Unless the devs put some serious work into fixing the issues it's not worth playing.Seriously do not waste your money on this POS game it is just not worth the pricetag they have on it, I would disapointed even paying 1.99 for this game.

												I LOVE the old school cars, however....I cannot recommend this game for one reason.... it's not worth $20 when you are competing on a market with games that are still early access that are $15-20 dollars and quite obviously people put in a lot more work into those games than this one.If it were about $10 or less, this game is quite worthwhile! I really enjoyed the era influenced art and music, although wish there were a few more tracks available. After about an hour I don't really want to hear that song for the third time again....The system is pretty basic compared to other games like this. You race, you get achievments, you get money to upgrade the mechanics or customize the look of your car. You get special points for completing things with ""style"" while driving. Through achievments you unlock higher levels and you can repeat previous levels to gain more money, and so on. I found it challening and fun! I didn't encounter any major bugs or errors, so overall it is pretty good. I don't find myself playing it very often, but I do pick it up once in a while.If I notice the price tag change to a more approprite number, I will change my review to recommended. :)P.S. The AI cars passing through other cars on the road while you crash into them also is kinda annoying.			"

Anyone can make games, this is art with wheelsMotorama is a flawlessly crafted gem. You look at the store page and it hypnotizes you. Now fooled into believing you purchased a rather robust, somewhat complex game, you play it.That's when the sheer brilliance hits you right in the face  like flirting with Shaun Connery and you come to notice, Every, Single, Design, Choice! and i do mean every single one, perfectly and intentionally created a game void of any fun. It literally beats watching paint dry and yet you think such a genius concept was accomplished unintentionally.I for once, thank 251 Games for reminding us Games are a form of art and for having the balls to do so with the worst Video game ever since Desert Bus.On a side note, i would like to point this game out to the most infamous devs on steam. You see...to actually give birth to the worst game of all time, you must first create something you can call a game and only then suck all the enjoyment out of it.Could not recommend you enough to,  not, in any circumstance, buy this game.

												This game isn't even worthy of a lengthy review, but a simple ""don't waste your money"". A near $30 game (yes, 30 bucks, because I'm Australian and our dollar is horrible) that's not even worth the $2 or something that I paid for it on a third party site.			"

												The time I've played this game as of this review is only a half hour.  Still, in that half hour I've seen more than enough to make a short review of this game.  This doesn't feel like a complete game but for a couple dollars it's worth it.It's noticeably lacking anisotropic filtering; a graphical setting that vastly increases the look of long distance textures without causing a large hit on performance.  This is a huge issue for a racing game in particular because of how far ahead you'll be paying attention.  If this is in the game somewhere, it's not included in the PC High settings that I selected in the launcher and I haven't seen an option in the actual game.  This is odd because the screenshots clearly show areas in the game with a high amount of anisotropic filtering enabled.  If it's in the settings files then it should be on by default for medium and high settings.Anisotropic filtering example:http://i.imgur.com/POg9HHj.pngThe next big issue in the game is traffic.  I've seen traffic drive off the side of a road and that's just with one race that has traffic enabled.  I also saw the AI go straight through the traffic while you can't do so.  It's good that you can't but the AI shouldn't be able to do so either.  It would probably be better if they just got rid of traffic altogether if they're going to take the cheap route and make it where the AI doesn't collide with traffic instead of programming them to go around traffic.  It doesn't seem like they cared too much about realism which is a bit of a shame.Now that I'm done talking about the negatives, I'd like to talk about the positives.  This is more of an arcade racing game that allows you to customize your cars.  You can buy performance parts or even change what they look like.  This is a good feature considering most games that do this only allow you to change the paint jobs which is a bit disappointing considering games like NFS: Underground 2 are already over a decade old and nobody has created better car customization in a racing game.This game can be kind of fun if you get it for cheap.  Not bad if you buy it in a bundle for $3 like I did.			"

The music is awful.  You can literally hear where the music loops.  And there are only a few tracks.  Worse is the BGM is tied to the level you're racing on, so the first few courses are tiring.  Best bet is to just turn the Music slider to off and leave the effects on.It's also buggy.  There are two different parts in my LP where I fall through the world and another where my car is just going through psychedelic colors for no apparent reason.It also feels like a milquetoast Unity game.  It's a weird sentiment, but if you've played a Unity platformer, there is a resemblance to other games you've played.  I am having difficulty putting my finger on it, but it doesn't feel like they tuned the game all that much outside of the imported physics engine.The AI is laughably easy.  All you need to do is shove them and then it's practically game over for them.  They'll be zigging and zagging all through the course.Having said all that, I was still having fun.  The progression system is a bit too slow, but there is one level where you can grind money fairly easily.  Also, it's not often you get to play a racing game set in the late 50's/early 60's hot rodding era.  I only went two ranks deep, but I haven't had a chance to race for pink slips yet.  I'm not sure if it's in the game, but that would be nice. (maybe it's because I only have one car?)If it gets cheap enough on Steam sale or gets bundled, definitely give it a try.			"

												I wanted to like this game but I can't recommend it in its current state.When you reach level 10 ( happens quickly ), every subsequent race will give you another identical ""limited edition"" vehicle you can't get rid of in addition to an identical set of rims and a logo if I recall correctly.AI Vehicles don't collide 99.99% of the time with non-racer vehicles; I witnessed one colliding with a non-racer vehicle ONCE, and it may have been a road glitch because the hoods of both vehicles were almost touching ( a foot or so to spare ) of the ai racer inside the non-racer vehicle.You can collide with the road for no reason and it can send you flying off the map.You can ramp off non-racer vehicles which can launch you off the map.You can drive under non-racer vehicles, then get stuck in place.Your wheel or wheels can go under the map leaving your vehicle stuck or scraping the ground for a while.The options menu doesn't remember your audio settings ( It ""stores"" the data, but every time you exit a race you're stuck with BLARING MUSIC until you re-open the options menu and select the audio slider or start a new race ) - I muted music and set SFX low.If you have a game-pad or joystick connected, random button presses will prevent you from selecting anything in the menu other than the first race until you start the race and exit or complete it.If using a joystick or wheel with a slider ( or pedal ) to control speed ( as the launcher > input menu forces you to use on some input selections ) you won't be able to use it. Pedals, sliders or joystick axis will not register therefore preventing you from playing; you need to unplug the joystick / gamepad and relaunch the game prior to being able to play with keyboard only.When you first launch the game, you can't use any of the menu options; you have to first enter and exit or complete a race before other menu options ( such as garage, etc.. ) may be accessed.Key bindings don't work for keyboards just like they don't work for gamepads or joysticks... Trying to use rearview camera it flickers quickly between the rear then back to front as though it excepts as axis. This could be because there isn't a way to unbind a key from the options menu and I changed the keys and the only way to clear it up was to either set both primary and secondary as the same key, or set up a single key somewhere it'd hopefully never be used as all...I got this game in a bundle for less than pennies on the dollar. This game reminded me of motorcity online years back which was pay-per-month and decided to purchase the bundle to try this out. I'd rather play one of the earlier need for speed games ( with interiors / Porsche ) because the physics respond much better in it, the graphics are just as good and you get to drive classic vehicles.If you want an enjoyable racing game with upgradable vehicles, check out the burnout series which doesn't cause you to stop instantly from 150 mph speed because of a road glitch, or if you slide across the guard-rail.

												Does this game live up to its price? No. There are a lot of things wrong with it. One of the major things I found to be annoying, was that there was no ingame indepth options menu. The music repeats itself, which is annoying. You get no hint whatsoever to which keys you should press, as there is no ingame options menu for PC controls. And much more. Do I like the game on the other hand? Yes I do. The concept is good. I like the ingame graphics. It's unique. Now, I bought this game in a bundle, and was surprised to see the pricetag on its steam store page. 17,99 euros is not worth it. The game needs a lot of updates in every department, especially in the options department. This is a PC game for crying out loud. Also, on the first stage, there was a barrier I could clip through.But as said, I do like the game. It's a one of a kind, and it is therefore I give this a positive review.  But do not buy this for its current price. It is not worth it for that amount of money.			"

												the first association i get from motorama is to the old street rods. same age, same look-and-feel, same cars...visuals and music are nothing to write home about but are appropriate enough. driving model is arcade and cars are mostly unmanageable when spinning out but that actually fits with the 50s racing theme.now for the bad parts:- ai cars have no clipping, just going through the traffic cars that collide readily enough with you- driving ai sucks, it does spin out randomly that helps overtaking them but it does not feel like something that should be happening. plus, ai cars have unfair advantages like hyperspeed, blowing past your upgraded car with ease- upgrading cards feels random. just as one example - a car with 55% speed is actually slower than one with 40% speed- progress is badly managed. major amounts of moneygrinding is required to progress and this is always a bad signracing through the game takes about 2-3 hours, unfortunately grinding the cash for upgrades takes a lot longer and is simply boring.i really want to recommend it but in its current form, i cannot.if this would be a beta, i would be stoked to see how it turns out. but as a final game - skip.

												When I bought this game, I did it understanding that Im not going to find a Need for Speed, whatsoever, but thinking that Im going to find a fun racing game, based on the 50s, with those massive and potent cars, and their rock music. I have to say that I´m quite enjoying the experience. For a Unity game, the car models are very well resolved, and if the sensation of speed is not crazy, Im sure that those real heavy ♥♥♥ cars, didn´t run faster than this...I´ve had hard times in the beginning figuring out the keys to play, as I dont have a pad, but once you do, you can play ok.

But all in all I found the game enjoyable, I like the mechanics of the achievements to unlock new levels and the car customization. The physics during the race are not brilliant but decent and I found myself struggling to finish some of the races.If the developers keep fixing bugs and implementing some of the required improvements claimed by some critics I think this could be a funny and entertaining game.

												Motorama is probably a game that should have been launched in Early Access. The devs, who are pretty active in their forums, do promise future updates for the game. It's obviously not a full release upon playing it right now though and many bugs are encountered. Now at first I was a little upset, but when I went to the forums I noticed that there are planned updates and the Devs  are pretty much responding to almost every post. The only problem I see is that people are sucked into buying it from what the screenshots look like and what the description says, which isn't false at all, just lacking information. It should have been stated on the store page that this game was still in development so atleast if people got upset, it would be their own fault for not reading the description. Instead it was not stated which has lead to a high number of negative reviews. My thoughts: I think the game has great potential. The cars are not liscened so they are recreated versions of real cars but they resemble real cars very closely both visually and with their names. There is lots of upgrading to do on each car both in the performance area and in the visual area, leaving a lot of customizing and time spent in the garage. There are 3 teirs of upgrading performace parts which for some reason are all available to purchase form the start which automatically makes me upgrade to teir 3 and skip 1 and 2. They should probably implement a ranking system or a Class A through C liscense system to stop this from happening and actually allow for more playability. The game runs on the Unity engine so the graphics are what you can expect from Unity. Shadows don't fall in the correct place at times and the textures seem a little solid in some places. As far as gameplay goes, it could use some work, Cars don't take damage and NPC's can no clip right through the traffic. Thats is just a couple of things I experienced of the many listed bugs on the forums. I also chose to turn the music off due to only a couple songs being played, becoming quite repetitive and headache worthy. There are 5 areas you race throughout the game, each resembling a popular 50s themed race, like the ditch scene in the popular movie Grease. Overall once you get the driving down, it's actually fun to play and the updates mentioned by the developer seem to make for a promising full game, when it gets there. I have yet to experience some of the weird bugs Ive heard about like falling out of maps or the game just crashing to the desktop so I'm under the impression that those are computer related issues with the game, not the actual game itself. Now I do recommend checking this game out eventually, but It might be best to wait a little to make sure updates are being pushed out. Again, I think this should have been released as an Early Access game so please take that into consideration before buying.			"

												 I recently purchased this game on sale. Prior to purchase I read all the negative reviews, so I was wary, but I decided to give it a chance, for the sake of the Fifties cars.. First off I must say that this game is loaded with glitches and bugs. Every error you've read in any review is true. I've had the game freeze, my car fall through the map etc. Never the less I managed to get gold in all events and unlock all achievments. Since the game doesn't come with an instruction manual, this causes some issue for some who play it. I personally recommend you own an xbox controller if you want to play this game. To stop the annoying music you must turn it down in options then press 'A' to save it. To drive the cars in the game .. and win, you must be very carefull when driving through water, or dirt. This will cause your car to lose traction. Your car comes with nitrous, which you activate via the ""a"" button. To build up your nitrous meter, you must get driver achievments during the game like drifting, which you activate by pressing the'B' button for emergency brake. The most difficult track is Keegsquaw peaks 'Spring water laguna' . It's extremely difficult to get through this track, which you need to do to progress. It's likely the game makers intended this to be a dirt track, as any carbehaves terribly on the surface. This map is also likely resourcce intensive for the game engine, and the car wanders left and right continuously . To get past this level, you need to buy the right car, with the right handling upgrades.. and drive the aoppropriate speed in the right areas. I also  lowered the game graphics quality to the lowest level, to stop the frame twitch.My main dissapointment was from the advertisement clips on youtube for the game say ""25 sixties cars"" .. well, there are only 15 game cars you can drive in this game. I was looking forward to driving the 1956 chevy which, is pictured on the website, and in the game. But the car was cut from the game ansd replaced with a 1949, merc, and given some generic name. This car was likely cut from the game by the developers, in addition to wheel selection, likely because these game elements were causing game bugs.The Ai is so terrible that the game becomes unintentionnally funny, as the cars continuously drive into each other. If you drive head on into traffic, quite often the traffic car will jump over your car, like the Dukes of Hazzard. yee haaa!But i paid 5 bux for it and I got to the  end in a day or so... it was ok for 5 bux.

												Motorama has a good idea for a racing game, but it's rather unpolished. This game feels to me like an early access candidate. The game uses the Unity engine, so at the start you're presented with a launcher, that let's you pick a couple of presets and redefine your controls. But there is a twist - the game actually let's you rebind your gamepad controls to your keyboard, so instead of using a standard and well established control names (brake, accelerate, handbrake), your stuck rebinding J1righttrigger and J1horizontal (+) ... and I decided not to mess with it. So at the start of my first race, the racing game turned into a puzzle one, as I was trying to decipher my keyboard controls - found out a,z,x,c,v,space not sure if these are all of them. Those were of course the easiest to figure out, good luck finding out the more important ones - replay the race, go to garage after race, go to menu - I gave up and ended up using my gamepad keys just for that purpose .Once you figure out your keys, you'll establish, that the keyboard controls is not so bad, but the car handling on the other hand ... Before my first race I was presented with a choice of a car to buy and as a racing game veteran I picked the faster one with lesser handling, comfortable in my skill. Boy oh boy was I doomed - the car was almost uncontrollable in over 100km/h and every slightly more sudden turn sent me out spinning to the last spot in the race. In retrospect, this might have been by design as the first track is not exactly on a street and once you upgrade your handling, the cars feel waaay more responsive and actually enjoyable to ride. I still just can't shake off the impression, that the cars are sliding over the track, rather than driving on it, but that may just be me.The graphics are nothing special, but reasonable, and sadly, littered with bugs - seizure inducing texture blinking, car textures disappearing or blinking and the occasional stuttering are a common sight. Activating the ""nitro"" results in full screen (Gaussian?!) blur, with very little acceleration gain, but huge visibility problem (for me at least), so I avoid using it.The music is era fitting ( I guess?), but gets repetitive fast and the volume control is utterly bugged and resets to MAX upon race completion, which is frankly infuriating, so I ended up muting the game all together.The AI has trouble driving in a straight line and ends up spinning quite often, if in front of you, while when behind, puts the ""turbo"" on and speeds past you with unreachable speed - that only happens on one track for now though, on the rest of them it just feels like you're competing against old ladies behind the wheel (no disrespect!). I can overlook the fact, that the AI has no collision detection with the incoming random traffic (while you have trouble colliding with bigger-than-visible car models), and account that as a feature, to up the difficulty.On the bright side, the game offers quite a few cars and racing modes, there is some level of car customization and upgrades. Even though the upgrades are usually a flat 5% increase in a category, the change some of them provide is quite distinguishable. I highly recommend going for some handling upgrades at start. The linear progression of the upgrade's price and the flat % increase promote skipping of the mid-tier ones and going for the best asap. The money you make is not enough for that, so you really need to replay races to get dosh. The easiest way to do that are the knockout races.Overall, Motorama offers nothing special, but I suspect, it can become quite enjoyable, once the huge amount of bugs has been cleared. Sadly, as of this moment, I simply cannot justify the price tag and will not recommend you buying the game.TL:DR you can watch my salty video, as I rant about the game:

												I did right a review of this game a couple of months ago on the week of release. But you know I think I I might of been too harsh. So here is my new review of the game, if you can even call it that.If you asked me to sum up Motorama in a few short words it would be. S h i t heap of broken physics and gameplay.Well Motorama seemed like a very good game on paper but now that they have made it this game should have been thrown in the bin and set fire too as soon as it was thought up. The games physics are just outright broken and glitched. The other racers have a tendency to just give up and sit the rest of the race out and let you do endless laps because the race never ends. This game was so ♥♥♥♥ I decided to contacte the devs for a refund but no. They said that they couldn't do that as Steam had taken variosue taxes from it. But these guys couldn't just send me the £12 I spent on this game straight to my visa account. Ahhhhh. Customer satisfaction seems really to be key with these guys.It was like they don't even care about the game and that they have released it. Lead Game Developer: ""DONE! Job done guys we can all go get wasted even more now then whilst we were making the game. GG guys GG"" Thats what I can imagie was going through thier heads when they released this pile of horse poo.I refuse to buy anything from this developer for quite a while. I mean they are used to making 2D platformers but I guess this was just to big for them.Never again. NEVER AGAIN!			"

												Well... it needs work, that's for sure.  Good game, I'm only comfortable paying $5 for it...  Bugs all over the place, handling model is sketchy at best (Period correct, but frustrating as hell).  ""Invisible walls"" everywhere-  6 feet away from a visible rock and I get stopped by them.Overall, I like it, but it has its rough spots.  Hopefully new updates are on the way to fix these bugs and more I neglected to mention.  For right, now, I won't recommend it based on ""bang for the buck"", but if it's on sale for $5, you got nothing to lose...			"

												this game is a waste of money.  Go find a better racer.  The controls are awful, and are even marked wrongly in the instructions.  The steering doesn't work, the opponents are unbeatable thanks to some god-awful rubber banding, and the music can't be turned off, so it gets really annoying after a while.Spend your money elsewhere on some more polished racers.  I love the 50s asthetic, but it just doesn't carry this game beyond the horrible control and awful, abusive, AI.			"

												I really am still out on this one game.  While I really like the idea of the game (who of my age doesn't love Street Rod 1 and 2, in which this game is totally reminds me of, but very much a British take) I have a lot of reservations. The game is fully playable, and the graphics are fair to say the least (for the Unity engine), and I love the fact that it has full controller support (for I who have kids, that is quite invaluable, but as I said I have further reservations on other items in the game.  Mind you I myself have only played the first bit of the game (due to lack of instructions on how to get the clean pass achievement).  The physics of the car do not act like real cars and on top of that the controller will flip out on it’s for no reason what so ever (I am using 2 different X-box 360 controllers) and both experience a very odd pull to the left (it would be nice to have an option of adjust controller sensitivity) but alas there is not one.This game is new so things can change.....and so can this review.  Good work devs, I think you have a product for the motor heads if you keep working on the physics and the bugs!Cheers!			"

												If you're buying this expecting it to be Need for Speed with 50s era cars, you're going to be disappointed. But if you take it for what it is, an indie game attempting to evoke 50s movies, there's a decent amount of fun to be had. The visuals are nice, if outdated, and it runs well on my low-end PC (Athlon 64 X2 5400+, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD5450, Windows 7 64bit). And the handling of the cars is a nice balance between arcade and sim; you can't just go full throttle and drift around the curves, but it's not at a punishing realism level of Gran Turismo or Forza either.The ""steal your opponent's girlfriend"" bit is silly out of context, but does fit in with the 50s film concept.

												So is the game worth buying? NO. At the current state of things definitely not. Sure you can play it as it definitely has potential as an indie game, but the core problem is elsewhere. The numerous bugs in this game (some less severe than others) are quite problematic, but the main issue is that at the writing of this post the developer hasn't been online for a whopping 119 days. With that being said the bugs that are in the game will probably never get fixed, due to the absence of the developer or staff for that matter. So in the end I might give it a super bad note but I just can't stand it if there are obvious bugs in the game and they aren't rectified. So on that note I'll give it a 2/10.			"

												I'm not very picky when it comes to games. (I loved tmnt for NES, Still do XD), but this game makes that look like it should have 3 GOTY awards. First off, the graphics. They look amazing. Oh wait, this wasn't released in 2006? Oh ok. Then in that case, the graphics are horrible. The pictures you see have been edited, the game looks nowhere near that good. Also, the game engine. I played a mobile game the other day (no joke, look up nitro nation) that had the same engine as this. That is a 2.5D drag racing game. For mobile. The AI is horrid, and can drive through vehicles. You can't. As a member of the undead, I don't have high standards. But this is one of the worst games I've ever played. 2/10, save the money and burn it. That's still a better use of it than buying this.			"

												I bought this in a bundle for just about 50c.  I don't know that I would pay much more than that for it.  It still needs work.  The graphics are okay (dated for 2014 when it came out, think 2005 or so), the controls are okay, and the AI is not very forgiving.  There is also a big where at least half the time the AI just clip through traffic.  Also, knockouts sometimes just don't work.  You may have to reboot.  Then there is the flashing and ripping terrain and completely irrational AI 'NPC' car behavior, like stopping and backing across the middle of the road...You cannot configure the controller (and no wheel support), and even if you turn off music, it still plays when not racing, which is annoying.  The cars are recognizable, but the names were all changed.  It is kind of annoying at the beginning because your car is slower to accelerate, slower top end, and has less grip and handling than the other cars.  You have to replay races repeatedly to get enough money to get enough mods to win, and repeat this cycle until you beat the last boss.At 50c this is about a 4.5/10, maybe for 100% achievers (guilty) who want a somewhat quick racing game to complete.  For others, it may be worth 50c because you will get an hour or two out of it before you quit in frustration, but hard to say how the quality of your experience will be.At $19.99, I think it is a prolonged April Fool's joke, or the developers are hoping for some charity because it is insanely overpriced for an unpolished indie game.

												Motorama is a retro 50’s car racing game with various cars to buy and a wide variety of upgrades to purchase as you climb your way to the top of the underground racing circuit on 8 different race modes.The upgrade system allows you to improve all features of your car from improving the handling and breaks so you don’t spin out of control to changing the looks of your car to beat the competition in style. Speaking of style you can also level up based off of how stylish you are for doing things such as drifting. These will get you to level up but it’s also important to do well in the race and not just look cool. After the first race depending on how you place you will get money to upgrade your vehicle and boy will you need it.The first cars you will get are let’s face it terrible they handle awful and or are slow, you can buy some upgrades at the start with your start up fund but your car isn’t going to be a Ferrari.Your objective is to beat the 4 best racers but to do this you have to prove your good enough by completing various challenges, they each have challenges that you must complete such as winning $x in prize money. This means you will do each race several times to unlock the best of the best.The music of the game is either something you will love or something you will hate. The soundtrack consists of 1 song that you will hear constantly on loop and it may just drive you insane.The game is created in unity as many indie games are and allows you to change your graphics. The first track of the game reminds me of an area in grand theft auto San Andreas but looks a bit higher resolution.The game itself is fun and gives you the feel of a mariocart game were the AI is cheating as it seems easy. Enough to get into not last but the guy in first seems to have a rocket strapped to his car. Your car doesn’t have a health bar so ramming the enemy and trying to get the lead is fun and works for a while.Overall if you do not mind a slow grind to a better car then the game is a fun little racing game and if the music doesn’t drive you insane then you should have some fun with this one.There isn’t much in the way of story and the music will drive some people crazy, taking that into account the game is fun and if you enjoy racing games you should consider picking it up 8/10original posthttps://gamingmalarkeyreviews.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/motorama-review/video version

												Don't get this game! Just don't!Pros: It has a simple premiseThe cars have reasonable designsCons:You need an xbox controller. You can't map your keyboard keys.While it draws the mouse curser in the ui, you can't actually use it. It won't autohide either.The graphics look 10 years old despite being run on a Unity engine.You can turn down the (cheesy generic) music in the options, but it forgets it when you're done with a race.It uses trademarked car names (Mercury Eight Coupe 5, Chevrolet 210, Ford Anglia etc) but I've not seen any copyright notices on that, so the developer could end up getting sued. You can't delete/restart your career if you picked the second car option and found out it isn't viable.The AI is cheating. For instance it can run thru traffic.The garage menus are not intuitive. If you upgrade something you need to press A according to the message, but B works the same. The physics are a bit wonky. If you upgrade your car completely, you can only drift using the handbrake. And in general sometimes the car will just go left for no apparant reason. Note: I've only played the first couple races. Maybe there's gameplay hidden somewhere futher along, but I can't handle the suffering it takes to get there.ps. If you want to reset your career, go to %userprofile%\Saved Games\Motorama and delete Slot.000 (ironically numbered since you can only have one profile). Also if you want to use a money cheat, just change byte 0x41 to 7E "

What ever you do – do NOT buy this game at full price! Even in a sale this game is a waste of money so just dont buy it..			"

												Pretty nice idea this game.Unfortunately I didn't like it so well. Let me tell you why now...I start this game and the sound is awfully LOUD. I ♥♥♥♥ my pants. This start of the game didn't get a good ""first impression"" on me so to speak.I started the ""tutorial"" and bought a nice looking car :DI like games where the steering feels realictic. Unfortunately this game took like 5 minutes to totally steer to one side. (A lot less but you know what I mean,)So I ended up with closing and deleting the game in the middle of a race.I give this game 3/10, Summary:Nice game, Nice idea. Bad steering - Ruins the game.

												I'll explain briefly what I think about Motorama:Motorama is an honest and enjoyable game, completely fun and good looking. Damn! it's not NFS or so! but for sure is very playable and original racing game with awesome details for the pricing, in my opinion. Is very funny to see how competitors (race events) fight pushing each other out of the path or how they make mistakes.Garage seems deep to explore and complete, great to me, and most important is that car improvements have an important impact in races so the feeling of progression is good and well adjusted.Graphics are good and cars are very detailed. Pricing is ok for Motorama so I feel ok to this regard.Repeating what I've read from other users, game seems to be designed for Xbox or PS3 and the PC version just take the 'pad' control heritage, but at least to me that doesn't mean any important problem.Some minor bugs and glitches experienced but the overview is that Motorama has met my expectations.

												34%? Seriously? Let's review the most 6itchery in reviews:""Unity sucks"" - it doesn't. If this game was made with Unreal, it would look... almost same. What a surprise.""Graphics suck"" - it wasn't a AAA game and you knew it. they did decent job on some tracks. It's lower than average in terms of design, but 6itch, please.""Screens are fake"" - they are not. Yeah, they did some blur afterwards taht is not in the game, but cmon. You can even notice blurry textures there.""Physics are awful"" - well, asking for good physics in an arcade game from a random indie developer? You mad?""You keep spinning on the road"" - don't hold the damn turn button. And don't use handbrake as you're used to. It's not NFS after all.""You can't win"" - you can updgrade your damn car, you know?The fact is the game's playable. You can blame it for single music track used for every race, dumb AI that always follows the path on the same speed, broken flickering shadows, engine sounds that throttles when you reach 170, sensitive handbrake, the price finally. But c'mon, this is far better than Drift Streets Japan and that one is rated at 72%.			"

												Bought it just because I had lot of fun playing Street Rod and Streed Rod 2. Sadly it has full controller support but no keyboard support at all. Right now I'm on my way to the shop to get a controller.			"

												Awful controls, AI is way to fast, Graphics are extremely bad for the art style it is trying to go for (realism) and the music is awful. Worst 7 minutes of my life.			"
