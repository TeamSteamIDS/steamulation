												I bought this game for two reasons: it was ridiculously cheap, and I recognised the type of game it was and thought ""I haven't played one of those in a while"".Why the thumbs down? There are plenty of flash games on the internet that do this better, and of course for free. It's a very simple formula, and yet this game manages to mess it up.1.) First time running the game, I was treated to a splash screen advertising a different game by the same developer, complete with embedded youtube video. (I understand they were giving it away for an email address, but still guys, this is bad).2.) This was followed by a config window for resolution that can't be accessed from within the game.3.) Navigating the menus with the mouse was frustrating as the pointer displayed as higher on the screen than it really was. This meant having to guess where the volume bar was to lower it, and in some cases clicking the button above the one I wanted to click to get the desired effect.4.) The 'tutorial' level gives you controls, but doesn't really say what they do. I was plonked on a planet that I couldn't leave using thrust alone, instead having to toggle gravdrive first. I'm still not really sure what this actually did.5.) Those purple lines. Oh god those purple lines. These are horrific for three massive game-ruining reasons:a.) They constantly move back and forward in a swaying motion, standing a really good chance of giving you a horrible headache after about 5 minutes.b.) As the lines are all parallel and always in the same direction, it makes it really difficult to accurately judge the boundaries of the area they surround. Just from the screenshots you can see this. Look at the stage in the shape of a 'W'. Where do the edges parallel with the lines even start? It's not where they're purple, because the space between them also kills you, and the lines are constantly shifting....c.) This is the worst part in my opinion - the purple-lined 'death zone' only kills you if you go a certain way into it, which isn't marked in any way whatsoever. From part of the trailer I thought that maybe just the purple lines themselves would kill you and you could maneouver between them, but this isn't the case. There is an arbitrary distance which you're allowed to travel over the lines. Worse still the game actually depends on this and gives you levels early on that require you to skip those gaps, with no way of knowing how far is too far. It frustrates me that a game like this can make any money at all. Bugs can be forgiven, but this is just an absolute masterclass in terrible design. tl;dr - I spent more time writing this review than playing the game, and I also had more fun.			"

												Gun Rocket is not for players that get easily frustrated as it honestly can get a quite annoying at times. While the goal of the missions is very straight forward: Get your rocket to the target destination while staying in the designated area. You can ignite your engines which will give you a speed boost but will also make you drift if you turn around and ignite again. There are no speed up and brake controlls just igniting of engine. Getting used to manoeuvering will take some time but once you eventually get used to it (and once you find out that you can touch and even move a bit into the non-allowed areas before getting destroyed) Gun Rocket turns out to be actually a quite nice and at times damn challenging game.

												Gun Rocket is a very cool game, but VERY hard. If you wish to try your patience, you can hardly do better than this.The premise is to move a rocket through space to a target. The challenge being that space, having no gravity, has no means by which to slow or stop your ship, other than its own rockets. So, you fire your ship's rockets to move, to slow, and to change direction. Generally pretty much all at the same time. Thus the challenge is great.You do all these things in a contrived, shaped space. As such, not only must you do all the above pretty much concurrently, but you must stay within areas of unusual shapes and proportions. Only one level at the time is available for play (so far, at an early level), but 100 levels are available over the life of the game. You are attempting to succeed in reaching the target, but also with the best time and least fuel consumed. Thus, it's possibe to play with great caution, or ""hell bent for leather"", while consuming fuel rapidly. The feeling of success is substantial!There is also a multiplayer aspect, which I haven't explored. For this price ($1.99US), you can hardly go wrong. High recommendation.			"

-Quick Review-Gun Rocket is an indie 2D puzzle game which has over 70 unique puzzles to solve, Gun Rocket is extreemly minimalistic in design and provides several hours of entertainment.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There really isn't any type of story in this game.Game Play: Once upon there was a game called Astroids, and that's basically how this game controls. you face the direction you want to go, and press up forward button, you can also boost to go faster. There are two additional abilities to consider: A shoot button which fires projectiles (not to damage anything...This isn't an arcade shooter, but to create ""bumps"" or push other objects out of the way) additionally there's a move which will make you imune to gravity for a very short time.

Price Gun rocket is priced at $1.99, for a couple hours of entertainment, that's a fair asking price. Conclusion: In a way Gun Rocket is a nod to some of the very earliest classic games, I found it much easier to play then astroids, but in all honesty I find the game lacking in motivation to keep me playing.I recomend this game to anyone who wants to play a minimalistic game for a few hours and then move on to play something else.

												It reminds me of Thrust for the commodore 64.No brakes, but have to just change the direction of the ship and use the thrusters to control your trajectory.I'm unsure If I am using all available controls though, due to playing with an xbox controller.I know its a simple game, but clearer instructions or an in game controller config page would be nice.The most annoying thing is that, even when using a controller, I have to press the left mouse button everytime I want to start, or restart a level ( and thats a LOT). That is VERY annoying and completely brakes the flow of the game.The game itself could be great if it gave a smoother and clearer controller experience.It's cheap too.Thumbs up, but definately needs tweaking.

												In the end I can't recommend this game.So what are you getting here?  Well, just what it looks like.  A cheap physics puzzle game with exceptionally bad artwork.  And the physics based thruster puzzles are not bad.  You can waste a few hours going through the levels.  Also the music is very decent.So why am I not recommending it?  Didn't I know what I was signing up for?  Maybe I did.  Maybe the problem is with me, that when I saw this I was hoping for more rather than what it looked like at face value.  Ultimately I found the game not very fun.  The waving purple lines in the back really started to give me a headache.  The art was in this case so bad it became painful after a while.  Also, hidden in those terrible purple lines are hidden death zones that you just have to guess at.  Even the opening level does not really do much to teach you how to play and is a bit of messing with the controls to get past.This game is what it appears to be, and nothing more.  If you don't get motion sick from the purple lines you might have fun with it.  I did not.4/10			"

												This is a great puzzle game. With some trippy colors and techno beats, you guide a little rocket ( that shoots  astric symbols) if needed, through a maze to get to a crazy neon colored sun shaped portal thingy. A good game to try out during a break from shooters and hack/slashers. UNTIL, you get to that one level that is just frustrating and wont work for you. Then you take a break from the break of playing Gun Rocket.  Each level has a fuel and time gauge, that you can try making a personal best with for each level. With tricky mazes and obsticles and gravity, it'll keep you busy and frustrated for a bit. You also get to custamize your ship if you want from rocket to hat or axe or something, that really doesnt change anything. Fun , TRY IT!			"

												At a glance, the simple graphic design would lead many people to pass this game.But if you are a fan of physics based puzzle games, you won't go wrong with Gun Rocket.The main mechanic is gravity, or rather the lack of. Your goal is simply to get your ship from point A to point B using only your thrusters. Simple... except there is no assistance. There is no gyroscope or breaking thrusters. Once you gain momentum you keep that momentum.One thing I found odd is the only unlockable in the game was the final level. All other stages and levels, as well as 6 ship designs are available as soon as you start playing. This isn't really a bad thing, as it allowed me to skip more challenging stages and return to them later, as well as try out the different ships.So if you enjoy a nice 2D space puzzle game with gravity challenges, this is a nice fit for you. But be warned, it's not as casual as it appears, as the levels start to get tricky real fast.			"

												So my little brother bought me this game, and I can only assume his motive was to troll me incredibly hard.Basically you fly a spaceship, asteroid style, and try to dodge a moving purple headache with no easily identifiable hitbox.The level designs are incredibly repetitive most of the time. There are however, a few very fun and innovative levels, making use of a game mechanic called the ""gravity drive"" in which you can disable the gravity effects on your ship for a few seconds.Often times you need an extra arm to complete a level because when you press the button to start it, you die instantly unless your hands are already on your controls. I cut off someone else' arm and grafted it to my body, but you could probably just get a friend to help you.Some of the levels are also just balant lazy level design, made to meet the quota of 100 levels. Some levels also make you wait up to 8 seconds before you can even move.Good for a laugh I guess, don't reccomend wasting 25 cents on it though.			"

												Fun little game. Nothing to the game really. Very simple, just steer the ship to the portal at the end of each course, in the fastest times possible. For the price, it is worth every penny.   A good selection of ships and courses.5/10**Would have given it a higher score but the devs were a bit sneaky, acquiring my e-mail address for their mailing list on the promise of a 'free game code' that would be in my inbox in less than 48-hours.

This minimalistic space navigation game captures the finicky physics fun of classic moon lander style games.  The dual grading axis of fuel used and time taken encourages players to push their ship to the limit.Solid mechanics are not enough for this game from orbiting around the planet of mediocrity.  After just a few maze like levels much of it starts to feel the same and the wavy purple boundary lines are both distracting and inconsistent.			"

												For 20p I thought what was the worst that could happen? at this point I noticed it had trading cards. This lead me to belive that you can make profit from this game. After browing the prices of trading cards on the martket I noticed you can make profit of this game whilst playin this game. At this moment in time I not not gained any trading cards and am still hoping to gain them.The game overall is a little bit lacking and lacks level design compaired to modern games. This game seems to be very far behing on graphics and the physics engine is not up to scratch. This game how ever is ok but is not worth actually playing. Simply purchase this game and leave it open. After 5-10 minutes trading cards will come knocking and you would have mad a mad profit of 10-20 p.p.s you will have my you have my respect to purchase this game and leave it open for around 5-10 minutes to gain around about 10-20p. Also you have no life such as I. 5/10			"

												My little brother decided to buy me this game. Twenty-five cents was all it costed, and he bought it because he has no impulse control.I decided ""what the hell"" and decided to take a look at the game. My very first words were ""what do i do"" followed by ""PURPLE SPACE STRIPES WHAT THE HELL"". And thus began my descent into madness. It began simple; fly to the portal and avoid the majestic purple space stripes. It was a simpler time. But things began to pick up, as I realized three things.1. You can shoot purple space asterisks out of your face.2. You shoot white space asterisks out of your butt for propulsion.I failed to achieve thought number three, as I was dumbfounded by exactly what the hell my ship was supposed to be; an enigmatic green mountain with snow against the fluorescent stripes directly from the depths of hell. Eventually, the endlessly looping music gave me a new question; why do I have no hitbox? The purple space stripes are fickle mistresses; sometimes, you could fly deep into their embrace; other times, they'd simply tear my tiny little space mountain into tiny space mountain shreds.I then proceeded to punch my little brother in the face, and continued my adventure. All I could see now was planes of darkness, travelling across the purple space stripes. Travellers against the legions of hell. And as I flew, my little brother called the ""space portal"" a purple space hexagon, causing my final drop. I fell so far, that I pierced straight through hell, and found myself in the abyss.The abyss of purple space stripes. That's about the time when, for the safety of my sanity and the entire universe at large, pulled the plug on my computer and lobbed it out a window.perfect 5 / 7, watch out for space asterisks and you'll be okay			"

												Oh my god....this game sucks! Playing it on 1920x1080 you get a totally screwed up menu and game!You have to click the button above the button, that you want to click. Ingame you can fly through the ""radar"" areas, since they aren't really set correctly. The physics just suck and even for 91 Euro-Cent you get better games than that! It feels like a half-hearted flashgame, that got on steam by luck (or giveaway keys). I totally NOT recommend this game at all!			"

												This game is a redo of a classic game know as lunar lander. Now the graphics are pretty simple. Also you don't have to land on a pad at a safe angle and velocity. You just need to make it to point A to B while avoiding the danger zones on each stage. Also you still need to maintain your fuel levels.The nice thing about the game is that there is a couple of ships (I prefer to play as the top hat personally) with their own Properties and shape. This changes their thrusters and boosting power and how they can affectively change in the way the games space gravity work. The game also encourages you to either go and beat your time or beat a level with more fuel saved.It is a simple game but once you get the hang of your preferred ship's thrusters you can get the hang of it and zip zap and zoom through space.

												Got this on sale. I've played similar games and this one is pretty good but gets incredibly hard, very fast. I'm sure people who love challenging games will love this one. For me personally I think I got to a point where I just can't make any more progress.			"

												I dont even know what to say. Its more frustrating that 10 Second Ninja. The game still couldve been challenging while making the controls more intuitive. You use A and D to turn/rotate your ship. Great. You use W to thrust/move forward. But the whole challenge is to navigate turns without going off the map. So, when you need to slow down you would hit S right? Nope. S is some stupid gravity thing that doesnt appear to do anything. And then there is a ""Boost"". Which is the last thing you need in this game. There isnt any place that benefits from having the boost, especially since this is a game about timing and controlling your speed. Boost is useless. ""Gravity"" or Gravidar or whatever is totally pointless. So you have a game where you can fly one of six simple shapes through barely manueverable trails.This is free right? Did I pay for this? Look, Im not going to give it a thumbs-down because some people (very dumb people) like these types of game. And since they are professional idiots I'll leave them to judge. Matter of fact, IM giving it a thumbs up just so one of those people buys this impulsively and has to live with the bad decision. I hope the next person that buys this is the idiot that got me pinned into the wall in KF2 and robbing me of an achievement for beating a level on Suicidal. Ive been working on that forever, almost had it, and this dude who claims to be a ""gamer"" because he has a collection of Point and Click search and find games on his phone ruined it for me. Steam should have mods. And those folks, if they were watching, would have no choice but to cnacel his account and mail him into ISIS territory with a ""What Would Jesus Do"" t-shirt. Dont buy this unless youre that guy. If youre that guy, this game is awesome and you'll love it. I promise. Play this instead of KF2. Ignore the reviews on KF2 as well. Its not that good. Play this all the time. I bet you cant beat the game.			"

												Go to Store (Featured), Click on Games, Narrow by Feature (Steam Trading Cards), Relevance (Lowest Price).Then skip to Page 9 or 10, until you find the .50 - $1.00 games.Add them to your Wishlist, games that are a dollar can go on sale and you may be able to purchase for cheap!A game at .50 may give you that value back in trading cards.Search and Install ""Idle Master"" which will run your games even without the game being installed.I may or may not ever play this game, but some games I have installed and messed around with on a rainy day!@ .50-$1.00 it's hard not to recommend!

												A surprisingly fun skill game with nice gameplay that pulls you through the, sometimes, pretty challenging levels. The variety of the 100 levels is great enough, the length of the game is satisfying too! Of course depending on your skill & patience, you might finish the game 'sooner or later'.Sadly enough there are no achievements to grab and in-game there aren't really any time (or fuel) targets like: finish a level within 20 seconds = 1 star, 15 seconds = 2 stars. It's almost crucial, because while on mission (in space), one must have its goals or targets, no? This isn't good for the motivation.But overall a very nice game that will take care for some dopamine in your body ;)8/10			"
