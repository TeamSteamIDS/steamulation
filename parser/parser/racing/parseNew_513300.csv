								Very steep learning curve and encouraging to beat the highscores, also pretty funny to try out different seeds in the random levels section i can recommend ""Schacht"" for example ;) or/ 16783962			"

												A solid and really fun running game in the same vein as T.E.C 3001 and some others. Schacht has you make your way through procedurally generated sci-fi levels where the goal is to get to the end whilst avoiding obstacles. The manoeuvres available are similar to other running games such as jumping, air dashing, wall-running, swinging from grapple points, and using jump pads. At times there are force fields that require the player to use their EMP ability, which disables some force fields and enables others.The controls are very slick and everything works really smoothly, though there is a bit of a learning curve at the start. I've particularly found jumping between multiple wall-running platforms to be a bit fiddly if you're not used to it, but with time you get a hang of it.There are daily, weekly, and monthly challenges provided with highscore charts for a bit of a competitive element for those who really dig it, as well as an option to simply pick a randomly generated level.There is a very easy-to-use level editor available in the game too, which provides a large variety of platforming pieces. It takes literally a few minutes to construct a level, which you can then submit to the workshop and have other people play it. Having this kind of community support feature can greatly prolong the lifetime of the game. One minor problem though, I've found trying to access Workshop from in-game causes it to freeze and become unresponsive. Not sure if it's a problem with my computer or with the game in general. So the only way I found to get community-made levels was by exiting the game first.Generally a really fun game and highly recommended for anyone who likes running games full of challenges.			"

												This game is perfect for people who are looking for a challenge. It is not just finishing this one level,it is coming back to it over and over to get to find new tactics and shortcuts to finish a level quicker.This however is is not a game to play for several hours because it will get boring after some time since the gameplay elents even if quick and easy to learn, always stay the same.The levels might seem different every time because of a big variety of parcour pieces and the random generated courses, however after some time has passed it just feels like you have already seen this level or something simmilar.But on the other side it has to be considered that the amount of people whot have worked on this game (all of them are students from the ""Hochschule der Medien"" in Stuttgart, Germany),compared to the amount of people that it usually takes to make a game that is not even half that goodis just remarkable.They are putting all their effort into improving this game, adding new mechanics and cosmetics (yes that is a feature).Overall it can be said that this is the perfect game for in between times and people looking for a real challenge, the game is very fast and fun to play, however I would love to see the still very small comunity to be implemented into the game, maybe helping with new decissions or ideas.And finall, but this is just a minor critic: the priceThis game has left early acess just a few weeks ago and since then the price increased from 5€ to 8€ without really adding any content, this mild difference ended up in some people (including some friends) to not buy this game. I am always happy to support the developers of such projects but 8€ even caused me to think twice before I bought it for him. (I ended up gifting it because he wanted it so bad)This game gets a solid 7/10			"

								Truely addictive game! The whole movement feels so smooth and satisfying that you might find yourself playing the same level over and over again because you know you can do better. As a huge Mirror's Edge fan, I am very satisfied!The daily/weekly/monthly challenges are also great because seeing your name at the top of the highscore list is just so awesome!Visually the game is also super pleasing, performance is excellent! Also the character individualization is so funny! You can put the most random but hilarious things on for example your head, like a toilet plunger.With just costing 7,99€ you can't really do anything wrong buying the game! Give it a try!			"

												The game has alot of potential. So far the experience is good, but if there are no rapid updates to customise your character, reward system, maybe extra abilities while going through some levels for the people who love the challenge, then the game will die quickly. I can defnitely see this game turn to be really cool or really dull depending on the developers.Message to the developers:What is your next step for this game?			"
