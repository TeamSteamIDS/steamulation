								Climbey is absolutely fantastic and a must own for all VR owners. I was skeptical at first because for some reason I thought it was a shallow VR ""experience"". I could not have been more wrong, Climbey is one of the most engaging and wildly fun titles for VR. Tons of content to play through thanks to the Steam workshop and a great community. You will not regret picking this one up, it is a MUST HAVE VR app!			"

								Climbey is the most immersive game I have played on VIVE yet. The game has the largest amount user created content of any VIVE game out there and is infinitly replayable because new levels are created all the time. The muliplayer mode is a blast, and you can help each other through tough spots. The developer is active and making updates every few days. This is and is going to remain one of the best games for the platform.			"

								Incredible VR game experience! Tried the demo and within minutes, came to the conclusion that this was a MUST BUY, especially for only 10 dollars! The climbing is fun and challenging in a similar fashion to puzzle platformers such as Portal and the like. Workshop support and level design also make this pretty much infinitely replayable. Great use of motion/momentum controls for combining room-scale and large-scale movement. As an early access title it has nowhere to go but up and it is already fantastic!Would recommend to anyone looking for a game that gives back way more than just 30 minutes of entertainment!

								Wow, I just realize that I am terrible at writing reviews. I don't even know how to start.This game is great! (how was that?) It's so much fun climbing along the courses, flinging yourself to the next grip, plummeting to your death only to respawn and try again. Honestly, I was surprised just how well the movement works. You can walk into the direction you're looking by swinging your arms or alternatively ""throw"" yourself around the world by ""grabbing the air"" with both hands. Of course you can also climb along climbable walls by just grabbing them. Did I mention how much fun it is?And I haven't even tried multiplayer or the level editor yet...Highly recommended!			"

								One of the best gameplay-oriented VR experiences I've seen so far. Original gameplay, tight controls that make moving around and climbing feel incredibly natural and satisfying.The difficulty ramps up the faster you try to complete a level, which makes it perfect whether you're in the mood for a workout or just relaxing and enjoying the climb.The effective locomotion method and the comfort options help a lot against motion sickness.Very user friendly level editor which makes level making just as fun as playing, if you're the creative type!

								This may be my new favorite VR experience. After trying the demo I was hooked by the way it felt to basically do super-human VR parkour. I would HIGHLY recommend trying the demo, especially since it is free and you have nothing to lose. Even though it is limited it does a great job showcasing the potential with the game. However, I wasn't prepared for the feeling I would have going through the various levels in the full game.  The game's movement mechanics really lend themselves to VR and is what sets this game apart from anything else on the Vive. It's easy to get completely immersed once you start pumping your arms like a sprinter and start swinging around and flying through the air like some sort of crossfit Spiderman. The amount of freedom you have when completing the level is what I really love about the game and it utilizes room scale nicely. There are so many ways to tackle the various obstacles and challenges that are placed before you. Also since there is a more natural mapping to how your actions translate to movement in the game I didn't experience any type of motion sickness whatsoever and felt empowered beyond imagination. However, if you do get motion sickness there are options to help minimize this.There were two moments I experienced that really blew me away and solidified this game as one of my favorites. The first is when instead of trying to climb across a beam to cross a gap I decided to just jump as high and far as I could. After swinging my arms downward as hard as I could I basically did a Hulk jump and somehow landed directly on the goal after flying through the air for a few seconds. The second was when I had to reach a goal that was below me that I had to reach while flying through the air at high speed. Based on my trajectory it looked like I was going to barely miss it so I dove on the ground backwards at the last second and was able to barely grab the goal.The fact that this game will have online play AND a level editor which allows for community created content makes me fully anticipate that the replay value for this game will be off the charts. I can't wait to see what this game becomes because right now it is looking like it may be the start of something epic!			"

								Brilliant fun, they've really nailed the motion sickness. It's not as competitive as I thought when buying it but instead it turned into a very nice social experience like rec room which is even better. It also has workshop support for maps which means you'll never get tired of playing the same levels. Definitely worth the purchase.I don't recommend playing under a light as I broke mine.			"

								With all of these uber-realistic mountain climbing VR games on the market, Climbey takes the climbing genre (if there is such a thing) in an entirely new direction. Nothing about this game is realistic, instead cartoony and colorful. The mechanics of jumping and climbing feel good, and well geared for fast paced action. In addition to a multitude of built-in levels (all of which can be replayed to get a better time) Climbey comes with Steam Workshop funcionality. Any level can be played in a lobby of four people, and (unlike some other VR games at the moment) the servers seem active. To me, playing through the built-in levels on my own would have been worth the money. The Workshop levels and online capabilities put this game on another level. If you own a Vive, get Climbey.			"

								Honestly I bought this game because a lot of people recommended it to me but I was absolutely sure I wouldn't like it. Graphics looked simple, gameplay seemed pretty boring.Then I launched the tutorial, and the first jump I made, I got hooked. Do *not* trust videos, this is something you need to experience to truly understand how absolutely awesome, addictive and satisfying it is. The game is full of ideas that keep you on your toes (anti-gravity, trampolines, etc), the levels are very intelligently designed, and there's a lot to work with in the Workshop.If you remember the good old days of Kreedz Climbing back in the heydey of HL2 mods, this is the same feeling you'll get. Really recommend it.			"

								Brilliant little game. The workshop integration means it has a decent amount of playtime to it.It can be a little frustrating at first, getting some of the techniques down to leaping etc, but PERSIST. If you give up at the first hurdle (Hurr) you're missing out on a game that is great to chill on, and it does give you a bit of a work out.Warning: With the amount of moving around you do, make sure you have enough space. I'm frequently bashing my arms into the walls with the swinging motion, so try and keep center of your playspace!			"

								I can not recommend this game enough! It is so great! climbing with friends is a lot of fun!Even when alone, I keep coming back to it. There is always new use-made maps and they are getting better and better every day. Sometimes I just try to beat my previous times by finding new paths. Climbey is certainly one of the 10 best game of VR and it's very affordable! Get it!!I must warn you though: it is challenging! You will get hot and sweaty, you will have a hard time learning to jump well. Stick with it, the learning curve is not as steep as it seems on the first impression and it is very rewarding. It's OK (and kinda normal) to struggle for the first hour or so.The base game features only 15 maps which I went through in only 3-4 hours. However the steam workshop integration is GREAT and there are tons of custom-made maps. You can change the skybox (the paris eiffel tower 360 view is popular for a reason, it is so amazing to climb 1000feet above paris!)I've heard this game be called the Mario64 of VR and I agree! It does a great job of expanding on the ""classic"" VR styles (wave shooters and wave defenders and more wave shooters... yawn)Climbey is different and it is awesome. Buy it now. "

								Like many other reviewers, I was initially turned off by the bland graphics and simple premise. It's like Mario 64 in VR - except no plot, no colors, no enemies, and no music. But once you step in and start jumping around, it's wild fun. You're scrambling up ledges, out of breath and hands sweaty, arms sore, then trying to time a jump onto a moving platform, and when you make it you feel like the coolest person in the world. Once you master the built-in maps, there's a large and growing collection of player-made maps to test your skills on.And once you try out multiplayer, there's no going back. Doing Tarzan leaps around a giant playground with five other people (in the snow! With santa hats!), giving someone a thumbs-up, or reaching out to grab someone's hand because you can't reach the ledge, is super addictive. The voice chat is nicely done; a player's voice gets louder when you're close to them so there's a real sense of space and distance, and it's hilarious to hear people yell in despair as they miss a jump.Whenever it's time for a VR break, I glance over my library of games, all of which have ""more things to do"" and/or much prettier graphics than Climbey does. Then I boot up Climbey anyway and hop into a multiplayer room, because that's the experience that I look forward to the most.			"

								My favourite VR game. It doesn't utilise the teleportation method of travel as most VR games do and I absolutely love it for that. It's much more immersive needing to skillfully jump to get around, with the bonus of being able to run by swaying the controllers back and forth similar to running in place. Also has multiplayer and that's a huge plus for me; not many VR games currently support multiplayer and the few ones that do are also the highest rated -- surely not a coincidence, it's fun to interect with others in VR. Simple Pro/Con list for lovers of TL;DR-style: PROS:Multiplayer if you can manage to get players together for it. You can even grab onto other players' hands and they can help pull you up if you're struggling to progress. Lion King all over again. Level editor. Not a big fan of it since it's in VR mode and not on the desktop, but it exists and for those people willing to stand up in their room for possibly hours and meticulously craft a level, I appreciate your dedication. Immersive movement. I can run, jump, and even use gestures with other players. Not everybody's a fan of manual movement and they might prefer teleportation to avoid nauseau, but I personally love it. Challenging, but not because I feel limited in what I can do. (like in other VR games) Updated frequently. (As of December, 2016)You can play ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" with people online. Or just flip them off. I'm not judging anybody. Great workout: Save money on gym, flail arms around in your room while wearing expensive blindfold, profit.A good amount of content for the price. Also a good amount of custom levels, some of which are very nicely-designed maps.CONS:Not many players, but as this game does have niche appeal, it's understandable. It's also a game that can be very physically demanding to play with all of the motions involved, so what players are around will likely tire out quickly.It can be very buggy at times. It's not fair to dock anything for this as the game's freedom of controls allows for many variables and in general this isn't a rare issue with VR games as they're all early designs. There are a few technical issues, but nothing as severe as crashing or being unplayable. Again -- fully expected to have lots to iron out with a game like this. I hope to see this game a lot more polished in the future. Minimal graphics. For some probably too minimal. I personally like the clean look, wouldn't mind a few more choices for aesthetic.Final thoughts:Would love to see a desktop version of the level editor included and more graphical options since the game is fairly barebones in its appearance so far. Aside from those gripes, it's my favourite VR game and at a great price.  "

Early Access Review
								First and foremost - the actual core mechanics of this game are awesome.  The climbing feels great, the jumping feels AMAZING once you get the hang of it, and the comfort options mean that I don't feel any sickness whatsoever.  Before I jump into how I don't like a lot of this game, I want to emphasize that I still recommend it.  It's still a ton of fun, and the core mechanics are almost enough to carry the game, but there ARE issues.  These are issues that are pretty much entirely due to level design, which can be fixed by the developer.It's early access, so poor level design is something that might improve, but the levels that come with the game feel like they were thrown together.  It really does not feel like any care or time was put into most of the levels past the tutorials.  The major problems are:- Difficulty curve that is all over the place.  Some levels have ridiculously precise jumps from walls that you need to do.  Then after those, you have some levels that are ridiculously easy, with almost no challenge at all.  The game lets you specify 3 checkpoints of your own per level, but some levels are so long that that is not nearly enough, and some levels are so short that even using 1 seems like overkill.- Lots and lots of waiting.  Most levels have moving platforms of some sort, and when you screw up, you'll spend a solid 5-10 seconds waiting for a platform to come back.  I got to what I think was level 10 or 11, with several platforms that each seemed to take over 10 seconds to rotate back around, and I got bored and closed the game.  It's a major problem in almost every one of the levels.  - Lots of repetitive gameplay.  I enjoy jumping, then turning around, and jumping again... but I don't really enjoy doing the exact same jump 8 times in a row.  There are a lot of areas in the level that are very long, skinny platforms that just take a long time to walk across, and there's really no reason for them to be that long.  Same with several climbing-up-the-wall segments.  Moving through some of these levels feels like a chore.- Levels don't do a good job at eaching mechanics at all.  About 8 or 9 levels in, you're finally shown the sort of ""ice platform"" where you can get a lot of speed, but the game hasn't explained the mechanic at all, and never gave you the chance to really learn what to do with it.  That point in the level is preceded with... just a bunch of very easy to traverse moving platforms.  The dev could easily have taken the earlier parts of the level to gradually introduce the ice mechanic, but instead just makes you do it once for a HUGE jump that isn't intuitive at all.- Levels are just... not elegantly designed.  They feel thrown together.  Huge walls that are huge for no reason.  Some levels have multiple routes, some have a single route that's not obvious at all.  Lots of random jumping on tiny platforms.  You can excuse some of this, the game comes with a built-in level editor, but I really hope that the dev takes some time and goes through each level with some more care.  Early levels should be teaching one or two mechanics, gradually increasing their difficulty, and then testing your mastery of those mechanics.  It's honestly missing that pretty much entirely as of right now.			"

								Seriously fun, has some of the most polished VR interactions yet IMO. The motion is fluid, many levels are quite fun and technical, and the multiplayer is a fantastic casual experience that's more engaging than Rec Room.One thing to note is that it will likely take at least an hour or so for you to acclimate to the motion unless you have an iron stomach (I had to take a significant break after the first half hour due to some motion sickness). My second session was better. As with other games that initially made me sick due to motion I wasn't used to (Lucky's Tale specifically), small and frequent hydration breaks generally help until you get used to it.I'll definitely be playing more of this.

								Feels a bit like testing in Portal, except instead of a portal gun, you're using your hands to climb, hang on, jump, crawl, and walk. Surprisingly a lot of fun, well worth the price. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, which is supposed to make it even better.			"

								For some reason my lighthouses keep turning off, otherwise I'd not leave this game all evening. I loved the demo, and this feels just as good. It's got multiple comfort options like a floorgrid, ""cage"", FOV reduction, but if you can stomach having them all off it's a blast just flinging yourself around. Main walking control is grip-button arm-swinging motion, and ""jumping"" is using the triggers to heave yourself as though lifting onto a ledge. Both work perfectly, and allow you to chuck yourself all over the levels. Cracking!Would plummet to my death again.			"

So what I'm trying to say is, I MAKE time to have fun in Climbey, even though schedule is packed.It's just that good - I really feel like I'm THERE, climbing on big structures - motions from reallife climbing also work and the swinging from blocks to blocks FEELS like what a monkey would do.And with the community maps?

								A very clever climbing puzzle game, the movement is fantastic and I love the feeling of being able to effortlessly climb around like a monkey. its not super easy either and with workshop support it seems like it will have plenty of extra levels to climb around in after the stock maps are completed. I look forward to the release of the multiplayer!Its a great VR platformer with interesting motion mechanics definetly worth the price!Note: I dont get motion sickness from VR so beware if you are prone to get sick easily from non-teleporting locomotion methods maybe try the demo before purchasing the game.

								I think Climbey is a good game and it will only improve as more levels are added. Once you get used to the movement mechanics it gets easier. I recommend narrowing the FOV to limit movement nausia. In a way, if you has a time limit or if you could race against other people it would be a bit like Mirro's Edge.  Climbing walls, jumping over chasms etcFor $10 its worth adding to your collection.I reviewed it here:

								Edited as of 1/2/17  Ok. Lets start off by saying lots of potential with this game as long as the devs stick by it. Alot of ea devs seem to abandon games. id like to see some form of body besides hands. not sure if that will ever happen. but hey its a wish list lol... maybe a more easier way to select levels. the dev commented that there is more to do but i couldnt  find them. so maybe a more polished interface.the climber feels a bit light. like he is a feather. not sure if its possible to make it feel a bit more weighted but what they hey. some way to free form the camera to see what the player is seeing. the camera seems to move its self and shows odd angles of the player.i originally refunded this game but after a two day span away from it , i repurchased it. i stand by my faith for this game and what it will be.

I played with the recommended floor grid on for a while, then eventually turned it off to be completely immersed.

								Be warned, this game uses in-game motion and encourages you to finish quickly. This is a combination designed to get your stomach rolling. Not everyone will suffer, and I was fine at first, but once I got confident enough in the mechanics to start rocketing around the arenas I stopped feeling so good.Game also needs to spend more time on teaching you how to jump properly, and I think wall climbing needs to lock you in position so your slight arm movements (because there's no wall to actually hold and keep your steady) don't lead to the camera bobbing back and forth.

								Uh ok, so I am a pretty intelligent, pretty athletic\coordinated man, also a skiier I cannot for the life of me figure out the ski pole jumping mechanism. I grab with both hands, wind up, go two feet, then fall straight down. Next time I grab with both hands, wind up, go fifty feet up in the air and backwards. To me it seems extremely inconsistant,  to the point where it took me a good solid 25 minutes to beat one very simple level of jumping back and forth on a few platforms (I never beat it, I rage quit). Very cool concept but I need a cast on my broken hand which I slammed on my desk while angrily trying to jump to the next platform for the 15th time.			"

								Okay, so I've only played for 30 minutes and I like the idea (and it's amazing that this has multiplayer), but the jumping mechanic sucks.First of all, jumping makes me constantly smash my controllers into the wall (which is partially because my room setup is only 2x2 metres), but it also just doesn't work. The way jumping is designed right now is very wonky, not fun and all together - frustrating. I mean come on, about a quarter of my jumping attempts send me backwards!?Otherwise the game is pretty cool, and surprisingly not nausea inducing (especially considering that you are always moving in the game). Hopefully this will be addressed in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								I really wanted to like this game, it got alot of great reviews on reddit for its locomotion and everything, but 80% of this game is fighting the controls not the levels.  It tells you to hold the triggers and move in a walking motion, but this will only move u forward one step and then right back to where u started, u can let go of one trigger and ull do some terrible stutter step, so to move u basically do the jump motion and leap frog everywhere. Edit: I have since been told after the fact that the grips walk to prevent the leap frog motion.  This may be true, but easily overlooked since there are no diagrams during the tutorial.  Aside from that, the jumping is still aweful as I explain below, still dont recommend a game where u fight the controls more than u fight the levels.The game lost its fun on the third level of the tutorial, i was messing around and setting checkpoints but i jumped three times and got to the last platform, ran out of checkpoints and had to make the jump...i did this like 8 times, jumped three platforms perfectly, got to the last one, and no matter how i jumped, it would either sent me straight into the air, backwards...most of the time backwards.  I lost my sense of joy and forfieted and just went on to the next level.   But even then after about 2 or 3 great jumps, the controls would throw me in a random direction and i would fall and start over again.  I could only do this so much before refunding, when your core mechanic is glitchy at best, you cant charge 8 dollars for it.Second Edit: I have also learned from this review the extreme toxicity of the playerbase due to the unknown walking motion, however all of the angry ppl didnt address the jumping issues, which is literally 95% of the this garbo game.  This game fails on alot more fronts than i thought and really glad i didnt continue to play multiplayer with these kinds of people.  I guess instead of staying positive and getting more people into VR, we can show them how toxic we all are and let VR die since we already can barely get 50 people on a top game like onward...thank goodness for refunds.

The game is just generally awesome, you jump around and parkour in either built-in maps or maps made by other players (by the steam workshop) and if you really need to buff up your arms this would be the game. Just make sure you stay cautious of your play space, you WILL be throwing your arms every where (I hit my wall a few times xD) Well, If you have some money and notting to do this is one of the best games in my VR collection.

								I definefinitely recommend this game. It has great gameplay and was amazingly fun. I am not the person that gets motion sick. If you do get motion sick really easily, you may get sick. What really helps motion sickness is the fact that to move, you move your arms like you're jogging. There is also many comfort options in the main menu that may also help you with your motion sickness. The concept of this game is great. I think this game will be very popular. Oh, and I forgot to mention, there is a multiplayer option where you can play with people. I have not done it but I've seen gameplay of it. All in all, I would recommend buying this game. It is 100% worth the time and money. "

								This game is so much fun! As a spiderman fan this is awesome. i saw the climb for touch on youtube and i hoped it would come out for the vive too. still not sure if it will. But this game oh man.. maybe not graphicly but gameplaywise i think it probably beats it.Much props to the developper who made this. thank you!now for a bit of feedback: sometimes when moving fast it gets a bit jittery, i haven't found anything in the menu to fix that yet. i do have supersampling on 1.7 maybe if i reduce it, not sure. other games seem to be fine.the locomotion for running is awesome, i think they used armswinger for this. I hope in the future more games will use it. it's great, no motion sickness whilst running at all!for people who are prone to motion sickness , leave the floor grid on. It shows some cubes that represent your floor when you jump. I turned it off but got a bit woozy after a longer time of jumping around. Nut much, but you know, enough for me to turn it back on. No more problems!so far only played for 30min but i'll do alot more of climbing for sure :D			"

								I recommend Climbey to anyone that is looking for a VR title with replayability as there isn't a whole lot of it in the VR scene right now. Playing this game online with other people is one of my favourite parts about it, I have met and spoken with a few players and we worked together to finish some levels. One of the reasons I'll keep coming back to this game is because of the in-game level editor and upload to the workshop - It gives this game infinite replay value (aslong as people keep making maps) but so far I have had a blast playing this and recommend it to any players that love fun experiences. - Game looks really good even though it's basic- Many quality of life options- Tons of replayability- Awesome multiplayer- Great community- Cool dev! :D			"

								Only just started playing, but what a great game.As everyone says, the locomotion is fantastic and I didn't experience any sickness at all, despite this game being challenging for those with a fear of heights!Plenty of fun, and a learning curve that encourages ""just one more try..."".

								Honestly one of the best games on the Vive at the moment, and with a cracking price. The locomotion is I think the best one I've tried so far. Playing with other people feels great fun, all screaming maddingly as you all slide off the ice pillar for the 7th time before finally cracking the course.The level editor means there is gonna be tonnes of content in the futue.I'm secretly hoping the devs make a new game with these climbing mechanics but as a multiplayer shooter, I think that would be absolutely awesome.

Early Access Review
								Only played 77 mins last night, but it felt like forever, it was really fun with a good group of friends. So, it's an EA game, but the core concept/gameplay mechanic is solid. Network play is on point. The only ""con"" I would give it at his moment, is lack of Dev Created Levels. But there is a level editor for us to play with and there's always the Workshop ones. I would love to see further tweaks on networking done to perhap be able to include more than 4 people at the same time. Also, if you're a shortie like me, with shorter arms than those tall mofos...you'll need to either GO FASTER or learn to quickly jump up and take a few steps at a time rather than trying to compete with them at the same pace!Hella fun, try it!

Early Access Review
								I never knew VR Platforming was a thing and now that I've tried it I can't get enough of it. In Climbey you traverse massive levels by climbing, jumping, and walking through various obstacles in order to reach a destination. The most important thing with these kinds of games is accurate and satisfying movement and I feel that the developers have found that ""Super Meat Boy"" sweet spot in excellent traversal mechanics. The best thing about this game is that the movement for me (FYI I am very prone to motion sickness) did not cause me to get nauseas.Another great aspect of this game is the fact that you can climb with other people. The experience is a lot like AltSpace or Rec Room in that you can carry on conversations and interact physcially with people that are half-way across the world from you. Hell, I just played with a bunch of Frenchman (I live in the United States) and it was a lot of fun getting to talk and interact with people that come from a competely different continent from me.  TL;DR This is a great VR game that any Vive owner can throw a couple of hours into. If you are a person that can't stand playing normal platforming games then this probably isn't the game for you. But, for those of you who get addicted to games like Flappy Bird or Cat Mario this game has that ""one more try"" feel to it.			"

								A MUST HAVE. This game is a lot of fun for 3 main reasons.-WORKSHOP i have been waiting for a platformer style game that allows it's users to create insane maps and this game does just that it increases the replayability 10 fold.-TEAMWORK I find this game the most fun with friends because you are able to jump and leap and use your teammates bodies as objects to hold onto. So you can yoda them the whole time by staying on their back. Yoshi them where if they mess up you can use there body to jump off of. Or feel like a action hero trying to grap your friends hand whos hanging off a ledge.-3 YOU NEED IT very good for demoing to new people though may disorient them a little but just tell them to not move their physical body while their virtual one is and that will solve a lot of problems,Favorite part was in 1 of the first few missions there is a huge vertical wall that angles you eventually just hanging and gets my heart pumping so fast i loved it.

								I really like this game.The included levels won't last much more than a few hours, but they are fun and polished and let you warm up to the mechanics. There are many (so many, already) fantastic community levels, and you're given tools to make your own.The robot sounds like Justin Roiland channeling Claptrap, and that's okay with me.It's very freeing to play a platformer of which you're a direct part. It sort of requires that you be in adequate shape, but if you've been playing in VR much, you know this. I haven't become motion sick from this. However, that feeling when you get off the treadmill, and it feels like you're still moving? I've felt something similar to that after playing this for more than an hour and then walking around outside of VR. It isn't bad, but yeah, the demo would be a good thing to check if you're vulnerable.I've yet to touch the multiplayer, as it is really peaceful to put some music on and just play.			"

Playing this game online with other people is one of my favourite parts about it, I have met and spoken with a few players and we worked together to finish some levels. One of the reasons I'll keep coming back to this game is because of the in-game level editor and upload to the workshop - It gives this game infinite replay value (aslong as people keep making maps) but so far I have had a blast playing this and recommend it to any players that love fun experiences. - Game looks really good even though it's basic- Many quality of life options- Tons of replayability- Awesome multiplayer- Great community- Cool dev! :D			"

								I absolutely LOVE this game.  This is The Best Climbing Simulator out there.  There is a huge community supporting this title with add-on maps, some of which are particularly maddening.  There's no music, so you can stream your own music in the background - just be sure you can hear the little 'click' when you grab onto something!I have gotten vertigo in this game multiple times.  On one map, where you climb up a wall that starts bending backwards (and you have to turn around), I cannot look down without getting that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.  So Cool!I highly recommend you have a large open space with plenty of overhead room - I broke our ceiling light playing this game (we're installing LED Lights as replacements).			"

								The amount of damage done to the ceiling in my room is a testement to how utterly engrossing this game can be. Yes the graphics are insanely simplistic but this is one of those titles that works because of it, the experience is what its about. The general goal is to...well reach a goal. However you have to navigate challenging maps to do so, using as you might imagine climbing as your primary tool. You will hang, leap, slide, lunge and fall to victory through the included maps, which get you little by little use to the game. when your ready hit up the workshop and see what the internet has thrown at you.There is multiplayer, which is a blast, and its a ton of fun to race other players to the finish. The sense of excitement you can feel sometime soaring through the air is just unreal. Its hard to do this type of game justice with a written review, but luckily i dont really have to, as there is a FREE demo that lets you try out a practice map. I do not think there is anything i can say to convince you to spend your 10 bucks on this more than that demo.For newbie VR users, my advice: do not look down.			"

My advice to any new player is master the jumping technique early as you'll need it the most.  I read some tips on the forum and found having my arms outstretched and swinging them down whilst releasing at the highest apex a tried and tested success formula.  One minor gripe though is this has been the only game where I felt a little sick.			"

								All in all I recommend this game. What I would love to see is more polishing, because I notice alot of framedrops on my 970. Didnt have that in the demo I tested, but in the full game it's another story... All in all I love it, I think it's a must have for all htc vive owners, I think it's the perfect example of a non-shooter, non-rpg game that really shines on the vive and I'm going to play many and many hours on this game from now on.

Early Access Review
								In short this game made me request a refund. Not because the game itself is bad don't get me wrong it's one of my favourites but I strongly believe that there just isn't enough of the game to enjoy; not to mention the free demo you can get which show cases EVERYTHING about the game (I've spent more time in the demo then I have the game). The novelty just wears off and now that I'm more or less used to VR now it's become a worse experience for me. Many would argue that the steam workshop combatability creates limitless gameplay (to which I'd agree) it DOES not add new mechanics which the game in my opinion desperately needs. +The graphics are simplistic and cartoon-inspired which takes away the realism yet somehow adds to the fun.+Adrenaline is created through the vast heights and jumps you can make, but the novelty wears off +/- The robot is nice...? But I'd like to see him input more based on what you're doing and not what level you're on-The mechanics and novelty for me PERSONALLY just wear off too quickly to replay-The free demo is better then the game to a certain extent-The running locomotion is useless, found my self bunny hopping more then walking aroundOverall the game is still very nice and the potential here is large, this, in the future could be part of a massive open world VR genre and it brung out the inner parkour machine in me. But as of right now the ammount of default levels and game mechanics make my future with the game obselete.			"

								Okay, WOW. Love, Love, Love this game. I play on the HTC Vive and this is easily my most played title already, and why? Let me give you a list:1. I get motion-sick when moving around in VR when my body isnt actually moving. This game almost completely ELIMINATED that by trikcing my brain into thinking I was moving. I don't feel any symptoms of motion-sickness until after an hour of gameplay!2. Most intuitive movement control system I've experience.3. Physics of falling and propelling yourself are good, although, you can jump like a grasshopper. That can be a bit disorienting.4. Steam Workshop Integration. I cannot stress how important this is. There are only 15 levels built in, the rest are all user made! Super cool, in my opinion.5. Multiplayer is good. Helping friends is neat, and voice chat is integrated.6. Add your own skyboxes and change your player color. Is there anything these guys didn't think of?Cons? Not many.1. The in game level creator / editor isn't very easy to use. I'm a slow learner though, so perhaps thats just me.2. Sometimes I notice a bug whilst walking, my game doesn't always register that I've let go of the grip buttons and try to keep walking. I have to click them again to make them register. I don't think this is limited to my Vive Controllers.Aside from that, GREAT GAME! Keep up the great work!			"

								This game is so much fun! As a spiderman fan this is awesome. i saw the climb for touch on youtube and i hoped it would come out for the vive too. still not sure if it will. But this game oh man.. maybe not graphicly but gameplaywise i think it probably beats it.Much props to the developper who made this. thank you!now for a bit of feedback: sometimes when moving fast it gets a bit jittery, i haven't found anything in the menu to fix that yet. i do have supersampling on 1.7 maybe if i reduce it, not sure. other games seem to be fine.the locomotion for running is awesome, i think they used armswinger for this. I hope in the future more games will use it. it's great, no motion sickness whilst running at all!for people who are prone to motion sickness , leave the floor grid on. It shows some cubes that represent your floor when you jump. I turned it off but got a bit woozy after a longer time of jumping around. Nut much, but you know, enough for me to turn it back on. No more problems!so far only played for 30min but i'll do alot more of climbing for sure :D			"

								This game is a very simple concept. But it works incredibly well. You can get good at it quickly, but seems hard to master. This game to me proves that First Person Platforming can work almost flawlessly on a VR platform.You walk with arm swings, but you don't often need to walk, usually you're either climbing or jumping.There is already several good/well designed levels on the Workshop.Multiplayer improves the overall experience too, as others can assist during the climbs, and it helps solving the harder maps.I'm trying to think of some Con's to report. The only one I can think of is that the graphics are very plane, but it doesn't affect the gameplay.			"

								This game is amazing and hilarious to both play and watch! After you get a feel for the controls, you can jump, grab and climb like Spiderman! My friend legitimately screamed in panic the first time he fell off the skyscraper and plummeted into nothingness, but quickly got used to the feeling. Running with the grip buttons/hand motions works incredibly well and I totally wouldn't mind if it were implemented in some adventure RPG type games.I really hope the devs are looking into scenic level design, like actual rock faces with breathtaking views. This is the benchmark of gameplay for motion control climbing titles so it would be the best of both worlds if they could incorporate comparable visuals to The Climb and other seated experiences like that.There are also some absolutely outstanding user-created levels including a wonderful and challenging Super Mario inspired stage!10/10 will continue to jump off buildings for fun.

The excellent comfort settings definately help with that, and having a small play space is fine with the always on center of the room marker so I can always recenter myself if Chaparone gets all up in my face.I've never had a more positive multiplayer experience in gaming as the primary interaction you have with people is literally lending a helping hand!

								I was really quite surpsrised by Climbey. The graphics and art style leave a lot to be desired, but the rest of the game blew my expectations away.Climbey is a fun, simple game with potentially infinite content. This is the exact type of game I want to see on VR. Easy to pick up yet is challenging, has responsive controls, and tons of non-repetitive content. It doesn't require a lot of room to play either, despite how much movement is in the game. Most of your real life movement will be arm flailing. Your character is far from stagnant, however. The walking mechanic has restored my faith that future VR titles can do locomotion well. It works well and feels natural. Jumping works just fine as well, but it's tricky to be accurate with it, and is one of the hardest parts of the game. I'm not sure if I have just gotten more use to VR or if it's the natural movements you have to make with your body to walk and jump in this game, but I did not feel any m otion sickness.The user created levels expand the potential content of this game to the moon.  It's fun sitting in a lobby with other players and listent to the chit chat as every tries to make it through a course someone created.The game is a bit physically demanding. Not to a great degree, but enough to break you out in a sweat. Just know what you're getting into. This is not a relax and unwind kind of game.I think Climbey is a must-have for new VR owners. Don't pass it up because it looks lackluster like I did initially. Looks can be deceiving.			"

However you have to navigate challenging maps to do so, using as you might imagine climbing as your primary tool. You will hang, leap, slide, lunge and fall to victory through the included maps, which get you little by little use to the game. when your ready hit up the workshop and see what the internet has thrown at you.There is multiplayer, which is a blast, and its a ton of fun to race other players to the finish. The sense of excitement you can feel sometime soaring through the air is just unreal. Its hard to do this type of game justice with a written review, but luckily i dont really have to, as there is a FREE demo that lets you try out a practice map. I do not think there is anything i can say to convince you to spend your 10 bucks on this more than that demo.For newbie VR users, my advice: do not look down.			"

								This game is a very simple concept. But it works incredibly well. You can get good at it quickly, but seems hard to master. This game to me proves that First Person Platforming can work almost flawlessly on a VR platform.You walk with arm swings, but you don't often need to walk, usually you're either climbing or jumping.There is already several good/well designed levels on the Workshop.Multiplayer improves the overall experience too, as others can assist during the climbs, and it helps solving the harder maps.I'm trying to think of some Con's to report. The only one I can think of is that the graphics are very plane, but it doesn't affect the gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is FUN. The tutorial part was refreshingly well done (informative, humorous, let's you skip ahead or ignore it). The built in levels are fairly basic, and the real fun starts with the user built Workshop levels, which are possible due to an awesome built in level editor. Building a level within VR is incredibly intuitive, and it's a joy not to have to take the headset on and off for testing.And the MULTIPLAYER!! It's fun just to share in the challenge with other players and chat with them. Being able to help others out is highly satisfying as well. I'll wait at the end of a ""difficult"" jump with a hand extended low, and new players miss the jump but grab my hand without necessarily knowing it will work. Elated yelling ensues. Easily worth the price as is in early access, looking forward to more. 10/10			"

								I never review games but this one heavily deserves it. I absolutely love this game. It's early access but is still amazingly fun. Its replayability is high due to the level editor. Custom maps are very fun and so far when joining a multiplayer server, I've encounter the map maker and they are always open to advice or suggestions. So far the current online player base is so very friendly which is a nice change from other online games.As for the gameplay, it works very well. The mechanics of climbing and launching yourself are a joy to use. I know this is a review but I want to take a sentence to say thank you to the creator for making this game. I will be playing for months to come. This game alone makes the vive worth buying.			"

								Great, simple, challenging game!  I get motion sick in games where you push to walk (Onward-like), but for some reason, leaping around the maps like the Hulk is 100% OK.  The excellent comfort settings definately help with that, and having a small play space is fine with the always on center of the room marker so I can always recenter myself if Chaparone gets all up in my face.I've never had a more positive multiplayer experience in gaming as the primary interaction you have with people is literally lending a helping hand!  What??  No shooting each other???  It's true!!  Everyone that I've played with has been very patient and encouraging.			"

								Best VR game experience and value, for me, to date. I have just under 20 games. Many of the puzzle/adventure games are great but they are more expensive, low on content, and offer little to no replay-ability. This on the other hand is the game I keep coming back to. The single player is not incredibly long but that doesn't matter. That's basically the tutorial. The multiplayer is where it's at. You log into the game and join one of the servers or make your own. You can choose from a plethora of created maps or make your own inside the VR level editor, which is amazing in itself. Proximity chat makes it easy to talk to the other players and the community has been very chill.As others stated, you will get a little workout in here. You will have a sweaty hands and face in no time as you make your way across these maps, and it is totally worth it. Can not recommend this game enough - if you have one game to buy, this is it.

								Some of the most fun you can have in VR. Sandbox climbing/jumping/""surfing"" experience with nearly infinite replay value thanks to the built-in level editor and workshop support. Multiplayer is easy and intuitive and provides hours of fun tackling some of the more ridiculous workshop creations with friends or strangers. What it lacks in graphical fidelity it more than makes up for in gameplay. If you ever enjoyed tooling around in old CS surf/climb maps or just like a good and exhausting challenge, you should pick it up.			"

								I was on the fence about this one for a while because the grey and white cube aesthetic is, in my opinion, quite dull to look at. At £6.99 though I took the risk and it paid off; the game is a huge amount of fun to play, genuinely terrifying when you almost fall off a ledge sometimes, and the mechanics are a dream to use; really immersive locomotion technique. To be honest I had to try hard to remember why I was on the fence in the first place after spending a couple of hours with it.			"

								Overall a lot of fun for the price. I think the built-in level set could ramp up in difficulty a little more gradually and include some more fun/easy sections, such as climbing a bit on one surface, etc. The jump mechanic can be a bit frustrating to learn initially, but works pretty well once you get the hang of it. If you're tall/have short ceilings be careful about banging into the ceiling when you frantically try to grab something overhead in the game... (Kneeling sometimes works.)			"

								I was really quite surpsrised by Climbey. The graphics and art style leave a lot to be desired, but the rest of the game blew my expectations away.Climbey is a fun, simple game with potentially infinite content. This is the exact type of game I want to see on VR. Easy to pick up yet is challenging, has responsive controls, and tons of non-repetitive content. It doesn't require a lot of room to play either, despite how much movement is in the game. Most of your real life movement will be arm flailing. Your character is far from stagnant, however. The walking mechanic has restored my faith that future VR titles can do locomotion well. It works well and feels natural. Jumping works just fine as well, but it's tricky to be accurate with it, and is one of the hardest parts of the game. I'm not sure if I have just gotten more use to VR or if it's the natural movements you have to make with your body to walk and jump in this game, but I did not feel any m otion sickness.The user created levels expand the potential content of this game to the moon.  It's fun sitting in a lobby with other players and listent to the chit chat as every tries to make it through a course someone created.The game is a bit physically demanding. Not to a great degree, but enough to break you out in a sweat. Just know what you're getting into. This is not a relax and unwind kind of game.I think Climbey is a must-have for new VR owners.

								It's simple in design and mechanically is really good. The movement is really responsive, throwing yourself if a difficult skill to master but easy to learn and gives a lot of fun form the challenge. If you want to relax you can do an easy map without having to worry about difficult hard jumps or tiring yourself out. The sound in this game is probably the biggest problem since its near non existant but it isnt actually that noticable. Where this game shines is the multiplayer, talking to others and helping each other get across gaps makes this game well worth it. Single player is fine but a bit dull, multiplayer makes it more than worth buying, and is reliable and quick enough that you shouldnt have any problem with it.			"

								One of the most fun games I've played in VR, haven't even explored the community content yet. Great to demo and watch as people try to jump			"

								Overall a lot of fun for the price. I think the built-in level set could ramp up in difficulty a little more gradually and include some more fun/easy sections, such as climbing a bit on one surface, etc. The jump mechanic can be a bit frustrating to learn initially, but works pretty well once you get the hang of it. If you're tall/have short ceilings be careful about banging into the ceiling when you frantically try to grab something overhead in the game... (Kneeling sometimes works.)			"

								Really amazing, i havent played much yet but just comnig out of my first play through i can see a game i could play for hours. the game mechanics are very solid and fun.The graphics could definitely use an improvement but the gameplay is so fun it doesnt matter (also keeps it clear which surfaces u can climb).  Kudos to the developer for implementing the idea so well			"

								This game is the coolest platformer I have ever played. Probably would be a difficult sell for someone who has issues with motion sickness, but otherwise there isn't a good argument to NOT buy this game! It's amazing and the workshop support/ingame level editor combo is enough to justify this game for a $30 price tag (even though I got it for less than 10).			"

								This game is great and has simple easy to learn mechanics, the graphics suit the game, my only con is that if you have  a fear of heights or falling or whatever this game may trigger that for you, but dont let this throw you off.			"

								Climbey is great fun, I feel that the graphics could improve a lot, the game doesn't really feature any textures, it would be cool to be able to climb trees!! "

								Super fun, however can get quite boring if you do not expand on gameplay, i.e. playing online, customize levels, etc. Either way, a great game to play with friends, interesting to watch.			"

								While the main content does not take long to complete, there are a ton of maps in Steam Workshop. Beware the ice levels as they made me nauseous from moving so quickly.			"

								This feels like the VR spiritual successor to Super Mario 64. Same revolutionary take on classic platforming in a brand new medium. ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun, and the community mods and level editor adds a lot of replayability on top of the base game. I'm extremely prone to motion sickness normally, but with all the comfort options turned up I can play this for an hour or so at a time before I start to feel queasy.			"

								Purchased this yesterday, Great freaking game, i played the demo for 5 mins i was like hmmmm.........Purchased the game, oh my oh my, it surpassed my expectations by far. Amazing and the fact it's got a steam workshop built in. Can not complain especially for the price. Just finished level 15 i think it was the Skyscraper level and i'm not afraid of heights but my legs were a little shaky that high up.  "
