												[EDIT: Game has been released out of Early Access, this is my updated review, having played a few more hours, you can read the OLD REVIEW below this]So, has my opinion changed at all? Short answer, no it hasn't; and here's why:1. The Story is still the same length, so the game is still no longer than it was when I originally played it. Added acheivements is nice, but it's as though the devs added those just so you would play longer, and overlook the brevity of the game.2. They have added a new mode - some Grandpa mode that I can't think of the name of (and the devs haven't even added this in their blurb about the game contents) - where you have to race around the map to collect items within a certainn time, with each item adding a small amount of time. That was fun, for all of about 10 minutes. *The devs have the potential to expand on this with all sorts of modes, but for me, it's too late now.*3. I tried MULTIPLAYER for all of you guys out there, but here's the problem: it's dead. So, that's as far as I got - an empty lobby. I waited a good 10 mins waiting for players. Nothing.Final Conclusion: more acheivements and an extra-limited gamemode, couple with dead multiplayer, makes this otherwise ""had heaps of potential"" game a major disappointment. Definitely still don't recommend the game at the price it is, because, while it is quite polished, it's more of a thin veneer over a mostly empty shell. I won't rate it, but I will give you a personal value of the game: $3. This is based not on how much time and effort the devs put into the game, but the bottom line of how many hours one would probably spend on the game to get most of the acheivements: ~3hrs (and that's playing story mode about THREE times, talk about tedious).[End of updated review]TL/DR: ""A pretty fun game with lots of potential to be great if A LOT more content is added.""Curently what this game does is grab the elements of good kart games, adds a bit of it's own feel to it, and leaves you with a empty shell of a game. I say this because when I jumped into this game I expected a solid single-player game. What I got was less than 2 hours of gameplay - and it would have been much less than that had I not bothered so hard to upgrade my kart so early on, by repeating a few races. So let's break it down a bit, be a bit more constructive with our bashing of a game that has so much potential to be a good game.Pros: Graphically, it's nice to look at - looks a lot like F1 Racestars or Costume Quest - simple, clean and easy on the eyes. Sounds are also simple - didn't notice any annoying repetitiveness blaring away in my ears, it's all pretty good. Gameplay is solid. Heck, these three points should make for a great game!But, the Cons: Story mode is super short. I reckon it would take me, if I could be bothered, just over an hour each to use each of the 7 characters in story mode. But really, WHY would I bother? I didn't see any other single-player modes, apart from re-hashing the story - Open World Practice and Time Trials anyone? Wow, major OP karts once you have even half upgraded them. Made the 2nd half of the story mode too easy I didn't play this for multiplayer. Maybe one day I'll play split screen, but even then it's limited to 12 tracks (plus 1?)In conclusion, this game had me torn - it has so much potential (did I say that already?) But with the lack of SP content alone, I cannot recommend this game anywhere near the price it is.If the devs overhaul the SP into something a LOT bigger - even with a 1/5 of the content of Sonic/Mario/F1Racestars/GasGuzzlers, then maybe we have a game on our hands. As it is, it just doesn't have enough going for it, the devs have a solid base, but they need to get out of the basement, and make this an apartment block. Till then I cannot recommend. Let's hope the devs read some of these reviews and act positively :)			"

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.Coffin Dodgers is a kart racing type game that was released in July 2015 developed by Milky Tea Studios. The gameplay in Coffin Dodgers is something which I found to be something of a strange one. The actual kart racing looks to be really fun from the screenshots and video trailer, but when you get into the game, it is just infuriating. I have played my fair share of kart racing games, and you expect to be screwed over at times by the rest of the players, but it is beyond a joke in this game. It is almost like you are better off being in last place until the last five seconds of the race because if you are anywhere near first place, you WILL get gimped on, and when you do, you will go right back down to last place due to the amount of people that will be aiming straight up your backside with rockets.  People may think I am just ratting on the game because I am bad at it, you may think that, but I actually finished the game fairly quickly and on the harder difficulties. I then tried it on the lower settings and it is exactly the same; completely unfair advantage that the AI has over the player. As with all other kart games, there are power ups for you to collect as you race; these consist of rockets, Uzis, speed boosts, defibrillators (these act as an area effect stun), shields, and oil puddles. On top of these power ups, you are able to upgrade your kart in the garage by using the gold you earn from taking part in the races. Quick tip, don't upgrade anything unless you can afford the highest upgrade for your engine, everything else is just pointless on the single player. You can upgrade things such as how well your kart handles, how many power ups you may carry at any one time, or how much damage you do to the other riders.  For me the gameplay is really a level below all other kart games out there at the moment and I was a little disappointed with it. Graphically, Coffin Dogers is actually a really aesthetically pleasing game. It has the cartoon art style which looks like it’s come straight out of Simpsons or Family Guy and it actually fits in well with the theme,  the game does not take it self seriously at all. The graphics side of the game do actually redeem itself a bit here. Like I said above, this is a pretty difficult game to play on single player - the AI clearly has an unfair advantage over the player and it shows on a nearly minute basis as you get blown up time and time again. The game has varying levels of difficulty but even then, the easy settings still punish the player phenomenally. Coffin Dodgers actually has a fair amount of replay ability in it - the single player story/campaign mode took me about four hours to complete, there are about 5 stages, and each stage has 3 sub racers for you to take part in, you do however really need to be winning every race for you to get the biggest gold reward at the end of it all allowing you to upgrade your kart in order to keep up with the rest of the pack. Where I got the most enjoyment and playability was in the game's local multiplayer function. The game allows split screen up to four people and it does it really well. Being able to play with your friends on the couch for a few racers is really where this game shines - my friends and me have played this game for about five hours just on the multiplayer split screen. You don't mind getting shot in the back when you are playing with friends, since you can all have a joke about it, it is a bit different when it’s the AI though... All of the race locations are really well designed. Granted one or two are the same map but just done in a reverse direction, but there is a nice amount of shortcuts you can find in order to get a slight advantage over anyone else. Whilst there are a small amount of locations where you can pick up the power ups, it would make it a lot more hectic if there were a few more points to get them from. Some of the levels are quite large and you can be going quite a while before running into the next power up at points. I did have a few technical problems with Coffin Dodgers sadly; firstly, the game does not work with the Steam controller at all, but has no problems with the Xbox controller. I wouldn't recommend playing the game with a keyboard, it'll just get messy.  I also noticed a few bugs in the game too; for instance, there are a few power up strips located throughout some of the maps, it seems as if these do the exact opposite if you ride over them - you get a bit of a stuttering effect when using them, so it got to the point where I needed to avoid these all together. I also had this same problem when going up any sort of ramp, you'll be slowed down to the point where you are almost stationary, but your opponents do not get the problem.  The last problem I had was a bit of a strange one. Even though my frame rate counters were all showing me at 60+ FPS, the gameplay still seemed to look as if it was being run at 30 fps. I couldn't work out what was causing it, but it did eventually sort itself out with no interaction by me. The game can also be run at 4k resolutions which is a nice plus too. In conclusion, I am not going to recommend Coffin Dodgers, purely because the gameplay is really not good. There are better kart racing games out there. The only enjoyment I got out of the game was the local multiplayer, but I wouldn't recommend it just on that.  If you are into the kart racing genre, you may want to check it out, but even then, I think £8, 99 is a bit much. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Coffin Dodgers is one of the better Mario Kart, Crash Tag Team Racing/Nitro Kart style clones made for PC but with that said I still can not recommend this game. It is fun for a while then becomes really repetitive and annoying and is full of things that I'd have expected to be smoothed out better. With that said, I'll list my pros and cons below.Pros:♦ Great funny/quirky game concept (What's better than old people on mobility scooters whacking people with walking sticks?)♦ Great number of character skins (They are only skins as each character doesn't do anything unique from the other)♦ Awesome initial storyline (See cons for why I say initial)♦ Amazing artwork/graphics♦ Nice number of modes♦ Customizable controls that work♦ Good integration of controller and keyboard ♦ Maps look stunning ♦ Helpful TutorialCons:♦ Different Characters don't give a uniqueness to the game (This is annoying as there is no point playing one character over another as they are only skins and give no ingame unique difference such as special weapon or vehicle attribute etc)♦ Hardly any campaign content (Only 15 races which took me around 2-3hours to complete)♦ No Brakes (Pressing S instantly reverses which makes it really hard to slow down)♦ Can hit someone and instantly get knocked off (This is annoying as you just have to tap someone and they can knock you off)♦ Almost impossible to quickly/easily get unstuck on corners when stuck behind obsticles such as light posts and hay bails (Trying to get unstuck takes ages and hitting one can put you in eighth indefinitely no matter your current position)♦ The ending storyline was terrible (Just seems to show a short scene with Grim and then randomly saying ""The End"". Could have been written way better)♦ Voice Actors would have made it cooler♦ XP gained seems 100% Pointless♦ Can't replay a Campaign Level when you hit continue after finishing it (This is 100% stupid as an achievement is get gold on all levels and thus if you didn't get gold on your first play through, you have to keep re-trying until you do and if you accidentally hit continue, you can't go back. This is also annoying for replay value as you have to start a new campaign to replay levels).♦ Multiplayer is laggy or unbalanced compared to campaign/single player (I was playing with 2 people online and the rest AI and I couldn't seem to get out of 8th place in both races I did whereas in single player, I almost always placed in the top 3 which didn't add up as I should've been vsing the same AI as in single player)♦ Multiplayer Vehicle Upgrade Shop seemed Broken (I purchased all the upgrades in Campaign and went to Multiplayer and had to re-buy them. So I did this and yet it still wouldn't let me use them in Multiplayer. If upgrades don't work in Multiplayer, why have the option to buy them?)♦ Multiplayer got stuck on loading track level (I Alt+Tabbed whilst the level loaded and came back and it just kept showing the track preview and I could hit escape or do anything, I'm not sure if someone quit before it had loaded but it was 100% stuck spinning on track preview)♦ No voice chat for Multiplayer (This would make it more fun)♦ Alt+Tab seems to causes errors sometimes (Once the game crashed saying it couldn't load graphics and the second error I got was sound glitched until I died, which was annoying)♦ Achievements seem like an after thought (There are some nice achievements and some that are just silly try-hard to make you play the game just to get them, like win multiplayer every day of the week or on special days etc and the fact you can't replay campaign levels to gold them if you didn't without starting a new campaign to get the gold all level achievements is stupid)♦ No way to quit multiplayer when I joined matchmaking (Found players and after each race, it just threw me back into another race and seemingly the only way to quit multiplayer was to quit the race once the race had to started. This is bad as quitting during a race ruins your rating).♦ Can't restart a campaign race whilst in that race (This is 100% stupid as if you know you're not going to get 1st, 2nd or 3rd you can't restart and either have to quit back to main menu or finish the 4 laps to restart the race... which is way time consumer and annoying).Overall, Coffin Dodgers isn't a terrible game and is one of the best Mario Kart/Crash Tag Team Racing/Nitro Kart clones for PC I've seen in a long time. However, unfortunetly there are more cons than pro's meaning I can't recommend this game in it's current state. If there was more campaign content with a story that had so much potential not just randomly ending, you could actually break so you crashed less, could get out of stuck situations easier/quicker so you didn't definitely come last everytime you crash and didn't reverse every time you wanted to slow down and if multiplayer was less buggy/glitchy/laggy it would be a 100% game.

												Race For Your Life!In Coffin Dodgers, the Grim Reaper is in town and he’s not leaving until he has some souls. The town’s seniors decide that the best way to sort out who gets to live and who dies is by having a racing event where the losers are quietly swooped away by the Reaper, while the winners get to live…at least a little bit longer.After choosing to play as one of a handful of seniors, players partake in races that take place in the town and surrounding countryside. Powerups litter the track, giving players the ability to, among other things, shoot submachine guns, rockets, or create oil slicks that slow down the other racers. Melee attacks can also be used to disrupt other racers, though these attacks obviously require close proximity to opponents.Upgrades can be purchased using the rewards from the races, and players have the ability to customize their scooter to their heart’s content.As is the case with these types of racers, they’re much more fun playing with a group of friends, than playing solo. The single-player experience is good fun, but racing against A.I. only entertains me for so long. The game’s multiplayer experience is a virtual ghost town, though, so I was unable to find a multiplayer match to join in on. Fortunately, local multiplayer options ensure that if you live with friends or host frequent parties, you’ll all be able to jump right into Coffin Dodgers for some silly racing experiences.A ghost town of a multiplayer community isn’t uncommon for small-scale PC games. Luckily, Coffin Dodgers is a pretty fun game on its own, and I imagine is great fun to play with others through local multiplayer.			"

												I wanted to recommend this game a lot, but I can't. It just has so much charm. If you can get it in a bundle for for just a couple bucks, get it.You'll see all there is to do in about half an hour, and that isn't worth the price it is. On top of that, there's just so little gameplay in this. It's a racing game with no rear camera or handbrake. It's a melee battler with one, charge-up move. It's a mario-kart clone with no reverse fire and non-interesting items. There's no defense beyond a shield item. You can get beat to death on the finish line, lap 4, in first place, and finish last. It's more annoying than fun.			"

												The kart racing genre was a staple of the 32-bit era. Every possible franchise you could imagine had an entry — even Mega Man and Final Fantasy. Some of these wound up being highly-forgettable due to their mediocrity, while top-shelf entries like Mario Kart 64 and Crash Team Racing raised the bar for the genre. Due to the glut of games, however, a lot of these franchises just had one and done entries and the genre wound up being downgraded in terms of the quantity of games, but increased in quality. The Mario Kart games kept things going, as did a scattered assortment of other games like Crash Nitro Kart while Sonic and Sega’s All-Star Racing franchise remains the third-party gold standard now.With the console-centric entries in the genre keeping quality high, it’s led to an influx of kart racers on mobile platforms. Some have just been mobile variants on console games, like All-Star Racing Transformed, while others have gone with a 3D look like Shrek’s kart racer. The 3D games tend to look rather ugly and don’t do much to freshen things up. While Coffin Dodgers isn’t a pretty game and sadly continues that trend, it does freshen the genre up a bit with a unique premise.The Grim Reaper is coming for a slew of old people and it’s to whichever character you choose to play as to save the day for themselves.Wins and losses actually have a sense of importance in the championship campaign since whoever comes in last place winds up dying. This means that they can’t make any progress in the story, but Death will revive them to get in your way. In a neat bit, Death actually takes part in the races too. I guess he’s really hands-on and wants to make sure that he takes care of all these codgers himself to at least try and ensure his job is done properly. Luckily, Death can be thwarted here thanks to some power-ups and your default melee attack. The control layout works fine and everything is responsive — not razor-sharp like Mario Kart 8, but still reasonably good.Standard kart racing rules apply for the main game with the basic goal being to score in the top three to ensure progression throughout each set of championship-level races. The better you do in the standings and on the track, the easier time you’ll have making progress. Proper weapon use nets you a ton of XP, while wins get you cash. Cash allows you to upgrade your mobility scooter in a variety of ways. If you’re not happy with its handling, just focus on mobility upgrades. Unlike a lot of kart racers that let you re-race tracks to get the best score, you can’t quite do that here. You’re free to retry as much as you want to right after a race, but can’t go through an earlier course with new gear to try and gain more money. It’s a bit of a shame, but it does allow things to be a bit more fair and not make any single player a demigod in the lineup. The game’s use of rubber banding is annoying, and can easily send you from first into the back of the pack with either a single mistake that sends you into the scenery or a weapon blast. The core game offers up a lot of fun with a combination of a melee attack that can be charged up to do tons of damage in one shot and the usual array of power-ups. The combat evokes a bit of Road Rash by offering up some satisfying bonks to the head during a close race. Item pickups are fairly standard, with a boost, rockets, and homing rockets available. The biggest change is the inclusion of a sub-machine gun, which you certainly wouldn’t expect in a game like this.Visually, Coffin Dodgers looks like a fairly old mobile game. Nothing about the graphics is all that eye-pleasing, and to say that they’re on-par with the PS2 would be an insult to the beauty showcased during that generation. The character models are simplistic, as are the environments and animations. The most impressive part of the graphics probably lies in the explosions from the rockets — and even those aren’t all that amazing, they’re just the best-looking things in an otherwise bad-looking game. Animations are nearly non-existent and every part of the world looks like a paint-by-numbers design. It’s a sloppy-looking game in every way.The audio is worse than the visuals because at least there’s some variety there. Musically, you get very few tracks to listen to and they’re short and loop constantly. Sound effects are okay, but forgettable due to being bog-standard with what you’d expect. You get a basic thwack sound for melee, braking, acceleration, and power-up weapons like rockets. You can just imagine them and that’s what you’d hear — the game loses nothing being muted, and that’s never good. Sound design is such a crucial part of the puzzle and it’s just been forgotten here.Coffin Dodgers is a heavily flawed game that winds up being ever-so-slightly greater than the sum of its parts. On the surface, it shouldn’t be as fun as it is due how rough around the edges so many parts of it are. The core game is still fun to play even with its issues, though. The options are somewhat limited for PC kart racers and this one does have enough going for it gameplay-wise to be satisfying. Its graphics and sound fall far short of any standard set in the past 15 years, however, and it looks far sloppier than any kart racer we’ve seen on the market in many years. As a result, Coffin Dodgers comes with a very mild recommendation if you’ve played through every other kart racer out there and just want something to dink around with for a bit. Overall 5/10.			"

												I've eyed this game for a while as I've seen it on sale once or twice, but finally decided to give it a go when I felt the price was right. Felt like it was worth the purchase, but even so, it bugs me that there is no one online to play with after beating a mid-ranged story mode.Coffin Dodgers feels like Mario Kart met up with Road Redemption while introducing it all with an interesting story line to say the least. The game is good, but it feels like it could have been a lot better with a few tweaks. Death one day decides to show up to the little town where there are numerous old folks. One by one, they will be taken away if they do not succeed in placing first in the race. The game itself is enjoyable. In fact, the game feels quite right as no shortcuts or glitches seem to prop up. When I first started playing, the driving scheme didn't sit too well. It felt like Mario Kart turning initially but ended up as Sonic All Star Racing drift feel. I was slightly confused in knowing how much was too much going into a turn when it came to smashing the gas. After a bit of time, I familiarized myself with their control scheme and actually find it enjoyable. You can get through a track without using the brake by letting off on the gas to make sharp turns. There are times you will need to quickly let go, tap the brake, and hit the gas quickly to keep your head out in first. The carts you drive in themselves were also up for question before I bought this game. I figured how fast could one really go and make a scooter fun to drive. They, however, made it so. Besides the driving feeling right, they added power-ups within the game. Upgrading your scooter can allow you to hold two power-ups simultaneously as well change it's color and engine specification. Power-ups come in many forms such as rockets, boosters, mac-10 automated pistol, and even oil slicks. My power of choice in this game is the ability to whack your opponents with your cane at any given moment. This is one of the great features in this game that many other games as Mario Kart lacks. I like games that consistently keep you on your toes, engaged, and force you to pay attention at all times. At any point of a race, you are able to charge up how hard you want to hit someone and are able to release that charge right through your cane into another racers face. Just because you don't have a power-up, doesn't mean you won't get knocked off your scooter/kart. In this sense, it follows Road Redemption but adds the extra umph once a power-up is picked up. This feature alone can make it worth while, and as seen in RR, can make the whole game. After each race, you are rewarded with coins and experience. There was an excellent balance between grinding for cash and earning rewards. Throughout the race, there may be random obstacles within the way or ways to get more XP or coins. A cop car or a regular car may come driving through, a pedestrian may be crossing, or zombies might be in the way. I also have to give the game huge props for doing multi/local player battle race extremely enjoyable and simple to access.Graphics are absolutely appropriate for what they did. It feels like N64 graphics but with a 2015 update/mod/patch/fix to it. I love the sounds and the ambiance provided within the game. You will see your old timer as they are cruising through the map looking around and observing what's going on. It's small details like this that make games noticeable (but it's the big details like game play that make up a game)!Though albeit the game for the most part is good, it could have been a lot better. Besides having one melee attack, why not add two? Or a variation to the swing? Small things like this take the game from simply having an ability, to extending the power of this ability that effects the entire game. It also gives me a different method of attack. I would have also liked to see different game modes. Sumo, battle, or maybe a mode to see who could blow up or whack the most zombies.Because it is missing a little, but because it does have local, I think it's a well rounded score deserving a Indie RATING : 7.8/10Standalone RATING : 7.0/10I would highly recommend playing this with friends as it's difficult to find people online. Also, for any future updates or DLC's to the game I would recommend a longer storyline with a bit more whackyness to the tracks. Towards the end (and especially the final track), things finally got overly creative that it was starting to become really fun to play. Playing a bit of local co-op I've noticed some players spend a lot of time on the floor. I noticed myself on story mode that I'd be licking pavement. I would make it slightly more of a challenge to knock someone off their scooter.

												TL;DR Good potential and features, but the game is too damn hard.Trying to find a good cart game on PC is really hard. This game is probably one of the best I have played, however its plagued with small things which are infuriating. The AI has zero rubberbanding that I have observed, if you get to last place during a race, its extremely unlikely you will be able to catch up. I'm not saying racing games need rubberbanding, but for this type of arcade racing, it would be nice.The maps are unforgiving. Scattered all around the levels are objects on the sides. The AI never hit them, but if you do, you instantly stop, and are required to reverse to get around them. This can take you from 1st place, to an unrecoverable last place. The walls are sticky, if you tap or grind into them slightly in some places, you completely stop and get stuck, other times you just bounce off.Upgrade system is too expensive. You can't replay levels to earn more money, modes other than story don't earn you money. You can buy paint for your cart... WHO would buy this?? Theres not enough money to upgrade the essentials let alone deciding to paint your cart.Weapons, seem inconsistant. Sometimes they work, other times they don't. e.g missles in a straight line sometimes miss the AI players. AI don't seem to have this issue when shooting you.Powerups are useless. The 'boost' doesn't seem to do anything, sure if makes you look like you are going faster, but AI have passed me while I've been 'boosting', and I rarely catch up to AI when using the boost.The game has really good potential, but these issues need to be ironed out before its actually enjoyable. Was this game even play tested before being released? I've only played this game 2 hours and I've already found highly annoying things, surely testing would have found the same issues.			"

												Coffin  Dodgers is a throwback to the old school kart racers such as Mario Kart, Crash Team Racing and Diddy Kong Racing. The gameplay whilst basic is dont correctly and fits the genre well. The graphics although nothing spectacular are collourful and refreshing for gaming in our times as racing games have switched for the realistic approach of more recent times and whilst this is good it also means we lose cool and charming little games like this. There's enough weapons to keep the gameplay mixed and you can upgrade your karts such as power and acceleration.It also comes woth full controller support and a multiplayer component which is nice.Overall my only negative criticism is that there aren't enough tracks but I feel the devs could easily add more if the community asked for them, All in all this game is fun especially for the price tag and you'll get a few hours gameplay from it. But if you like OAP's, Supercharged scooters and uzi's then give it a try,Ill add in a video from my YouTube playthrough so you can see the game in action.Overall score 7/10

Early Access Review
								The time I've spent on this game (just under an hour) has been fun. This game is quirky, crazy, competitive and all round a good laugh.The scooters handle quite well, the weapons in game are pretty fun and the circuits are full of tight turns, obstacles and zombies roaming the street! Sure it has aspects that could be improved such as acceleration up hills (its lags a little bit) and maybe pictures of the characters in races to see who is in what positions etc. However for an early access game it is damn good. Throw in multiplayer in future updates and this game could be very very fun. Here is some gameplay footage of me trying the game out and having fun!

								I love this game so much, The awe-inspiring game design and the perplexing art direction is more than enough to guarantee a fun gaming experience will be had. Mobility scooters, power ups, old people, zombies! All the ingredients for a corker.			"

								Mobility. Scooter. Death. Racing. Do I really need to say more? Maybe i should. This game plays like road rash 64 crossed with mario cart 64, with a dash of flatout 2 added in. Only real downside is that it's kinda easy, beat the game in one try. Still, it has funny animations, funny concept and is good for a few hours.			"

												**Regarding Free VR Update**For HTC vive users this game works fine with xbox controller. It's not mentioned on the store front I think due to the way it boots up in steam VR. You have to go to the option play in other VR.It then plays perfect for me.As for the game Its a great little kart game as other people will have reviewed better than me, my review is just to say the VR works.Big thanks to the devs who are always very active and reply to questions, and also a massive thanks for making the update free when you could have easily charged.Don't make the same mistake as me with how I tried playing it, htc did an update and messed with my seating settings and I was nearly under the game without knowing why :-D			"

												Before you purchase, I recommend you play the demo to make your own analysis of the gameplay. You may like it, you may not.But I can't say I recommend this game. That's not to say it's bad. It is fun and slightly funny, but ultimately not very interesting. Other than a few funky aspects of the games physics (Getting stuck on objects or crashing you car randomly), its pretty smooth and balanced. The game is very short and offers a very basic couch co-op racer. Other than that there's nothing really to add.It acts as a place-holder for a Mario Kart style racer, and while it's fun for a little bit, I never found myself wanting to play it again after I beat the story mode (after little over an hour).If you don't own a game like this, this game will be good for you. But for those who have played other similar racers, it's not that interesting.			"

Coffin Dodgers is a fun and little cartoonish kart racing game, running around with old people in mobility scooters where the last runners are being caught by Reaper and then they run like zombies. During the game, you have the challenge of improving your vehicle with very funny visual upgrades.The controls are simple, gameplay is simple, fun and addictive. It has lot's of playable mods from single to multiplayer, which allows a wide range of choice. Open-world explore is a good and interesting mode to play. Short game but very fun. While I played, I had fun a lot.A note for the tutorial, simple and useful. New players will not have problems to start playing.Do not understand the negative reviews that I read on the game page on Steam about this game. Seriously.+original and super fun concept+great variety of weapons, upgrades and playable mods+quite good for playing in family/with friends+really interesting graphic models and textures, reminding cartoonRecommended game to buy on sale (as I did).

Review in English/Spanish 
Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  This is a blatant mobile game, the karting isn’t great, the scooters aren’t as customizable as the trailer made it seem and yet I can’t bring myself to give Coffin Dodgers a bad review because It’s got one of the silliest plots I’ver seen and all the silliness managed to bring a smile to my face for a couple hours.I’d say go for it if you are really bored or if the game is on sale.  Español:  Es un juego de móvil por donde se le vea, los controles no son los mejores y las motonetas no son tan personalizables como el tráiler muestra y aún así estoy recomendando el juego pues tiene una de las premisas más absurdas que haya tenido la oportunidad de disfrutar. No está mal para matar un par de horas pero no lo compraría a menos que estuviese en descuento.			"

												It's a cart game.It has the typical cart-y things (no gearbox, no handbrake) and powerups (rockets, gun, shield, speedup, oil slick), and you can also do (or be done in by) melee attacks with your crutch (upgradeable). You do get upgrades, but to farm for money in story mode you need to place in a race and not win, because once you move on you can't keep racing that track. It took me 2 hours and 2 showstopping glitches to finish ""story mode"" (game crashed on the cutscene after the first 3 races, and after the final challenge it wouldn't quit out of the victory loop). There are 13 tracks in all (some with zombies on the road), and a free-roam mode that also has a game. And of course there's multiplayer.The game is decent, but less fun than what it looks like. I'd say ""meh"", but would you want to spend money on ""meh"" in a genre that has much better games in it?			"

								A funny Mario Kart inspired game. Old farts are racing and fighting each other and Death. Actually whenever you beat someone they just bounce from the road and in this crazy game you can do it a lot. Still not completed but this game deserves it's price. Fun times guaranteed. Jump on your old school scooter and roll!			"

								Overall, game physics is great for current version!What you need to fix: I once played with 2 friends. They both had 1 lap to finish but I had 5 laps in the same match. Idk what was that.What I want to see: More online players (only 120 players right now) Better graphics on Steam version

												Going just by the looks, this ought to be a fun game, but unfortunately, they screwed up the basics - the steering and general ""feel"" of your vehicle is quite poor. With so many good ""action racers"" out there to compare yours with, and controlling your vehicle being so central to this kind of game, getting the basic gameplay right should not be rocket science.So it both boggles your mind and breaks your heart to see one where the developers appear to have put a lot of effort into making the game both look good, and have a fun and interesting story, but flub the actual gameplay. I mean, don't they have anyone in the office that actually try playing it, before they ship it?			"

												Coffin Dodgers is a kart racing game that puts you in a role of a resident of the retirement home in an effort to outrace Grim Reaper and save his/her life. Game consists of 13 race tracks spread over 4 different areas and you can play as one of the eight characters whose diversity are only visually. The reason I'm not recommending this game is that it's really, really short - you can easily complete the campaign in 2-3 hours and the multiplayer is nonexistent. Another reason is that the gameplay is often frustrating. Having a lead only means that you will be blown up by everyone else so the best strategy is to sit back and try to win the race in the last lap. Winning feels more like a coin flip than actual skill.			"

												It's hard getting old and not being mobile anymore. But hey now days you can get a sweet little buggy to drive you round. And when death comes for you you can deck out that buggy with weapons and say your not coming for me I'm coming for you. This is a fun little game but its nothing new just your standard cart racing game but with senior citizens. The levels are well designed and theres lots of upgrades. You can play on line and even free roam , so it has more features than your average cart game. I had fun playing it and its one of those games that offers a challenge and rewards.			"

												Good fun for a few hours but as mentioned in other reviews, the whole thing seems a bit shallow with regards to upgrades, characters, races etc. I went through it 3 times and there is nothing much else there on offer. Multiplayer seems to be dead as well. Short lived racing game which can be unfair and frustrating but strangely charming and quite addictive with it.			"

												Sure its not Mario Kart, but its a okay clone for Steam for a not so high price. You have over 16 courses, can upgrade your bike a bit, the story mode is nothing big & mp is almost dead, but maybe you have few hours of fun like me. I give the game 53 % and 73 % to achievement hunters ( 3 date achievements). Thx 4 reading.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the crash team racing bandicoot replacer! It's really fun, even there is need for some costumization.When you upgrade your stuff, you can have more weapons etc. You can also upgrade your cart and the colour. It's not that much, but it's okay since you see this game in Early Access.What needs to be fixed:- Hills / speed (It feels that you stop, when you drive)- Sound settings (It's 100% loud and almost destroyed my headphones) You have to change it in windows.- The driving seems OK. I'm not the one who plays car-games so much, but it feels too lose. When you drive, it's okay and no delay, but turning is hard.- You fall off too easy (If you drive into few things)- They should add voice acting for cutscenes (in the beginning) It will feel more alive.- The game crashed first time for me, that it could't find a resolution? So it gave me this message box that it didn't support anything. A restart  & verfy files fixed it.- MORE WEAPONS PLEASE! :D- You should be able to shoot bagwards, when you have a weapon.- It would be great if you could change clothes, skins, etc. Overall for those things, i find it funny. I can't way to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of my friends. also note, that they are working on splitscreen and different stuff. So don't you worry! it will be great.For an Early Access game, i had a fun experience! Total worth it: 8/10.Watch my gameplay:

												This game has a cute concept with fairly decent graphics, and it can provide a few hours of *some*enjoyment, but...- Something about trying to steer on the existing track design is strangely more difficult than it seems like it should be. You're racing mobility scooters on public streets and yet it's challenging to not run into a wall while taking a corner. I probably end up doing this at least once in every race, and for my 66 year old mother (who was drawn to the concept and I thought might be ideal) it's completely constant. Using a gamepad with thumb sticks helps a bit, but I feel like even with a full blown steering wheel the winding tracks would still prove too difficult.- The problem with the above is exacerbated by AI bots that are *incredibly* effective. Even on the lowest difficulty level, it's hard not to get constantly hit by something, and there's no real shielding in the game. If you're lucky, when you notice you're being targeted with rockets or guns and you happen to pick up the defibrillator (a good example of the admittedly clever charm in this game), then you can disable the weapons of the bots immediately around you. However, that won't help if someone sneaks up and whacks you with a cane. It's also possible to lay down some oil slicks, but the bots always seem to successfully navigate around them.- It gets to a point where if you haven't upgraded your vehicle in just the right way, by the time you get to the last few tracks, it's virtually impossible to advance. I think I put too much into my transmission and/or weapons rather than upgrading my engine enough, and accordingly I simply couldn't go fast enough to even keep up with the other bots--even if I successfully managed to never hit any walls or get damaged by bots.- It's for the above reasons that I never successfully finished the single player campaign and the game proved so incredibly *frustrating* that I just gave up on the whole thing.Honestly, Super Tux Kart has far better gameplay and features on virtually every level--and that game is completely free and open source. The only thing Coffin Dodgers has that STK lacks is online multiplayer (as opposed to just local split screen). However, since the base game was this irritating I lost interest. I played a few matches online, but the issues persisted, and the only way I could imagine it being halfway enjoyable is if I played without any bots, and last I checked there weren't a lot of servers setup this way anyways.Meanwhile STK features...- Drifting support where you can gain speed while skidding around corners- Wider more open tracks that are easier to navigate and far more enjoyable to play with more diverse settings and interesting elements- Weapon and defense upgrades that are more well balanced- A broader difficulty scale which facilitates AI that won't completely murder you when you're just trying to play through a casual kart racing game- It even has better graphicsAll things considered, while the game's concept has some initial charm, I can't recommend it with the current state of its gameplay, especially when there's better cheaper options available. Rather than spending $11 on this game, you'd be better off taking that money and donating it to Super Tux Kart (you'll get a bonus level or two that way too).http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/ "

												I never thought I'd se a kart racer that has worse RNG than mario kart but here it is. Like the last stage either you are first or last. Also the bounding boxes are hillarious. Sometimes you'll bounce of a wall no problem, sometimes you'll fall of your kart and sometimes you'll be bumped back into the air for a few seconds. Also you'll be cursing the guy that invented lamp posts after beating it. The weapon variety is really bad as well. You got a boost, a double homing rocket, a shield, a oil slick and the uzi which is the most useless thing ever. It's a punishment if you pick one up. But nothing can compare how bad game runs compared how it looks. Like I can run allstars racing transformed on max with no issues yet this stutters all over the place? Inexcusable.			"

Early Access Review
  Introduction            	Coffin Dodgers is a kart racer about the elderly people trying to keep from dying by winning a set of races with the grim reaper. This should tell you the tone of the game, very comedic. The gameplay is solid with tight arcade style racing, 6 different power-ups, and melee combat. This game is very fun, but as with all early access games it has a lot to go. They have added local multiplayer, but the update for online play has not been released yet, this will increase the want to play this game. Along with a few game elements that need updating, but this game is fun to play. The developers have set goals for adding more features and content to the game. I am looking forward for this game to get its online multiplayer, it will be a blast to play with friends.  Pros               
Arcade style racing Fun power-ups Upcoming online multiplayer Several playable characters Kart customization  Great track design    Cons              
Not enough power-ups Needs more game modes Problems with going up short hills     Conclusion                  	Coffin Dodgers is a fun, comedic, and unique kart racer with a very unique story . Along with the insanely fun gameplay, the online multiplayer will be coming to the game in a future update, and I can’t wait to shoot rockets at my friends online.-HiPFiRED If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

								From my first impressions of this game I am pleasantly surprised. The story is great and the characters a memorable and the gameplay is absolutely enjoyable. The game does have a few small bugs like going up or downhill is a little clunky and not as fluid as it should be but besides that my time with Coffin Dodgers has been very enjoyable. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of any of the battle racers like Mario Kart.Here is some gameplay of my first impressions if you prefer video format.

Early Access Review
								Finally, a game where ""You drive like a grandma!"" ISN'T considered an insult!As a fairly new game and with such limited reviews, I thought I would add to them and tell you guys what I think.Coffin Dodgers is PC players answer to a multiplayer ""Mario Kart 8"" type game. I've always thought a game like this would be so much fun on steam, and I was right! It is!Now I can go around in a hot pink leotard hitting old people with my walker. 10/10.- Play as your choice of grammie or grandpa- Unique scooters to each character- Battle Royale type campaign story mode, if you are in the bottom you are sacrificed to the grim reaper. Only way to win is to be at the top.- Colorful and beautiful art style and graphics.- Upgrades on your cart through coin progression based on how well you do in the matches.- Play story mode, time trails, open world, and soon multiplayer racing.- Challenging maps and AI's. You will crash. A lot.Current downsides:- No Multiplayer support added as of now. Devs have said it will be updated within the next 2-3 months at which time they will be out of EA.- Being that it is EA, there are some bugs and glitches.- Campaign mode is missing the final level. It's not complete.With such a short estimate for these things being updated, I don't feel it's enough to not try out the game and give them some early support until they do finish it.Things I would like to see:- Character customization! Would be neat to play dress up and unlock different props, clothes, hair styles, or even more carts or colors/designs on them.- VOIP. For this to be a contender in one of the best casual party racing games, it needs the ability to communicate in voice!- More maps, and more characters. (Specifically females! Only 2 to choose from in current build.)- Implement more cart customizations like the newest mk8 such as gliding.- More power ups to choose from! (And an option to drop power ups if we don't want them right now. *coughs* machine gun that you have to shoot a million bullets to get rid of)But yeah, really fun game! I will be eagerly watching the development of this game and know when multiplayer comes out it will be a hit.			"

												Its a fairly entertaining game with a lot of potential to be better. The story is original and pretty funny. The game play leaves a lot to be desired however. Most of the maps have insanely sharp turns and there is no upgrade to improve steering. You either spend the game hitting walls and betting bounced backwards or ride your brake, which is not an effective racing strategy. Especially since brake is also reverse. If you try to brake too hard you (for more than 1 second) you will go into reverse. The AI weapons seem to be able to track while yours can only fire in a straight line. I have gone around other racers and obsticals and still been hit. Decent enough game, though I personally would recommend buying this one on sale rather than paying full price for it			"

												in this game you get to choose wich person you are going to save and you race as the person you choose and you have to beat death in the races or you will die in the races there are boxes you can collect with special bonus power ups and also if you get close enough you can hit them with your can! this game is very fun and addicting I can easily recommend it.

Early Access Review
								I loved the concept of this game and was pleased to find it so well executed. Some of the highlights:The gameplay is great; “vehicles” are responsive and handle well (though prior to upgrades, you won’t get much air off the jumps).There’s a nice range of tracks, taking you from the seemingly tranquil (but actually zombie-infested) village to the haunted graveyard. The graphics are consistently beautiful.The weapons system works well and adds to the general bedlam. It’s really, really funny. The geriatric carnage that results from a crash is so funny it’s almost an incentive to drive badly.Could be better:More experimental weaponry.  The current range is a little predictable, and might have been more in keeping with the geriatric theme. All in all:Thoroughly enjoyable.Coffin Dodgers shines for its comedic details, and for how originally it manages to tear apart the tranquil village evenings, with unprovoked walking stick assaults, UFO visitations, and granddad gunfire.

												For a game about racing to save your soul, this feels terribly lacking in a soul of itself.- The game is a Mario Kart clone and it could be quite charming but it's just very dull. - The rubberbanding is horrific. The AI are constantly right behind you even if you're nailing every corner, but as soon as you inevitably get blown up by a rocket (happens a lot) and you slip back to the middle of the pack they drive really poorly and you are able to catch them very quickly. - The weapons / pickups are boring and unimaginative. The uzi is an interesting idea but has been implemented very badly.- There are no real driving physics to speak of. I know this is an arcade karting game but almost no thought has to be taken to get round the tracks.If it's incredibly cheap in a sale (I think I got it in a bundle) then maybe it's worth playing for a very short time, but there have to be bettter options out there if you like this sort of thing.3/10			"

												Had a kick playing it! Works great with SteamOS and the wireless 360 controller. Suggestion would be maybe to make an option so that it's more kids friendly - e.g.: so a young child can read something a little friendlier if they finish in 8th place. Maybe have the ability to name your characters and possible have a character maker ... Other than that, very fun and on my favs list.			"

												Coffin Dodgers is basically Mario Kart with mobility scooters, where a bunch of old folks need to have a race and beat the grim reaper, as they aren't quite ready to go. However, most won't be able to win, and those who are ""dead"" continue racing in the next series as zombies. There are five areas, and seven of you (eighth guy is the Grim Reaper himself), with the final are being a one-on-one between you and death. As typical in these races, you obtain weapons from mystery boxes and decide when and how to deploy them. However, by winning you can get coins, which can be used to upgrade your mobiling scooter with top speed, acceleration, grip, weapons, and so on. There's even melee, where you use your cane against any one dumb enough to get close to you. There are also plenty of weapons, from the typical ""seeking rockets"" to ""oil slicks"" to shields to EMP pulse to Uzi. Graphics are fast and cartoonish, as expected, and there are full support for gamepads, even split screen keyboard AND gamepad support. There are several oldsters to pick from, each with a slightly different backstory and bonus power. Music is a bit repetitive, but not too bad. Sound effects are a bit plain, but workable. All in all, Coffin Dodgers is a cute high concept with a proven formula, but doesn't offer something too new. It's fun for a bit of multiplayer and have some mutual laughs. Get it while on sale.

												This isn't a particularly good game, but for the price, it's not a bad cheap alternative.  It had a bit of Mario Kart style flare (though it reminds me more of Re-Volt).  Kart racing with a few weapons.  The theme is kinda cute, members of a retirement community racing against Death for their lives and souls.  One interesting mechanic is that you only have to beat the 'living' players at the end of the mini-tournaments, and those that fail come back as zombies.  It does add a bit of a twist to the game.However, this is not a fully polished product.  The physics are very wonky.  The song (singular) is very repetitive after a while - though it does seem that there are a few variations of it in the game.  The weapons are not particularly good, and the tracks can be a little frustrating with having an outcropping right after a very tight turn and the like.There's also a few things that may not be obvious right away.  In story mode, when you upgrade your cart, those upgrades keep.  You can restart the story mode and still have those upgrades on that player.  In fact, you can't get all the upgrades in a single play-through, so to fully upgrade your cart you have to play the same character at least twice.  This does mean that if you're getting frustrated at how hard the races are getting, you can restart to power up some more.There is also a ""score"" in the way of ""XP"" that doesn't really seem to do anything.  It's just there.  You gain some by successfully using weapons, smashing zombies, or running into some obstacles on the track, and can lose some by being knocked off your cart.  There's not a whole lot of balance as to what gives better XP, and there doesn't seem to be any point to them anyway.All in all, it's a cheap game that if you are desperate for a cart style racer and don't mind if it's not a triple-A title, and this is on sale, go ahead and pick it up.  Just don't expect a masterpiece.			"

												Just got this game yesterday. While it is quite similar to other Mario Cart style games I found the quirky environment and characters quite engaging. Making an elderly, mad scientist smack the Reaper in his stupid face with a walking stick is surprisingly satisfying. As was spraying his zombie hoardes full of lead. It's a fairly short game, which might put people off, given the $9.99 price tag so I would suggest you give the free demo a quick spin before purchasing if you're unsure.I think this is one game that will definitely benefit from using a controller instead of a keyboard. I ended up strewn across picket fences quite a few times while trying to simultaneously build up my melee attack and keep track of my power-ups, but that might have had more to do with my choice of drink than the game itself.

												I agree with others that this game isn't balanced well enough.And no: Getting one booster item after another when you fallbehind is NOT what I consider a good balance.Maybe I'm too demanding but the campaign is way too short and I really like to see more tracks. Taking into account thatall tracks are more or less slight variations of a single town,this is not enough to make it a great single-player experience.However, since I had quite some fun for the 10 bucks it's still a recommendation.

												I'll say 'Yes' to recommending but that's only because I'm kinda forced to either say yes or no and not maybe.It is no Mario Kart. The physics can be wonky at times, the steering violent and the action hectic. Sometimes that's great fun, but other times you touch the side of the track and go flying and go from way out ahead in first to last in the blink of an eye.The setting itself won't win any prizes. I guess it is meant to be funny, but it quickly grows old (pun intented). It lacks the fun and sparkle of the leading games in its category and that means you won't be breaking it out at a party unless it is your only multiplayer karting option. The tracks lack variety / distinction, and are generally a bit bland. The weapons don't feel balanced at all, and being caught in the middle of the pack is way more dangerous than being at the front.Still, it is good for a bit of fun, and is not unreasonably priced. Graphics are decent enough, controls are responsive (even if the steering can be a bit hectic) and the game is done well enough that there are no major gripes. It's just lacking that bit of ooomph that could have really made it stand out.			"

												A kart game with old people trying to avoid death. What could go wrong? Everything: - The graphics are horrible - The music is repetitive - The maps boring and look all the same - The powerups are uninterresting and there aren't many - Stutering is very noticeable - If you lose and want to retry you have to wait until the next stage screen appears - By default the next stage screen is set to continue, not try again, whether you lose or not - Some obstacles do nothing while others make you stop or even bounce back - Everyone is there to get you but are rather peaceful if you're not among them - Pray not get hit because if you do you'll probably be in last place - You cannot restart in the middle of a race - You cannot drop a power up you don't need - You cannot fire your power ups backwards - If someone hits with anything at all you lose all your power ups - The ending sucksGood points about the game: - Multiplayer - Has upgrades - Playstation Dualshock 3 works flawlessly - The game is playable - The game is shortThe idea behind the game is begging for failure. Old guys racing? Really? At least the game could be fun but its not much fun. It is just a boring and annoying kart game.			"

												ok .. now .. i dont know if this review will be taken seriously but here goes this game is great  ,me and my friend played this game together and we really enjoyed it .. grannys and mobility scooters with the ability too hit eachother with sticks its so good we were in stitches through so i myself reccomend this game the only think that lets this game down is PRICE / CONTENT i completed this game in under 2 hrs so at £8.99 .... NO WAY is this worth it ... (26/11/15)but sub £5 yes it is .. if you want a light fun racing game for a bit of non serious fun this is a good game  "

												best way to describe this game is Mario Kart the Golen years...you can style up your scooter and you race death for your life, its just one of those games that you can enjoy the story a good few times or you can jump on with friends in local or online mode and its always fun!its a good solid game!

												Coffin Dodgers is an excellent demonstration of the difference between a game that's like Mario Kart and actual Mario Kart.  The concept is essentially identical, the sensibility is similar, but in the hands of less capable developers the outcome is not the same at all, and the experience suffers for it.The central conceit of Coffin Dodgers is that all the racers are very old people in mobility scooters, compelled by the Grim Reaper to race each other to win another day of life.  This is... funny?  I guess?  The game is styled as though it was comedic, but the devs seem to have hung their hopes on the idea that old people and mobility scooters are inherently funny, and thus not bothered to include any actual jokes.The environment and track design is adequate, though not much more.  It provides a suitably twisty place in which to race, but you won't be spending much time admiring the scenery.  Some stages provide various objects in the road which can be hit.  Hitting these objects earns you experience points, as does hitting your enemies.  Thus far, though, I can't see any actual use for the experience points other than a meaningless counter.As with most Kart games, luck plays as much of a role as skill does.  The effect is particularly pronounced here, though.  You can quickly jump from first place to last in one rocket attack from an AI kart, but also from last to first, if the AI players feud with each other.  The frequency with which this happens in the last half of the last lap makes the race outcomes largely random.  The ""whack enemies with your cane"" mechanic is also rather unpredictable; I seem to be most likely to hit if I swing when an enemy is to my side, but about a half kart-length ahead.Powerups are distributed liberally along the track, but there aren't very many kinds; with a bit of luck, it's quite possible to try out every powerup the game has in your very first race.  There's a speed boost, an oil slick, a shield, a rather ineffective machine gun and a very effective missile launcher.If there weren't the big name kart games like Mario Kart and CTR out there setting the gold standard -- had the kart game actually been a new concept instead of a well-developed genre -- this could have been a bit more fun.  As it is, Coffin Dodgers emulates the big guys too much to escape comparison with them, and it does very poorly in that comparison.			"

												Ever wonder what happens to Mario Kart racers after they retire? They move to this retirement village.This is a brutal little racing game where a bunch of elderly drive around town, squashing zombies and beating each other with canes, missiles, and machine guns, in order to prevent death from claiming their soul.Its what you expect from a Mario Kart clone.It has a reasonable controls and I found myself having to work at several of the races. Control your racer however your want, keyboard, controller, some weird mix of the two, just make sure your reflexes are up for the task.Ultimately this game makes me happy. Its nothing we haven't seen before, and its short, but it is satisfying to play.			"

												Thanks all-mighty Alienware warriors for giving this Early Access to me for the review.Pros: - Funny concept- Smacking opponents with a stick- Local Multiplayer :)- A nice campaign mode.- Open World option- Online Multiplayer.- Worth the pocket money. (10 bucks)Cons:- AI seems to be a bit too easy.- Campaign is a bit too easy, considering the AIAll in all, a funny game inspired by Crash Team Racing, but a bit too easy for some. Online, however, is flawless.			"

												Coffin Dodgers is a budget Mario Kart mixed with Road Rash. Pick 1 of 8 elderly persons, hop on a mobility scooter which you can pimp out with upgrades, and race against The Grim Reaper and the other old farts you didn't pick, In story mode, the last person to finish dies and comes back as a zombie in the next race. You can shoot rockets and use uzis on the other racers. You can hit other elderly people on mobility scooters with your cane. You have to try this game!			"

Early Access Review
								One of the most fun and funny arcade racing games I have played in a long time on the PC. For the small amount of content it is definitely not an all-nighter game. Even with it being early access, I still don't feel this will become one of the top racing games, maybe one of the more hilarious games...But it is definitely a repeatable time filler. I hope the online community increases, this game makes you care less about who wins & more about what mayhem you can create in your senior years. I am looking very forward to all the updates and addons to come for this game. Simple control scheme, very well thought out tutorial. Unique & original plot. Thumbs up to the Devs alone.Personal side note, I think ragdoll effects should be emphasized more. Since character arms and legs seem short, it makes it seems as though the effect is minimalized. Also, being able to catch some major air in crashes along with ragdoll could be quite hilarious as well.			"

Meet ""Joe Black""He's a bit of a gambler and enjoys a good curry.His hobbies include horse riding and gambling, he also boasts an impressive collection of hourglasses.Anthony Hopkins has met him (although he looked a lot like Brad Pitt back then).Bill and Ted have met him too.Seasons don't fear him (nor do the wind, the sun or the rain).I am of course talking about the Grim Reaper.The personification of death who also has a secret passion for cart racing (who knew!) which brings us on to Coffin Dodgers, an interesting little cart racing game bought to us by Milky Tea Studios.The Scooter PlanIt seems that the old-timers of Sunny Pines retirement home have attracted the attention of our black clad bony friend and are not too keen on being ""reaped"".Knowing that Death is partial to a little cart racing some of the more spritely residents of Sunny Pines put their heads together and come up with a cunning plan.They will challenge Death to series of mobility scooter races to the... err... death.The Grim Reaper agrees and the pensioners set about dusting off their ""Old Mans Harleys"" in preparation for the races to come.This is where you come in.You'll get to pick your favourite OAP from  a selection of seven wrinkly racers, grab your controller (or keyboard if you want to punish yourself) and race your chosen oldie around the suburbs of what can only be described as a bizarre little town.Close EncountersYou'll be racing around suburban roads, zipping through tunnels whilst dodging oncoming trains and tearing around graveyards in an effort not to come last, If you lose, the Reaper will take your sole and it's ""game over man"".There are various obstacles and distractions to slow you down too, a good example is when you're roaring around the farmland outside of Sunny Pines where you'll quickly discover that several UFO's have also taken an interest in the area.These little spaceships, which I suspect may be storing their alien cocoons in the local swimming baths, (That would explain the sprightliness of the Sunny Pines residents... seriously, you haven't seen the movie Cocoon?)Anyway these little spaceships will try to slow your mobility scooter down with their tractor beams, this is a bad thing when you've got a pack of equally desperate ""coffin dodgers"" snapping at your heels.Granny GrenadesAs you race around the various tracks you'll also collect power-ups which play as much a part of winning the race as your driving skills.A handily timed shield will protect you from that machine gun toting granny who's desperately trying to get passed you, like wise a missile power up will help you blow that problematic pensioner out the running if you can get her in your sights.Why there are rocket launchers, machine guns and ""shields from the future"" lying around on the road isn't explained, maybe the aliens put them there?Why are there aliens?Because they're visiting to collect their cocoons from the swimming pool, remember!Don't look too hard for any coherent logic or meaningful plot here, this is a true old school arcade cart racer, you don't need fancy reasons, you just need fast reflexes.Pimp my RideShould you finish in a respectable position, you'll be spared the scythe a little longer (unlike the poor old sap who came last) and live to race another day.You'll also have earned yourself some experience which you can spend on upgrading your trusty mobility scooter.From go faster stripes to an engine that will actually make you go faster, there are several upgrades to choose from which should give you an edge in the next race against Death.Mutton dressed as  LambThis genre has been around for a very long time and I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to review a cart racing game without mentioning Mario Cart which came out way back in 1992 and opened up the flood gates for countless cart clones.The genre hasn't really moved on much since then either, sure the games have gotten better looking with time but the actual mechanics have pretty much stayed the same.Coffin Dodgers is a testament to this, the cutesy cartoon graphics whizzing past are pleasant enough. The audio again is fine, although the music can start to grate a little after you've been listening to it for a while.With regards to game play it feels very similar to countless other cart racers I've played in the past. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I enjoyed those old ""cart'em-ups"" and I enjoyed this one too.It just suffers a little from a feeling of déjà vu.Codger ComedyThere are two aspects of this game that did shine through for me though.Firstly, the premise.Whilst I'm sure some out there will be offended by the term ""Coffin Dodgers"" and wear their moral outrage with pride against this mobility scooter madness, I found the whole concept hilarious.I mean, pimping up mobility scooters, racing grandads, Death riding in a cart, it's comedy gold!It also adds an extra level of tension, if you...

												“Pimp up your mobility scooter and take on the Grim Reaper and his Zombie army in a race for your soul. Armed with a variety of homemade weapons and gadgets, battle your way through 13 unique & exhilarating tracks. Can you survive the retirement village?”GameplayHold onto your hat like Jeremiah and race around in this fun little indie game racer. With very basic controls similar to other cartoon racers it’s got a really good pick up and play aspect where you aren’t having to learn loads of stuff over before you can get going. Use your walking stick to attack your rival racersStory ModeEach track has three races, which see you competition to be the top coffin dodger and take the gold! Keep on an eye on your position because at the end of each of the three races there are eliminations.Top Tip 1Keep an eye out for shortcuts, they aren’t the most obvious to see but if your almost at the finish and in 5th or 6th they sure do come in handy.  Although we didn’t do great on it our favourite track is Story Mode: The Graveyard, Race 3!Top Tip 2Don’t slow down, you can make about 95% of all the corners without taking your front off the gasPower-Ups / Pick UpsOne feature that’s much loved of all cartoon racers is the items you can pick up along the way. It’s nice to see the consistence of the games theme being shown even in the fact this items are stored in old school travel cases. Beware next time you pass someone on a mobility scooter apparently they can be equipped with some rather powerful rockets, who would have know ?Our favourite power-up is the defibrillator as it’s a radius attacker meaning if they are in front or behind as long as they are close they’ll stand no chance against you.If your out in front also be aware that we couldn’t work out a way to fire the rockets behind at your rivals so you may have to slow and let them pass just so you can take the shot. Sadly the power-ups aren’t stackable at first so if your hanging onto something useful you may want to use it early and pick up another. Although if that’s not your style then you can spend some of your hard earned corns in unlocking the number you can hold and the ability to lock and switch them.UnlocksWe love a good unlock, it gives you something to aim for! In Coffin Dodgers you get to upgrade and personalise your mobility scooter* by spending the coins you’ve earned in previous races. Everything from engine to paint job is customisable so you can really go to town on the design of your mobility scooter as you avoid the looming threat of the grim ripper. Top Tip 3Don’t waste your money early on like we did on styling your mobility scooter make sure it’s upgrades are all dealt with first as the game requires this for you to progress at a good pace rather than multiple replays of the same tracks.Other ModesIt’s not just racing on tracks and completing a story like game their are other modes available to play. The one’s you expect are included quick race, time trial and multiplayer but there is also a pretty fun one called Open World. Something we weren’t expecting to see in this game. Open World is as it sounds a large drivable town that you can do mini missions and challenges within, it makes for some quick fun when the story is getting too tough and you want a break.Read more and see some gameplay videos of the different points I've covered over on the blog postCoffin Dodgers - Indie Game Of The Week[www.dabs.com] "

								Coffin Dodgers sees you take a control of an elderly person in a mobility-scooter race to the death against the Grim Reaper and their fellow retirees. The losing oldies will have their souls well and truly reaped, whereas the winner receives the gift of life!While the game is in early access, it seems to be pretty much complete already. Just one more race is yet to be added at the time of me posting this review. Coffin Dodgers has a lovely art style that is reminiscent of a Pixar animation, and plays like Mario Kart. It's darkly comic so If you appreciate crude humour you will probably like this. Just don't play it in front of your grandparents.Check out this video for my first impressions:

												Platform of use: SteamOS 1.0Great little game, and worth the 8 dollars I paid for it. I like the upgrade system, and when you get hit and taken down by other players, there is an addicting sense to it. The only weapon I felt was a bit unfair was the Uzi, you can't escape that thing! The story mode was ok, and had a bit of humor to it. A challenging story mode that made me always want to continue and upgrade my cart. If you find it for cheap, pick it up!

Early Access Review
								A quirky cart racing game in the vain of Mario Cart.MilkyTea has done early access right. The core mechanics of the game are clearly expressed and well executed, even if the content is currently somewhat limited.You select one of 6 retirees, the premise - to outrun death, literally. As expected in these types of games there are various powerups including traps, weapons, shields, boosts, and pulses.The combat is coffin dodgers is relatively original and done quite well. In addition to item drop weapons you have a basic attack. This can be tapped to stun and briefly slow opponents, or it can be held down to throw them off their cart. Being thrown off your cart occurs when hit by weapons (depending on the weapon strength) or during high speed collisions, after which you will respawn after a short (but pivotal) period of time. The calculations for being de-carted are done very well and really add a strong element to the game.The choice of riders offers no difference other than aesthetics. In single player carts can be upgraded (top speed, acceleration, control, melee damage, item slots and paint job). In the multiplayer mode this translately into a game setting determining what level of upgrades all the carts have. This system means that you can't choose characters/carts with relative strengths and weaknesses like in most racing games. Being early access this may change in the future, however given the current system I doubt it will.The levels are well designed, interesting, visually appealing and diverse - with the promise of more to come in the future.The modes currently include campaign mode, free roaming of the maps (both multiplayer and single player), and multiplayer modes (online, LAN and splitscreen).The pricetag may be a little high for the current content (as is generally the way with early access games) however the promise of future content makes the price worthwhile.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM "

												This is one of the better ""mario kart"" style games I have played on PC/steam. Controls are decent, the theme is original(old people on their scooter-chairs). There are enough power ups to make it interesting and its a challenge to win the races for me so far. Graphics are not state of the art, but are good, so is the sound. Gameplay is fun and there are enough modes and story mode to keep you playing for a few hours at the very least. I got this game from a giveaway, so the price is not an issue for me, but I would say $5 would be a nice price, so if you see it on sale at that, do not pass it up if you are a kart racing fan.			"

http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/coffin-dodgers-review/ - Full ReviewGrave Dodgers doesn’t do enough to stand among the greats like Diddy Kong Racing, Crash Team Racing or Nintendo’s flagship franchise. Despite it’s adorable premise and fantastic art design, the game falls flat when it comes to map layout, power-ups, and strategy. The online mode has already been deserted, and there’s nothing outside of the main campaign to offer players. There’s some fun to be had here, without a doubt- but I can’t imagine this game standing the test of time. I would love to see a sequel however, as there is some real opportunity here, and the clever innovations and melee combat make this a real contender for something new in an overly dominated genre.

								This game with quite an annoying manners reminds why old people are annoying, or you just simply hate them.It gives you answer to the reason why... :  All those hags who like to teach us - young people - what to do and how it needs to be done, or how they had to behave in their times. Veterans who can't stop telling how rough were their physical training at our age, and could talk for hours about the time they served. Those geezers at grocery stores are pushing your groceries closer to the cash register and rushing to put their own on the counter. Granies who'd use any means just to get in front of you in the line to doctor.... are getting on our nerves.The answer appears to be as simple as can be - they're trying to win the race vs Death. Perhaps if someone gave them a medal they'd leave us alone and quit bugging us. All in all the game's fun and (of course) annoying.  10/10

								For me, this game is essentially broken. Me and my flatmates were looking forward to a simple racing kart game as a replacement for our N64 emulator and Mario Kart setup.We played this for an hour or so, but all essentially agreed the steering in Coffin Dodgers simply isn't up to scratch, it just isn't fun in the way a game like this is supposed to be, especially for multiplayer.Will revisit it at some point if there are more updates to the mechanics.For reference, we were playing it with Logitech F710 pads, not keyboard or whatever. I'm sure it's possible this was the weak link in the chain, so to speak.			"

			Coffin Dodgers is an arcade racer akin to Mario Kart. Take on the Grim Reaper in the singleplayer mode and take on other players both locally and online.		

Positives - Solid Mechanics- Local and Online multiplayer (online multiplayer coming in a later patch)- Quick Races pose a good challenge for AI races- Simple and Clean aestheticNegatives- Courses are very similair- Lacks interesting characters- Modifications can make the singleplayer a breeze to win- Pick-ups are fairly standard			"

												Coffin Dodgers is a quality kart racing game with a unique storyline: a group of senior citizens soup up their mobility scooters to take on the Grim Reaper in a series of races to the death. Coffin Dodgers gets the most important aspects of the genre right: good controls, appealing graphics, a decent variety of pickups strewn throughout each track, and a garage to upgrade your kart. It also has a morbid sense of humor that hits all the right notes.As with any kart racing game, winning is a combination of skill and luck. Yes, there will be times when you're in first place, five feet from winning the race, and you get scattered to the wind by an opposing racer's rocket. The result? Sixth place. If that bothers you, you probably shouldn't be playing a kart racing game in the first place. It's just part of the genre. Overall, I thought the skill vs luck aspect of the racing to be well balanced. If I raced well, I usually had a chance to win and generally finished in the top three. If I finished toward the bottom of the leaderboard, I usually felt I made too many mistakes. I do have some minor quibbles with Coffin Dodgers however. Projectile weapons can't be fired backwards. If you get a rocket or a machine gun while in first place, it's basically useless. The ability to fire backwards, even if doing so would give you less chance of a direct hit, would be a welcome addition.Another minor disappointment is that there doesn't seem to be any shortcuts or alternative routes on the tracks, at least not that I found. Also, while you can choose from seven different characters to race as, they don't seem to have unique attributes that make racing with one character a different experience than racing as another. Despite these issues, I enjoyed my time with Coffin Dodgers. I beat the game in about three hours, and I definitely wasn't rushing. I replayed many of the tracks several times, not because I needed to improve my standing, but because I enjoyed the track and wanted to race it again before moving on. Is Coffin Dodgers the best kart racer on Steam? Nope. That woud be Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed. If you want the second best, get F1 Race Stars. But as a kart racing fan, I consider Coffin Dodgers to be a solid addition to my library.Coffin Dodgers is easy to recommend to kart racing fans, especially if it's on sale.			"

												The demo looked alright, but the full game doesn't add too much functionality. Sure, more tracks, but I bought it mainly for multiplayer, and all you can do there is single race or ""explore"", which lets you drive the area with no other opponents. All you do is drive around and once in a while shoot the other player, which doesn't change the score or anything. Plus, the music gets annoying after 10 minutes, play the demo and imagne hearing that in a loop.			"
