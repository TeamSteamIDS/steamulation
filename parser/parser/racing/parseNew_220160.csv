												This is by far one of my favorite games.  The physics are just right, the gameplay is easy sometimes but progressivly gets super hard.   The only hinderance is that it uses uplay, which is not a big deal but it's annoying.			"

												if your'e a fan of ""tilty bike"" games (no idea the actual genre name) then youl enjoy this game, the only downside is a controller is a must, as you need a pressure sensitive trigger/button to get the gas just right to get those tricky hills and jumps. Other than that, this game is the top game in its genre, good visuals, great gameplay, and a great franchise. if you are considering buying it, do it. i doubt you'd be dissapointed.Akari-chan			"

												Awesome game, put 30 hours in, set some crazy records, got a number 3 spot in the world on a track. Would buy for 5 bucks any day.EDIT: Since this review has gotten popular, I decided to add to it. Trials is a unique game. Its a race against time, and is a ton of fun but can be very very challenging at some times. The controls are well done, and the bikes and tracks are all made well and the difficulty of each track is organized in a fair manner. Usings the controller works best with this game, in my opinion. The multiplayer isnt too active, but if you can get 4 friends over for some local trials races, you will have a blast, I guarentee it.The only downside to this game is that it uses uplay, but in my opinion, there really isnt any other game out there like this one, so it is worth it.

												Trials sets a standard for this generation of arcade style games. Although there are certain aspects you'd expect from this game that are missing; with its fast-paced gameplay, impressively realistic 2.5D visuals and its addictive quality, RedLynx open up the arcade genre to a new level of brilliance, showing other developers how to make a modern day arcade-style video game.8/10Pros/Cons+ The physics engine in this game has the perfect balance of realism with an arcade-like edge. + Trials matches excellent refreshed visuals with the classic 2.5D look to make another classis.+ Trials is crammed with hundreds of levels offering a decent amount of content for the player.+ Community created levels add endless hours of fun on top of the offline single player content. - The limited bike and rider customisation is disappointing and feels like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥new feature.- Gamers who aren't all that big on community content might get bored of the basic content.

												I will be the first to admit I am not the most ""hardcore"" gamer on the planet. Some may even call me a b***h, and I'm totally fine with that. This all means that when games become super hard I generally tend to turn them off and do something that doesn't make me want to smash my face into a concrete slab. This game however, is incrediably rewarding and keeps me drawn in. I have unlocked all the tracks in both sections of the game (Trials HD, and Evolution). I in no way would ever concider myself a ""good"" trials player. Look up videos of folks pulling off Extreme traks with 0 faults, and you will know what god looks like. The reason that this game doesn't get frustrating, is the amazing physics system. I have never once felt like the game cheated me out of landing a partifuclar obstacle. Everytime I fail I know it is my own fault and the only thing standing between me and the finsih line is skill, not luck. This brings me back again again and again. If I have 20 minutes before I head to class to play a game, this is almost always what I chose. I try my hardest to get a gold medal on whatever track I chose. If I suceed, I feel like like the worlds biggest bad a** all day. If I fail, I'm no frustrated, and all day I'm thinking about what I need to do different to reach my objective. I love the fact that the online multiplayer allows you to use whatever bike and ride on whatever track you want (irregardless of weather or not you have unlocked that content in the single player.) This provided hours of enjoyment as me and my bestfriend tackled Extreme tracks knowing damn well we barely had the skill for Medium tracks. This system actually improved our skill quite rapidly and I'm all for it. I wish more games would allow players to access all content from the get go. I've never written a review before, so excuse me if this was all rambling, but this has become one of my favorite games of all time and so I felt it was fitting to share my opinion!			"

												The game itself is extremely fun-- I also own it on Xbox 360 and have spent hours on it. The required Uplay account is the reason I can't fully recommend it -- Uplay runs constantly in the background even after you quit the game and slows down the computer. Ubisoft is notorious for badly-thought out DRM and it appears they haven't quit yet. If I were you I'd get this on console instead.			"

												Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a game where you drive a MOTHER♥♥♥♥IN' DIRT BIKE up ramps and over obstacles, thousands of times, often while grimacing and swearing to yourself that this time, this fault, this checkpoint will be the time you finish against these insurmountable odds. There are over 120 tracks, ranging from easy, fast tracks, to license tests that are neat tutorials which also unlock a new bike, all the way to Hard and Extreme tracks, which can last upwards of 20 minutes before you finally reach the end, cursing each time you have to retry. A handful of bikes change up the pace a bit as you progress, but by and large the game remains unchanged in its mechanics from start to finish. That isn't a knock, though, because over time you'll learn various new techniques to help you overcome the ever-increasing challenges of the tracks to become a champion. A handful of mini-game type tracks, tournaments, and themed tracks keep the game fresh, and striving for Gold (or even Platinum!) medals in tracks will keep you coming back for a long time. In addition, there's a multiplayer mode where you can compete against your friends on a series of tracks to see who gets the best time. It's barebones but fun, and though uPlay is a significant hassle, it's worth it for the zany antics and rush of competition.Overall, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a great game that combines two well-regarded games (Trials HD and Trials Evolution) into a fun package that gives you as much back as you put into it. Some people say there are optimization issues, and indeed on some later tracks the framerate will dip wildly into the teens before climbing back to a playable framerate, but overall it's a good port. I give it 8.5/10 stars and hope to see future Trials games hitting PC, because I'll be there for the ride.			"

												Let's get this straight: I absolutely adore this game, it is really fun to play and see how you improve over time. Even better if you have a couple of friends to compete with on the leadersboards or play a bit of multiplayer.You can even make your own tracks in the editor which is pretty easy to get started in, but advanced enough to make crazy minigames and really slick looking tracks.If the game will actually run at all for you that is.It seems to be a coin-toss if this game will work on your system or not, and if it actually does run it might still lag even with really good hardware. I'm running it with a HD7970 and an i7 3770k so it runs well just because of the brute force.My laptop on the other hand has a decent high end i7 (for a laptop) and a HD8870M and I can't even run the game on low settings in 680x480 (for reference, the laptop can run Battlefield 4 on low sort of okay in 1080p) without having lag.Other people have problems with the game not starting at all or crashing frequently.EDIT: Track central is now fixed and works just as well as it does on Xbox 360, removed the ""it's not working very well part"".It also has DRM in the form of uPlay, which will start when you try and start the game from Steam. It was pretty terrible in the beginning but seems to have improved a bit over the year (still would rather not have it). uPlay also handles the multiplayer part of the game if you want to make private games with friends and that part is incredibly broken too. Pressing invite from the in-game friendslist just crashes my game and I'm one of the lucky ones that it's the only problem I'm having with it.To sum things up I would recommend the game if I knew it would work properly, but with all the problems it has it really seems to be dumb luck wether it will work. The infrequent patches haven't done much to remedy the situation in the last few months so I honestly cannot recommend it when it's so broken for a big portion of the people that bought it.			"

												Let's say you're going to watch a summer blockbuster at the theater.  It's a movie that has gotten rave reviews and you are pretty much know you're going to love it.  You get your coke, popcorn, and gummy worms and head to an aisle somewhere in the middle of the theater; it's your favorite spot.  And the icing on the cake is your smoking hot girlfriend is with you and equally excited for the movie. However, you notice that a few rows in front of you, there is an overweight, greasy guy that's breathing heavily and constantly picking his nose.  He has an obnoxious laugh, he slurps his soda really loud, and every now and then he lets out a smelly fart.  Initially he is kind of distracting, but after a while you learn to block him out of your mind; you are not going to let this guy ruin the best movie of the summer for you.Well, Uplay is that smelly guy, except much less offensive, and Trials in the summer blockbuster.  And if you're refraining from playing this exceptional game because the idea of running an additional program in the background while playing bothers you, well...I think that's pretty ignorant.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic and the inclusion of the HD levels is much appreciated if you never had it on 360; it really is like getting two games in one, and it makes progression through the more frustrating later levels a lot more tolerable when you can switch off between the two.That said, I really wish they'd port this somewhere else -- I try to avoid getting Ubi and EA stuff on PC because of UPlay and Origin, and the port itself is also kind of janky; it requires DX10 so it's not likely to ever work in Wine, and performance is a little worse than it should be. For my money, Trials Fusion isn't nearly as good, but unfortunately that's the one they've chosen to support an OpenGL variant of on the PS4.			"

												It actually saddens me that I can't reccomend this game, considering the enthusiasm with which I approached it. Right upon launch the game forces you to make a uPlay account, which is not that bad one might say. Then, you are introduced to the uPlay overlay which is laggy, non-intuitive and an overall pain to use. After 30 minutes of trying to get in a game with a friend, during which we encountered silly errors (""Steam is disabled for some reasons"" [sic]) the only thing we could do is give up.There seems to be a tendency nowadays that every publisher is keen on forcing us to use their in-house unusable bloatware.

Your standard pre-launch setup (expected)2. A window that is clearly not your game appears (unexpected)3. It says 'updating Uplay'4. It takes almost an hour to 'update Uplay'5. Create a Uplay account (even though you don't want to)6. You type in the key steam has given you7. Repeat step 6 another 4 times8. Become banned from uplay for entering an 'incorrect' key too many times9. Try restarting Uplay10. Be faced with another hour long update11.  When that finishes, why not have another!Thats as far as I have got towards playing the game that I payed for 2 hours ago and haven't played yet. As far as Trials Evolution goes, it's a great game that I have played on Xbox for a long time. I reccomend you buy it on Xbox, and if you don't have an Xbox then wait until they are cheap. This wait will most likely be shorter than the waiting time for Uplay to update. Have fun! "

												Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a 2.5D physics platformer that combines both Trials HD and Evolution into one package. You are tasked with getting across each level as quickly and with as little crashes as possible. Looking at some screenshots of the game you may think it is an action packed racing game but in reality it is about overcoming various obstacles in your path by using careful precision. Keeping your finger on the acceleration key will make it far more likely that you will crash in a spectacular fashion unless you are really skilled at the game. You can crash as many times as you like and still get a bronze medal as long as you cross the finish line but to unlock more levels to play you will need to go for gold or at least silver. The fewer times you crash and the quicker you get to the finish line, the bigger your reward will be. Aside from medals you will also be rewarded with cold hard cash which you can use to customize your rider and the bikes in your garage.You will automatically unlock new bikes the further you get into the game and they all have different ways of handling. Some may be heavier and slower while others will be fast and very prone to flip over if not careful. Handling aside, each bike you unlock is a straight upgrade to the one you were using meaning that you are unlikely to use those bikes ever again. There is one bike called the Micro Donkey that is unlocked by completing any track without crashing or leaning though for the life of me I could not accomplish this so I have no clue as to how the bike is. Customizing your bike and rider is solely for aesthetic reasons and has no effect on gameplay. You can color each part of your bike individually, making it look like you painted your bike with whatever spray paint you could find in the dumpsters if you so desire. As for different parts there are very little to choose from so most bikes will look the same minus their colors. Same goes for the rider, not much clothes to pick from though you can color him however you please.Starting off you may be wondering which of the two games you should start off with but it doesn't really matter as you will have to constantly switch between the two as they are tied into each other. Whatever medals you earn in either will count toward your total to unlocking newer, harder tracks so you will have to play through both game's easy tracks in order to unlock medium difficulty ones. You can use the same bikes, same rider and the gameplay is exactly the same so it is very seamless, making it feel like one giant game. With the combination of two already decently sized games you will have a ton of content in this edition of the game. Trails HD no longer has its original soundtrack unfortunately and instead shares Evolution's soundtrack for some reason. Evolution also has a setback in that its DLC is not available for the PC which is really unfortunate since they were very fun. This version is by no means awful but I would suggest getting them on the Xbox 360 if that option is available to you.Port quality of this title is solid, ran well and I've experienced no glitches or crashes. Most people's issues seem to be with the added Uplay DRM. It runs far smoother than the 360 version especially when there are lots of explosions going on, which is a large portion of the time. It being a 2.5D game means that the explosions going off in the background can't harm you and are there to look cool. You can only move to the left and right of the screen though when you are sent hurling off your bike after a crash you can fly face first into objects that can't normally be interacted with. It is a small unimportant detail but it never gets old sending your poor rider spiraling off the course and directly into some explosives. There is no gore or blood, he will just ragdoll into objects while occasionally letting off a very goofy scream. Trials does not take itself seriously at all and it is always tongue in cheek about things such as the descriptions for the levels that are often times references to movies or other forms of entertainment. It is goofy, it has respawn points littered seemingly every couple of feet and you can respawn as often as you want but Trials is by no means easy. It may start off as seemingly easy and boring but it will quickly kick off the training wheels, leaving you to fend for yourself as it giggles making you slowly drive your way over a row of highly explosive barrels. These insane, nonsensical things it puts you through is a huge part of its charm and in no time you will be riding through a WW2 battlefield, a floating island full of giant stone golems and a haunted castle to name only a few. You never know what to expect next since the theme of each level varies so greatly and so does the level design. Even after you think you have mastered the levels near the end of the game you will be able to earn a 4th platinum medal which require 0 faults and little time wasted. They are by no means necessary as by the time you unlock the ability to earn them you will have already unlocked all the levels, they are just there to add replay value and earn bragging rights.After reaching the extreme difficulty tracks I'm just happy to get through a track and couldn't believe when I managed to get a silver medal on an extreme track even if I have played Trials since 2009. A neat feature incorporated into the game is the ability to view other player’s replays to see exactly how they got on the leaderboard and learn a few tricks from them. The community can even use the built in level editor to upload their created levels which are often time as good or better than the professionally made ones. It is a pretty powerful editor and I have seen the game turned into a First Person Shooter which was pretty mind blowing but honestly not that fun. There is tons of user created content to go through however the PC version has their own community that is separate from the Xbox version. That is really unfortunate since the Xbox version has been out much longer and has some amazing user created levels. Nonetheless what is here is typically pretty good and you will not be running low on tracks to play anytime soon.Aside from your typical tracks you can play through a variety of “Skill Games” which massively change up the core gameplay with crazy ideas such as attaching a rocket booster to your bike, riding on ski gear or flying a UFO. They are very creative and a ton of fun to play through a few times though they lose their appeal quickly. If you are low on medals they can be a lifesaver since they are usually easier to get gold on and there are a ton of skill games to swift through. The other mode is a simple tournament that has you riding through a gauntlet of tracks in order to gain some medals. Each track has their own leader-boards where you can compete against friends and strangers as well as a feature where you can upload your playthrough of the level directly to Youtube. There is just so much content to the game that you'll likely be playing it for a long time if the gameplay is to your liking. A demo is available on the Steam store page which is rare for a PC game but much appreciated and allows you to see if this is your cup of tea before buying. If you have the option of buying these games on the Xbox 360 I would suggest getting them there as Trials HD would feature its original soundtrack and Trails Evolution has some really cool exclusive DLC for it. If not, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is still jam packed with content and is a very unique, addicting game that everyone should give a shot.			"

												I like this game. It's fun. But I can't play it.I can look past the frame rate bugs, I can get over the fact that you have to use UPlay, I can live with the occasional error or crash. But the last few times I've launched the game, I can't even access ""Track Central,"" where you will download user-created tracks. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen. So the only part of the game I can play is the single-player developer-created tracks, all of which I have already completed. This would be an absolutely fantastic game if it worked. But there's too many problems that all combine to create a steaming pile of terribly-ported, poorly-optimized, broken, buggy, frustrating donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I used to play Trials evolution on the Xbox 360, when I still did that, and it was one of the few games I really properly missed when I moved to PC.  When it came up on steam, with all of the levels from Trials HD, which I had never played, I immediately wanted it.  After owning it for quite some time now, I'm still thoroughly impressed.  Great game to just pick up whenever, play through one or two really hard levels until you kickass at them, and then stop.Surprisingly complex for a motorbike game.9.2/10			"

												Before Trials Fusion comes Trials Evolution: Gold Edition.This is a really good game with 2 new campaign maps and many new tracks to try out. Customize your riders clothes, bikes. and choose the colors!Do brand new crazy stunts and challenge yourself in multiplayer local or online and play competively against people around the world.This game wasn't as good as I'd thought it be because you can only be a male rider, and the campagin story also felt allot shorter than in Trials Fusion, but the game itself is still really good and challenging to playI think they did a much better job with Trials Fusion but this game was more dirt tracks and trials Fusion was more futuristc tracks. I don't know...I think it's just as good as fusion, it's just the male rider and shorter campaign that let down abit...really exciting game though and the skill games were really hilarious what they came up with lol! There's allot more customizations in Evolution with the rider outfits and also the bike customization parts. Let's just say, there's allot more you can do in Evo than in Trials, it's just a good game as Fusion. Thumbs up ^^The leanings so much better too, it's much easier to land your bike and do stunts and wheelies.10/10Game Rating: PG (Mild Violence)Catagory: Racing			"

												I owned this game on 360 back when it was released on a $10 multipack disk and it only had about 1/3 of the content of this version. It was one of the best party games ever so I picked this up when it was on sale for $7.50. One of the best Steam purchases I've made. Practice makes perfect in physics based games like this and the satisfaction when you finally get a Gold or Platinum on Hard or Extreme is unrivaled. The graphics and levels are fantastic and the skill games are very fun. It is a hard game to put down once you start playing. You really need a controller for this....actually two because you'll most likely break at least one joystick while trying not to faceplant.			"

												At one time this was the Mario Maker of 2D driving games, except you could do practically anything with the level creator.Learning the driving physics is a ton of fun if you're up for the challenge.The level diversity is great and they are plentiful since both HD and Evolution tracks from the previous games are included.A good party game because it supports single screen multiplayer.Vsync can cause heavy stuttering if your fps drops under 60, and without it the screen tearing can be very visible. This shouldn't be a problem with better GPUs, but if you can take the tearing even weaker graphics solutions should be able to run this very nicely.This game has no story; you have to dig the driving to get motivated.The soundtrack is average.

												This game is very fun and full of rage. This is one of those games where you will only have fun if you are good at it. I am ok at this game but I still have fun on it. By the time of writing this review I have only created one track using the editor. Once you get used to how making a track works it will get easier the more you make. Some of the maps can be very long (15 minutes) and some can be very short (30 seconds.) If you ever get bored with the main places then you can go download player made maps. There are a ton of them and you will not get bored playing them. If you rage very easily I do NOT recommend this game but, if you have patience and is not easily enraged then I do recommend this game.Also, there are very little graphics settings. You can not change the textures, models etc. If your computer is pretty decent then you should get it but if your computer isn't good then the lag will kill you.			"

												Trials Evolution on the Xbox 360 is my favorite video game of all time. I am ranked around 6000th on the overall leaderboard, and have devoted over 4 days of my time to getting platinum on every track in the game.This PC port, however, is severely lacking. If you haven't used it before, the UPlay interface is atrocious, and its pitiful that Ubisoft requires their 3rd party software for all their games. The menu navigation is clearly designed for controllers, as sometimes you click things, but other times you are required to use the arrow keys (not WASD, arrow keys only) to navigate the menus and then hit enter to select. To be frank, if you are not playing with a controller with analog triggers, you are not playing the game correctly, but for those who don't have them they should be able to navigate menus effectively with a mouse.Do NOT buy this game if you do not meet the RECOMMENDED requirements (if you have any doubts, give the demo a try). As a 360 port, this game was built to run on certain hardware, and if you don't have the hardware, it will perform VERY poorly. For some reason, the game engine is tied to a 60 fps framerate, and if you dip below that (believe me, if you don't meet the recommended requirements you will not reach 60 fps) the game suffers from severe stuttering, rendering it unplayable for some. With limited graphical settings to mess with, this isn't a problem you can fix, and it doesn't seem to be a problem Ubisoft or RedLynx is willing to address.If you meet the recommended requirements, you should absolutely buy this game. It is a perfect blend of developed gameplay with great arcadey elements with great online leaderboard integration. The multiplayer has some problems, but the mere fact that they let you play user-generated tracks with your friends makes up for it as far as I am concerned. A robust track creator will keep the hardcore fans content for years to come. Its a shame that this version is bogged down by poor controls, UPlay, and a general laziness in porting the game engine.			"

												    If you love games that are challenging with a hint of technique then you should like trials.     Also mind you the music is incredible I recommend buying this game it is worth the price.    Best thing about this game the challenge seems to never run out and you find yourself playing hours of this incredible game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do -scryptedblade38			"

												Trials was one of my favorite games on the xbox so when I saw this I had to get it. Additionally, it comes with all the maps and such from the xbox version too so its like 2 in 1.However I'm very tempted to not recommend it becuase of Uplay and the PoS it is as well as leaderboards having a decent amount cheaters or if they (Ubisoft) even bother with them.

												If you played the XBOX versions of the game, you already know what you're in for. If you waited for this as long as I did, then it's everything you hoped it'd be. Higher resolution textures and gaming specific to the PC version (it's in beta, so it's not perfect yet), and MORE than 30 FPS (I know, right? ""Wowww!"" you're thinking, I totally get that) make it instantly better, in my opinion. It's crazy, extremely crazy side-scroll racing fun. And you can play it with 3 other friends or go up against randoms in various race mode types. If you've waited for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ XBOX exclusivity of this game to expire, well... get this damn game, because it has. I can't recommend it enough if you're looking for actual fun instead of the boring, day-in-day-out FPS games flooding the market. You won't regret this. It may be a Ubisoft game, and some may be put off by that, but it's really a good purchase. No regrets here.			"

												Trials Evolution Gold Review:       If you have ever used a flash game site, chances are you would have played Trial Bike at least once. Trial Bike was the game that was fun to fail at just to see those amusing ragdoll physics. Besides that, it consisted of the player attempting to get their rider across a two dimensional course. Trials Evolution is merely an extension of this experience, but in a much more polished and intriguing format.        There are two modes; career, as well as online and local multiplayer, all of which have a level of depth that was not realized in the free yet fun to play Trial Bike. Career mode sees your rider climb the tiers of your motorcycle licencing system by running test courses for D, C, B, and A class licences respectively. After you complete a licence, you get to participate in a series of tracks that will test the skills you’ve learned while progressing through your licences. These tracks range from beautiful back country vistas to more classic settings like warehouses and construction sites, each are beautiful in their own way. The game has just built on the foundation that its predecessor has laid, not losing its identity along the way. The level of fun you will have while playing Trials evolution are doubled from Trial Bike, with the inclusion of stellar graphics, a fitting heavy alternative rock sound track, and a deep level of rider and bike customisation. You can also play player modded tracks that can often offer a higher level of challenge. Another thing that is charming in its own way is the way that your rider will shout “YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!” and exclaims in other ways that’ll put a smile on your face while you pull off big airs and flips.	Trials Evolution Gold Edition on the pc is a dream both visually and in terms of playability. Keyboard and gamepad work perfectly, and it’s likely that you’ll be maxing out all the graphical bells and whistles while maintaining at least sixty frames per second on a decent rig. While playing split screen multiplayer one player can use keyboard controls while the other uses the gamepad. If you have two gamepads then both players can use them.         Trials Evolution Gold provides a unique driving experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the world of videogames, provides a tremendous amount of good old fun and is a beautiful thing to look at. I urge you to pick this up on Steam or Uplay at full price or if there’s a sale going on even better. Even if you’re not into motorsport in the slightest you will not regret buying this for the hours of fun you’ll receive out of it.10/10Also note that sometime early in the second quarter of 2014 (April 24th) the sequel will be released: Trials Fusion, which promises more of the same but with upgraded visuals I hope, and a whole slew of new tracks set in various settings not featured in this installment such as deserts snow peaked mountains and what looks like futuristic cities. You can pre-order it now if you know you want it.			"

												My favorite XBox 360 game, now on the PC. It has some technical issues, but I still love it. It is the very definition of ""Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master"". I recommend an Xbox controller and of course, a reasonably powerful PC. My 1.5 year-old PC (Intel i5 2500K) with a 3.5 year-old graphics card (GeForce GTX 260) handles high detail settings pretty well. I haven't played it nearly as many hours as shown. Leaving up the useless ""Uplay"" counts as running the game, and I've done that overnight a couple of times.			"

												I'm never usually one to moan about console 'ports' (not that real 'ports' exist anymore of course), but this is utterly dire. Doesn't show track times of anyone in my friends list for whatever reason, when I know 6 other people on steam who play the game. Framerates are aweful, leading to very choppy gameplay. I could only fix this by playing in 800 x 600, but even then the experience was nowhere near as fluid as it should have been. If you have an Xbox 360, shell out the extra couple of quid and get it for that, its an ultimately more rewarding and fun experience. The game itself is fantastic and it seems a shame I have to be so negative about it, but I really am totally unimpressed with this title.			"

												Short and crappy review here, but this game is easily a 5/5 for me. It's very easy to get into, and ramps the difficulty up very smoothly, eventually to maddening difficult degree, for those who want the extra challenge. The difficulty *will* eventually break your back, but there'll be a lot of insanely enjoyable and creative content before that happens.I very-highly recommend Trials Evolution because of its deceptively-simple mechanics, but great amount of technical depth for those who can muster it.

												Trials... Trials is one of the older racer platformers but i gotta say if does it very well indeed. In this game you need skill and you`ll need to cross that finish line but hell, does it fell good when you do. You can also costomize maps, create your own and try out other peoples maps and if had a few that are VERY fun. Then alsoyou can costomize your character, race long enough get pionts and unlock amazing things like TE:GE wallpaper to even a space suit. Then as a bonus, you get multiplayer 1v3 for a total of 4 players compete with or against your friends show off your ride and even get user created content on there race bmx`s to anywhere your mind takes you. This was a game worth my money... I`m sure it`ll be worth yours. Hope this helped. Good luck...			"

												Trials Evolution Gold Edition, a fun addictive platform puzzler which is all about bikes.Trials Evo is a great platformer game, with the gold edition you get to play tracks from Trials HD which was released quite a few years back on XBLA.As for the game itself it is really fun, challanging and its something to waste time on.The PC port of this is much much better than what people have been claiming, the game runs perfectly as of the current update; I have a rather modest rig and I've not had a single stutter yet.My only major gripe with this game is that it uses uPlay alongside with steam.Having a game use 2 DRMs is pretty annoying but it doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.Back to the Gold edition content,The Trials HD levels (Or at least the first 20 or so) are insanely easy now due to the trials evo bikes.Now I'm not going to say that they were hard in Trials HD but it was a more of a challange due to the slow speed of the Trial HD bikes.All that aside, if you're looking for a cheap racing puzzle platformer then this is a damn good candidate.8.5/10 Would recommend			"

												This is an amazingly fun, addictive, and frustrating game that will test your patience again and again if you want to compete for the high leaderboard positions. However, this is a game ported badly from the Xbox that also runs through UPlay. Fortunately, I rarely come across problems but I'm definitely not a part of a comfortably large majority. There are a lot of people who experience tons of bugs that shouldn't be present in a game that's been on sale for this long now. Overall I'm recommending this game because I've had so much fun with it and I think you should give it a try if you like the concept of the game. That said, if you have an Xbox 360 go ahead just buy it on the there instead, because you'll have a much smoother experience and there are different map packs you can buy which add a lot of variety to the tracks currently on offer (If you want to try the HD maps available on Trials Gold on xbox too, you can download Trials HD). If you buy it on PC just be aware you might possibly run into bugs frequently, and if that's something that will ruin your experience, I'd say you probably shouldn't buy this despite my recommendation.

												Been waiting a while for this game to drop. Glad it finally did.First off I've had 0 problems both the install, and using Uplay for this game. I've heard some things about it running poorly or the Uplay service isn't good. Uplay has updated their platform and its not bad at all.This game is just fun to relax and play listening to your own music. Controls are great. You gotta be precise to execute some of the goofy drops well on a  bike. It also has some fun multiplayer options. But the true goal of this game as anyone who has it knows!!!! Trying to get ""Gold medals"" for every track. For 5 dollars you really can't go wrong.			"

												The game is awesome. As reflected by the metascore. Quite enjoyable.What sucks is being forced to sign up for a service just to play a game. Uplay. I didn't know what it was before purchasing this game. If I had realized I had to sign up for a service just to play this game I wouldn't have bought it. I don't care about Uplay. I'm not interested in Uplay, but I have to sign up with them or I just threw my money away. Now I have yet another service that wants to send me spam mail, and force feed me advertisements for other games I might be interested in buying from them. I know some people won't be bothered by this and may even think I'm making too big of a deal out of it. But I remember when you just bought a game and played it without having to give your personal info away. Ahh, the good old days.Well you got me Uplay. I""m too cheap to just write off the money I have already given you. Thanks for forcing yourself into my personal space.			"

												One of the best tilty bike games out there. Runs great on my mid range computer. Tons of missions to complete, plenty of controller-throwing-rage-inducing moments. The real reason I'm leaving this review is because of the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about UPlay. UPlay is a digital distribution and digital rights management platform. Exactly the same as Steam. Here are my idling stats: Steam spawns about 5 helper processes. The two big ones use 100-150 Mb of RAM each. The main Steam client constatly hogs 1-20% of my CPU. Nothing ridiculous, but it's there. UPlay runs at 0% CPU, no matter what I'm running. It also uses about 90 Mb. For it's backup processes (3 of them), they each use about 30-50 MB of Ram, with no CPU drain. So addressing the comments about it's intrusiveness and instantly-♥♥♥♥-up-everything quality - what? Another completely neutral point about UPlay - it's a DRM client, just like Steam. Unless you *only* get your games from Steam (if you are, stop), you realize how common it is for websites to sell keys that don't link to Steam. Hell I have several AAA titles that are on UPlay, not Steam. It won't stop me from getting games for pennies on the dollar.EDIT: Check this♥♥♥♥♥♥out  http://imgur.com/BFmphPS  - ain't the first time either.			"

												Trials looks simple, but it's pretty dificult if you want to truly master it. Getting only Gold medals is going to take you a long, long time. The goal of Trials is to get your motorbike to the other side of the track as fast as possible and, if possible, without falling. The tracks are 2.5D, so it's all 3D but you'll be riding in one direction. Like I said, it looks simple, and it starts off simple, but gets hard really fast and certain tracks will take you hours, maybe even days, to master.The tracks, by the way, look awesome and are cleverly made. The game in general looks pretty sweet, but it does suffer from the occasional FPS drops, without good reason. Messy, but forgivable.Restarting a checkpoint or track is pretty much instant, which is important for a game like this. You'll keep playing and playing until you won that one bike or finished that one tournament. It's really addictive. In a good sort of way.I'd gladly recommend Trials. It's a game anyone can enjoy, even if it's for just a few tracks.[Rating: 85/100]			"

												Despite the fact that Trials Evolution requires UPlay and despite the fact that UPlay desides to disconnect and basically do whatever the hell it wants except for running smoothly, Trials Evolution manages to be that shot of Nu Metal Broski dirt bike racing that we all know and love.  The controls are tight, the tracks are hard and it makes for good old fashioned hand cramping fun on the game pad.  If you like the original Trials, this is more of the same except shinier, HD-er and with more creative tracks.  Plus, if you were a big fan of the original, all of those tracks are in here too, re-done and upgraded for you to swear at all over again.

												People say Dark Souls is like the video game version of being bullied.  The people who love that game still ragequit on trials.  There's nothing to jump out from the shadows, nothing that is going to stab you in the back.  The only surprises in the game get you once, and from then on, it's your fault.  This game has tight controls, diversity, infinitely challenging replay on so many levels.  Playing this game inspires hate from the moment you hear the music, and everything you love about this game drives you up the wall.  The more you play, the better you get, and the worse you do.  You will hate your life, and you will likely consider suicide, but this game is worth it.  It is so gratifying once you get it right.  EVERYTHING in this game fills you with rage, and inspires high blood pressure, increased heartbeat, and compulsive cursing.  The 'restart' button will be your most pressed; it will be your best friend, and your worst enemy.  You will cry.  You will scream.  You will uninstall in anger.  You will reinstall and torture yourself over and over to try and just barely scrape past your own limits.  You will love it, sigh in relief, and feel so gratified that you know it's worth it.  This game will ruin you, and you will rise from the ashes of your former self, only to burn away again and again.			"

												Personally, I have been a fan of Trials since its Miniclip flash game days. I was addicted to Trials HD on the Xbox Live Arcade when it released in 2009. The game felt like it was meant to be played on a controller, since you like you had more control over your bike. It made me sad when I saw that Trials Evolution was only coming to the XBL once again since I jumped to the PC platform at that point, and I was tempted to buy it regardless of minimal play time on Xbox since I enjoyed Trials HD so much. I am SO glad that I waited to buy it, because you are getting two games for the price of once! This version includes the tracks from Trials HD as well as the fresh ones (though they haven't added the DLC tracks from Trials HD.) I tried playing the game with the keyboard, and it just didn't feel right since I played Trials HD on X360. If you like racing games, then definitely pick this game up. It's a blast to play with friends, and has a really awesome track creator.			"

												As of January 2014 - Unless you want to risk a terrible experience, get the game on XBOX 360 instead.I am a fan of Trials HD and Evolution on my friends XBox 360 saw the game was coming to steam and was excited to play both games on my PC sadly it is a terrible port that does  not appear to have been optimized for many computer types.Whilst a few people are reporting no issues with the game more and more people are experiencing severe lag, stutters and freezing as well as random crashes with no errors, at all resolutions and video setting configurations. This game is based alll around timing and precision so when these factors are broken to begin with it is nigh impossible to play and extremely aggravating.The game also uses a clunky uPlay DRM launcher, not a massive issue for me, but yet another stepping stone unfortunately.Before buying do a search on the forums and discussions to see if there have been any fixes for the game yet as currently it is in an unplayable state for many.

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Trials Evolution: Gold Edition haphazardly proves good level design and gameplay are paramount.Let's get some important stuff out of the way first:This game is H.A.R.D. and challenges can get repetitive/frustrating as you explore the limits of your ability. If you're a completionist trying to get Gold medals (or better) on every challenge, you will be brought to actual tears.The Uplay client is horrible in practice and is unavoidably required to play the game. This isn't a Uplay review so I'll keep this short, I would highly encourage disabling Cloud Sync in the Uplay client to ensure your saves aren't being mucked around with. I lost an entire day's worth of progress and had to re-do a dozen or so of the more difficult challenges because of syncronization issues I experienced (Jan 2014). Luckily I had a semi-recent backup of my save stored locally.Once you get past that, you'll find Trials Evolution is worth it where it matters - it's fun. How fun? Pooh rolling around in a tub full of honey. It isn't without issues, but the overall experience is cerebral. There's a level of maneuverability that becomes essential for success - a symbiotic relationship that grows between you, your bike, and rider as you fail over and over again. It's figuring out what needs to be done to get through a tricky section, and actually being able to do it consistently.There are moments:Flying through the air on a dirt bike at full speed, gliding smoothly over a ramp to accelerate at just the right speed, narrowly avoiding instant death by eeking out one final backflip just before landing on the other side of a gap otherwise insurmountable. Climbing up nearly vertical walls, and hopping across elevated platforms above a pit with no floor from a stopped position. Loop-de-looping into (and out of) a loop-de-loop of loop-de-loops.It's magic, and what makes Trials Evolution worth every minute of agonizing failure.A couple of final notes:Some of the menus are confusing and don't always behave as expected. I was disappointed by the lack of an option to restore my bike's colours to factory defaults for instance. Other things like customizing your bike's individual parts appear inaccesible if you're playing with a controller (you can use a mouse to click on parts displaying a wrench icon to access these sub-menus). In a sense it doesn't feel like the project was fully presented as a product for PC users but rather a quick port.Part and parcel with the above point, setting up a multiplayer game doesn't need to be this silly. Not only are you navigating in-game menus, you're also fumbling between overlays!Texture pop-in is as bad in this game as it was for Halo 2 (xbox) at launch. Just about every stage suffers from it (especially at the start of races) in addition to the occasional slowdown. Pretend the slowdown is (intentional) dramatic presentation and you're golden.The music is in your face and obnoxious: Who commissioned a rap about how badass playing a game about dirt biking is? Some might like it but I turned the music volume almost completely down after about 9 hours of play time - my brain just couldn't take it anymore.The developers appear to be fairly open to patching the game so hopefully some of the kinks are worked out in due course.Bottomline: I'm in no position to tell you how to spend your money, but if I'm coming over and you've got Trials Evolution, I'm playing.

												I bought this game on accident before I noticed the Ubisoft logo.Once again they've taken beautiful artistic software that a team of hard working developers no doubt poured their imaginations into, and done an absolutely terrible job of optimizing it for PC. Truth be told I am completely against purchasing Ubisoft games specifically for this reason. I am on an Alienware M14xR2. I can run Metro 2033 on max graphics with decent framerate or process the insanely dynamic physics of Max Payne 3 with no slowdown. But I can't roll a motorcycle across a one mile patch of dirt without lagging down to 20FPS through the majority of the track? Ubisoft should be inspected for their lack of interest in the quality of their product. Their games should not be shelved until they are properly tested and implemented for the pleasure of the many many consumers who hand over their money for unplayable games. Having said that, I'd give this game a 9/10 IF Ubisoft released a patch that fixed the absolutely abysmal framerate			"

												As of January 2014 - Unless you want to risk a terrible experience, get the game on XBOX 360 instead.I am a fan of Trials HD and Evolution on my friends XBox 360 saw the game was coming to steam and was excited to play both games on my PC sadly it is a terrible port that does  not appear to have been optimized for many computer types.Whilst a few people are reporting no issues with the game more and more people are experiencing severe lag, stutters and freezing as well as random crashes with no errors, at all resolutions and video setting configurations. This game is based alll around timing and precision so when these factors are broken to begin with it is nigh impossible to play and extremely aggravating.The game also uses a clunky uPlay DRM launcher, not a massive issue for me, but yet another stepping stone unfortunately.Before buying do a search on the forums and discussions to see if there have been any fixes for the game yet as currently it is in an unplayable state for many.

												DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE UPLAY. And really, does _anyone_ like that crap?It's what I get for not reading reviews and assuming it would be as awesome as the console version. Uplay BS is completely incompatable with Big Picture mode. It pops up a login window behind Big Picture that you can't get to without a keyboard. You _have_ to create a Uplay account. I will not do that for this one stupid game. I have Steam to manage my games. I don't need another buggy service. I loved the game on Xbox360 but this is unplayable for me. I wish I could get my money back for this garbage.			"

												Personally, I have been a fan of Trials since its Miniclip flash game days. I was addicted to Trials HD on the Xbox Live Arcade when it released in 2009. The game felt like it was meant to be played on a controller, since you like you had more control over your bike. It made me sad when I saw that Trials Evolution was only coming to the XBL once again since I jumped to the PC platform at that point, and I was tempted to buy it regardless of minimal play time on Xbox since I enjoyed Trials HD so much. I am SO glad that I waited to buy it, because you are getting two games for the price of once! This version includes the tracks from Trials HD as well as the fresh ones (though they haven't added the DLC tracks from Trials HD.) I tried playing the game with the keyboard, and it just didn't feel right since I played Trials HD on X360. If you like racing games, then definitely pick this game up. It's a blast to play with friends, and has a really awesome track creator.			"

												游戏体验很棒，赛道很有创意，游戏视角不可调节刚开始不太习惯，但是时间长了也就无所谓了。技巧上面的东西似乎有所弱化，选择不同的摩托有时候效果是天壤之别，并不是性能越好的摩托就一定适合。不过优化上面似乎有点问题，室外和室内有显著差别，某些场景很卡。排行榜功能的弱化非常遗憾，Second Edition的时候排行榜很重要，可以以个人名义，也可以以国家名义，还可以组队以团队名义上排行榜，那个时候，什么金银铜牌根本没有，只有时间才是最重要的，而现在得到金牌似乎成了大多数人的目标，因为游戏就是这样，你不主动想看，是看不到排行榜的。。。			"

The truth is that the only reason they're that high is so that you can brute force it. NewsFlash Ubisoft, no console port should have higher hardware demands than that of the console it was ported from. oh and Btw ""Advanced Effects"" is not something a good PC port has as a video option. The track sharing feature is so slow it's unusable. Avoid this game like the plague but atleast the plague is free. It's not hard to understand why this game is called ""Trials""			"

												FANTASTIC game. Loved Trials HD on XBLA, so I was stoked to see the sequel which I had never played (PLUS the original Trials HD content), make it's way to Steam in this nice bundled package. Smooth interface, VERY fast load times from startup to loading levels; definitely a ""pickup-and-play"" game when you wanna kill 15 minutes or so. The physics are probably the best part, and add to the humor tremendously. And with the level builder built-in, there is a strong community of user made levels that you can download for endless replayability and challenge. And yes, even the multiplayer via Internet works great. Highly recommend this.			"

												10/10 game, excellent, fun and enjoyable for all ages. Only one problem, UBISOFT. Somehow manages to ruin the entire game. Many examples:-Ubisoft runs in the background even after closing the game, thus slowing down your computer-Ubisoft Manages to destroy he multiplayer, Cannot even join my friends due to ""NAT errors"" that i tryed to fix countless times. NAT is good on any other game i have ever played-Ubisoft Manages to ruin one of my favourite xbox 360 games-Basically this game summed up in one word; ""UBISOFT""Don't buy this game for PC, you are much better off buying it on xbox 360. If you don't own an xbox 360, still don't buy it for PC. The only thing the works on this game is the single player and track making. Multiplayer is completly 100% broken. Its so sad that such a good game gets ruined by a terrible company. GG UBISOFT G ♥♥♥♥ING G			"

												As fun as this game is, I hope you're not trying to figure out how to make a multiplayer. It's  like walking through the deserts of Asia witout any context clue of where to go. Everytime you THINK you get it, you're all happy. Then ""NOPE"" you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Overall, a good game with the thrilling bike trails, tracks customization, but stay away from those extreme tracks. They'll getr your blood pressure to the brink of which water cannot stay in the sink any longer. You just burst, which sets up some challenges which will make the game longer to last. Great game.

												Disclaimer:  Hundreds of hours played between HD and Evolution on Xbox 360.  I love the Trials series, and am a huge fan of this particular game... on Xbox.  You'd think the PC version would be better - especially since this series started on PC, right?  ... right?Wrong:  PC version of Evolution does not contain the DLC available for the XBLA version, nor is it available at all.  Including the tracks from HD was nice - but why leave the rest out?Ah, Ubisoft.  They'd sooner correct you on your interpretation of their carefully crafted misleading statements than actually address a consumer issue.  That's exactly what they've done here in the forums.  #effubisoftI bought this game on Steam because I wanted to replay one of my favorites, taking full advantage of the better hardware on my PC.  To some degree, that's what I got - the game (mostly) runs at 60 fps @ 1080p - which is great and all - but this version suffers from some real problems... and let's face it - this is Ubisoft we're talking about.  They have no intentions of fixing them.  The Problems:- Uplay (the creamy filling inside Satan's♥♥♥♥♥pimples)- Poor optimization: stuttering  (bad in a game of skill)- Graphical glitches: mainly all the sprites on screen flickering in unison (distracting in a game of skill)- Poor multiplayer functionality (some of the most fun I've had with T:E on Xbox is with multiplayer)- Social media integration that can't be turned off (some might see this as a plus, but I see it as Ubisoft listening too much to focus groups - if I wanted to do stuff like post my replays to youtube, I'd buy a bloody capture card - and nobody I know wants to see the facebook logo in between every match.)- As stated above, DLC was never released despite ""Gold Edition"" title and misleading statement about ""all"" content being included.  (As a developer pointed out, the statement was not technically inaccurate - but as many forum-goers have said, the statement is all too easy to misinterpret, especially given industry conventions.)- Uplay (Uplay)			"

Leaderboards are the key addiction to Trials, and considering how easy it was for me to get into the top 10 globally on one of the events (UFO), whilst my best run of the same event on the 360 puts me at about the 500-1000 mark, there's no real fun in it for PC. If you don't own a 360, then definately get it here though.			"

If you can play this superb game some other way DO IT because it will be easier. Dont be fooled this is a fun acade like game that is worth playing if you feel the need to go out of your way and set it up. If the Uplay accounts where not involved I full heartly recomend this to about anyone. I only have about six hours into this game where I came in expecting to put in over 200 hours because Uplay accounts are a pain to set up. It is in my opinion the best game in the franchise.			"

												This game doesn't even deserve to be on Steam. Now before you disagree let me explain...It isn't that the game itself is bad, it isn't. BUT THE GAME DOESN'T EVEN RUN ON STEAM! It runs on Uplay, another gaming hub made by ubisoft. Because of this, you have to create a seperate Uplay account and install Uplay to even get it up and running. After you get into the game, very few user made levels will load for you. The game itself is great though, so it's really a shame that it has so many issues outside of the actual gameplay. Sometimes, after crashing during a run, the game will say that you have a new personal record even if you have made it much further than that run. You could even crash on the starting line and get a record! This causes a ton of wait time as you have to wait for the new best time to process and save before restarting the level. The MAIN problem that I had was that even after exiting the game and completely closing Uplay, steam still said I was in game. This is a MAJOR issue. There was no way to take myself out of the game, and this made it impossible to play another game on steam or even close steam. Even going to the task manager and ending the application didn't work. Only restarting my computer finally took me out of the game and that simply cannot happen every time you want to play Trials. That's just a terrible port.			"

												So far I've tried for about 3 hours to get this game working through Uplay, which you need to use in order to play it, and have not managed to get it running. Uplay support has been everything but helpful and im most likely going to see if i can get this refunded through steam...			"

I install it, wish to play, have to sign up with the auto-installed UPlay from ubishit, can't remember my password that I made when I was twelve, contact Ubishit, get no reply for a month, contact again, go through password recovery, finally get to play, updates needed, thanks Ubishit, update, log into the game, terribly keyboard support, slow on a GTX 770, exit game, uninstall.

												DO NOT GET THIS GAME! At least not on the computer. It is horribly laggy, (I have a pretty good computer and have tried multiple fixes), Has horrible texture issues, and it is overall so bad it makes it impossible to enjoy the game. The game is great on Xbox, so get it there, and not here. The game also makes you get Uplay, Ubisoft's digital distributor. Uplay is the worst!. Trust me, you do not want to suffer like I did just to experience lag and texture issues. I was excited to play this game, but event though I got it on sale, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!			"

												GET THIS ON CONSOLES!!!Do not make the same mistake by buying this horribly ported piece of garbage on steam.First, it forces you to make a Uplay account, which is completely unnecessary.Second, My computer surpasses the specifications, but still the horrible framerate renders this game unplayable.I bought this game on sale thinking i would save some money. Instead I wasted five dollars.I own Trials HD on Xbox and I really enjoy it. I have no doubt that this is an amazing game, but the PC port is embarrasing.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.The reason I have 3 hours clocked on it is because I left it running by accident and then, 3 hours later, restarted my computer.

												This was a double dip for me as I originally played this on the 360. Fantastic game, but not on Steam. Forced Uplay which is absolute garbage and it doesn't run well at all on my machine, which isn't exactly low end. Texture popping, lag in the menus, framerate dropping way below 20 most of the time. Even on low settings this thing is awful. Terrible port, which is expected from Ubisoft. Learned my lesson, won't be buying Ubisoft again if I can help it.			"

												Steam really needs to be more informative about games that require third party user accounts. I doubt that anyone with a decently specced PC (or indeed many others) ever reads system requirements, where the information is hidden. It should be next to the ""add to cart"" button. Part of the Steam deal is that it is a no nonsense platform, and it is implicit in the purchase that you shouldn' have to deal with others in order to get what you paid for. That's why if this is not the case, we need to be told. VERY CLEARLY. Or better yet, kick out the distributors who insist on this rubbish. TL:DR; GAME REQUIRES 3RD PARTY ACCOUNT			"

												Admittably I've had a reasonable amount of fun with this game in the last couple of days, but I have two main problems with it.First of all, the controls are clumsy when you get a bit further in the game. They feel quite good at first, but after you've unlocked the most agile bike with the A license, you realize how clumsy the controls actually are. At least if you're playing with the keyboard, you can't gently shift your weight on the bike to one direction or the other. Just a slight tap on the left or right arrow will make your guy push as hard as he can on the foot rests, which will cause him to leap in the air with the light weight A license bike, completely messing up whatever you intended to do, like climb a steep hill. This makes it quite impossible to enjoy the more challenging stages. The stages honestly seem to be getting progressively cooler as the game goes on, but the clumsy controls ruin it. The 450cc bike will probably be the last one you'll have fun with.Secondly, it forcefully installs Uplay on your machine when you install the game.			"

												I bought the game for the full price, seeing as the Demo had been good on the Xbox.I should've just bought it on the Xbox instead. The game is literally Unplayable. Every time I try to launch the game, it says ""Installing Uplay"" and the screen goes away, after that, it SAYS i'm playing the game for 30 seconds, and then goes back to online mode in my friendslist, and I've never actually been in the game. Uplay is probably the problem here, and I would appreciate it if the devs would actually make the game playable, because spending this much money on a game is absurd.			"

												Great game, one of my favourites of all time, but it's much better on Xbox 360, as there are many more people who play on it. Leaderboards are the key addiction to Trials, and considering how easy it was for me to get into the top 10 globally on one of the events (UFO), whilst my best run of the same event on the 360 puts me at about the 500-1000 mark, there's no real fun in it for PC. If you don't own a 360, then definately get it here though.			"

												Finally Trials came to PC.Trials Evolution Gold Edition is a frustrating yet fun game. For those who have played Trials HD or other Trials in the past and enjoyed them, you get the same good fun from this Trials and more! The skill games are great and there are many more maps, but the real kicker is the giant amount user created maps. This makes the replayability insane.Trials is a hard game, it requires a lot of precision (only delivered by the controller). The game controls are precise, to the point you cannot blame the game for your failiure.This game is super fun. You move a motorcycle across the screen, but damn it grips you.			"

												great game plauge by terrible DRM. I've enjoyed playing trials since it was a little flash game on miniclips. I was eager to give this new game a try since it has been exclusive to the xbox. Overall it's a great game, the underlining mechanic is still solid and very enjoyable, the addition of the skill course where you do silly stuff and eaaily access user generated content makes this feel fresh. However, the included Uplay DRM is terrible, you have to make an account with Ubisoft, the game load it everytime you play and instead of steam achievements and cloudsave, Ubisoft decided to do it themselves. Most of the time the cloud save works but I've had instance where it didn't save my progress (only lost 1 or 2 track). Achivements are useless since no one see it and it burry in the terrible UI. The worst thing about Uplay though is the unresponsiveness of the server, the game attempt to save your score after everytrack and it can take anywhere from 5 to 30 s because it has to sync with the server, it basically killed the momentum of the game especially when you just want to jump right back in. User generated contents are awesome but it also very slow and laggy to browse and download. I have to sadly give this amazing game a no for recommendation. If Ubisoft come to their sense and get rid of the terrible Uplay this game is a must own.			"

Posted: January 12, 2014
												So I think I've played this game enough at this point to give an honest opinion.This game sucks.  Let's go through the reasons why.1.  The graphics - Okay so the graphics aren't terrible, the problem lies in the game engine.  You'll have to force your video card to run at full throttle if you have a modern graphics card.  For whatever reason this game will not trigger full utilization of my graphics cards.  Another huge problem is that textures pop in and out, from blurry to sharp.  Objects will pop as well.  This makes this game very irritating to play since you need to see the things in front of you in order to know how to approach the next jump.  This brings us to our next problem.2. The camera - I understand that this is a console port, and like every other crappy Ubi console port it suffers.  This was evidenced in the graphics and is also apparent in the view with which the game is presented in.  It's essentially like a 3D version of the NES classic Excitebike where the view is from the side.  However, the viewing angle is schewed a little more toward 70 - 80 degrees.  This is very annoying and does not allow you to complete many of the levels on the first attempt.  Granted the levels are divided into segments via checkpoints which you can ""reset"" to when you inevitably crash.  Which brings us to...3.  Level Design - Get ready for some of the most repetitive gameplay ever, with only very small variations on the gas / lean / jump theme.  Some levels have some humor to them, and at the end of every track your guy dies in assorted fashions, but the novelty wears off.  Some of the levels are just plain infuriating, having predetermind events that affect the layout of the course, often with varying results.  Speaking of varying results...4.  Physics - Or complete lack thereof.  I still can't figure out why your bike sometimes will act as if it has weight to it like a real motorcycle, yet other times its as if it is floating on a single point that refuses to stabilize.  For example, you can land a jump and your bike seems to be planted and you can give it gas and it responds as it should.  Another time you can land off that same jump and your bike is almost uncontrolable and just wants to flip backwards no matter how delicate you apply the gas.  It makes no sense and ruins the game very easily.5. - Controls - Quite possibly my biggest complaint with this game.  So you control the balance of the bike with gas, brake, and lunge/lean.  I say lunge/lean and not just lean because there is no way for you to gently lean your bike forward.  Any bit of input toward the right results in your rider thrusting his face over the handlebars.  Which interferes with blancing landings and climbing wills since this motion will pull your back wheel off the ground and usually results in an endo.6. - Uplay - Is a joke.  If you've ever had to use Uplay then you understand.  Whats the point of buying the game on Steam if we're forced to use Uplay?Save yourself some money and go find an old copy of Motorcross Madness.  That is a much more entertaining game and is over a decade old.  Oh and textures won't pop in and out...			"

Some levels have some humor to them, and at the end of every track your guy dies in assorted fashions, but the novelty wears off.  Some of the levels are just plain infuriating, having predetermind events that affect the layout of the course, often with varying results.  Speaking of varying results...4.  Physics - Or complete lack thereof.  I still can't figure out why your bike sometimes will act as if it has weight to it like a real motorcycle, yet other times its as if it is floating on a single point that refuses to stabilize.  For example, you can land a jump and your bike seems to be planted and you can give it gas and it responds as it should.  Another time you can land off that same jump and your bike is almost uncontrolable and just wants to flip backwards no matter how delicate you apply the gas.  It makes no sense and ruins the game very easily.5. - Controls - Quite possibly my biggest complaint with this game.  So you control the balance of the bike with gas, brake, and lunge/lean.  I say lunge/lean and not just lean because there is no way for you to gently lean your bike forward.  Any bit of input toward the right results in your rider thrusting his face over the handlebars.  Which interferes with blancing landings and climbing wills since this motion will pull your back wheel off the ground and usually results in an endo.6. - Uplay - Is a joke.  If you've ever had to use Uplay then you understand.  Whats the point of buying the game on Steam if we're forced to use Uplay?Save yourself some money and go find an old copy of Motorcross Madness.  That is a much more entertaining game and is over a decade old.  Oh and textures won't pop in and out...			"

												Trials is awesome.What keeps me coming back to this game is the skill curve. The game rewards becoming proficient with your bike, and getting that gold medal on a course you had previously struggled with feels amazing. And just as you think you're good at this game, you get to the next batch of tracks that knock you down a peg.That and the sick jumps.			"

												More of a physics puzzle game that happens to take place on a motorcycle than a motorcycle game, Trials Evolution offers an almost endless array of tracks and modes to enjoy. Leaderboards are well integrated and they are everywhere. It can be tough as nails, but if you finish a race after 100 tries, it's hard to top the euphoria.			"

												Trials Evolution is a side scrolling motorbike game. Think excitebike on steroids. The developers have done a great job fleshing out this simple idea with many challenging (and great looking) levels, unlockables, better bikes and outfits, multiplayer and internet leaderboards!Each level challenges you with getting a gold medal, which usually involves a good time with no accidents. Restarts are very quick for those of you who get frustrated or realise early in a level that you aren't on track for a gold. The levels themselves are around 30 seconds each and are perfect bite sized morsels of entertainment.Highly recommended.			"

												I can recommend this game purely on the basis that you will be playing it with friends. Other than playing with people you know, I cannot see any incentive to play this game. The biggest problem is probably that it's a relatively bad port considering the way it works. I can understand when GTA IV doesn't play well because it's very CPU intensive, but when Trials Evolution, a game that is played ENTIRELY in stages with relatively small environments lags on my laptop that will plays Crysis 2 on Ultra at 40fps, it can be kind of concerning. It doesn't lag on my rig at home, but the lag is only one of the problems. Playing without friends can become EXTREMELY frustrating, some of the tracks are INCREDIBLY hard, and while you can't really knock a game for being difficult, there is a certain point in which challenging simply turns to frustrating. Gameplay wise it's very fun until you find a map that's almost entirely broken, like the one where they swap your bike with skies while you try to ski down dirt and concrete and wood, and the physics on this map are completely broken. Why is a game like this so inconsistent? I don't know, the game just seems to be good when it could be AMAZING.			"

The game offers many many hours of entertainment and it has a steep learning curve for the hardcore players.The game, like so many others, excel in conjunction with friends. The internal rivalry and competition for the best times and medals makes this game ideal for LAN or inbetween class entertainment.Due to the nature of the game, you are able to pick it up, play for 5 minutes and be happy, or play for hours.Challenge: 9/10Graphics and audio: 8/10 - this is not very relevant though.Fun factor: 9/10 "

												God this game is garbage. First, the good. The game's concept is fantastic, the visuals are serviceable, and the game would be fantastically fun and hilarious IF. Now let's get the bad:* Extremely unstable. The most unstable experience I've ever had. Crashes dozens of times a day, even if you turn off Uplay settings and play on lowest quality. Compatibility mode doesn't help. (I use Windows 10 and an i7-6700 but no dedicated GPU.) The shadows can completely break too and won't be fixed until you restart the game. Almost 100% of crashes happen inside menus; so if you give even half a damn, look into that, somebody.* The button layout and UI combination is abysmal. The gas button is used heavily in menuing and you are constantly doing things you didn't mean to do and didn't know you could do because of the terrible buttons.* The difficulty is so badly understood by the game that no matter what difficulty the game says the challenge is, it's a total crapshoot as to how difficult it actually is. In fact, getting gold in some events is nearly impossible, and the tournaments are so difficult that the lack of a ""restart whole tournament"" button is astounding. I'd bet a ton of money very little testing was done to see how difficult these challenges would be and what menu options would help lower the frustration. On top of this, your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed medals are based on how FAST you beat the challenges. That's so stupid it hurts. If you don't know what's wrong with that, then you clearly haven't played this game. People want to be rewarded for the clever thinking that will allow them to FINISH the course with minimal to no crashes, and maybe be rewarded for how many flips they can do because of the focus on bike stability. It doesn't even reward you for saving yourself from a crash. Where's the love for creativity?! That's what this game is all about!! People do NOT want to be rewarded for how fast they can make it to the end. That would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed stupid! So basically, you're punished for creativity, and you're also punished for not being absolutely perfect, in the way THEY wanted you to be perfect. What the hell?!* The game can have a 320 x 200 resolution, but it maxes at 1366 x 720p. What. Why?! It's an Xbox 360 to PC port, dumbasses! Could you even put the SLIGHTEST effort into this port?! I have to lower the resolution of my 1080p monitor just to play well, because this game is too unforgiving to play on a tiny window. There is also no borderless mode.* This game is cynical to its audience as all hell. It uses the universally-hated and pointless DRM software Uplay, and there are TONS of problems with Uplay. Game activation, Steam syncing, stability, you name it. This game also has some of the worst, most cynical and untalented theme songs I've ever heard, custom written for this game. It's rap about the game from some obnoxious-sounding, talentless hack, and it has god-awful lyrics. It matters to me because it shows how badly the developers thought of their audience-- or at the least the cynical cheesiness of ""let's try to be hip for the kids!"". . .I want to love this game, but this game doesn't love me. It hates me. It feels rushed, it hates creative solutions to the courses, and it's so unstable and poorly maintained that I can barely believe it.Ubisoft, I don't want a refund. I want a patch. A big one. F**king fix this game. Or make yet another Trials game-- this time with high stability, 1080p, windowed and borderless modes, intuitive frustration-free menuing, no microtransactions (I'll accept DLC though), and a much bigger score for flips, saves, and crashless runs than for speed. I'll even f**king accept Uplay and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music if you get all these other things right. Peace.			"

												Trials Evolution looked like a good game and since it was on sale I decided to buy it. Unfortunately not only does it use Uplay which is annoying for anyone who hates third parties and account that need to be created. But Trials Evolution developers have decided that the graphics card that millions of people like myself use are ""inferior"" and if we have that graphics card we can not play. The graphics card I talk of is intel which is a popular brand and is perfectly fine running other games I own. If you do use Intel graphics card do not get this game because it will resemble being on LSD. A stupid choice by the developers that means everyone in my situation that has bought the game is unable to fix the problem without spending an insane amount of money on a new graphic card.

Regardless of if you can tollerate uplay or not uplay is a plague, uplay ruins gaming experiance and uplay takes advantage of Steam. Either stick to uplay or rely on Steams DRM. uplay games on Steam are going to be the death of Steam.If you can overlook or tollerate uplay restricting your access to your games constantly thehn this is great buy.

												This game is almost unplayable due to the lag and general choppiness of the graphics. I have an i7 3630QM, 8GB of RAM, and two GeForce GT650M's and this game is still painful to play. I'm sure it's not an issue if you have three GTX Titans, but I feel very sorry for anyone who bought this and doesn't have dedicated graphics.			"

												Uplay has made this game literally unplayable after some time for me. Everytime I log in to play it makes me enter the code given to me when I bought. But everytime I enter the code it says it is already taken. Also, the times where it actually has worked, the game is woefully unoptimized and I struggle to run it with an intel i5 2400, 16 gb ram and a radeon 270x. I really wanted to like this game. Just watch videos about it on youtube instead of wasting money on this.			"

												This may be a negative review, but it is because the specs on my laptop do not work at all with this game. I have an Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics card on my system, and it works relatively well with most games, but with this game specifically everything goes out of wack. All the textures glitch, the game stutters like mad, and it is an overall unenjoyable experience. The game should run well on a better system, and I would love to be able to actually play this game without the lag and texture problems. If you have a mediocre system, then I would highly reconsider buying this game.If you are suffering with my graphics card, then I would definitely reconsider buying this game.			"

												What a major, utter dissapointment. Was waiting to acquire this game for quite a while cause I loved the first one and it's such a mess, performance wise. It's complete garbage, hot garbage! It's obviously a non-optimized console port, from the Xbox 360 era, you can clearly notice it from the first slideshow of a playthrough. I can play all kinds of games old and new, and this game plays like crap. If this was some sort of turn-based game, well... performance wouldn't be really much an issue but being a Trials game it requires precision, fluidity and smooth framerates at all times and all of that is missing. Plus it's ridden with u-caca, that p.o.s. DRM platform by Ubisoft, it's even more intrusive and bothersome here than it is in the acceptable and enjoyable Driver: San Francisco game, for whatever reason.I recommend to skip this game and instead just get Trials 2: Second Edition, it's still fun and plays really well. Go for it when on sale!			"

												Great game, one of my favourites of all time, but it's much better on Xbox 360, as there are many more people who play on it. Leaderboards are the key addiction to Trials, and considering how easy it was for me to get into the top 10 globally on one of the events (UFO), whilst my best run of the same event on the 360 puts me at about the 500-1000 mark, there's no real fun in it for PC. If you don't own a 360, then definately get it here though.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicingBut seriously, I love this game! :D "

The rider does not return to center when the joystick returns to center, instead choosing to lean forward or backward depending on the last input.

Ubisoft Shanghai ruined this game. I hate to recommend a console version of ANYTHING over the PC versioN (except perhaps games like Skate or Fight Night) but you're better off getting it for the 360 or xbox one or whatever. As a result of all this horribleness, the player-created maps are complete garbage for the most part because nobody has the time to muddle through this backwards console-to-pc port that's lacking all the best placeable objects. And anyone who gets really deep into creating a complex level? They'll probably uninstall the game once they see how slow their framerate is upon the first time they test it. Trials Evolution is one of the best games ever made. Period. Go get it for console instead. If you love the trials series, do yourself a favor and skip this one on PC.			"

												I didn't mind UPlay, but then I took a BEX to the knee (a thousand times in a row).For some weeks, thanks to UPlay I could successfully launch this about one of twenty attempts.Pretty unjolly console port with frame rate issues and other weirdnesses.Some nuances of the control scheme bother me far more than in previous Trials games. I'm not a fan of this one, and Trials Fusion seems much worse still.Rating: DON'T BUY THIS "

												Lesson learned about reading the reviews before buying a game.  it installs a DRM and demands an account creation to play this thing.  I would have gladly paid $20 for a pile of dogshit but this game doesnt even come CLOSE to the high standards that dogshit demands.  Its like playing excitebike while on a bad acid trip.  I'd rather play excitebike to be honest.  ____________________DO NOT BUY THIS GAME___________________			"

												Starts off nice and easy and slowly ramps up until it's ridiculously hard. One of those games where you just want to have one more go and end up sitting there playing for hours. The only thing to be aware of is the quality of the PC port. It's not great. Some people don't seem to have any problems and some people have issues with the framerate dropping really badly. I'd say if you're prepared to knock the graphics down if you're one of the unlucky ones then I definitely recommend this game.			"

Thankful that I bought it during the Black Friday sale.Be warned, it requires registration and login to Ubisoft's Uplay network, which is intensely annoying.			"

												so i've waited some time to review this, i played it for probably around 80 hours on console, it's a lovely game and i love it for being so easy-to-go-at and incredibly hard to control at the same time, it may have something to do with that im not used to play it on my computer, but that is not really the probably as it wasn't made for computer to begin with! if they made it a little more pc-friendly, that would be great!star-example: the icharus factor needs you to gently push the RB button, how is that for a pc-gamer? :/only level i know that has the problem though. apart from that this game is perfect!

												Well, that was dissapointing. Kinda. Not really. Well. Anyways, it's dissapointing, but only as a port. Ignoring the lie that is ""Gold Edition"" you have probably THE best racing game ever. No, really. This game is a Redlynx game, so it's harder than titanium and is really less about racing and more about platforming with a bike. The environments are varied and DANG are they beautiful. There's also a really good multiplayer mode that leads to hilarious fun. The game will take a while to complete, even longer to get gold on all tracks, and if you want to 100% it then give up if you're impatient. It cranks up the difficulty 10X from the first game (yes that is possible) and allows for much easier track sharing, so you can have almost impossible tracks to play that probably took 7 years straight to make. But god, are they beautiful. In fact, the only problem I can find is that it's really CPU intensive. Now, as a port..... well. The options are good, but for a ""Gold Edition"" it lacks the expected DLC and there is no compatibility with the 360 Track Central. However, you do get the entirety of the original first game, which is actually a really nice touch, but honestly the original game wasn't exactly expensive, so having the DLC come with the gold edition and having 360 compatability would have been pretty nice. Anyways, I would give it a buy, and then buy a stress ball or 2... thousand.9/10			"

												I love Trials games. My first was Trials 2: Second Edition back in like 2008. I got the demo, played the crap out of it, and bought the game. Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and I bought it as soon as it did. This game is AMAZING. The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are great, the rider customization is fun, the tracks are awesome; it is, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. I have all the Trials games available on Steam, and this one is by far the best.			"

												Had loads of fun playing it, loving the simple but fun gameplay! Also really liked the small easter eggs as well as the map creator and the online mode, though I primarly played the singleplayer mode. However I had some technical issues with this game. The graphics were pretty messed up, all the textures were wrong and buggy. Though my graphics card was good enough for the game, I blame it on my laptop :D Then I can only recommend using an Xbox controller or similar. For most of the time, I only had mouse and keyboard, which made it a whole lot harder, at least in my opinion. 8.5/10			"

												Trials Evolution is a game that will make you very frustrated, but it will also leave you with a feeling of accomplishment if you have the drive and determination. There are a few bikes that you can unlike that each have different stats. The faster ones are a lot harder to control, but are necessary because the harder  levels have bigger jumps that need that specific bike. This game all in all is a great, fun, and frustrating game to play, that will test your abilities. "

												I'm really glad that Ubisoft gave Redlynx the greenlight to port this game to the PC. I played it on a friends 360 and got hooked, and when I looked for the PC version it didn't exist! so I'm glad this finally made its way to PC. And it's not only Evolution but also the previous console title Trials HD so it's basically 2 games in one. The Multiplayer is pretty cool, very well worth the release price tag! The onlything that would make this game perfect would have been steamworks integration but since it's ultimately a Ubisoft title it uses uPlay which is really not that bad.			"

												It's ♥♥♥♥ing Trials. It's got a crazy editor that you can do crazy stuff with, character customization, realtime multiplayer, loads of single player tracks and leaderboards among other things. Plus you get all the content from Trials HD as well.Now as for the beta, it's got some pretty terrible preformance and some button prompts still have the 360 controller buttons (you can still use a keyboard on them however) but that♥♥♥♥♥♥s easy to fix and i'm sure will get fixed when it's released.Plus if you are playing without a controller you are doing it wrongThe tracks aren't multiplatform, so we are gonna have to wait for some gems to come up sadly. Can't go hop on the crazy tracks Rooster Teeth does just yet.I would go as far to say it's the LittleBigPlanet of 360 and PC. Until LBP comes to PC that is.I would ♥♥♥♥ing kill for LBP for PC.			"

												I haven't played this game that much, but I think I'm in a position to give an honest and trustworthy review.The singleplayer is fantastic, it has loads of cool tracks and tons of replay value. This mode is worth the game alone in my opinion. Not only that, but there are ton of user made tracks that will keep you coming back to this game.The multiplayer...well...can't say a whole lot about it. Everytime I try to matchmake no one is online. I guess thats understandable since Evo is an older game in the franchise. However, I'm sure this game would be a blast to play with a couple of friends.Lastly, I feel like I should address Uplay. I had a little bit of trouble getting it to work my first time playing, but after that it worked flawlessly. In all honesty, I have no idea why everybody hates the game because of Uplay. I never felt like I was having less fun because of it.I would recommend this game to anyone in search of an awesome game to play. "

Not only are the tracks beautiful and the gameplay addictive, it comes bridled with a full-fledged level editor and awesome online multiplayer. Do yourself a favor: get this gameP.S.

												Why I'm refunding - Windows 10""Multi-colored texture glitch"" ""Missing texture glitch""""Corrupted texture glitch"" I've tried rolling back drivers, tried verifying game files, tried uninstalling reinstalling, tried different monitor connections (VGA/DVI/HDMI), tried windowed mode vs full screen mode, tried messing with settings, tried contacting uplay (LOL!), tried running as admin, and... I tried launch commands that reduce the graphical quality. Nothing worked... what else can I try? I'd love to play this game but the graphical glitch makes it unplayable. It's happened on almost all the maps (every map if you include the glitch on the bike itself) I've played so far and it's on all the bikes I've played so far, so I'm assuming it will happen throughout the entire game. I will not continue to play and hurt my chances of a refund just to find out for sure if the glitch will continue or not. Here is an imgur library of what the glitch looks like and where it happens. http://imgur.com/a/Ms2C5^click/copy n paste the link above The computers I've tried this on are as follows. 280x83208GB 1866 Tried on SSD and HDDsecond computer is i7-860 7850 6GB 1333 HDDBoth computers have w10, and the glitch is present on both computers.

WARNING: Ubisoft forces you to install 'Uplay'(Ubisoft game client) on your computer in order to play this game. The version pushed by steam currently(13/11/2015) is buggy and the game wouldn't launch. Instead of spending Friday after work playing the game I bought on Steam, I had to contend myself to finding fixes for uPlay on forums. After all of this, they have the gall to advertise you other games(which have nothing to do with this one) within uPlay before letting you play.I guess it's easier to create worthless software and force it on everyone, than it is to create VALUE that people will come looking for themselves. If I wanted uPlay installed on my computer, I would install it myself.The developpers did a great job on the game if you like the genre, I just can't stand scummy behavior by publishers so that's why it gets thumbs down.

												Fun game, and bloody addictive when tying to achive gold on all levels. However, the money recieved after each event seems trivial as it can only be used to buy clothing to customise your rider. Also, the game seems to take a long time to load up when first started. However, after that its pretty smooth.All in all, its a solid game. I bought it in the steam sale for just over £3. Saying that thoug, I couldnt see myself paying much more than that as it feels more like a stop gap game for killing time, rather than something I would want to really invest time in.6.5/10  (would have been a 7 if not for the stupid load time at the start)			"

												I bought the PC prequel to this game, Trials 2, in a Steam sale years ago and it was one of the most dangerous purchases I have ever made. It is in my nature to get addicted to incredibly hard and frustrating skill games and it is one of the best. I have very little bad to say about that game.The sequel moved to 360, which was really sad and upsetting that they ditched the fan base that supported them. After a few years, they announced the return to PC which was good news! It uses Uplay which is fine but I would prefer that it didn't. I would prefer full integration with Steam friends.Then it arrived. I started playing it. I got addicted again. I was 100% most of the game. I hated the game but couldn't stop playing it. Most of this came down to the horrible bugginess of the game. It would have huge FPS drops and jitter. The black and white level is almost unplayable. In a game that requires accurate timing, the bugs required me to mess up over and over again. The replays were also useless and didn't work properly.I will move away from the bugs to the actual gameplay.I much prefer playing on keyboard. Some of the harder levels with really steep inclines clearly were more designed for a controller but are possible with keyboard after pain staking trial and error.The dynamic camera in the game is frustrating, I much preferred Trials 2 static side on camera. In this game, it is common to have blind jumps that you have to memorize.The one level that is 18 minutes long (If I remember rightly), is horrible. I don't like having to repeat a level that long.Otherwise, this game is amazing. The level designs are great. Controls feel satisfying. 100% this game is incredibly hard and equally satisfying and I did get very addicted.I will say I do recommend this game but it is a gamble with the bugs. If you have an older graphics card, I imagine the gamble is higher.			"

												A very challanging and fun game. The PC version has some problems that needs to be solved, but it is still one heck of a game.With endless maps made by the comunity with the same tools that the developers had gives players endless of fun.I would like to stress that this game gets very... VERY challanging when you get to the difficulty after the last difficulty, AKA Ninja Difficulty. Only the fact that this difficulty was created by the players says a great deal once you've tried your luck on the extreme difficulty. So if you're after an easy and forgiving game, I'd skip this one.It's really tailored for the gamer that doesn't mind practicing a truely skill based game with new player created content coming out by the hour.

												Trials Evolution. Christ this is a ton of fun. If you enjoy racing games, hearty fun, and a brutal challenge, Trials dominates the competition. It captures the ""easy-to-learn, hard-to-master"" aspect so well, that it becomes something more than a racing game: It becomes a glorious timesink. You'll find yourself saying ""I missed the gold by THAT much... I'll just give it another run.""It drives you to try and get gold everytime, and the further in you go, the harder it gets. It has a good amount of customization for your biker and is enough to keep you trying to get more items for your bike and rider. The only downside, of course, is the need for Uplay. It seems tacked on, and just adds a bunch of time between loading and playing the game. Other than that, it's a great buy. If it is on sale, it is a must-buy.			"

This Isn't Really a ReviewBecause this game is amazing, the mini-games are hit and miss but the game itself is absolutely amazing, one of my favorite games. I only wish it was longer, had more bikes and had more customization.I'm not going to go into how much of a fan I am of this series or how I've put hundreds of hours into each game simply to just keep this short and sane since I'm a bit of a blabber mouth.But basically, this game has a ton of performance issues, it feels really good sometimes, solid 60FPS then.....BAM, the FPS is all over the place and the game feels choppy and delays your moves and it stutters between smooth and choppy and it will completely throw you off and cause your demise 90% of the time. I have a pretty decent system and I'll put the specs near the bottom for people interested but I should not be getting these kinds of problems with a PC this decent, one I can play GTA V with much smoother.The game is good, the physics are top notch, the controls are solid and that's what I play this game for but it all gets thrown out the window with the performance issues. The game can even play perfectly fine but the second you restart the match, bam, stuttering or choppy FPS, and sometimes even in an area with nothing happening the game can be choppy but in areas with♥♥♥♥♥♥blowing up and buildings falling the FPS is rock solid. It seems to be CPU dependant as changing the video options doesn't do much of anything.UPlay is a non-problem for me, never has been a problem, some people just have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck, or in this case, a lot of people have terrible luck but from the very get go since that hell spawn's birth, never had issues with UPlay in any Ubi title I own, just had problems with the games. Stating this since some people seem to hate on UPlay for no reason but to hate on it and 50% of the reviews are talking about it.Why do I recommend this game if it has performance issues? Because it's a REALLY good game, one I come back to all the time owning the games on Xbox 360 and PC and I know it's probably just my dumb luck the game is programmed poorly for my CPU even though others have the same problems. The 360 version is sadly smoother albeit at a lower FPS. Even if I lock this game at 30FPS, it still stutters and gets choppy. But amazing game, especially if they could solve this problem for the people it's affecting.SpecsCPU: FX-4100 OC'd @ 4.5GHzRAM: 16GB DDR3 1600MHz Corsair VengeanceGPU: Gigabyte R9 270 2GB 975MHz Core, 1400MHz MemoryPSU: 850W Thermaltake Gold CertifiedOS: Windows 7 Pro x64 SP1HDD's: A few 1TB 7200RPM drives ranging from Seagate to WD.

												A very good game to play when you are looking to take a break from shooters. There is no other game out there (or atleast done this good) in this genre, and Trials just also happened to hit the nail on the head. The physics doesn't make it seem like your floating about space, and the graphics are just good enough so that they don't detract from the gameplay. However, this game is not completely flawless. Trials, which was originally made for the Xbox Live Arcade, really works well on Xbox with the analog sticks, but not so much on PC. At times, the arrow controls seem a bit unresponsive, and brings out the other big issue; rage. It's not the developers fault, however, but I am just warning you that there will be some form of rage once you get to the harder tracks. Overall, it is a good game though, and I would recommend this game.			"

												I haven't played this game that much, but I think I'm in a position to give an honest and trustworthy review.The singleplayer is fantastic, it has loads of cool tracks and tons of replay value. This mode is worth the game alone in my opinion. Not only that, but there are ton of user made tracks that will keep you coming back to this game.The multiplayer...well...can't say a whole lot about it. Everytime I try to matchmake no one is online. I guess thats understandable since Evo is an older game in the franchise. However, I'm sure this game would be a blast to play with a couple of friends.Lastly, I feel like I should address Uplay. I had a little bit of trouble getting it to work my first time playing, but after that it worked flawlessly. In all honesty, I have no idea why everybody hates the game because of Uplay. I never felt like I was having less fun because of it.I would recommend this game to anyone in search of an awesome game to play. "

												2.5D dirt bike time trial challenges; think a much more modern Excitebikeish deal, or a much more sophisticated Happy Wheels. Kind of poor difficulty escalation quickly turns from casual fun to extremely challenging, but it's still pretty fun for the most part.  Looks great, but is very badly optimized. Has five unlockable bikes, but the fourth is a barely controllable sidegrade and the fifth is literally a joke. Driver and bike customization are okay, and give you color editors. Uses an online service called Uplay, which makes you sign up for another frickin' account somewhere, has a bizarre multiplayer interface, and is apparently prone to forgetting your accomplishments. Casual multiplayer with a friend is good fun without sweating the results much, though. Plenty of slapstick humor with your post-race, and sometimes mid-race, ragdoll, and some non-dirt-bike jackass events thrown in for good measure. So, mostly a good time, sometimes an infuriating time, with some noticable flaws and subpar computer efficiency, but overall, pretty okay.			"

												Great little game. Balancing two wheels on planks and trashcans while backflipping off bridges has never been so damn fun. Only real downsides are the requirements of a high-end PC to run it without a slow and stuttering framerate and having to make do with Ubisoft's aggressive U-Play system. Like why the ♥♥♥♥ does it even exist? JUST LEMME PLAY IT FERCHRIST'SSAKE!Still recommend it.			"

												Fun game, you can spend a lot of time on it. Good for killing time, too. Only problem is the harder levels are just that; hard! There feels like there isn't that many levels but that's where the custom user created content comes in. The character customisation is quite good when it comes to colours but there is a lack of clothing items.The game has to run through BOTH Uplay and Steam so that sucks having to run both but it's not the worst thing in the world as you unlock Uplay points which can allow you to unlock extra in game content but that content is kind of poor.I tried getting on multiplayer but it ended up taking forever so I didn't bother so I unfortunately can't review that.Downside to the game: The soundtrack is literally the most repetitive and annoying thing I have ever heard. Just turn it off and blast your own tunes. Unfortunately you have to listen to some a**hole screaming at you when you first load up the game but that eventually stops at the main menu.Overall, the game is great. It goes on sale often enough on Steam and all the other websites so just wait and grab it on sale. If you're one of those annoying people who get their panties in a twist because you have to run it through Uplay as well as Steam just get over it, seriously. Uplay earns you points to unlock that extra game content so it aint so bad!			"

												Starts off nice and easy and slowly ramps up until it's ridiculously hard. One of those games where you just want to have one more go and end up sitting there playing for hours. The only thing to be aware of is the quality of the PC port. It's not great. Some people don't seem to have any problems and some people have issues with the framerate dropping really badly. I'd say if you're prepared to knock the graphics down if you're one of the unlucky ones then I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Just bought this game on winter sale, should have checked the Steam forums for the red flags. The game is unplayable due to constant stutters at a consistent interval, they even persist within the UI. I can knock the settings to 640x480 windowed and all effects disabled and the same framerate and stutters exist. I repeat the framerate is unchanged from 1080p AA advanced effects to 640x480 windowed! The quality of this console port is unbelievable! All I want is a refund but Steams policy is clear no refunds are issued. Thanks alot Ubisoft/Steam for still offering this game in a highly popular flash sale while it's unplayable and obviously without the support of the developers Red Lynx. Worst part is it was like this from beta to full release and all patches ignored the problem and all devs gloss over the issue even though the fans called them out. I uploaded a video to show, its much worse In realtime and it creates even worse input lag. Watch the in-game clock to see the freezing.

Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is definitely in my top 5 motorbike/cycle/ATV right now. It is the second installment of the original game known as Trials HD. This Gold Edition Is definitely worth the pricetag and is usually offered with a sale. If your into tough challenging games, then the hardcore tracks is where the game can become somewhat unforgiving at times, but still very fun. Although the online play seems to be nonexistant, It still holds up 8/10 "

												Well, that was dissapointing. Kinda. Not really. Well. Anyways, it's dissapointing, but only as a port. Ignoring the lie that is ""Gold Edition"" you have probably THE best racing game ever. No, really. This game is a Redlynx game, so it's harder than titanium and is really less about racing and more about platforming with a bike. The environments are varied and DANG are they beautiful. There's also a really good multiplayer mode that leads to hilarious fun. The game will take a while to complete, even longer to get gold on all tracks, and if you want to 100% it then give up if you're impatient. It cranks up the difficulty 10X from the first game (yes that is possible) and allows for much easier track sharing, so you can have almost impossible tracks to play that probably took 7 years straight to make. But god, are they beautiful. In fact, the only problem I can find is that it's really CPU intensive. Now, as a port..... well. The options are good, but for a ""Gold Edition"" it lacks the expected DLC and there is no compatibility with the 360 Track Central. However, you do get the entirety of the original first game, which is actually a really nice touch, but honestly the original game wasn't exactly expensive, so having the DLC come with the gold edition and having 360 compatability would have been pretty nice. Anyways, I would give it a buy, and then buy a stress ball or 2... thousand.9/10			"

												READ THIS TO GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF TRIALS EVOLUTION! As everyone says, this is way better than ""Trials Fusion"", I can give pros about Trials evolution in so many perspectives and ways! For example.......-You can really feel the weight of the bike once you lean back and fourth, and I really like that realism!!EVEN LITTLE THINGS MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, SUCH AS......-The layout of the main screen and the missions selection.ALSO HOW MUCH CONTENT IS IN A GAME, SUCH AS........- Trials Evolution has over 100 challenges and carrer missions (that i know of) to play.AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE FEATURES THAT COME WITH THE GAME, SUCH AS.........- Multiplayer - Best Experience, Played with others- Track Editor - You can customize a world to your likings, AND SHARE IT!- Indoor AND Outdoor Environments - For the most realism in a 2D bike game :P- Bike AND Rider Customizations - (Again) Customize your character AND your bike to your likings- Global Competition - Compet with others' (ghost AND global scores on the Maps you play)AND A KEY FEATURE NOT REPRESENTED IN THE ""Key Features""......- You can - Replay AND Upload - EVERYTHING what happened before you died on a certain map. (Included in Multiplay AND Singleplayer)In Conclusion: Trials evolution is the game for you, IF all these have reached your expectations, or just buy it, its only $19.99. Not like your wasting money.			"

												This is such a great game. It's fun and challenging. The problem is, that it is an absolutely horrible port. The controls are definitely not for PC. If you wish to play this game, and not get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of at the controls all the time, then play with an Xbox controller. Another gigantic problem, is that Uplay is integrated. Uplay sucks major♥♥♥♥♥ It causes the game to take forever to connect to the community, and it just plain sucks. This is a fun game, but it's a horrible port, and Uplay integration sucks.			"

												You really need an Xbox 360 controller to play this game but is well worth the asking price if you have one. Perfect difficulty curve, great implentation of leaderboards and friends' times and razor sharp controls lead to a real 'just one more go' experience. Also includes a great track editor to lose even more hours in. On the negative side Uplay is a bit of a pain, the frame rate very occasionally drops and the multiplayer tends to reward speed over finesse which is in contrast to the single-player mode. These are tiny gripes though and I can't recommend this game enough to any one with a pulse.			"

												so i've waited some time to review this, i played it for probably around 80 hours on console, it's a lovely game and i love it for being so easy-to-go-at and incredibly hard to control at the same time, it may have something to do with that im not used to play it on my computer, but that is not really the probably as it wasn't made for computer to begin with! if they made it a little more pc-friendly, that would be great!star-example: the icharus factor needs you to gently push the RB button, how is that for a pc-gamer? :/only level i know that has the problem though. apart from that this game is perfect!

												TE:GE is a pretty good game if you enjoy MX (dirt bike) games. Years ago I bought both Trials HD and Trials Evolution on XBLA and loved them; so after my X360 decided to do its own thing I bought them again on Steam in one handy package: this Gold Edition! Even before Trials, I had played some free dirt bike games like Action Supercross and Elastomania that play the same as this but with old graphics etc. so I knew this would be right up my alley.I don't ride a dirtbike myself but have gone to a few competitions that my friends were racing in and this game seems legit with regards to how the bikes would act in real life. Plus, unlike real life, you get to stack it at the finish! Hilarious!If you thrash a track and want to brag to your friends about it, there's a built-in YouTube uploader that goes up to 1280x720.REQUIRES UPLAY! BE WARNED!			"

Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and I bought it as soon as it did. This game is AMAZING. The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are great, the rider customization is fun, the tracks are awesome; it is, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. I have all the Trials games available on Steam, and this one is by far the best.			"

												This is a pretty fun game. Good physics for a classic 2D motorcycle game, like all the flash ones. Good feel and enviorment too. I have fun with this game.But obviously Uplay is terrible. After every run, the game has to save, but it saves to Uplay, so it takes forever to save (like 10 seconds), and there's a billion menus between runs, so you just end up smashing enter 50 times before the next one comes up. Multiplayer does not work, so don't even try it. the Uplay servers are broken or something, and it's always been like that.   I still recommend this game to those that can deal with some of the BS.

												Why I'm refunding - Windows 10""Multi-colored texture glitch"" ""Missing texture glitch""""Corrupted texture glitch"" I've tried rolling back drivers, tried verifying game files, tried uninstalling reinstalling, tried different monitor connections (VGA/DVI/HDMI), tried windowed mode vs full screen mode, tried messing with settings, tried contacting uplay (LOL!), tried running as admin, and... I tried launch commands that reduce the graphical quality. Nothing worked... what else can I try? I'd love to play this game but the graphical glitch makes it unplayable. It's happened on almost all the maps (every map if you include the glitch on the bike itself) I've played so far and it's on all the bikes I've played so far, so I'm assuming it will happen throughout the entire game. I will not continue to play and hurt my chances of a refund just to find out for sure if the glitch will continue or not. Here is an imgur library of what the glitch looks like and where it happens. http://imgur.com/a/Ms2C5^click/copy n paste the link above The computers I've tried this on are as follows. 280x83208GB 1866 Tried on SSD and HDDsecond computer is i7-860 7850 6GB 1333 HDDBoth computers have w10, and the glitch is present on both computers.

												If you like games that are physics and momemntum based you'll like this one.  Subtle inputs make big changes; so you always think you can do better than you did that last time, even if you just laid down your best time. I highly recommend a controller for this game, I used a 360 controller and it worked great.			"

												A very challanging and fun game. The PC version has some problems that needs to be solved, but it is still one heck of a game.With endless maps made by the comunity with the same tools that the developers had gives players endless of fun.I would like to stress that this game gets very... VERY challanging when you get to the difficulty after the last difficulty, AKA Ninja Difficulty. Only the fact that this difficulty was created by the players says a great deal once you've tried your luck on the extreme difficulty. So if you're after an easy and forgiving game, I'd skip this one.It's really tailored for the gamer that doesn't mind practicing a truely skill based game with new player created content coming out by the hour.

WARNING: Ubisoft forces you to install 'Uplay'(Ubisoft game client) on your computer in order to play this game. The version pushed by steam currently(13/11/2015) is buggy and the game wouldn't launch. Instead of spending Friday after work playing the game I bought on Steam, I had to contend myself to finding fixes for uPlay on forums. After all of this, they have the gall to advertise you other games(which have nothing to do with this one) within uPlay before letting you play.I guess it's easier to create worthless software and force it on everyone, than it is to create VALUE that people will come looking for themselves. If I wanted uPlay installed on my computer, I would install it myself.The developpers did a great job on the game if you like the genre, I just can't stand scummy behavior by publishers so that's why it gets thumbs down.

												I'm really glad that Ubisoft gave Redlynx the greenlight to port this game to the PC. I played it on a friends 360 and got hooked, and when I looked for the PC version it didn't exist! so I'm glad this finally made its way to PC. And it's not only Evolution but also the previous console title Trials HD so it's basically 2 games in one. The Multiplayer is pretty cool, very well worth the release price tag! The onlything that would make this game perfect would have been steamworks integration but since it's ultimately a Ubisoft title it uses uPlay which is really not that bad.			"

												READ THIS TO GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF TRIALS EVOLUTION! As everyone says, this is way better than ""Trials Fusion"", I can give pros about Trials evolution in so many perspectives and ways! For example.......-You can really feel the weight of the bike once you lean back and fourth, and I really like that realism!!EVEN LITTLE THINGS MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, SUCH AS......-The layout of the main screen and the missions selection.ALSO HOW MUCH CONTENT IS IN A GAME, SUCH AS........- Trials Evolution has over 100 challenges and carrer missions (that i know of) to play.AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE FEATURES THAT COME WITH THE GAME, SUCH AS.........- Multiplayer - Best Experience, Played with others- Track Editor - You can customize a world to your likings, AND SHARE IT!- Indoor AND Outdoor Environments - For the most realism in a 2D bike game :P- Bike AND Rider Customizations - (Again) Customize your character AND your bike to your likings- Global Competition - Compet with others' (ghost AND global scores on the Maps you play)AND A KEY FEATURE NOT REPRESENTED IN THE ""Key Features""......- You can - Replay AND Upload - EVERYTHING what happened before you died on a certain map. (Included in Multiplay AND Singleplayer)In Conclusion: Trials evolution is the game for you, IF all these have reached your expectations, or just buy it, its only $19.99. Not like your wasting money.			"

												This game is rad, from the very easy courses of the beggining to almost impossible ones, it´s pure jaw dropping gaming.The controls are very simple, you can play with one hand using only directional arrows.. but don´t think it will be easy. Sometimes in the hard courses you will be stuck to an obstacle that seems impossible to pass, and this can be a little frustrating.. but if you have the proper skills you can easily beat it.The gameplay is very pleasing, you will improve everytime you play and after a while you can get insane skills and incredible control of the bike.. even so, you never get to the perfection. This awesome game is a must and i recommend to anyone.			"

												I love everything about this game, except the micro stuttering frame rate problems even when greatly exceeding the reccomended system requirements. It's totally unacceptable for a side scroller with graphics comparable to something from 2005 & no AI. They reccomend hardware that can run games like Crysis 2 maxed with no trouble & yet with a Q6700, 8GB RAM & a 2 GB R9 270 OC I get micro stuts all over the place. This game requires a lot of focus, precision & finesse in a lot of places & having an issue like that is horrible. It's even worse when they make claims that it was optimized for PC.  Also, I recently tried viewing other player's runs like you could do in Trials 2 SE & something is buggy as ♥♥♥♥ with that as well. The runs that load are not the right ones. I load the top run for the track (fastest time, 0 faults) & what plays is something where the rider crashes early in the run & then it loops that over & over? :s WTF? I highly recommend the game because it's a winning idea but we should all ♥♥♥♥♥ at Noobisoft for cluttering it up with their stupid UPlay crap & ♥♥♥♥♥ at Red Lynx for the unacceptable bugs. Trials Fusion is even worse. Higher requirements, less sophisticated graphics IMO.			"

												This game is a bit of a 50/50 for me. It's a really fun game and I love playing it, however I feel like the level curve is a bit strange.The easy and medium levels are really easy, I'm not that good of a trials player and I have all golds on both maps on the easy and medium difficulties.The hards and above are extremely difficult. On the main map, I have 100% on easy and medium and 33% on hard, literally bronzes across the board. It's not like I'm not playing the levels, I just have trouble getting decent times/death counts.This is especially a problem in my mind because I feel like those in-between levels are the best, and I have the most fun with those, but there are very few levels that fit in that category.Overall fun game, but might get frustrating past the easys. 7/10			"

												This game is amazing, but before you get it, here's why you should wait:The game is played through Uplay, so you have to download Uplay when you download Trials. Uplay is EXTREMELY BUGGY and in some cases won't work at all, and if Uplay doesn't work, neither will Trials. They ARE working to fix it, but I don't think it will be any time soon.Next, Trails is a poorly ported Xbox360 game, so they are STILL doing bug fixes. Even on the highest end computers it will have a jitter effect, because the game is locked on 60 fps (Which is good if it's on a console, not if it's on a computer.) They ARE working on a fix, but I doubt it will work the first try so it will be a while before they get it sorted out, if at all. For me, the jitter effect is small enough that the game is playable, but it still annoys me.Here's why you SHOULD buy it:The game is amazing, the graphics are great for such a simple game, and the customization in the game is astounding. The game can be a lot of things, it's not just a motorcycle game, there are plenty of options to choose from. The online gameplay is really smooth, and connection problems don't seem to be an issue from what I've seen. Singleplayer has tons of gameplay put into it, and it does have a level of difficulty, but not enough to leave you stuck. It makes sure you are putting some effort into it, though, which is very nice for a game. It certaintly isn't a waste of money, and I'm sure it will be expanded on and improved, especially with bug fixes and whatnot.			"

												First of all this game has some serious issues for some users. I've not had any of these problems and as such will still recommend this game. My personal favourite 'pick up and play' game. Trials can be so much fun and yet so frustrating all at the same time. 'Just one more go' seems to be the go-to reaction when failing to reach the platinum times. Great experience, 8.5/10.			"

												Bought this game after playing it on my Xbox. Read the reviews and heard it was through uPlay, I didn't really care. After it downloads, I go to open it, an it starts. But everytime I go to the first mission (License D Test) It just crashes. It say's uPlay crashes, or the game just stopped working. Disappointed I can't even play the game. So until the problem is fixed, I can't recommend it.EDIT: Had some updates after a while and now the game works without a problem.			"

												This Game is asinine. It will not function unless you roll back your graphics drivers firstly. When you get to the ski level it really makes all the work you put into making the game simply ""run"" Worthless.  all enjoyment is gone and you want to punch the nearest glass object. There is no consistency with the physics on ski's. Idk if i will finish this game since making my system able to run it kills functionality of most my other fav games.Uplay/Steam Flubbed up hard. Of course all this is IMHO. Buy and play, please have more luck then me.			"

												I haven't played this game that much, but I think I'm in a position to give an honest and trustworthy review.The singleplayer is fantastic, it has loads of cool tracks and tons of replay value. This mode is worth the game alone in my opinion. Not only that, but there are ton of user made tracks that will keep you coming back to this game.The multiplayer...well...can't say a whole lot about it. Everytime I try to matchmake no one is online. I guess thats understandable since Evo is an older game in the franchise. However, I'm sure this game would be a blast to play with a couple of friends.Lastly, I feel like I should address Uplay. I had a little bit of trouble getting it to work my first time playing, but after that it worked flawlessly. In all honesty, I have no idea why everybody hates the game because of Uplay. I never felt like I was having less fun because of it.I would recommend this game to anyone in search of an awesome game to play. "

Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and I bought it as soon as it did. This game is AMAZING. The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are great, the rider customization is fun, the tracks are awesome; it is, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. I have all the Trials games available on Steam, and this one is by far the best.			"

This Isn't Really a ReviewBecause this game is amazing, the mini-games are hit and miss but the game itself is absolutely amazing, one of my favorite games. I only wish it was longer, had more bikes and had more customization.I'm not going to go into how much of a fan I am of this series or how I've put hundreds of hours into each game simply to just keep this short and sane since I'm a bit of a blabber mouth.But basically, this game has a ton of performance issues, it feels really good sometimes, solid 60FPS then.....BAM, the FPS is all over the place and the game feels choppy and delays your moves and it stutters between smooth and choppy and it will completely throw you off and cause your demise 90% of the time. I have a pretty decent system and I'll put the specs near the bottom for people interested but I should not be getting these kinds of problems with a PC this decent, one I can play GTA V with much smoother.The game is good, the physics are top notch, the controls are solid and that's what I play this game for but it all gets thrown out the window with the performance issues. The game can even play perfectly fine but the second you restart the match, bam, stuttering or choppy FPS, and sometimes even in an area with nothing happening the game can be choppy but in areas with♥♥♥♥♥♥blowing up and buildings falling the FPS is rock solid. It seems to be CPU dependant as changing the video options doesn't do much of anything.UPlay is a non-problem for me, never has been a problem, some people just have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck, or in this case, a lot of people have terrible luck but from the very get go since that hell spawn's birth, never had issues with UPlay in any Ubi title I own, just had problems with the games. Stating this since some people seem to hate on UPlay for no reason but to hate on it and 50% of the reviews are talking about it.Why do I recommend this game if it has performance issues? Because it's a REALLY good game, one I come back to all the time owning the games on Xbox 360 and PC and I know it's probably just my dumb luck the game is programmed poorly for my CPU even though others have the same problems. The 360 version is sadly smoother albeit at a lower FPS. Even if I lock this game at 30FPS, it still stutters and gets choppy. But amazing game, especially if they could solve this problem for the people it's affecting.SpecsCPU: FX-4100 OC'd @ 4.5GHzRAM: 16GB DDR3 1600MHz Corsair VengeanceGPU: Gigabyte R9 270 2GB 975MHz Core, 1400MHz MemoryPSU: 850W Thermaltake Gold CertifiedOS: Windows 7 Pro x64 SP1HDD's: A few 1TB 7200RPM drives ranging from Seagate to WD.

Other than that, there isn't anything here, but there doesn't need to be, and shouldn't be. The game is really fun to play, though sometimes frustrating, and it's got some great music to go with it. Overall, defintately a positive experience here. Of course, if you have issues with Uplay, which I never have even though I don't really like it, this could end up being a trap for you.			"

												Awesome game, but a terrible port.  It runs at 60 fps, but if it drops below that at all, you will see major stuttering which makes the game unplayable.  If you don't have any frame drops, which only happens on occasion, the game is a blast.  It's all about timing, and that's what makes it fun.  It really is a good game, but until they optimise it, it's really a bummer.  Even with the major frame issue, I still think it's worth the money.			"

												Really fun and challenging physics based motorbiking, the only thing holding the game back is uPlay.(I have way too many hours played in the Xbox 360 version of this game)			"

												I am not a fan of racing games, but I love trials evolution. After playing it for 100 hours, I would say that I've learned the basics of the game. This game can last you for as much time as you want to put into it. You can just play it to complete all the maps, or you can play it to get platinum medals on all of the maps, or you can play it to be the best on the leaderboard. It's a game where you can choose your own goal, you aren't constrained to set objectives.+ no upgrade system: Although some bikes are not available at the start of the game, this is for your own good to help you learn the game and keep things simple. After a couple of hours of play you will have all the bikes unlocked then the only thing that holds you back is your own skill. Nobody has an unfair advantage over another. You don't need to look up guides online about meta strats and tweak settings in order to be the fastest.+ Awesome game engine: This game's great physics engine is the one feature which underpins all of its enjoyment. Every movement of your controller feels superbly responsive and allows for a huge skill ceiling while still being enjoyable for beginners. You never feel cheated by the game being unfair, every time you crash is your own fault so can be fixed simply with practice.+ Timeless craphics: Great graphics style which aged well with time. Although simple the graphics in this game are much nicer than those in trials fusion. Fusion's choice of polished metal and strip lights to give the air of futurism gets very tired very fast. Evolution has great variety in track design and atmosphere so feels fresh every time you play.+ Perfect for completionists: The progression in this game is perfect. The medal system encourages players to start of by finishing tracks, then coming back to them later once they've inproved to get the next rank up. At no point during this game did I feel stumped by a difficult track causing me to give up on the game. Even when I did get stuck, i went and played over some of the easier tracks, and when I came back to the hard ones my skills had improved to take it on.+ The trials community on youtube is excellent with great guides for all skill levels.+ Music: Oppinion may vary, but I loved the trials evolution soundtrack, it has the classic cheesy race ing game metal sound track pumping you up to drive faster.+ Custom tracks: I would say that the ability to make your own custom tracks is the best feature in this game. Sadly lots of players are unable to share their tracks due to bugs, so there aren't as many being made as there used to be. This is the only advantage trials fusion has over evolution, it has all the custom track creators.- DRM: Requires uplay in order to run. This is really bad. Uplay is down whenever a new game is released because of the volume of players logging in so you can't play any uplay game for a week. Whenever uplay updates it breaks so needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled to play your games. To launch the game you have to launch uplay too so it takes about 5 minutes to launch.- Broken multiplayer: This game has lots of multiplayer bugs which have crippled the community. Most players have problems connecting to online games, which has caused it to die completely. Thankfully there are still people active on track central, but there is also a bug where some players can't upload their custom tracks, which accelerates the community's extinction. I am using windows 10 which makes it impossible for me to upload my custom maps. You should buy this game for its single player, and if you get lucky you'll be able to use the online features too.TLDR; Even with the fact you need uplay :( this is still a great game and well worth buying! :D			"

												""Hand me the keys to this Motorcycle. Let me start it up... YEAHHHHH! VROOM VROOM, I'M READY TO GO!""It's a fun game, great music, a bit of humor and it's also pretty hard. Too bad this port is optimised like ♥♥♥♥. I have a pretty powerfull PC so of course I can run it (even if sometimes I briefly go under 60 FPS) but don't even try to run it on a potato PC, it will not work.Oh also the multiplayer is pretty dead so don't expect to play this game online.

												This is a must buy for serious twitch gamers. Since it's basically two games in one, it'll keep you busy for a while. Worth every cent!			"

												Seems kinda simple and sorta flash gamey form the outside but once you get into it this game has one of the deepest learnig curves of all time, you dont just lean the bike left or right, there are tons of small little micro movements to keep it perfect and very tricky jumps.			"

												This game has provided me with a wide variety of emotions from the blinding anger of faulting 10 feet from a the end of a level on a flauless run to the an uncomparable euphoria of finally getting that gold medal on Inferno 3. I always find myself coming back to this game, and despite already getting gold on every track is till find that i have just as much fun trying to improve my times as i did when i first started playing.

												If you are a person with excellent eye hand/finger coordination then this game is for you. If you like platformer puzzles and you have said eye hand skills then this game is for you. If you are just average or a little less skilled like me then you will have fun up to a point and then hit the wall with this game.Real world Trials is nothing like this game. I doubt anybody know what ""trials"" is as a motorsport. That does not matter for this game. You have a bike and you need to complete courses within a time limit to get medals to advance through the game. Medals get you new tracks and bikes. You earn money but it has no point other than you can buy parts to make your bike look different. They do nothing for performance so you can ignore them if you want.The game is fun. You get big air on some jumps. You can do back/forward flips all you want. It does nothing for your score but its fun and thats the point. There are some odd challenges like skiing on dirt, or trying to do a course with the throttle stuck wide open on your bike.The game rewards your own gifted skills if your are skilled. You have complete control of your bike and rider and far as brakes and throttle. You dont turn in this game so cornering is out. Your rider has a huge effect on the bike balance. The rider can lift the front or rear wheels off the ground just by leaning forward or backwards. This is how you conquer the the challenges. This is my most serious complaint about the handling of the game. You control the rider with the left stick on your game pad. It is super sensitive. I wish I could slow that down like mouse sensitivity in other games. So when you move him up or back he yanks the bike a bunch. Like I said I am not in the top 10% of skilled people.The game is fun. You crash a lot but you will make unbelievable saves that make you shout out loud. I got it cheap and played it a lot over the holidays but when I fired it up later on I just got frustrated. "
