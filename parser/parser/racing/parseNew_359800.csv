												To gamers who wants to try this game. Please 'o' please don't listen to these imbaciles giving a negative reviews of a proper racing simulator. Starting things off, there is currently no way you could enjoy a proper racing game without investing time to set it up first. Look at those negative reviews, they barely even scratched the iceberg with 0.2/0.5 hours of gameplay? I've been playing a lot of racing simulators so I know my way around setting it up.Now, ehem, this game is a lot for a free game. Heck you get all 4 licensed for not a single penny! They put a lot of effort in this game, especially in the FBB I love how it feels, how the car slides, how you lose grip when you hit a curb. The graphics is by far descent. I'm playing with n i3 and a GTX750 and I can run it max, talk about optimization. The AI is just wonderful, clearly a large amount of effort was put into this. (Now I think you're saying why are they saying the AI is bad? Well did you actually think those players are good? Food for thought) Bottom line I say, if you have a gaming steering wheel you got to try this out. I know you have interest in simulations since you looked this up, I know too you are more capable than these fools that complains just about everything. And to the Devs, well done sirs and madams well done.			"

												I actually don't get it why this game has mixed reviews! Only %68 why? The game is free, actually completely free. it has better ai then Assetto Corsa for gods sake. I hope this game gets good reviews and updates. If you have questions Ask me below :) Pros It has wheel setups, choose your wheel and game helps with the setup. It has decent AI drivers. (After many many many updates Assetto Corsa still doesnt have good ai drivers at all) Cars are fun to drive.  Can use the stick shifter and shifting light for G27. (After many many many updates Assetto Corsa still cant use the shifting light!) Couple tracks + Couple cars. Optimized good. Can run the game at max 1080p60fps easily! Decent simulation - racing game.Cons Graphics are a bit old. i actually dont care that much I cant make it show the map in race mode Brakes seems to be overpowered. Cars can slow down suprisingly fast. Engine sounds etc. lets say not the best but still playable :)Edit: Pros and Cons edited for easier reading.			"

												An awesome simulation racing game but you arcade racers out there better buckle up too. Why? Because you can adjust the options to turn this into an arcade racer! Please do not be the one to look at a few negative reviews and then not get this game if you like to race you would be missing out on a lot. I even adjusted the keyboard controls and its completely playable PLAYABLE ON A KEYBOARD!So for everything I have tried in this game including the night time racing I would have to give it a 10/10 I mean its not that often you get a game this extensive that is ACTUALLY FREE! You read that right FREE meaning NO MICROTRANSACTIONS! The devs deserve the rightful praise of this game because of what they have done.Thank you if you read this review in its entirety.			"

												As soon as I loaded this game up, I knew exactly what I was in for. Developed by Reiza Studios, the same folks behind the excellent Game Stock Car 2013 (Extreme now) and Formula Truck 2013 series of games, this is pretty much the same thing, but on the Brazilian stock car circuit. While not familiar with the Brazilian circuit myself, I thoroughly enjoy the aforementioned games, and anyone else that is familiar with those will feel right at home as well. This is mainly the reason that I am able to write this review with such little play time on this at the moment! So on to the gameplay! Once you're behind the wheel of either of three different car manufacturers (for now anyway), you'll see the familiar gMotor 2 engine used with these games, from the HUD to the ever-so-lovely shift/rpm gauge. Of course, these can be turned off (thankfully), which gives you a more realistic sim experience, if that is your cup of tea. And yes, you can change the view from the default cockpit! This is found in the Options > Display menu. There are a multitude of other settings that can be changed as well, from the number of cars seen on-screen at once to graphical settings. Most gamers with mid to high range machines can naturally max out these settings, as the graphics are not quite up to the same standards as Asetto Corsa and the likes. But, to me anyway, they look pretty good right out of the box, so to speak. This can also be said for the car handling physics, which are the same as other entries from Reiza Studios. And that is to say that they are some of the best that I have experienced in any racing game to date. Again, those that have played the games I mentioned know what I am referring to.In summary, if you've played the other games Reiza has offered, you know what you're in for, and will feel right at home once you're in the game. If you're even remotely interested in racing games that are more of a simulation, then you should definitely give this a try. And heck, even if you don't like racing games, give it a try anyway. After all, how can you go wrong with a free game, especially one of this magnitude. What are you waiting for, add it to your Steam library right now!!!			"

This is an amazing Racing Simulator. The controls are quite nice and smooth, even with my crappy old racing wheel. Graphics are OK, they aren't PS4 standards... They feel... 2010'ish, but still pleasing to look at, it works for what it is quite well. The customization and options are unbeliveble! You can change a lot of stuff to your liking, even on the camera, it's the first racing game i've seen that you can adjust the angle of the third person camera, its really neat!The game suffers a little bit on the HUD department tho, kinda barebones and there isn't a map, like other racing games usually have (unless it's hidden on some option menu i havent found)... also, the menus aren't the most intuitive and user-friendly, you will have to spend some time to fiddle with the options to find what you need, but when you get everything set up to your controller, it will be a blast!Some people seem to have problem playing with the keyboard, but since i played with a racing wheel, i cant say... even tho the game has a lot of options, with some patience, you probably can make any controller work fine!If it had multiplayer i would gladly pay for it, it's a really nice game!

												I can't really believe this game is free. I'm a big fan of Reiza Studios for their other sims (GSC Extreme and FT2013) which I have since their original release (before it was on Steam) and this small team gave us some of the best sims for years with those titles. And Copa de Marcas is no different, it's a great sim of a cool racing series with accurate models and tracks.If you are looking for a true sim, look no further. Try this game and look for the other titles from Reiza Studios as well.			"

												I played this game before its steam release and it made me fall in love with pc racing games. It doesn't have much content, However it is essentially a free demo of Game Stockcar. It runs on the same engine that GSC and Rfactor use. It is amazing quality for a free game so I would suggest to anyone unsure about buying games like rfactor or GSC play this. It is the perfect introduction to the 2 games and their interface. One of, if not my favourite free game on steam			"

												I had a quick go, no driving aids no adjustment to wheel settings yet and still found it drivable. So don't listen to anyone who says it isnt! Lots of understeer and poor line, but thats because i havent got a feel for the car or changed any settings yet:(Sorry for no sound on the video, I don't know why shadowplay didn't record it)


YouTube™ Video: Copa Petrobras De Marcas 

			Views: 367		

			Quick demo of game (no driving aids) no sound (im not sure why shadowplay didnt record it)		

It drives well, good FF (though i havent adjusted to my taste yet) and an extra series of racing for my collection that I didn't have previously. Looks nice enough, though it isn't RaceRoom or Asseto Corsa and the like, seems a bit older maybe like rfactor? - notsure as i havent played that ether). Sounds are pretty good on the car i drove, nice representation of Intellagos but beware the added chicane just before pits! Great for free, many thanks to the devs.6.8 / 10			"

												Use a steering wheel. Then you`ll understand. The Force Feedback is great and racing is fun. Many options for configuring races and controls (button mapping, driving aids, number of laps and ai drivers etc.). There are only 4 cars and 6 tracks, but that`s okay for a free game.  The graphics are ok. Don`t expect too much, but it`s still quite a nice view. Would drive again.			"

												Very good racing simulator, although it doesn't have much variety. The physics are excellent and force feedback is exemplary. AI is very good and they are quite aggressive. Actually, AI is even better than on Assetto Corsa or pCARS and will avoid collisions mid-curves.By the way, you will need a wheel to fully appreciate this game. And come on, it's free.			"

Try the home/end/insert/del/page/ keys for various views. One of the outside views allows you to rotate the view by using the numpad keys. Press I to let the AI take over driving the car for you while you admire the graphics, press I again to take back control of the car. This is a sim and not an arcade racer so, yea, there is no insta-stop, you have to plan ahead to brake efficiently.			"

												This is a good game although you might not understand why. Reiza is the studio behind the title and they are well respected in the sim racing world. They're up there with iRacing, RaceRoom, Assetto Corsa, and PCars. The game is based off the Game Stock Car Extreme simulation engine, it's simulation not arcade, and that's a good thing. The engine is dated visually but Reiza keeps brining it along with new physics and features and, honestly, it looks half decent. The full game, including test days, practices, qualifying, full races with full AI grids, etc., is completely free. I honestly think Reiza should charge $5-10 for this package and it would still be well worth it. It took me a few minutes to setup my wheel in the controls, just be sure to do that first. Enjoy the game!			"

												This game definitely takes me back to my days of playing Rfactor and it is amazing to say that it is free! Yes the game has little content but I like to think of it as one of the dedicated mods from Rfactor that has basically been made into a stand alone game but as it is free you cant complain about the quantity. And as others have stated it is practically a demo of Stock car and this has encouraged me to buy it sometime in the near future. Ignore the fact that the game has mixed reviews the majority of the bad ones are coming from casuals who don't have a steering wheel or at least a good one for that matter.

												IMPORTANT NOTICE: This game is a hardcore ""racing simulator"", therefore, it sould be played using a driving wheel controller. If you don't understand the above notice, then please don't play this game, and don't post reviews about how the game is not playable using  the keyboard! By doing so, you are hurting a great developer, who are very good at what they do (making racing simulators).This game can be considered as demo for ""Stock Car Extreme"" and ""Automobilista Motorsport Simulator"". You sould try this free game if you are interested in them, or interested in Automobilista especially, since it is the newer version of the former. The driving model and physics is great. The force feedback is the best in all racing simulators IMO. The AI is competitive enough to race against. All in all, if you are interested in racing simulators genre, this is the perfect game to introduce you the sim racing world! But be sure to try it using a proper racing wheel controller!			"

												Overall, it's a 6.5/10I can see it was at least inspired by GTR2, as it shares a lot of design choices. But it just falls short when compared.There are 4 different cars in the entire game, each with 2 different liveries. But they all feel the same.there are also 6 different tracks in the entire game, each with it's own feel to them. Nothing bad to say here.Options have been made well, there's a lot to change, controls, audio, display, and also difficulty of the game and rules of the races.And then there's the driving physics. None of these cars have ever spun on me, even with every driving assist off. They just feel as if they were FWD, is that supposed to be that way? Other than that, clutch works, brakes do lock, and You do lose control in certain situations, but it's way too easy.Same goes to the rival AI, once passed they do nothing to get their position back, and even before You pass them they seem like they were just moving obstacles on the road.Graphics are... not that bad actually, the contrast etc is fairly well balanced, but everything else is just not there. True, there are working real-time shadows of the cars and the track but... that's it. No real-time car reflections, they're just reflecting the skybox (which isn't any good either, just about 20 small clouds on the sky), no motion blur, no depth of field, nothing! It's the middle of 2015, what were you thinking?Sound is nice, You can hear everything happening around You, Cars do sound a little different but that's it, nothing spectacular again.Long review short, it's an average game when compared to other racing ""simulators"" out there, but from what I've seen, it's a good way to get into ""arcade-simulator racing"" as I call it. There aren't many cars to master, and they all feel the same so it's not a huge hop to change a car, the tracks aren't too hard to master, the AI isn't too hard and unforgiving, etc etc.So if You're new to the simulator genre, have an old computer which can't run modern games and a steering wheel do get it. It's for free so You can find out if You're going to like simulator racing or not. But if You do, please do get GTR2 and find some mods for it because that is the best way to get into ""hardcore simulator racing"". It's from 2005 so Your PC will run it, and it has a damn well written physics engine.			"

												One of the best sim games I've ever played, and it's free. Ignore my low play time, I usually play these cars within the game this is effectively a giant demo for, Stock Car Extreme. But they drive exactly the same in this.Physics are brilliant, not many people doing better sims that Reiza at the moment.Graphics are a little dated, but well optimised and look and run fine on low end hardware.AI seems pretty decent too. If you want an arcade racing experience go elsewhere, but if you currently play Forza or GT and you're ready to try something a bit more advanced to see if you like it, this is a very good way to do so for free. And your steering wheel from your Playstation or Xbox will probably work on the PC, too, if it's one of the good ones.			"

												First it's free, so if you like Racing sims, I cannot think of a good reason not to download this.Second, not only is it free, it is also very well put together - fully customizable control options, excellent FFB, and great car handling and physics.There are unbelievably some negative reivews - I can only assume they are from arcade gamers who do not want to spend any time properly setting up their controls and other settings, or are still at school and have not yet learnt to appreciate what it means to actually have to earn money to pay for a game, and therefore what it means to get a game for free. All I cans ay is, if you can not afford to buy a race sim, then this one may have less cars and tracks than other full release sims, but it will give you a simulation of racing that is as enjoyable as any of them.It's also a recommended taster for Stock Car Extreme, which has many more cars of equal or higher quality.

												Hands down one of the coolest and most simple sim racing you can get for free. Its super fun and super direct. Once you fixed all the settings its countless and hours of fun. Currently playing with everything turned off. This game makes u fight for your rewards to the finish line. Super fun and reconmendng the downloads for all non racing and racing fans.			"

												Multiplayer? FFb?Has multiplayer been stripped? Force feedback also doesnt work.I cant complain since its a free game. But I aint gonna lie: It'd be nice w.multiplayer. I'm sure its plenty fun since it has good handling.I have Project Cars and Assholo' C. and mulitplayer and ffb works fine.-Anyone has multiplayer working with this?/Dr. Mabuse; disgruntled gaming since the 1980'ties.

												I need more testing in game before I can decide if I recomend or not, however, I like the game. unfortunately cause I dont have windows XP, my Sidewinder doesn't give force feedback so I can't ""feel"" the road, but I still really like the game so far. I would like to say that there should be more cars and tracks, but so far this game has been good to me. havent managed to do a burnout or a drift yet xD but I'm working on it. All in all I'd give this game a 7/10. I will edit once I have played more and will let you guys know :)			"

												(First review, sorry!)This is a racing sim, probably one of the best free-to-play racing sims.I've played this for almost an hour, and for most of it, I couldn't figure out the controls. I've pressed every button my keyboard, testing things out, and couldn't get my car to actually start. The control panel had what seemed like MILLIONS of controls, and would be very hard to remember them all, especially if you don't play often. I've fixed my controls though, and finally started to drive.I turned off gasoline useage, tire ware, etc. so I could get used to the driving. Even with the fixed controls, the car was still very hard to control, and since some of the maps have a lot of twists and turns, I crashed often, or slowed down, and the AIs caught up, thus me ending up in 10th place in 10 minutes, even with a map I chose with only a couple of turns. Everytime I got back onto the track after crashing into the walls, I'd sometimes get hit with a passing AI, ending in me crashing AGAIN. Sometimes this cycle would repeat 2 or 3 times. Other than that, I had a lot of fun racing, and hope to soon get better as I play more.Pros:- Graphics are decent- Sound is awesome (in my opinion at least)- Beautiful car details- Free to play- Runs on slow computers- Perfect game for if you don't have a lot of money- No lag- Replays are coolCons- Hard to drive- Music is annoying- No tutorials- Controls are like wowOverall, I will give this a game a 6/10 and I recommended you give it a try if you like racing games.

This is absolutely great, I have had 3 hrs on this so far, and am enjoying it! You can run it on basically any PC which is a good thing. I love the difficulty and hardcore gameplay, it really adds that extra touch to it, making it the best sim I have ever played, that is free. I am expecting more from Reiza Studios, keep it up!!			"

												I like this game. It's more of a sim than it is an arcade racer but it does have some elements of an arcade racer I suppose in that you can get racing with minimal fuss in just a few minutes if you so wish thanks to a generous amount of driving aids and a clean menu which allows you to get involved in some racing action in just a few clicks. But it has depth as well and you can spend time fine-tuning your vehicles and working on your lines and braking points etc. I like that it supports controller use, because I'm not in the mood to get out my wheel setup right now and just want to put a few laps ina nd have a few races but I do look forward to playing with a wheel as well - the physics feel impressive enough with a pad and even though I'm no fan of FF cars, this game seems to have made them enjoyable to drive and that's all you can ask for really.It's rewarding, enjoyable, there's a decent amount of content for the price... and oh yeh the price - it's FREE. So no complaints here...Thanks to Reiza for giving this one away. I'm already contemplating investing in AMS as it too looks great.Thumbs up :)			"

												Free Auto Racing simulator,  It worked, Played great, Looked Great, Sounded great.  Very complex simulator, if you you don't know racing games you might not know what to do.  No tutorial.  Keyboard control might be too hard, xbox controler might work with some playing around. If you have a complete driving wheel, you should get this game.  You might have to reconfigure your controls to work with what you have. Plenty of options and dificulty controls.  Personally, i don't know about racing or play racing games, but tried it out with xbox controller.  Didn't see anything to buy.For more info:

												It's a simulation, not an arcade. So if you want some funny arcade game, this is not your cup of tea. Graphics is working under Direct-X 9, very nice models, but nowadays it looks like the graphics in racing games in years between 2006 - 2008. Engine sounds are not very real, but this is a same problem, like Project Cars, GRID2, and lots of other car racing games have, so do not be dissapointed. I have been playing this about less than 15 minutes? Behind view is very funny, you just see only your seat, nothing else behind. :D No damage model (but it is understandable, most car producers does not want crashing their cars in racing games) If you do not have anything else, it is free, so you can say ""it is still better than nothing"" and I am really confident, there will be someone who will like this ""game"" or ""racing simulation"". Very real looks interior view, where no hands are holding your racing wheel, but you can look left and right and the interior looks very nice. If they put some DX 11 efects, this game would be very nice to watch. This game looks designer for racing wheel owners, it worked on my keyboard, but it was weird and every corner I was telling myself ""If I had a steering wheel, if I hade a steering wheel!!!"" But on the replay videos It looked just fine.So...Recomend or not? Definitely recommend! It's free and steering wheel owners with older PC could be satisfied. If you have slower computer, so you will be probably satisfied with Graphics and you can play it for free. What else would you like from this game?!  "

												Now, I have less than an hour on record of the game. But for what I've played for this game is great, The developers have put a lot of effort into just giving us a game. Let alone an F2P game. Now, all of you Casual players out there, I recommend the game, but if you're in it to win it? Don't rage if you don't. The game is more focused to simulation and aims at players that are experienced with Simulation/Racing games. But this game is worth giving a try since It's something the Dev's have put a lot into and It gets you down when you spend so much Time/Effort/Money on a game that actually plays well. But doesn't get the Respect it should. I Recommend This Game. ;)-Mr Retro			"

												This is a good racing game. The physics are believable. Even though they are not very detailed, they are sufficient for this game.More importantly, this game allows you to map your inputs freely, like any game that respects the player does. also, there is none of this modern ""steering dampening"" nonsense where your gamepad is supposed to feel like a wheel that only turns slowly.No, this game respects you and your inputs. it doesn't mess with your steering curvature.and the in game wheels are moving in sync with your controller and as fast as you can move the controller. I wish every racing game controlled like this.			"

												Copa Petrobras de Marcas is an OK game, not too great. It's free, so I can't say much too bad about it. The default controls are different than in most games, so if you don't change them from the beginning, you will be driving way off. There are many cool things about this game- pitstops, gauges and meters, while tracking tires and other things. Also, you can change the camera views in different ways than in most games (i.e. side mirrors).-Pro: You can choose different variations of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X from the start.-Con: No multi-player mode.

If you like rfactor then you will like this and f-truck otherwise.....................Not one buy in option in the game, so Kinda hard to say not good when it is completely free.

												Sim Players are passionate when it comes to driving, flying or even riding the vehicles that have either thrilled and amazed us during our childhood even still do today which is why we take time out to write great reviews .. so I’d just like to add something to that ……It’s always a shame to read about the disappointments that a fellow Sim Player has experienced instead of reading about their delights as they have taken the controls of their favourite consist and proudly taken passengers or goods from their chosen station, port or yard and delivered them on time having faced realistic challenges of schedules, other transport or sometimes signal failures and adverse weather conditions - that inner sense of achievement (and self-pride) is all we really seek - Yes they may be after all only simulations of real modes of transport –BUT…. be it an incredible landing of a fully laden 300 ton Boeing 747-400 on a real time flight from Singapore to Heathrow - Microsoft Flight Simulator perhaps - where you take care of the Jumbo's flight deck and using the array of true to life switches, levers and dials as you descend gently down to terra firma – EGLL runway 21 to be exact to the [imagined] sounds of cheers and applause of your satisfied passengers and crew. Or that inner voice that says 'yees!' when we finally arrive at the depot and park up our Flexi-Bus for the day OMSI 2– its late, the sun has set, both outside our windows (if we care to look!) and within the Sim… but we don’t care.. We’ve driven with diligence and skill, we’ve hit n hurt no one and managed to pick up and drop off everyone without a hitch… that’s what matters.. That’s why we play these Simulators – That’s what Sims do for us! - They fulfil our innermost desire to be a part of something that we admire, to take control of the very vehicles that we venerate and are in awe of – Hours of our lives are spent recreating the paths taken by Road, Rail, Air and Sea in order that we may share the experience in some intangible way of that of the Driver, Pilot, Captain, Fireman, Soldier and Doctor? within us all – all this achieved speedily at the flick of a mouse button and without the arduous years of universities, specialist training and professional advice and preparation, we will not suffer any loss of limb if we make mistakes as we learn the art of take-off and landing, nor will we face litigation and inevitable imprisonment from the families of the loved ones that we lost at sea due to our lack of experience of sailing cruise ships, or even suffer from docked wages from South West Trains for continued late arrivals at London Victoria… Friends our desire and task is a simple one … to Simulate through our chosen modes … without the Wind, Rain, Ice, Snow or Insurance Costs ever affecting or view of our chosen destination - To Dream the Impossible is what drives the human spirit – But to deny someone of that dream is to deny them of the very lust for life ….. So keep dreaming keep ‘Simming’ and whether it’s by Air, Sea or Land may your journeys be filled with fun, passion and excitement – Sim on! n Smile as you go!			"

												i only recomend this game because it is completely FREE and only 2GB download. TRy it!i suggest though ot use this game for an additional car and track combination of race tracks not often used in games. keep in mind to use it only for private practice without AI. because the AI is in that sense terrible that they dont understand ''2 wide'' (if you are on their out- or inside they ignore you and ramm you off the track if you block their race line.) they can only drive 2 wide with other AI.other than that it's decent looking, nice controls, easy setup. many pre configured wheel-setups.

												PEOPLE GIVING MARCAS A NEGATIVE RATING MUST BE COMPLETELY BONKERS OR COMPLETELY SIMPLE...JUST DISGUSTING TO SEE THIS FINE FREE SIM RACER GET A MIXED REVIEW!If you are on a tight budget - there is simply no better sim racer you can find with such a complete single player championship experience, only raceroom experience comes close.There is absolutely no reason for people who are into racing not to like what Copa Petrobras de Marcas has to offer FOR FREE. The only reason this game is free is because Brazil's largest oil company Petrobras is paying the bill. Marcas is a promotional game built on a quality sim engine, by people who know how to make this engine shine better than the original programmers.You get a FULL TC championship, with the same great handling that comes with Reizas Game Stock Car series.If you have a FFB steering wheel you are in for a treat, as Reiza's Stock Car series has been universally recognized as having one of the best driving models in the business. The graphics are crisp and functional, without unnessessary eye candy (check SweetFX*), so the game can be played on most mid range machines at the highest graphical settings.I was actually happy that the Marcas content was recently added to the Stock Car Extreme game, as it is one one my favorite Reiza classes to drive - being front wheel driven they require a different style. FWD is another detail some negative reviews seem to miss when they discuss handling.As for the comment on driving views - there are many camera views (!), in and outside the car.Before posting negative reviews, take a little time to check the set up possibilities, controls etc, and you'll find that almost anything can be set up. Same for FFB, it can be tweaked to near perfection. At best any negatives given on these issues show a lack of looking for the proper settings - read stupidity of the reviewer.Most of the negative comments seem to come from people who are expecting an arcade racer, with basic one size fits all ez mode, game pad support, game pad friendly handling and ""eye candy"" visuals.Unfortunately by doing so they completely miss the point - as non target audience of this game - and trash the game accordingly.Pearls before swine I'm tempted to say.....The graphics are GOOD, nice and crisp SIM STYLE, instead of the on steroids Michael Bay kind you find in most arcade racers.Get a good FFB wheel, take some time to set up this game - my Logitech Driving Force GT requires NEGATIVE FFB to work correctly, you have to know that and deal with it. These are really essential requirements, just like installing the SweetFX* shaders to get optimal visuals.Learn how to drive with the free copa game and soon you'll be buying Stock Car Extreme for all its other classes and tracks. Want something really different, get Formula Truck. I own the original non-Steam versions of Reizas games, including the older GSC2012 - still cool, still on the hdd and I still play them.Summery- arcade racers move on (please, and stop reviewing)- get a good ffb wheel (essentiel with race sims)- take some time to tweak your settings (also essentiel, no one size fits all in sims)- install SweetFX (...some eye candy)- have fun RACING (the whole point)- give Marcas and Reiza some well deserved love!*The post processing effects you see in videos and screenshots are not standard, but can be easily installed. SweetFX - takes less the a couple of minutes to set up.http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/sweetfx-reiza-settings-for-gsc-extreme-formula-truck-2013.3482/ "

												Well i have played a few simulation games to know a good sim when i see one and this doesnt fit the description,the car isnt at all smooth (i played with a steering wheel then my keyboard) The UI inteface is really bad and needs improvemment and they should keep tutorials for new comers who just started playing such games.The graphics also were kind of bad (like CS 1.6 graphics kind of bad).

												Now don't get me wrong, the driving in this game is quite solid and the visuals are quite good too. Heck, the cars even sound great. Think of it as HIGHLY polished content for rFactor. Purely by driving experience, I'd say it's pretty neat.So why the thumbs down? The game's accessibility is downright terrible. Even Assetto and rFactor are better in this front. Every racing sim, free or not, must come with atleast one of the following - Racing Line, Minimap or Co-Driver. I'm not familiar with any of these tracks, and that is in fact a good thing as it brings up fresh content to drive on, but this becomes a bane when you don't have navigational assistance on the track. This is a major putoff for a casual player like me.PS - If there really is a Racing Line/Minimap feature, please let me know and I'll update this. TIll then, I'll get my kicks from  rF and NR2003 :)			"

												Briefly.CONS1) defualt assist settings mean the car drives itself effectively. Just remember when to lift at the end of the straights.2) change the assists and the car still tries to steer itself a little in the corners. Set the FFB to above zero and you can feel it. at +50% (yes it is possible to have -50%) you end up fighting the wheel to strighten up to the line out of the corners.3) if you don't like the bumper view the camera options are horrible4) I tired interlagos for 20 minutes. At the end of the pit straight the braking markers on the right side are missing and with the camera view it is impossible to judge the braking distance. I did 10 laps and went off every time.5) Although it has many defualt wheel configs they all need to be customised and it's not immediately obvious how you do it.Pros1) race 07/rfacetor engine.2) defualt setup for the evo (only car i tried) is good. very grippy and stable.3) freeConclusionIf you are new to racing games. This is one to try. It will help teach you the racing lines and how a car should feel before you dive into something like LFS/ Race 07/Asstto Corsa. If you have any experience, it's best to avoid unless you want an easy game to play while drinking and driving but the Need For Speed games exist for that purpose.			"

												There will be people who will say I didnt spend long enough ingame to have a valid opinion however, I am a serious sim racer. I`ve been playing sim games for many years now, gtlegends, rfactor, race07, iracing and rfactor2, i`ll even spout I own what I would class as arcade racers ie shift 1,2 dirt 1,2,3 f1 2010 etc etc.... My setup does not involve a joypad if your gonna play a sim then buy a wheel its that simple, I love my g27.Onto CopaGraphics: the gfx are poor for a game this recent, a mediocre laptop could run this at full whack and not suffer.Sound: music was ok in menu, car sounds suck massive unicorn wang! meaning they are the worst Ive ever heard.control: wheel setup was easy, the cars feel very unrealistic even running on veteran settings.Online: is there an online? i dunno it was uninstalled after about 10 mins.conclusion: If your a serious sim racer avoid this game at all costs you will be nothing but disappointed with it even given the fact that its free. If your an arcade racer then I spose its ok but my 2 cents would say to look elsewhere for arcade racers, I would even recommend the original Grid game over this. The only plus` I can give this game is the inmenu music and the ui is easy enough to navigate. So all being said serious sim racers not wanting to spend money on iracing dont get this lol,,, do yourself a favour and get rfactor2 or even race07, you will have far more fun with those titles... now excuse me while I load up rfactor2 and go hit nord in autumn on full HD with the nissan gtr :) nuff said,,, avoid copa unless your an arcade racer!!!!!

												After being released from the prison mental ward, Coffin Joe is greeted at the gate by his old and loyal servant Bruno (Rui Rezende), who takes him to a secluded basement below a favela in São Paulo. As well as Bruno, the hideout is populated by four fanatics who are obsessed with Coffin Joe's history and ideas, and have been waiting and preparing for his arrival in order that they may faithfully serve him. After questioning their motives and testing their loyalty, Coffin Joe immediately orders the followers to begin kidnapping women so he can renew his murderous quest for ""the continuation of the blood"", his lifelong obsession to find who he determines to be a perfect woman who will bear him a son. His first victim is Dr. Hilda (Cléo De Páris), a controversial eugenicist who Bruno kidnaps. Coffin Joe tests her will by injecting her with drugs and she has hallucinations of Coffin Joe cutting off her buttock and presenting it to her after which she willingly eats it. Meanwhile, Coronel Claudiomiro Pontes (Jece Valadão), a fervidly Roman Catholic police captain who holds an old grudge against Coffin Joe for blinding his eye, and Father Eugênio (Milhem Cortaz), a mentally unstable priest (the son of one of Coffin Joe's past victims, Dr. Rudolfo in At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul) learn about Coffin Joe's release, and decide to join forces to seek Coffin Joe and kill him once and for all.

												Copa Petrobras de Marcas.Is this a fun game? Yes.Is this a multiplayer game? Sadly no.Would it be worth paying 10 bucks for if it wasn't free? No.The reason why it's not worth 10 bucks is because it's only singleplayer, and you can only race a couple of track.And there aren't that many cars. So no, it's a fun game. But not worth much money.But that's why it's free, do I recommend it??? Ummmmm. Well, for the racing itself yes. And if your gonna get this game, that's probably what your into.But for the game itself? Nope. It's good as a free game but look at Trove for an example of what a great free game is (it's not even constricting, you don't need to buy anything even though it does have microtransactions).Now I know I clicked the ""No"" on the ""Do you recommend this game"" thing. But here is the thing, I wouldn't recommend it for the lack of features, not for the racing. So if your not bothered by this then go and get it. The racing is great, the features, not so much.			"

												The game is ok for being free-to-play but I can't really recommend it to anyone unless they don't have any money.  This game feels unfinished.  The car is constantly bouncing around on the track like it has no shock absorbers.  Maybe you can change the setup of everything in the menus but I didn't even try.  I'd much rather pay for and play Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, or RaceRoom Experience.			"

												I'm extremly dissanpointed. I downloaded this game thinking it would start a race similar to that in forza motorsport. Plus, I'm used to a third person or fith person vehical view. If I could change the camera, and if it could start at the starting line rather than at the pit stop I would be happy. I would also be happy If standard cars were available(like the Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS) or exotic cars(like the Picani Zonda or the Ford GT). Thanks for reading my review, I hope these improvments can be made soon.   :)			"

												I'm an accomplished tech, so when I post a problem about this game crashing and I get a WIP troubleshooting link from the dev, that seems a bit poor. I have a really up-to-date PC with every damn update for drivers and a top end graphics card. But still the game crashes after about 45 seconds when ever you try to drive. Then the dev locks the support topic so I can't respond. That's poor support and poor troubleshooting resolution.My advice, don't bother and get Assetto Corsa instead, at least you get decent support.			"

The in game graphics are completely different and I'm surprised the gamemakers even had the cheek to put those high-resolution pictures on the page. The whole point of it is to show what the game is like. Bad:*Graphics*Cars*Controls*GameplayGood:???Overall if you want a good track racing game from steam go for Asseto Corsa or Project Cars, definately not this one.			"

I've read so many ""I know sims and this is good, other played 0.02h, they know sh*t"" reviews, and now I know why... Because anyone who knows that this is an rF mod, just deletes than goes back to Simraceway (which is also an rF based game, but with a living/growing community and online tournaments... also free with micropayment...).

												It's a game that has just been released, I understand that. But the game wasn't that bad. However, there could be some changes that should be in effect, instead of what I am about to expect on a F2P racing game. The controls are terrible in this game. They don't save your changes, whenever you launch the game. If so, then you would have to change them again and again to fit your controls.

												Well this is the worst game ever!!! It is a racing game but the controls are stiff as @#$%!! The default controls are: a to accelerate, , to go left and . to go right the $%^&. If one craping pixel gets off the road the god dang car goes craping crazy. The car just bounces around then it won't listen to your controls then it crapping STOPS it just STOPS. The pitstops are crap you can't see the crew takes crapping 8 hours to get out  of the pitstops. DO NOT get this game unless u like games that have no controls. Finally the cars theres is a small amount of them so dont bother serching for a really good car they  are all the same just with different brand names. There are more cons than pros guys. DONT GET THIS CRAPPY GAME .			"

												The most advanced and user friendly game and control I've ever seen.I do have the impression the developer team had never played a racing game in their life.It is very interesting to have a clutch, I think games like Forza and Gran Turismo can rock with this concept, but I would suggest that all the players would start with automatic and then they would have the opportunity to use manual or even clutch. Or a tutorial would help.Well I will stop my critics here.			"

												spent 10 minutes fixing settings, 2 minutes playing which was plenty enough.on a serious note, brakes weren't all that fantastic, controls are abnormal for a racing game in my eyes. it's probably a lot better with a wheel but mine broke a while ago so i cannot test that part.sounds arent the best either but might appeal to some.at the end of the day, it's a free game. I would give it a 5/10 but wouldn't recommend it to friends.			"

												I stumbled across this game when I accidentally opened steam while trying to open the logitech profiler (Which was next to steam on the task bar.) Best mistake ever.Pros1. Realistic handling. The way the handling operates is brilliant. The understeer and lift off oversteer that you would get from a front wheel drive touring car are so accurate that it's unbelivable.2.  Compatibility with slower computers. My computer has 4GB of ram and a 1.4GHz processor. Not one problem with the smoothness of the game and the graphics aren't even that bad. Why do you need any better graphics thn this, it might look cool but really the graphics in this are just fine3. IT'S FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!Cons1. Takes a while to set up, First I didn't realise it had defaulted with all assists on and the controls were with the keyboard. Once I made the wheel work and turned off the assists the force feedback was steering the car for me so I then realised about negative force feedback, which solved my problem.2. Strange AI behaviour and bad penalty system on the formation lap the AI are extremely slow and when I tried out the rolling start the AI started overtaking each other and the saftey car on the formation lap. When I tried to test the damage module I went straight down the inside of another car at full speed destroying their car (and not mine) I only got a warning.In summary I will say this quickly. GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!			"

												I tend to review games in different sections people tend to look for:Graphics: 68/100. The Cars them selves look very nice. The surroundings are not particularly great, however you shouldnt notice it if you are looking where you are going! ;)User Interface (UI): 46/100. It doesnt look the prettiest. Simple design however it feels like it's the wrong colours that just make it look... not right?Artificial Intelligence (AI): 96/100. The AI feels perfect. They notice that your there (unlike other tittles recently). They know if you are faster then them then they would move over to let you through. But dont think it's that easy ;) If a bot wants to challenge they will. You can get some really good battles.Frames Per Second (FPS): 85/100. I didn't have many FPS drops when playing it that were particularly noticeable. I wasnt sure how many frames I do drop because I had to use the Keyboard to drive, due to the game not noticing my wheel. Sounds: 87/100. The car sounds are good. The music is meh, but you can turn tht off in the menu. The game notices what type of terrain you driving over, for example when going over rumble strips, you for sure know you are. Content: Currently at 68/100. There are only the one class of car currently in the game. There are about 6 different race tracks. About 4 different types of car. Single race, Test day and Championship. I am not sure if they are planning to add more content in the furture?Controls: 72/100. The game does have a few wheels that it knows, such as G25 or the G27 and some Thrustmaster ones like the TM 500. You can use a Xbox gamepad and your keyboard. (If you do use your Keyboard make sure to check the keybinding's)Overall rating = 73/100Overall great for a Free to Play! If you like racing games then I would suggest this to you. Only a small download nothing big. Good base to the game if they want to make more content. Few problems with the UI looking weird, all in all, worth the download.			"

One of the biggest problems though it does not supprot 1440 x 900 monitrs so that may of caused some problems with the graphics so they need to be fixed. also the menu is very bad as a accedentaly quit a race a few times and the defalt controlls are not the sandared WASD it is crazy.

												The simple and honest FACT about this game is, that it IS infact just rFactor1.  With a rearranged and revamped UI skin.  Once you pass the first screen its painfully obvious what you are playing because no matter how you skin it, rFactor, stands out from its other clones like Race 07 and all of its variants.   The time favored menu options are still here.  Now the dead giveaway for me was the garage and its tuning options. The UI is so annoying and confusing to navigate to accomplish whatever tuning or changes you wish to make.  Loading out onto the track was like a joke. It screamed GTMAX world touring car mod (a rFactor user made mod) from 2011. Same Toyota, however this Focus version is new, seen this Lancer before.   Although these modders make a better default cockpit view. Its more like looking through a person with two eyes , than that narrow perspective♥♥♥♥♥rFactor ""I must have only one eye"" FOV. The controls by far, hands down, are a billion times more understandable and appreciated over rFactors♥♥♥♥♥♥for sensory feed back.   It seems like rFactor was geared towards idiots with logitech wheels, and not really followed by people with actual quality made devices.   As if the modder community just are a bunch of blow hards.  I do play rFactor  as a die hard fan, since it came out. But what I say is true.     This game without even touching any settings I chose to set out onto the track to see how ""factor"" like it was, and was proven wrong.  I was so happy to see that my first turn, that i said to myself ""this is just about how i would steer if I were sitting in this car"" actually gave the car the direction I wanted.       Excellent job guys. That alone is something to cheer about.  Though being an rFactor fan, it makes me wonder if the settings we see and the choices that are configured in the .PLR file are set with some options that are in place to create that superb handling.  Such as the fact that I cannot do anything about my infant drivers weak♥♥♥♥♥neck and his floppy loppy head banging around in the cockpit.  That♥♥♥♥♥♥is so wrong for one god damn reason. Yes G forces will batter your head from side to side, but, our amazing ""anti skip technology"" built in to our eyes, prevents us from having that unuseable sight of vibration.  Eyeballs let us look to the side without moving our heads. They allow the head to move without the area we are viewing to pan tilt or skew whilst our heads move along dang near any axis.     If my noodle neck driver could just hold his head still, (and option in all other games using this sim engine) it would be so much more fun to play.  But as  I inspected the games files I am to belive they acomplish their handles by using a slightly different approach. And I think its that they use the games physics engine in a different way. I believe this game bases the cars handles off of the drivers head physics, versus the other games having the .HDV file, the SUSP.pm, the , tires.tbc, and a few other components to configure how your car would feel on the track.      Whatever it is, great job.Questionable though I just find this game after its makers get bought out.You guys going to do a clone port of rFactor 2?That would be awesome if you keep improving the steering experience.  :D			"

												This game is great. The AI are amazing. The sounds are really good. My only annoyance was that the end of the race didn't work properly. It was supposed to be the last lap of the timed race, but instead it added an extra lap. Was lots of fun though. I have no idea why the reviews are ""mixed"" I think they should be ""Mostly Positive""I have a G27 for Gran Turismo 6, and I an the 150th fastest person in the world on it, 32nd fastest in the USA. I was too lazy to move it to the PC, I just used a keyboard with only ABS:High everything else off. AI I used 100%/100% And I got 3rd place in my first race. I really enjoyed it, I have some real life racing to do right now, but Im excited to practice Interlagos some more when I get back. :)			"

												Ok, so I've had this downloaded for some time, but never played it as I thought, for a free game its going to be rubbish,  only played a couple of laps, getting controllers set up etc, an I can say I'm pretty impressed, not sure why this has had so many negative views to be honest, the graphics are very good, not project car good, not even close, but games like race etc, hands down beats it. but I guess thats not the most important thing in a race game is it. Its the handling and how it ""feels"", well again I've many race games on and off steam, and I think so far this is great, its responsive and you can tell understeer etc, so tuning shouldnt be too hard. over all i'm very impressed, and I'l recommend it on the brief anount of game play I have had. after all I have paid for racing games that I have really regretted. I cant think of many free racing sim games better than this.			"

												I play GTR2 and I'm a die hard race sim faqn.  I've had a great time with this title so far, and you certainly can't beat the price.  FREE.  I think it's built on the same engine as r-factor and gtr series, so it has the wicked FPS you'd expect on modern hardware, but the track side detail and textures are certainly closer to next-gen.  Highly recommended!			"

												With extensive experience in just about every Sim since the original Microprose Grand Prix games, includng time in earlier iterations of GSC, I really only needed half an hour of hotlapping to know exactly what you get with tis title.This is solid racing title, based and built on a tried and true, if ageing engine by a studio witha great reputation.And it is free.Having read some of the negative reviews, I have only come to the conclusion that they have been written by those with limited sim experience, who believe that plugging in an xbox controller and expecting to be able to drive this is the way to go.No.Get a wheel. Otherwise you are gimping yourself of any drivability and you will miss out on just how good titles such as this can be.Control of your inputs, smooth accceleration, controlled braking, finesse in the steering is what these titles are designed for. Pressing A to go and X to stop is just...wrong.You get a handful of cars and tracks for your money...which is $0, and that gives you enough content to keep a driver satisfied for sometime. Learing how each car drives, and then mastering it whilst learning all the intricacies of a trackis what you do here. It is not a matter of ""Grats Dude! You just drove 3 laps in Shiny Supercar A, not go take Extra Shiny Super Car B for a spin! Put it on Youtube!""Pro points:All content free.Nice cars.Good tracksTried and tested engine.Great FFBCons:Whilst engine is good, and you will get super high FPS, it is a touch dated. Bring this into a next gen engine and Sim drivers will need to clean the white stains off their undershorts.Thats about it for the cons really.Titles such as this, for free, and others you can get pretty cheap these days, such as GTR2, the Race series, Rfactor 1 are still very enjoyable, great to drive and extrememly entertaining.If you are new to simming and looking for titles to cut your teeth before investing more heavily, and you have a half decent FFB wheel, get this. Then go buy Stock Car Extreme.			"

												I stumbled across this game when I accidentally opened steam while trying to open the logitech profiler (Which was next to steam on the task bar.) Best mistake ever.Pros1. Realistic handling. The way the handling operates is brilliant. The understeer and lift off oversteer that you would get from a front wheel drive touring car are so accurate that it's unbelivable.2.  Compatibility with slower computers. My computer has 4GB of ram and a 1.4GHz processor. Not one problem with the smoothness of the game and the graphics aren't even that bad. Why do you need any better graphics thn this, it might look cool but really the graphics in this are just fine3. IT'S FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!Cons1. Takes a while to set up, First I didn't realise it had defaulted with all assists on and the controls were with the keyboard. Once I made the wheel work and turned off the assists the force feedback was steering the car for me so I then realised about negative force feedback, which solved my problem.2. Strange AI behaviour and bad penalty system on the formation lap the AI are extremely slow and when I tried out the rolling start the AI started overtaking each other and the saftey car on the formation lap. When I tried to test the damage module I went straight down the inside of another car at full speed destroying their car (and not mine) I only got a warning.In summary I will say this quickly. GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!			"

												as a freebie i have no complaints about this game.I am not the best at driving gamesand as i just bought a g27 thought i would look for a game to learn my wheel on.So first i amjust using settings where the wheel does the gear changes and i do the braking and slowly i am getting the hang of it.On the game itself the graphics are not it's strong suit but as a person who was 18 when pong was released i have seen very low graphics over the years and one thing i have learned the best graphics don't always make a good game.My only complaint for me is when i first played i got motion sickness due to the bouncy car and only being able to look through the windscreen then i got in to the settings and that solved that problem.Are there better looking games out there of course there is but for what you are getting for FREE i think this game is ace.

In any event, it forces 800 x 600 rendering which is slightly less than ideal, even for a basic DX9 application.This odd low-res graphics issue aside, - the game is a great, down to earth simmy racer.

												UPDATE: If you liked this free game and want to take a look at the full game, Stock Car Extreme, go to the game's website downloads[game-stockcar.com.br] page and there you can download the entire 7.1 GB game for a free 60 minutes trial. On the same web page is a Lite version demo, it includes the same car, but with only two tracks. The good news is that this 30 day demo, rather than sixty minutes, and it's only 2.1 GB. Original ReviewThis is a nice game that is essentially an in-depth demo for Stock Car Extreme, another racing game from the same publisher. It's very detailed with nice features like in-depth car set-up, in-race adjustments like brake bias and lots of other realism settings. It supports a variety of racing wheels, but I did just fine with my X360 controller. The graphics are a bit dated,  but better than GTR or Race 07, which it very much will remind you of if you have played those game. The nice thing about the less than bleeding edge graphics is that you don't need an uber-rig to run the game at a nice rock solid 60 fps. There are plenty of in-cockpit and other views, and a replay feature too.There are six tracks included, including a nice ""square"" oval that is a good training ground for new drivers. There are all sorts of options when racing as well. Opponents can be set to any number up to sixteen, you can select rolling or standing starts, and you can also decide whether to include practice as well as qualifying sessions. Races can be run against a clock or by completion of a number of laps. Tire wear and fuel use can be set to normal or can be multiplied to simulate a longer session. AI driver skill can be adjusted, as well as their aggression level. This is a nice racing game even if you had to play a few dollars for it, but for free? It's a no-brainer, download it and give it a try.			"

												The simple and honest FACT about this game is, that it IS infact just rFactor1.  With a rearranged and revamped UI skin.  Once you pass the first screen its painfully obvious what you are playing because no matter how you skin it, rFactor, stands out from its other clones like Race 07 and all of its variants.   The time favored menu options are still here.  Now the dead giveaway for me was the garage and its tuning options. The UI is so annoying and confusing to navigate to accomplish whatever tuning or changes you wish to make.  Loading out onto the track was like a joke. It screamed GTMAX world touring car mod (a rFactor user made mod) from 2011. Same Toyota, however this Focus version is new, seen this Lancer before.   Although these modders make a better default cockpit view. Its more like looking through a person with two eyes , than that narrow perspective♥♥♥♥♥rFactor ""I must have only one eye"" FOV. The controls by far, hands down, are a billion times more understandable and appreciated over rFactors♥♥♥♥♥♥for sensory feed back.   It seems like rFactor was geared towards idiots with logitech wheels, and not really followed by people with actual quality made devices.   As if the modder community just are a bunch of blow hards.  I do play rFactor  as a die hard fan, since it came out. But what I say is true.     This game without even touching any settings I chose to set out onto the track to see how ""factor"" like it was, and was proven wrong.  I was so happy to see that my first turn, that i said to myself ""this is just about how i would steer if I were sitting in this car"" actually gave the car the direction I wanted.       Excellent job guys. That alone is something to cheer about.  Though being an rFactor fan, it makes me wonder if the settings we see and the choices that are configured in the .PLR file are set with some options that are in place to create that superb handling.  Such as the fact that I cannot do anything about my infant drivers weak♥♥♥♥♥neck and his floppy loppy head banging around in the cockpit.  That♥♥♥♥♥♥is so wrong for one god damn reason. Yes G forces will batter your head from side to side, but, our amazing ""anti skip technology"" built in to our eyes, prevents us from having that unuseable sight of vibration.  Eyeballs let us look to the side without moving our heads. They allow the head to move without the area we are viewing to pan tilt or skew whilst our heads move along dang near any axis.     If my noodle neck driver could just hold his head still, (and option in all other games using this sim engine) it would be so much more fun to play.  But as  I inspected the games files I am to belive they acomplish their handles by using a slightly different approach. And I think its that they use the games physics engine in a different way. I believe this game bases the cars handles off of the drivers head physics, versus the other games having the .HDV file, the SUSP.pm, the , tires.tbc, and a few other components to configure how your car would feel on the track.      Whatever it is, great job.Questionable though I just find this game after its makers get bought out.You guys going to do a clone port of rFactor 2?That would be awesome if you keep improving the steering experience.  :D			"

												I am by no means a sim racer. A leisurely chilled sim driver maybe, but not a racer.My only gear is an almost ten year old Logitech Formula Force EX wheel with a somewhat flimsy pedal set, but the driving enjoyment I get out of this title, even with such meager equipment, is immense.Reiza Studios is a well-established simulation master, and rightfully so. This is the perfect free promotion for their paid title, Game Stock Car Extreme, which I am thoroughly thinking of buying in the near future.I mean, if a free 1.9 GB download can make me smile like a little boy on Christmas Day, why wouldn't a fully-decked sim with lots of content do the same?Take it out for a spin and you will see what I mean.10/10 without any exaggeration whatsoever.

In any event, it forces 800 x 600 rendering which is slightly less than ideal, even for a basic DX9 application.This odd low-res graphics issue aside, - the game is a great, down to earth simmy racer.

												UPDATE: If you liked this free game and want to take a look at the full game, Stock Car Extreme, go to the game's website downloads[game-stockcar.com.br] page and there you can download the entire 7.1 GB game for a free 60 minutes trial. On the same web page is a Lite version demo, it includes the same car, but with only two tracks. The good news is that this 30 day demo, rather than sixty minutes, and it's only 2.1 GB. Original ReviewThis is a nice game that is essentially an in-depth demo for Stock Car Extreme, another racing game from the same publisher. It's very detailed with nice features like in-depth car set-up, in-race adjustments like brake bias and lots of other realism settings. It supports a variety of racing wheels, but I did just fine with my X360 controller. The graphics are a bit dated,  but better than GTR or Race 07, which it very much will remind you of if you have played those game. The nice thing about the less than bleeding edge graphics is that you don't need an uber-rig to run the game at a nice rock solid 60 fps. There are plenty of in-cockpit and other views, and a replay feature too.There are six tracks included, including a nice ""square"" oval that is a good training ground for new drivers. There are all sorts of options when racing as well. Opponents can be set to any number up to sixteen, you can select rolling or standing starts, and you can also decide whether to include practice as well as qualifying sessions. Races can be run against a clock or by completion of a number of laps. Tire wear and fuel use can be set to normal or can be multiplied to simulate a longer session. AI driver skill can be adjusted, as well as their aggression level. This is a nice racing game even if you had to play a few dollars for it, but for free? It's a no-brainer, download it and give it a try.			"

												It's a decent touring car simulator. And it's free!I recomed for all touring car fans.As I see it's using rfactor engine so it limits the graphics but physics are good.Car is adjustable all ways.Good cars, good tracks, It's fun!			"

												ENGLISH*Its a really nice game but you need at least a steering wheel to play it. Without a steering wheel, controls are really hard.*Graphics are really good and game has real cars and real drivers.*And Its free you cant find easily free games good like this.TÜRKÇE *Gerçekten güzel bir oyun ama oynamak için en az bir direksiyon setine ihtiyacınız var. Direksiyon seti olmadan aracınızın kontrolü çok zor.*Grafikler çok güzel ve gerçek araçlar ve gerçek sürücüler yer alıyor.*Ve oyun bedava bu kalitede ücretsiz oyunlar çok az bulunur. "

												It's a free racing sim. On one hand, you can't beat that price, and it's fairly realistic (with an almost obsessive attention to detail when it comes to car settings). On the other hand, the audio is just kinda there, and the graphics are nothing to write home about. 7/10 give it a shot if you want a sim about touring cars.			"

												I like Race07 and its add on's and I saw this on steam. I pondered for a while - and then said ok I'll try it. When you load the game you need to take a little time to change settings. I changed the gearshift and throttle/brake/left/right and then got to it.Very surprised how good, and how polished this game is. Recommended to ALL car racing players, you deserve this in your collection. Its a shame its single player, but a great game none the less. I really think they did a nice job with this game.  "
