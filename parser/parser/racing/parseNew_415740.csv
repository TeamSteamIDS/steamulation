												Frustratingly fun old school gameplay + physics. The maps are pretty simple and offer a variety of different tasks and minigames, however beating the Gold times and collecting all the hats are challenging and offer a bit of replayability.			"

												As a sarcastic anti-game, OmniBus is a masterpiece in its own right, arguably the best of its kind since landmark cult hit Goat Simulator arrived some years back.Viewed as any other release? Positive-leaning mixed feelings.The concept of a vehicular platformer is a an exceedingly rare novelty in itself. I struggle to think of any other game that defines itself as such, much less so in the way OmniBus dares to present itself. To consider this anything less than commendable would be a disservice.Mind you, that's not to say OmniBus doesn't have its shortcomings; the lack of a camera control makes certain actions harder than they really need need to be, the physics are often far more unpredictable than reasonably anticipated and while the humor works for me, others are likely to put off -- dry sarcasm is very much a love it or hate it sort of thing.The same could also be said for the game's aesthetics; early 90s throwback visuals and bouncy chiptune are right up my alley, but for those unaccustomed to a period when the average game looked and felt no different? Further disappointment.To put it simply: OmniBus isn't a game for everyone. Then again, it isn't trying to be, and maybe that's really what I like about it best, anyway.			"

												It's been a while since I've played a game with as much charm and creativity as this one. Though the story mode might be on the short side, every level offers something different. I was surprised by just how much variety there was, with some game mechanics being created for one level only. The dialogue given to you before and after each level is very enjoyable, and the whole game has a great goofy tone to it. Nothing quite like using a propeller, a firework, a jet engine, and a soda bottle to shoot yourself to the moon.It's not a very easy game, often taking one good hit to force you to restart a level. Fortunately, the stages are short enough and restart quick enough that this isn't really an issue. Though I must admit, having my bus almost jump up and spin around after hitting a tiny snag was frustrating on occasion. Omnibus isn't perfect, but it does have a great feel, especially when your bus of choice reaches over 100 mph. Though it may be short, there is a lot of replay value here. Each level hides a hat to collect, and there are target scores/times to beat in each stage. Not to mention secret areas to find. Plus, free-play mode is great fun - feeling a bit like a Pro Skater game in a bus. You can even challenge up to 4 people to a split-screen bus deathmatch.In short, if you're looking for a few solid hours of silly fun, I'd totally recommend this one.			"

												This game is absolutely nowhere near perfect, but I'm finding it to be very entertaining.Basically the premise is that you're Omnibus, a bus that endlessly accelerates with no brakes that must travel the world, completing challenges and helping people along the way. Yeah, everything about this game is kinda ridiculous but it's actually incredibly funny and charming as a result.Here's the deal though, if you're not into the whole ""whacky physics challenge"" games like Surgeon Simulator or QWOP where part of the entire challenge is just fighting against the game, then you probably won't enjoy this much. Your bus can go flying at the drop of a hat and there's a lot of wrestling with physics and trying to keep your bus under control which can quickly go from funny to maddening. I've gotten stuck on a couple levels and felt quite frustrated, but in the end they don't take too much of your time to play and when you beat them it feels very satisfying, as a challenging game should.Now what's crazy is how incredibly creative the devs got - so far every single level has presented a new, unique challenge from anything before it that is still very fun and interesting, whether that be driving in a top-heavy tour bus trying not to tip over and lose your passengers or driving up the side of a building to knock King Kong off the top. It's very hard but addictive, and the ridiculous stupidity of it all just makes it that much better.With the fact that each level has a gold medal that you can shoot for and there's a local multiplayer mode that looks kinda fun, I can see this game having a ton of replay value, and I'm definitely happy with my purchase. If it looks interesting to you, I say go for it, you'll get a sense of the game pretty quick and you can easily refund if it's not your thing!			"

												I was able to salvage a version of this game for the Atari Jaguar. It wasn't easy getting my hands on it but.. here is my review of it.OmniBus is a simple, fun, challenging, quirky physics game that lets you drive an unstoppable bus. There are three modes currently for the game: First is  Story Mode  which features unique worlds with levels/missions that are very different from each other to complete. There are hidden levels to be found in each world, hidden hats that you can acquire in each level to customize your bus and lastly there are giant evil bosses. Each mission will sometimes provide you with a different bus to use with a unique ability for example a hovering mechanic or a jumping ability to jump across platforms. Each mission also has a ranking system. Finish a mission with the least amount of time to earn the best medal, but let me tell you, it is very challenging and will keep you on your toes trying to go for the gold.The second mode is  Freeplay mode.  this is essentially the sandbox version of the game which lets you choose any world you currently have unlocked as well as the many different unique buses with abilities you can use. You drive colliding with anything in your path while doing stunts and tricks to get a high score.  There are also hidden hats to be acquired in this mode as well. Lastly there’s  Versus mode . This mode is up to 2-4 players. Players get to choose any bus that has been unlocked in story mode along with any hat that has been acquired. Once players have chosen their powerful bus of choice, they are able to select any level to be put up against each other. The objective is simple, to be the last bus standing.. on their wheels of course. It’s up to you if you want to ram other players to make them have a bad day, use the unique ability your bus has to get you back on your wheels or lead them to a bumper and launch them off the stage. The choice is yours.This as well as finding the hidden worlds and getting every hat in story mode and freeplay mode gives this game a good amount of replayability. I will definitely try to 100% OmniBus in completion, but in the end I had to end up getting the Steam version of this game. My Atari Jaguar bit the dust and ended up dying on me.. see?			"

												After 3.4 hours I’ve completed the story mode of Omnibus, which is a rather short but very enjoyable time. If I’d hunt for achievements and had friends to play the versus mode with I would get way more out of it, so I feel like the money I’ve spent is just right for what I got. Mind you, I didn’t pay the full price. Thanks, Nuuvem!The graphics remind me of the PlayStation era and the gameplay recreated a feeling that I had with games like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater back in the day. A game that isn’t necessarily close to what the title advertises, but gives you an arcadey experience - not too hard, not too easy and no matter how often you fail, it’s never frustrating.If I had to compare it to modern games it would join the ranks of games like Goat Simulator, Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread. Not because the mechanics are unique like in I Am Bread, but because it’s goofy, doesn’t take itself seriously and relies heavily on weird physics, which serve for funny moments here and there.The story mode is a collection of mini games. Structured like an old school platformer and seperated into different worlds. Each level is idiosyncratic and guarantees that you don’t get sick of the gameplay at any time. Of course some levels are better than others, but it maintains a certain quality that doesn’t exhaust you.And there’s a little Pony Island WTF moment later in the game which suprised me.Overall Omnibus is just a really stupid game and I mean that in the best way possible. It’s exactly what I was hoping for. A game you just play for quick fun, rather than a challenge or an immersive story. It’s not the best game ever made, but it didn’t disappoint me either.Review taken from my backlog profile.[backlog-deepness.rhcloud.com] "

												Omnibus... is a game. It's a somewhat obnoxious, but endearing game. I know this may seem like an odd start to a review, but it's genuinely the most straightforward description I can give. Graphically it isn't anything special. It looks almost like something you'd see on the N64 or maybe the Jaguar, everything is rather blocky and very simply textured. Fortunately however, everything MATCHES this style, and it does blend together fairly cohesively, if only seeming like it's trying a bit too hard to look ""retro"" at times. This is probably most notable with the text boxes, more specifically with the pictures of the people talking; they're often just standard pictures, just incredibly shrunken, and with the whole ""90's Mouth"" thing going on; just flapping while they talk. Soundwise it's fairly basic. The music is just a small selection of chiptunes that match the current environment (IE; In the Space Levels it's rather 80's/90's Sci-Fi sounding, while in the Wild Wild West levels it's rather... well, American Western sounding.) They get repetitive after a while, but they do their job well enough, and there's enough variety to keep you from noticing how repetitive they are until around the 4th world or so. Luckily, if it isn't your cup of tea, you can just mute the music in the options menu and run some other music in the background if you want. The Bus you're driving makes engine noises(?) as it drives, and most hazards make a fitting noise. Bumpers make a pinball bumper noise, TNT/TNT Barrels make an explosion noise, that sort of thing. Gameplay wise? You're a bus. There are no brakes, so you're constantly speeding up. You try to accomplish your goal for the stage with those limitations in mind. Oh and physics. You want to know how i'd describe the physics? Imagine someone trying to put realistic physics on the N64. That's this game's physics. Mind you, that's part of the joke/challenge, and it works at first. The first world, other than the first stage (which is surprisingly harder than the rest of world 1) is fairly easy. It eases you into the physics being like they are, it teaches you some important mechanics (such as the fact that you can use a different bus on some stages! And that different bus can do different things!) It has a fairly easily obtained secret star to show you how unlocking secret levels works. And it even has a fairly easy bossfight, to show you that the game's bossfights are a bit less than bog standard. World 2 is fairly similar in that regard; still not ridiculously hard, but amping it up just a little. World 3, however, is where the joke starts wearing thin. Instakill glass walls (that are fortunately absent from the later worlds, other than one instance in World 5) surround every level, and bumpers start being more frequent. Still, you're introduced to one of the most fun alternate buses in the game, and it's genuinely still fun. World 4 is where the joke grinds to a halt in favor of frustration. You used to the weird physics yet? No? Have fun robbing a train that has some of the worst, most glitchy physics in the entire game, on a VERY strict time limit. Enjoy that? No? Well, what about having to VERY CAREFULLY grab Barrels that look the EXTREMELY SIMILAR to TNT Barrels? That are SURROUNDED by TNT Barrels? No? Have fun. World 5 is more of a ""look back"", in that it gives you one level that's basically just a rather hard level using the mechanics from a previous world, but it IS less obnoxious for the most part than World 4. Then, you have the final boss, and the game is over. Oh, and there's hats, because... all buses wear hats? IDK, since it's published by Devolver Digital they could add a Shotgun-Kin hat from Enter The Gungeon, so that's cool i guess. Overall, Omnibus is a rather frustrating but enjoyable game. It certainly isn't for everybody, that's for sure. However, if you can tolerate the bad physics and the somewhat repetitive nature of it, there's honestly a lot of heart and soul put into it. This is one of those moments i wish steam reviews had a Neutral option; while I really enjoyed it, that doesn't necessarily mean everyone will, it's definitely a game only for those who can tolerate the physics and look past them.

												this game is basically Dark Souls of the bus genre. After 5 minutes you'll be frustrated as heck as you repeatedly lose over and over as the game punishes Omnibus... but then an hour later you'll find yourself mastering the mechanics and feeling good about your bus-driving skills.... only to advance to the next level, get a new bus and have to re-learn everything from scratch. You'll swear and curse and throw your hands up- you may even smash your keyboard - but when you go to bed that night and are on the way to sleep.... that bumping soundtrack, those endlessly turning wheels on the bus, those hilarious problems people keep asking Omnibus to solve... this will play in your head as you drift off. When you wake up in the morning you will know, there is only love for Omnibus.			"

												This game was fun... most of the time. The level design was great and the story was funny. The graphics look really nice and it was addicting. Be warned this is a rage game and that is my main problem with it. The controls for when you are flying need A LOT of work. Right now if you are spun into the air the controls might as well not be there. It is basically just comes down to luck if you will land upright, this needs to change and being flung through the air is one of the main components of the game. Please also let us control the yaw while in the air. Other than that this was a fun game and I would recommend it even with the problems it has.			"

												Omnibus is a lot of fun!  It's a very simple game, and it provides a very simple kind of fun.  There's not much to do unless you decide to attempt to collect all the hats in the game.  It could use to be a lot longer (and thusly give you a lot more to do) but other than 'lack of content' this game doesn't commit any other sins.  It's a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed it.  Some of my friends said it got boring or repetitive or it was too short, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.  Try it out!  I'm still trying to collect all the hats!			"

												Omnibus is a good game, that would be better if with tighter mechanics. I get the joke of having wonky physics or a bus that easily flips over, but you're going to spend a lot of time in air not playing the game and landing upside down to start the level over from instant death. The joke wears thin quickly.The joke of odd physics is way funnier when something looks initially real, or when something is going right like racing well in Burnout only to crash into a million pieces. The graphics here are Jaguar level and the bus is too unwieldy to feel like you're doing well.Imagine if rather than being qwop/happy wheels inspired this game played with the tightness of controls Rocket League has. The levels could be scaled to be harder and you'd have a more fun game, one that was overall less frustrating.Omnibus is still a good game though. It's really varied in terms of level type, and the final boss even has you use all the basic mechanics to beat the game (something that many modern games forget to do.) You can also skip any level which is nice if you get fed up. I beat the game at 5 hours skipping 2 levels.I'd really like them to take another shot with this concept. Take the silliness out of the controls and put it into more of their inventive level ideas!			"

												As a physics-defying bus with no brakes, accomplish a variety of tasks that generally involve either crashing into or avoiding crashing into things. The physics are wonky by design, which can be a lot of fun in the early levels, and I'm sure is a blast in the multiplayer that I've yet to try, but can be a bit frustrating in the later levels where you're likely to have more than a few retries because the bus decided to spaz out and do a triple-flip instead of driving however you needed it to to clear the level.If you don't mind that bit of random luck factor in your physics/obstacle course type games, or if you're just looking for a fun time-waster to play on the big screen with some friends, you'll definitely enjoy it.

 A ball of chocolate with a spicy pepper in the middle.	The opening levels are fun and quirky and the game has a ton of charm and personality, taking the simple gameplay notion of a bus that can't slow down or stop and making every single kind of mini game they can with that concept, set to a cheery 8 bit soundtrack, a visually striking PS1 art style and some genuinely chuckle-worthy writing.However, the charm wears off FAST, as the later levels ramp up the challenge by adding in new gameplay quirks, new obstacles, new mechanics, and a ungodly amount of trial and error. For example, in World 4 (I do not know how many overall worlds there are), there is a stage that asks you to drive a bus that can jump first across several cliffs, then onto a draw bridge separated into the three pieces you must jump between that will sway RIDICULOUSLY fast completely upside down if you are even a milimeter off center, THEN you have to jump from the bridge, probably at a terrible angle, into a literal minefield stacked with TNT crates so densely that it's nearly impossible even with full control to avoid them, and if you somehow make past all that there is STILL MORE as there is a nest of moving bumpers and possibly even another challenge after that, I ragequited after a solid 20 minutes on that level alone, already upset at an earlier set of levels that implemented a strange gravity mechanic that I had to look up gameplay footage of to understand how to work. Challenges that could make up 3, 4 or even 5 separate levels in other indie platformers are jampacked into checkpoint-less gauntlets that feel like they were designed for rage-based YouTube gameplay videos. The difficulty isn't helped by the physics, either. They are consistent and fully functional, but they are unrealistic and therefore often unpredictable, especially since they change without warning for certain stages. On the ground, the gimmick of never being able to stop, slow or even change the camera goes from amusing to annoying as the difficulty ramps up, as the game demands deliberate forethought while giving you a set of controls that makes such a thing literally impossible, contributing to the aforementioned overall aura of Trial and Error. On the air, the problem is way more excerbated as you have almost zero control over your bus once it's airborne, which leads to a lot of cheap deaths. In a Tony Hawk game, if you bail from a midair trick, it's because you misjudged a half pipe or went for too many flips. If you bail in midair in this game, it's because the game randomly decided to make you spin 21 times instead of 20 and therefore you landed upside down. Given that there's a physics engine, it's not actually random, I'm sure, but it certainly feels like it in certain stages.Now, platforming challenge is platforming challenge, and you might just say I need to 'git gud', but the difficulty - the amount of obstacles on screen, the janky mechanics you have to master with little instruction, the crazy one hit kill spots - genuinely doesn't feel fair after World 2, like I said it seems to go almost entirely into trial and error, in which you can't possibly predict what's next; one hit kill bumpers and explosives are placed inside or behind buildings, completely removed from your view, so that you will literally not be able to react to them on first run unless you single frame reactions. For me, at least, waiting eagerly to see what funny dialogue or cool hat or interesting stage the game was going to throw at me turned into waiting anxiously to see what half-functioning mechanic or overpowered boss or cheap and broken segment the game was going to throw at me. I know Dark Souls comparisons are beyond cliche, but it literally starts to feel like that as one mistake - which is incredibly easy to make for all the reasons listed above - WILL kill you and force you to restart (to the game's credit, there is a dedicated restart button and there isn't any lag between death and restart). The reason for the title of my review - Omnibus seems like it's going to be a short, sweet and charming treat but after the first few layers quickly turns into a chafing, painful ordeal that you only keep soldering through just you can say you did.However, despite all my complaints, I still have it listed as Recommended, as like I said the first few levels still have a ton of charm, and if you're a fan of brutal, masochistic, perfectionism based platformers, (Johns, I am not) you will still love the game. If you aren't, you might still crank some fun out of the multiplayer and the sheer experience, and with the game's low price point (which saves the game honestly, at $20 this would be utter garbage), it's worth a dip if you're curious.

												Like everyone else said, this game is crazy and quirky and fun.  Even though I suck at these physics game, jumping in and out of runs are easy and satisfying.  The large amount of different challenges are hilarious and keep things fresh.  Nostalgic gameplay/visuals with a modern day spin. If you're looking for something to keep you entertained (and challenged) this game is definitely worth the price tag.			"

												I stole 1 million dollars from bank for mafia, then I stole 1.5 million dollars from mafia and gave it back to bank, now who's the bigger thief, see?This game is a lot of fun, but it becomes really frustrating if you try to do some challanging stuff. Also, this game taught me what to do if I was driving a bus, which has no brakes.I give it 9 bumbers out of 10, yes you hit that many bumbers in this game. "

												SPOILER ALERT: You're a bus.I think I have finally reached the point in my gaming career where screaming at the screen is long gone. But I have found myself on many occasions wanting to single handedly disembody my arrow keys and space bar because of omnibus. This game will also make you reconsider your life goals, throw your degree out the door and put an application in for the local elementary school as a bus driver. Lone behold you will withold the power, the power of the bus. And yet I cannot stop playing until I have cultivated all of the corn I have previously planted. DON'T HESITATE TO BUS.			"

												As a minigame collection Omnibus might be fun enough, run through the levels once and see everything neat before uninstalling and moving on to the next game, but if that's the case there's really not enough here to warrant the price tag.So on the other hand, to judge it on the extra content, secret levels, collectibles and time based medal system, the game just becomes unfun.  Losing control of your bus just once means restarting the entire level, because the times are tight and the levels are small and the entire point of the game is that the bus wants to fly through the air and flip a million times.  Trying to take the whole game as it is robs it of what was supposed to be about, instead of wreaking havoc and flipping across a destructible landscape it becomes about staying on the ground and desperately avoiding any props because it means doom.In the future, I would like to see what else these devs are capable of because they have a unique eye and some good ideas.  I just hope their next foray focuses more on gameplay that is unironically good, instead of ironically bad.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game, and played all the way through. It has a sense of humor, which is the prime reason I wanted to like it. But the challenge behind the game is due to poor controls. Rotating the bus in the air is very unintuitive. When the bus rolls it becomes a bouncing super ball with nothing to stop it. The joke about the game being bad went a little too far and became true :(			"

YouTube™ Video: OmniBus (PC, Mac, Linux) - PXA Peeks 

			Views: 88		

			Buy OmniBus DRM-free on GOG and help support the channel: http://gog.pxa.ca In this episode of PXA Peeks, I take a look at PS1-looking, retro inspired, insane physics sandbox...thing, OmniBus.		

OmniBus is insane but in all the best ways. It looks like a PS1 game, couldn't take itself less seriously if it tried and is essentially a bunch of crazy physics minigames and challenges involving a bus that can't stop. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you probably won't like it. If it does, there's a ton of great, stupid fun in here.What I particularly like is that every level in the game is different. You'll never have the same objective twice and you'll essentially have to re-learn each new level. It doesn't take long (at least initially) and you'll improve quickly so nothing ever outstays its welcome, unless you want to go for a gold medal, which is entirely optional. It may be a lot of variations on a theme but those variations are often so drastic that it always feels like you're having fresh experiences.The only thing I wish the game had was leaderboards for the challenge modes. In games focused around score attack, being able to compete against others online is always a blast and I would have liked that.As one would expect based on how the game looks, it runs like butter on even low end systems. The sound design is a little flat but still fits well and things are so goofy, it's not even something you notice that much.OmniBus is a game that knows exactly what it is and the type of gamer is was targeting. It could be less pretentious if it tried and it's not trying to appeal to everyone but to satisfy the niche it's going for. As someone who likes games that revel in absurdity, this appealed to me greatly. If you demand your games be serious, you won't like this but if you just like dumb fun, it has that in spades.			"

												I love quirky games, and interesting concepts. I get what this game is trying to do, and I get the joke.But that's just what it is. It's a joke/gimmick. Ragdoll physics and you're driving a bus, and doing bizarre tasks that you wouldn't normally expect a bus to do.Took me about a half hour to get through the first world, and I can see there are many other worlds to explore.Each level has a unique task, and a different goal.I appreciate that this game is definitely unique, and is not afraid of being what it is, and just having fun with it.But for me, i had enough of it after a half hour. It's not a bad game, so if you're down for some silly fun, go for it. But in general, I probably wouldn't directly recommend it to someone.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter because I liked everything about it.  Fun throw-back graphics, mayhem, destruction, and buses.  What I didn't expect was the sheer difficultly.The first level has you find and destroy 18 Tombs while avoiding bumpers and the edges of the map.  Oh, and your speed increases every couple seconds..  The best I have done is 16, out of an unknown number of attempts during an hour of gameplay.There are many people out there that want a hard game, I'm just not one of them, but you might be.If you want to play the ""Dark Souls of Bus Games"" then buy this and enjoy.  If you're like me and prefer to play a more casual game you might want to take a pass on this.			"

												Omnibus, a game that was supposed to release in 1992, for the Atari Jaguar, (idk if it was released for the atari) and then was cancelled for PC. Half a decade later, they decide to get back to it and release the ancient game for PC. PROS: Many busses to choose from/unlock. Secret busses to find, secret levels,           free play/sandbox, etc. CONS: No level editor/workshop.            Fences and small props that go under your bus can make it go haywire easily. (which is                                                                                                                   actually kinda funny). I'd rate this game a 8/10.

												It's selling on novelty. Simple yet horrendous controls. No tutorial or equivalent. The cheap style of the art and overall experience is somewhat endearing but it does actually represent the slapped-together nature of the game. The music was promising, though, before I binned it. I bought this on the back of Giant Bomb's 'quick look' but it's even rougher to play than watch.			"

												for what this game is, I find it really frusterating to play, the game gives off a very fun quirky vibe and has a good sense of humour, but I feel a game like this should at the best least be fun and feel good to play, and this is just real frusterating. often it feels like failing is 100% out of your control with mission feeling impossible due to no fault on your own. I can commend it for its humour and visuals but this game is just not fun.			"

												The right amount of retro feeling with absurd humor and gameplay makes it a very enjoyable game. It's a short burst of fun that pumped me up like rarely ever. I wish for a new campaign to come out to taste more of the devs weirdness and because you don't even need 3 hours to complete the first one on a first try.While I'm recommending it, I must advise to wait for a sale because, as I said, the game's pretty short in durability unless you want to finish every level with a gold medal and get every hat.
