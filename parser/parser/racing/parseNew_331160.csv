												SERIOUS NOTE - This game only works on some computers. I'm not sure why, so please be careful if you're considering on purchasing this game.Seriously, this is one of the best Disney game I've ever played! And one of the best driving games I’ve ever played :DI love this game!The game is about Lightning McQueen and Cars.The graphics are great. Quite appealing if you ask me. The town looks amazing with a lot of cars roaming around town, the best part is smashing into them and watching them fly and say funny quotes! The town looks like how you would expect it to look in the film. The characters look accurate to what they look like in the film which is pretty cool. The voice acting was totally awesome and pretty funny. For example, as McQueen overtakes a racer, he says ""objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear"", that cracked me up!The game has free roam (best Disney Cars game IMO), you can drive as Lightning McQueen around 3 different areas including Radiator Springs, what I enjoy doing is ramming into other cars and watching them fly while they say funny things xDFree roam is pretty much calm and fun to explore!The story doesn't really cover the film's story, it's kind of based on what happened after the story, so if you haven't watched the film then this game has got some spoilers for you. Spoilers, get it? The wing on the back of a car...?There are a lot of fun tracks to race on and a variety of characters to choose from, from Lightning McQueen to Wingo, and a bunch of paint jobs to customise them with. The characters have different stats like top speed, acceleration, handling etc. The characters' personalities fit perfectly to the film, and they do make races lively with funny and memorable quotes: Like McQueen’s ""KA-CHOW!"" phrase xD   He says it in different ways, he shouts it and whispers it and some of them sound funny to me.The bad thing about character selection is that there are some cars (like Luigi, Sarge and Fillmore etc.) who can race with you, but you can't race as them, so that kinda sucks :(There are fun mini games added to the side, like Mater's Tractor Tipping game, where you have to wake up tractors without waking up getting caught by Frank, and also Sheriff's Pursuit, where you have to pursuit cars while they are moving fast. They are harder than they sound, but they are enjoyable. The bad part is that they are too long and take too much time, like around 10-15 minutes.There are also Piston Cup races, each being 12 laps around. There is also a pit stop mini game with Guido as he changes the tires and refuels the car. But you could only play as the race cars in Piston Cup races, like Lightning McQueen, or Chick Hicks and Doc Hudson etc. not Mater or Ramone (lol) But I guess it makes sense, hence it being a Piston Cup race.Now onto the important part, the gameplay. The cars drive at different speeds and the drifting is handy, although it doesn't look like the drifting in the film, hence the ""turn right to go left"" quote. The wheel still goes in the direction you want to go, so the car just looks like it's making a hard turn instead of actually drifting. The gameplay is really fun, smooth and easy to master each track with various shortcuts.However sometimes the car decides to flip and go upside down if you try to crash yourself, it sounds funny and it makes up for it because it is funny lol.  Making contact with other racers will make your car slower which isn't what I'd expect from a racing game, but they do talk after collision which is a good thing.This game has controller support, so you can play 2 player split-screen multiplayer with your friend, which is a pretty fun addition.This game is friendly towards kids alright? So don't go wrecking other cars lol, because they don't show damage marks like scratches or dents.Or if you want to get straight into the action, use cheat codes to unlock all characters and race tracks and there you have it :Dbtw there are other cheats like unlimited boost which is fun!The soundtrack is amazing by the way, like awesome tracks from Bruno Coon and great music like ""Here I Am"" by the Explosion, and ""Free Ride"" from Edgar Winter Group, the soundtrack is addictive so listen to it if you dare XDThe only bad thing about this PC version (Steam version) is the lighting at night.Because the game is old and wasn't really updated, when playing mini games and races in night, it's too dark to see or drive, which is annoying and is preventing me from fully completing the game. So, I hope that gets fixed soon.The game is pretty and awesome, quite classic! The graphics are pretty good for a 2006 game. I first played it on PS2 and was addicted to it due to its awesomeness! I recommend this to any Cars fan, or racing fan. Because this game is fun!			"

												My favorite video game from all  games that i ever played in my entire gamer life.The nostalgia is just beautiful.The story is happening after the  first movie.The gameplay is very good for a 2006 game.Great memories with this game.If you say ``You suck`` well,you don`t know the old games or the franchise of Cars.Bought with 5$ instead of 20$ in summer  sale and i`m very happy i bought it on my b-day.The levels are good for beginner players of racing games.The free roaming is very interesting.Also you can play Versus mode with your friends Road Races,Mini-Games or Piston Cup Races.I will never forget this amazing game.Also this soundtrack is very nice.If you are looking for racing games you should give it a try to this game.Final note:10/10			"

												Wow... This game is just fantastic. When I first got this, it was my piece of junk PS2 that had a really hard time reading discs, making it really hard to play for longer than an hour. But over 10 years later, with it on my computer, it's even better than I remember. Let's start with some positives:The game is excellently designed. I never found one track that I deemed unfair or too difficult. Even the Piston Cup races were a ton of fun, and that's saying a lot for tracks that are just straightaways and then a left turn.The free-roam is awesome. Seriously, I can drive around the HUB worlds for hours and not get bored.Now onto some negatives:Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the minigames. Some like Sheriff's Hot Pursuit, High Speed Heist, and Lightning Strikes Back are at best OK, but others like Tractor Tipping and Mater's Backwards Lesson get way too hard for their own good, and Doc's Lesson: Powerslide is just way too short. Also, Lizzie's Postcard Hunt is one of the worst scavenger hunts I've ever had to go through in a video game.The control can be kind of awkward sometimes. I occasionally found myself just being flung against the wall for no reason, not turning as sharply as I wanted to even though I was powersliding, and it can just feel really slippery at times.Now this is just a nitpick (and it might just be my computer), but a lot of the textures, mainly the eyelids on the characters (especially Mack), will start flickering at random. The framerate will just suddenly drop at random as well, but again, this might just be my computer.Overall, Cars is a great racing game that definitely worth the £15, and even though it does have a lot of problems, I think you should try it if you haven't already.My rating: 7.5/10			"

												So far no crashes. I have been running it in adim with the old compatablity mode. So if you are wondering does this work. Well mine does on a 4790k,980ti, 16gig ram, and Win 10. Game play is good and is an upgrade to the consoles unlike Cars 2.    Graphics are older but ok However! This game runs at 30fps with no option to turn it off and crashing into things always gives a slight pause in the hub world. You should check out Mater National if you are interested in this. Most of the game is the same but it does not support widescreen. Though it is 60fps! with much better textures. More hub world and new tracks. I perfer over this older verion. That being said the story and racing is all very good. The hub world is also a nice touch.  I still recommend this game because it is fun. And that is the most important thing.			"

												Having played this game extensively when I was eleven to thirteen, when I found out that the game was available on Steam, I just had to get it. However, there is something terribly wrong: the game isn't compatible with Windows 10 which prevents me from playing it at all. It will load with no problem whatsoever, but once I select to play story mode or arcade mode, it will load for about two seconds before finally crashing. I have done this with the same result three times already. I really don't want to give this game a negative review for two reasons: I loved it when I was younger and I haven't played it on this platform yet. But I am left with no choice. I would like to ask for a refund for the game (a full twenty dollars), but I would rather see this game be fixed so that I can be able to play it again, because it is a really fun and interactive game. Hopefully, something is done about this and I, along with other people having this problem, can play it soon.			"

												Story: The Game picks up after the Movie Ends, As Lightning McQueen You must get ready for another Piston Cup Season.  Now with The King Retired it's Chick vs McQueen this time Around.  The story is basic & very forgettable, But hey, At least I have won all the Piston Cup Races. (6.5)Gameplay: THQ & Rainbow Studios made this game a free roaming Open World environment Which is Awesome, But the Controls are weird.  There are Unlockable Mechanics such as Turbo, Powersliding, Tilting, & BACKWARDS DRIVING LOL, Sorry, I had to.  Then again, This game is a Racing game, So there are alot of Races.  (8)Graphics: The Car Models are Really good, But the textures look Low Quality.  The Map of Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, & Tailfin Pass look Really good too.  I also love the Game excllusive Characters.  (7)I'm glad this Game Worked on my Computer.  And I also have the XBox 360 Version.Final Score: 8.5/10 (Good game, But Lacks some of that PIXAR Magic that made the Movie Great.)			"

												My nephew was so hyped about this game but once he started playing he didn't like it because he said the buttons were hard to memorize. After i played it a bit i realized that the keyboard controls make absolutely no sense. DO NOT BUY ON PC!			"

												This was one of my very first PC games, and I remember playing it on my mom's computer whenever I could. Unfortunately, I lost the disc somewhere in my old house, and I never found it ever again. After almost a decade of searching, I've finally found it here on steam, and it's just as good as it has always been.			"
