												//Neweer Updated Review (11/27/16)TL;DR: Decent IO game with server problems and a clunky UI. Theres worse, but there's better. Don't recommend because it still needs a lot of work in the state it's in currently.So I sat on this game for a while, just hoping the devs would update it and fix some of the points that i brought up in my older review (below) and for the most part, the game has been changed for the better. First off, it seems that they fixed the stupid glitch where you die to your own trail sometimes, which was ""game breaking"" basically. This could be false but from the time I played after the updates, it seems to be true. There is also now competetive edge which is long overdue. Killing others gives you more points and there are kill streaks apparently, but I never witnessed any. Floating around the map are powerups that you can use to your advantage too, ie double points and triple length trail. The UI is still clunky, but whatever, that's not much more than a peev of mine. The gameplay is improved in total now with how the game works which is nice (now there's a spawnpoint, and there's goals). Really the only thing Ia still have beef with is the population of the servers, which I know isn't really in the devs control, but it still is a real pity, and just the servers in general. People stutter around like crazy, it's laggy, albiet better than before, but still laggy, and the scoreboards are pretty whack, sometimes not displaying the names of anyone. In total, if you like .io games, there are better ones, but there are worse. For what it is, it isn't a steaming pile of crap, but it isn't the opposite either, it's just kinda meh, and that's why I don't really recommend it. (Also I just really am not a fan of io games, I just really like the dev and love to see his work, Hi Kas ~).//Old Review (Still Kinda Relevant)Well, you tried I guess you can say. This game is VERY buggy to the point that it's unplayable at times. If you make too sharp of turns, you'll die in your own trail. The trail collision system is just broken and I frequently saw people just passing through them like they weren't even there. I don't know if this is server issues or just faulty code, but it's a problem none the less. With the trails, sometimes they just don't even work. They'll appear atrophied and stretched, or get slanted somehow and it's just weird. The customization feature is fine, but it's a janky selection screen that would be better as a list possible because it's hard to find the specific car you want to use without cycling through the whole thing. Finally, my real gripe with this game is that there really isn't much of a competetive edge like other .io games have, and pull of much nicer. There is literally from what I have seen zero reason to seek out and destroy other players. There isn't much people playing for one, the most I saw was nine, others don't really seek you out, or you're just too fast to ever get caught in a trap, and it's just not fun. I mean, I got bored and quit before even hitting the ten minute mark and that's saying something.Fix these bugs/server issues, optimize the UI's, tweak the gameplay and this could be a decent tron like .io game, but right now it's just not.

												How many of you guys remember the old game Snake?  How many people tried a variant called Slither.io (an MMO version of Snake)?   That's exactly what this game is...though some have associated this as Tron's light cycles, which isn't incorrect either.That being said, is an in-depth analysis necessary?   Not really.  ""Pellets"" (or ""Fuel cells"") are collected and increase your speed in increments each 10 pellets, maxing out at a score of 100.  It's nice to see that this person tried to make an MMO game, though....but all the ""Youtuber"" skins is completely unnecessary and comes off as ""Suck-up-ish"".  At least there's free achievements, though.The previous ""Random Death"" bug seems to be fixed based on recent experiences (latest play was 12/15/16) and a few changes have been added.  These changes include a clear spawn-point that kills if you touch it along with items and a chargeable boost.  I could never figure out what the ""X3 Corner"" item was supposed to do.  Unfortunately, the game's life is still limited as you'll find yourself bored after 5-15 minutes of playing.  The only possible bug I could point out at this point in time are users that appear to drive directly through my trail, which doesn't make much sense...especially since I can only crash when I try to test out the theory of this working under any circumstance.Sadly, the original game already exists.  What the hell is with all these "".io"" games anyway?  Can somebody explain?3/10  Good concept, though the game already exists for the same price (Free)...and gets pretty boring relatively quickly.

												You know how the main appeal of .io games is that you're supposed to kill other players to level up faster? Apparently the devs missed that memo, because in this game there's no reason whatsoever to be anywhere near other players....Although it's supposedly been fixed now. I guess this review is outdated.			"

The Lightbikes are currently in the shopGame is Free, has achievements and free steam cards. Sounds good right! Well....Update (25/10/2016)I got to 130 score and randomly died. I didn't hit a border wall, I didn't hit my own trail and there was no one around me when I looked at the minimap as well as on screen. 2nd time it happened there was only one other person in the game and I randomly died with no one else in sight.... I managed to get to 500 on the 25th without dieing when there was no one else in the server so It appears to be a player related issue. Was going to farm some cards as the game offers them but when I checked how many you get it says 0 cards remaining out of 8? I haven't even recieved 1 card yet so I assume thats also broken right now :/I did get 100% achievements in this to add to my list of 100% game so it wasen't a complete loss but I also cannot reccomend it still as the multiplayer is to broken at the moment & there is no reason to PvP which is pretty much the whole reason of .io games.- Multiplayer doesn't work well with random deaths, no reason or reward for PvP3/10 "

												Racecar.io is a free to play Online Multiplayer Light Cycles like game.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  You can graze on dots for score. You can kill yourself by hitting your trail, the walls of map or other players trails. Pick up a powerup to increase your speed. You have several cars unlocked and you can get others for free, but the game sells cars packs to support the game devs.  You can play for free.  You only have 1 life to live in the huge map.  Very low replay value.  Has some easy Steam achievements. Another game with dot IO ending of the name. Try it and delete it. For more info:

												This game does not deserve all of the hate it gets. This is one of the better .io games. There are a lot of crap .io games. Yes it is true as of now there are some bugs but if you encounter them, they are not game breaking. Racecar.io is a mix between Tron (light cycles), Snake, and Agar.io. It has some fun mechanics and some are experimental. The games does not feel rushed at all to be honest. Overall it is a fun game to pick up and play every now and then.			"

												Racecar.io is an MMO version of Snake. It's fun, the players are on a fairly balanced stage and it's not too difficult to get all of the achievements, especially if the game is pretty empty while you learn the mechanics. Initially you will probably hit yourself a few times because the trail you leave behind is wider than you, so if you don't predict it, you'll crash a lot.There's not much to say here other than that it's multiplayer Snake, bugs aren't too common, the worst thing that happened was someone with 500 ping outmaneuvering me when my trail clearly hit him. You're at the mercy of anyone with crappy internet, if you start encountering these people, just stay far away on the other side of the map and let them do their thing.Overall, a quick, fairly fun 100% that can be accomplished in under 10 minutes			"

												Racecar.io is a deceptively simple looking cartoon racing game, but quite tricky to play in practise, particularly since you're playing against real people who cut you off and kill you with their trail. However, I ended up being my own worst enemy in most games, since your own trail can kill you too!  I enjoyed the ""cardinal points"" steering system once I got the hang of it. All around, and enjoyable game.Make up your own with the gameplay

												Alright, I've personally never written a review on a game. But I feel I need to with this monstrosity.This game is literally unfinished. I was playing it and NOTHING worked as seen in the trailer.For one, as I noticed others stated in their reviews, collision detection is mediocre at best.Players pass through the ""tail"" as if it doesn't exist, and otherwise seem to die randomly for no reason.The resolution is abysmal, and cannot be changed, at least from what I saw (locked at 640 x 400), which results in the game generally looking like pixelated garbage.Everything in the game seems to have to have some tie to a youtuber, most of which I've never even heard of?PewDiePie, for example. I've heard of him.But then, I see ""PhoneCat"" Who the hell is phonecat?If I had to pay ANY money for this, I'd call it a shameless cashgrab, cashing in on the .IO series of games. Thankfully, it's 100% free, so I have no regrets playing this.As a public beta? A game with absolutely no ""I'm finished"" flair to it? I'd find this perfectly acceptable.But it's not. It's supposed to be a finished product.I've yet to attempt to try the mobile version of the game. It might be in better condition. But this PC port is horrid.I do NOT recommend playing this. If it's better on android/IOS, play it on there, not here.Personally, I find the .IO games better on mobile anyways. It's where they belong.Anyways, with that said, Developers. Take this as advice. BUG FIX the game. Don't just translate the code. And listen to the people pointing these glaring issues out. Fix them, and also, add in an actual racing mode of sorts, where you use the tail to obstruct your opponents as you try to finish. That would be MUCH more fun than going in circles picking up dots.Toodles~			"

												a simple io game designed to appeal to io fans, spazzy youtube midgets and normies. It is fairly casual and it's only good purpose is to give people like me a boner for getting 100% achievements.			"

												Don't bother with this game if you're planning to play Online.Pros:-Play VS Bots (I think about 7-8 Spawn)-Online Gameplay-Great looking sprites, Colorful gameplay.-Ability to trap other players just like other games that's already been created online multiple times. (slither.io)-Getting Achievements just for liking a facebook Page, and subscribing to a Youtube Channel. (And I think also following a Twitch Channel. The only 3 achievements I have not gotten.)-Music seems pretty good. (Even though it loops.)-Ability to change your game size window/and Graphics upon booting the game up.-Choose multiple car styles.Cons: -When you've died and you go back to the 'enter your username' it's glitched. I can't erase my previous username.-Don't bother playing Online. Latency is no good. You'll trap cars and they'll go right through your line. No point at all unless you're away from them and collecting those little blocks/circles.-Music Loops, can get annoying at times.-You'll end up accidently killing yourself for unknown reasons.-Online Gameplay - A random car will end up lagging in front of you, getting you killed.Overall Rating:Controls:  10/10 - Reason why i'm giving this a 10/10 is because they function on how they're suppose to be functioning.You turn left, it'll go left ect. After all you only got 4 keys to push. So that's a perfect. Saw no problems with them.Game Display: 10/10 - Reason why this is a 10/10 is because it gives you multiple displays to choose from upon booting the game up. This was done well.Online Gameplay: 2/10 - I'm being generous here giving it a 2. Reason why it gets a 2 is because, you can actually play with other players, and there is usually 3-7 players online. That's it.Final Input: Don't bother, unless you want quick achievements. in terms of those 3 that i've listed above.			"

												This game could be some casual fun, were it not for the fact that you can die randomly. The .io games are based around collecting points and screwing other players over your large trails that increase as you gobble up points (think mobile phone Snake, but multiplayer), but when the game arbitrarily feels like sabotaging your entire progress, what's the point?Avoid.

												Overall a very fun and addicting game. It would be nice to see a currency system with buyable cars. All except for some minor bugs this game is awesome. I do have a bug where i randomly die i would hope to see that fixed. Great potential. Would reccomend to others.			"

												Netcode isn't good. Lots of lag. I don't really like the fact that you can turn so sharp you hit the front of your own body but that could be a gameplay choice that they made instead of an oversight. Gamepad only works by pressing a button to turn right or left instead of having directional pad work like you would think. Basically forces you to use the keyboard.Lastly there are acheivements for sharing the game on social media which is an aweful thing to do.			"

												Racecar.io is fun, it reminds me of playing Snake on my 3310, ahh good times! On Racecar.io you can either play online or against bots. The only downside at moment is, you randomly die! Hope they fix this in near future, other than that good game. ~ 6/10			"

												So let's see herePROSLots of skinsA lot are already unlockedMusic and Sound EffectsLike the conceptOffline ModeTrail can kill youCONSNo Prestonplayz skin ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING METhere is no variation in the amount of points you getCamera bugSometimes say you aren't online when you areNo punishment for players with more points from what I can seeSo overall, this was a toughie to choose, but Im gonna say not recommended, because  it is bland and there isn't really anything unique about it except the online mode, tbh I would prefer Emoji.ioAnd props to you creator for commenting on my video about the game! Although I literally said in the video the game kinda sucks but thanks for having a good sense of humor! :)			"

												(Edit) AH HAH! You fixed the random invisible trail/dying glitch! SO HAPPY! Except now there is a glitch where really high scores do not register for some reason.. EXAMPLE i just carefully scored a 592 and yet my high score says (0) above the little twitter, YT FB icons. HOW COME? i've noticed this on multiple occasions of getting any high score btw not just this one instance.I like the new particles, the name displays, and the trail kill system. i am NOT crazy about the the new speed boost system though. it's OK, I guess -everyone being at the same lowish speed, then grabbing ten bits for a well timed SPEEDY ESCAPE or ""reck"". However, I liked the old method probably even better, of gradually getting faster with the more bits you eat. So I miss it.. MAYBE mix the two somehow? Find a balanced medium? I am still loving this game, it is wonderful! Great! and a good time passer. Super fun and I am looking forward to it's progression! Only other things I can think to add is i still think a weekly reset leaderboard (or some leaderboard) and easier car customizations would ROCK.			"

												Racecar.io is a Slither.io clone, Keeping to basic principles of classic snake game of old.Pros:-Free, with easy achievements-Small download size, not taking up too much space on your harddriveCons:-Does not offer much in terms of content-Still extremely buggy, with trails not working properly, incosistent connection to servers, point errors, etc.This game could've been a lot more fun without the bugs, at the moment, not really all that enjoyable.4/10			"

												Alright, I've personally never written a review on a game. But I feel I need to with this monstrosity.This game is literally unfinished. I was playing it and NOTHING worked as seen in the trailer.For one, as I noticed others stated in their reviews, collision detection is mediocre at best.Players pass through the ""tail"" as if it doesn't exist, and otherwise seem to die randomly for no reason.The resolution is abysmal, and cannot be changed, at least from what I saw (locked at 640 x 400), which results in the game generally looking like pixelated garbage.Everything in the game seems to have to have some tie to a youtuber, most of which I've never even heard of?PewDiePie, for example. I've heard of him.But then, I see ""PhoneCat"" Who the hell is phonecat?If I had to pay ANY money for this, I'd call it a shameless cashgrab, cashing in on the .IO series of games. Thankfully, it's 100% free, so I have no regrets playing this.As a public beta? A game with absolutely no ""I'm finished"" flair to it? I'd find this perfectly acceptable.But it's not. It's supposed to be a finished product.I've yet to attempt to try the mobile version of the game. It might be in better condition. But this PC port is horrid.I do NOT recommend playing this. If it's better on android/IOS, play it on there, not here.Personally, I find the .IO games better on mobile anyways. It's where they belong.Anyways, with that said, Developers. Take this as advice. BUG FIX the game. Don't just translate the code. And listen to the people pointing these glaring issues out. Fix them, and also, add in an actual racing mode of sorts, where you use the tail to obstruct your opponents as you try to finish. That would be MUCH more fun than going in circles picking up dots.Toodles~			"

												Honestly, before I say anything, not many people play this game. It gets very lonely fast. During my gameplay I had some people join in. But they Left in the first minute. I guess they thought it was boring or something of the sort. Honestly guys. If you like this game share, spread the word so it can get better, and not be so lonely. People who dislike this game, Share it also, because if you don't, how will your problems with the game get fixed?I sat on my but playing this game and played this game for no more than 15 minutes and earned all the achievements. I must say the sharing achievements are a bit bugged. But other then that. The gameplay is good. Just wish there were more people on. Overall, if you have a friend or something that would like to play or played this game and liked it. It would be alot more fun with people playing with you. As I said before. Very lonely thats why we need to spread the word of this game. It will get alot more fun in the future because I believe it has potiential. Well thanks for reading. Do Spread the Word.

												I've had some fun with this one! Very glitchy though. You'll be driving along and all the sudden BAM invisible wall out of no where. It also sucks when you're trying to cut someone off and the go right through you wall, then go sideways and cut you off and you crash... Could be polished up a bit. I don't understand the obsession with youtubers... Oh well, good times for a little while and easy enough. Ahh the memories of snake...			"
