												I like the idea of this game. But that's where good things ends.Concept demo shows absolutely nothing. It shows less than screenshots. I probably would fund it if there was good concept with gamplay mechanics, narrative or visuals to catch my attention. But sadly there are none.And last remark. You did Vive version wrong. Instead of putting cart into center of room-scale you should attach it to seated position. That's how all seated games made for the Vive.Most of the Vive owners couldn't try your demo because of it. They don't have keyboard and mouse in the centre of roomscale space. I personally configured steam controller for this. But it's no excuse or how it should be.			"

												First of all i try the normal Version and the VR-Version. If you play it normal on your monitor its a really good game. Yes some bugs should be fixed but overall a fun game. But then i try the VR-Version and it was horrible. But at first i have to say this game needs really badly a Controller Support because with mouse and keyboard its really, really, really bad! Ok it looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome in VR but there so many bugs you wont play it again. Some keys and your mouse wont work in VR. So i cant shoot or anything else... In VR when i jump, it jumps out of the world. Really scary. When you slow down really slow, the game running not smooth anymore, its laggy. I mean i got 180fps, so its the game. In VR and in normal this is laggy on slow movement. Also the popping up trees in the distance really destroys your immersion. And yeah, there is the sound/music-bug you already know. But i belive in you all you get this fixed and it will be a really awesome game! :)***This game was running on i7-4790k; MSI GTX 1080; 8GB 2400MHZ RAM; Oculus Rift***			"

												Audio plays faster or slower based on the speed of the cart. The speed of the cart keeps changing following ups and downs of the terrain. The result is a soundtrack that gives a headache. I think it would work a lot better if only the beat was changed, not the pitch.In VR, you can't recenter the view on your current position. So if your desk/chair is not centered (Vive), you'll get a stiff neck on top of the headache.You need 3 hands: one for the mouse, one for the Q/A/S keys, one for the arrow keys.Graphically, textures are poor. It's not bad for the terrain when moving but it's really ugly when stopped and on the character and cart.Objects pop all over the place.But at least it's fluid (~200FPS on my GTX 970)In VR, when jumping, one goes through the ground when ""landing"", then back in the sky, the ground, ... ad nauseam.I'm sorry Exosyphen, but this doesn't make we want to fund the game (although to be honest, I wouldn't have anyway, it's not the type of game that I fund).

												That was really bad. It fails to be a tech demo because there is no tech, and for it to be a prove of concept it lacks of concept.			"

												Not sure why so many negative reviews, using the vive controllers to speed up or slow down no problem.  It’s a rail cart trip through a snowy mountainous landscape, it was ok and free, it is what it is, certainly worth a look.   Nice sound track as well.			"

												Horrible. No instructions or nothing and cart stops. And for a ""tech demo"" you are wondering where is the actual tech? Graphics isnt much to look at. Sorry but really cant recommend this and not excited towards the release either.			"

												It's a sitting experience and I had to fiddle with the keyboard to get moving but once I got moving, I thought it was pretty neat. It is short and a passive experience but the graphics are pretty good. I think it's absolutely worth a look and I don't understand the negativity. I look forward to seeing more of this type of sim.

												More like a rollercoaster demo. Which lacks a lot of what they, I presume, want to achieve with it. To be frank, indiegogo campaign with a very rudimentary demo... probably not. There are a number of cardboard rollercoasters that will give you this fix and better. Not that this was a bad ride but it lacked some serious polish in everything but the 3D tracking.Also, if you have the slightest inkling of motion sickness - you've been warned.			"

												This is one of the better looking VR coasters I've seen.  The keyboard controls are unusual, but most coasters don't give you any control over speed (or the ability to jump), so it's understandable for a tech demo.			"
