												Pretty Neat.  Not a tech demo but endless runner.  Just wish it went longer before repeating same terrain.			"

												I know I should not complain about the game which cost only Â£0.70, but do not waste your 70p on this. The game is just the bad clone of Poly Runner VR. Play that insted. It is much nicer, easier to control and it is free.			"

												Tron like ""endless runner"" while in a cockpit, for 70p you cannot go wrong with it. I've only played the non vive version! Either way, good game for 70p :)			"
