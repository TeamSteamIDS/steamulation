								The fun of flying low level and close to the ridge. The perfect way to take advantage of VR.			"

								I haven't played much yet, but I've really enjoyed my time so far.It plays something like Mario Kart in the sky, with a somewhat confusing control scheme that is incredibly rewarding when you do well.The drones handle neither like real drones or video game drones, which could bother some people, but I really enjoy it.I haven't tried the Vive support yet, but I'm guessing that it's super nauseating and fun.I think anyone interested in racing games with more difficult controls should check this out.

								Hard to control if using the pitch/roll plane method, fortunately the yaw/elevate drone method is much easier/smoother, and [with thruster stabilize off in options] air drifts nicely around corners, but with stabilize on it basically turns those fun/realistic physics off, with some users thinking that's an acceptable sacrifice for the sake of smoother VR, personally i don't....-also works on Gt 640 [non VR] despite what the min specs say.

								Very good idea, but for now, there are only 4 vehicles, no multiplayer and just one map, so you will get bored after few games. Mouse and keyboard control is a bit wierd first time you play. It can have good future, can't wait for updates!			"

								It takes a few rounds to manage the controls, specially when you play in VR, but once you are ahead of that its a cool racing game( weapons and online mode could be nice in this games )

								This game is still in the begining of the way, but obviously it has a good future. At least it is clearly getting better with updates. If before it was almost impossible for me to win the race, but now controls are pretty comfortable.Graphics still has low fps on my machine, and the GUI should be polished, but the game has a good potential. It would be interesting to try it with the VR headset (I played on a normal monitor).			"

								Hey I just bought your game to try with vr oculus rift. When the car runs into the no zone wall area it tends to spin the car 180 degrees. This can be an annoying glitch in the collison physics. Anyway I want to suggest about the effect settings. I only saw a difference in the water but when there was no water around having it on ultra or high affected the fps. Maybe a automatic effect setting changer that made the effects go on high when water is around. Question: Are u using dynamic shadows or static shadows on the rocks and cactuses? If it is dynamic that could be why i am getting stutter in the framerate with my gtx 970.			"

								Loved the fact that it had default controller mappings for mode 1 and 2, like you would use to fly RC planes/drones.The menu system where you have to look behind you is a bit much, maybe my centre point was off but seemed like I had to turn my head 180degrees to see the track, let me turn my body using the stick or keep menu to 180 degrees or 230degrees max.  The dynamics of how the drones handle are way off....if you've ever flown raceing drones before you'll have a hard time adjusting to this.  Bank and yank does not work well at all, I ended up doing best by flying rudder and ""throttle"" (up/down) only, which kinda defeats the point.Had serious frame drops in menu view, on a 1070?Fun for 30min			"

								Good so far, much better with a flight stick. A menu system that can be used while flying. Runs well. Id buy now at $5 tho. "

								Tried to play with thrustmaster t-flight stick x and it doesn't works. It's unreal to play on keyboard too. So I couldn't play this game and don't  advice it before developer will not fix this problem. p.s. Is it really hard to make a good mouse control as in old space simulators or something like that, not like this sh*t.			"
