												Dragon stands out with a very inspirational do-it-yourself approach that gets my own creative juices going, and makes me want to create in turn. The rough but very personal style of hand drawn, hand colored sprites and backgrounds compliment a very old school approach to action platforming, the way we remember it best.To no one's surprise the human authorities of this world exert their power over the weak with an iron fist, and our easy-going couch-potato of a dragon is the perfect target for the king's misguided aggression. Dragon, however, would like nothing more than to just relax at his girlfriend's place, smoking his pipe and winding down with some good old fashioned trashy daytime television. In an effort to ruin Dragon's day and to hinder the breeding of more of his kind, the king and his reluctant guards take off with the love of his life.The map features multiple paths to tackle at your discretion each offering a different style of progression to accommodate all types of players. Some will take you through action packed routes with loads of enemies to fight your way through, while other pathways will take you on more puzzle-based routes where you'll figure your way through using brains as opposed to brawn. Though the stages themselves may be more on the relaxing and often casual side, the bosses are anything but. With some seriously rad attack patterns that feel straight out of a 90's Treasure title, each boss offers an excellent variety in terms of the gimmick needed to defeat them and keeps you on your toes.Part of what really tickled my nostalgia about Dragon was the soundtrack; incredibly bright, happy, hummable melodies with plenty of rich retro bass all bringing me back to school weekends spent renting and playing the classic platformers of yesteryear. In particular the colorful and adventurous mood of the game combined with light RPG mechanics brought me great memories of the Wonder Boy series, and our scaly protagonist -almost- even makes this feel like a nod to Dragon's Curse (one of the greatest of the greats).Dragon isn't going to challenge the more hardcore of gamers and it certainly isn't going to provide hours of gameplay, but as a simple sidescroller it's a wonderful escape into a magical and humorous setting. The very personalized approach to the game's art creates a very relaxing and nostalgic mood, and especially for those with kids is something worth checking out just to witness how much love and fun can be put into the creative process of game making. It shows that making a game shouldn't be always about perfection, and more about the amount of enjoyment put into making it. Playing Dragon left me with a satisfying urge to go out and create art of my own, and that's a feeling that's rare for me these days.			"

												Dragon is a fun to play, joyful, lighthearted platformer that apart from it's unique graphics offers a classic rock-solid gameplay experience.Indeed the graphics are it's main attraction here. It is a pen & paper drawing come to life. Combined with catchy music and unobtrussive sound effects, this one manages to put a smile on my face while playing.But, however great the presentation might be, no platformer is truely enjoyable if the gameplay is flawed. Luckily everything is fine here. The controls (KB or gamepad) are spot on and tight and get the job done perfectly. When I started playing I thought at first that Dragons movement was a bit slow (maybe I was expecting something faster like Giana Sisters), but the levels were designed to fit Dragons movement speed and short flying ability and thus everything turned out to work as it should.Levels for most of the time a short and sweet; each featuring at least one hidden collectible that will enhance Dragon. While they are not too complex and difficult, they can get a little tricky at times (as expected from the genre).Overall Dragon is a sure recommendation. While it may not be that ""OMG it's sooo awesome you must play"" kind of title, it is a small lighthearted fun little game that is nice to look at and left me while playing with lots of positive emotions!

												After viewing the first trailer for this game, I expected this to be the most embarrasising game on steam.  That has to be the worst trailer in the history of mankind and probably cost the devs a lot of sales, it does not do this game justice at all.I went in expecting absolute crap, and instead got a fairly solid (if super easy), bug-free game with great music.  It took less than 3 hours to get all but 5 secrets and beat the game, I imagine finding those and getting everything else might take another 1 hour or less, minus any mindless searching.The art style put me off at first, but by the end of the game I kind of liked it.  No voice acting, thankfully!7/10, a pleasant surprise.			"

												This is a game which is firmly mediocre but shoots for the stars. A lot of really neat ideas are in here, but the execution is lacking. Or horrendously buggy. One of those two. DO NOT assume I am calling the game crap, but I don't really recommend it in the state that it was in as I played it.The hand-drawn/crayon-style art is really, really inconsistent. On some stages (the air force base comes to mind), the whole thing gels really well and you get a unique appearance that I can't think of a good comparison for. On others (pretty much any kind of indoor stage), it is horrendous as at least one layer of scrolling is nothing but [solid color on uneven construction paper scan]. The sprites themselves don't seem to follow any real guidelines either, and in a few cases it's really challenging to determine what's foreground, enemy, or just random detail.I'm gonna spin out of that into what is probably one of the game's worst levels, spent climbing a massive tree. It's the perfect example of the game's myriad flaws in one place: Ranged enemies can fire at you from offscreen with no visual cue to their existence, with you having absolutely no way to know they exist until an arrow/cymbal/etc. flies into you mid-leap. Incredibly tight platforming with controls not meant for it (one in particular is either something I was either doing wrong, or demanded surprising precision from you for a game with such floatiness of movement). Enemies who have suspiciously large hitboxes, resulting in cheap hits when you try getting near to attack them*. Objects which appear to be part of the background, but in fact cause damage on contact.Even if you want to tell me I screwed up in that one, it doesn't change that the game IS poorly coded. A game with such minimal specs as this should not be having random moments of slowdown/lag on my computer. At least once, I fell through a level into the void, but did not die, leaving me to have to force-quit the game and restart, as there's no ""exit level"" function. The final boss is a real mess, with at least one attack being wildly inconsistent as to whether or not you can dodge it or not**, then proceeding to kill him left a booming laser sound effect playing over the entire ending, THEN the game crashed mid-credits.Design-wise, it's also got some problems. More than once an enemy did a perfect 180 into attacking me with no tell, sometimes flipping themselves around (and bringing the already-in-progress attack) to hit me when I tried leaping past. I don't know if some animations have bugged frames, but at least a few times I just had projectiles spawn in my skull all of a sudden. Most, but not all, enemies end up in a stun animation when you attack them, leading the ones that can still move/strike you while flashing to be real nasty tricks the first time they appear. Basically, it's that inconsistency at work again - you think you know the rules it plays by until you suddenly don't.I get it and all, the game is basically one dude's passion project with some help from friends, but it doesn't excuse the game just having huge problems. Wait for a sale, wait for a patch, just... yeah. I do not advise leaping on this game.* In the game's defense, I probably should have used the breath weapons more around these jerks, except for the fact that more than a few enemies would just seem to be immune to them. Which was also a crapshoot.** This is not hyperbole. Said attack is a left-to-right sky laser which you are supposed to be able to shut down by shooting a target in time. The problem is that even if you do so before the laser even shows up, the speed at which it vanishes is inconsistent as all get out, and sometimes it will vanish after covering every single inhabitable part of the screen - meaning you are guaranteed to take a hit. Someone else on the game's forums mentioned this being an issue for them too, giving me proof that at least some of this is a known quantity.			"

A true treasure among the dragon's hoard!DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon is indeed a game about a dragon. You play as Dragon, whose quest is to save his girlfriend from the king that kidnapped her. It has platforming and RPG elements, and several levels to go through. Many enemies await, along with a handful of boss fights.That may sound like a simple premise, but this game is bursting with novel ideas and fantastic ways of executing them. I specifically requested it due to falling in love with the store pictures. This game has not gotten much attention, and it deserves far more. Look below to see why!Pros:The graphics are one of the greatest things about this game. The entirety of DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon looks as if it was drawn in crayon. It looks like it is a children's picture book, and I mean that as a compliment. The balance of being drawn very well and having small ""imperfections"" to fit the look is awesome. Each object is properly outlined, so it is easy to tell what is what. With these graphics alone, this game has an atmosphere like no other.The music is pretty good. There is a fair number of tracks and they are catchy. Some levels actually change music as the player goes from one section to another, which is something I don't see too often. I am especially fond of the track that plays at Dragon's home, though I like all of them.The story is both hilarious and sweet. I really got a kick out of the humor, and I was touched by the friendships and romances shown. These elements go very well together and make for a memorable tale.In a similar vein, the characters are excellent. It is easy to fall in love with the quirky and charming Dragon, which made me all the more determined to get him his happy ending. His friends get good development as well. While the hostile antagonists are not looked at as deeply, they are amusing and serve their purposes well.When it comes to the core gameplay, DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon is especially fun because you play as, well, a dragon. Being able to fly is glorious, but it is not broken since Dragon can only do it for limited amounts of time before landing. Having sharp claws to shred your opponents is nice. What's even better is having multiple breath weapons, including fire, ice, and lightning. You are not just a dragon because you look like one; you ARE one.There are special items scattered throughout the levels that give Dragon permanent boosts to his stats or gold to buy level-ups. These items are often challenging to find, but in a good way. I never had to look up how to get them, yet I spent several minutes at times trying to figure out where some were hiding. In addition, there are some that require puzzles to be solved. These make good use of Dragon's breath weapons and the player's smarts.In RPG-fashion, Dragon has stats that can be improved. Items and buying increases with gold will make Dragon even more impressive. The character sheet he has is both amusing and practical. The options are to raise attack, defense, and support, with support helping various abilities Dragon has. They can be raised at any point on the world map or in Dragon's home, so it is a convenient system too.The two control schemes, for keyboard and controller, are easy to use. I played DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon with a PS3 controller, but I also tried out the keyboard, and it worked just as well. The controls are on point. I never had a death where I blamed the game for shoddy controls or unfair moments. That is what I look at for game controls, and I was satisfied here.Each level is unique and fun. They are well-sized, being neither too short or too long. Some possess multiple routes, and combined with the hidden collectables, they are great for replaying.Like the levels, the enemies in them are of a wide variety. Many of them are funny, such as the texting knights and dolphin-throwing beach ladies. Their attack patterns are different, and they help spice things up.The bosses range in difficulty, with some being easy and others taking a few tries to get the hang of. They have good tells for what attacks they will use, but they do not have a set pattern. This makes it less of a game of memorization and puts emphasis on reacting in time to the tells.There are 13 achievements, and they range from decent difficulty to being somewhat hard. I like this level of difficulty in achievements. It felt as if I actually worked to get them, rather than being given them by default, and I have not found any too frustrating.If playing as a dragon is not enough incentive on its own, take this in: there is a wool union. That's right, a group of sheep striving for liberation is the deadliest enemy in the game. Their leader even has a beret!Neutral:Some of the hints on what players need to do to get items are a bit obscure. I was fine with this, as I found that they all made sense. Some players might find it frustrating to have a lack of clues, though.The world map has a fantastic feature of checking off levels players have fully completed, meaning you won't get confused over where to look for missing items. Props also for having the story segments being replayable and skippable. However, I found the PS3 controller was not very good at navigating it. You have to use the analog stick instead of the directional arrows, which was more difficult for me. The keyboard handles it better, but I didn't want to switch over to it just for an easier map screen.There are trading cards. They have cute drawings and are nice collectables.Cons:When the controls are listed on the screen, they flicker between the keyboard controls and controller controls. Most games I have played would default to one or the other depending on what I was currently using. The flickering got annoying at times, though it only came up in certain places.There were a couple of loading points that lagged for me. I am not sure whether it was the game or my computer, but my computer tends to run most games pretty well, so I think it is a safe guess that the game is partially at fault. It is not even close to being a deal breaker, but it is worth noting.Dragon can't use his claws or breath weapons while in midair. I keep instinctively trying to do so, only to fail because he has to be on the ground before he can attack. There are no points in the game where it is a necessary feature, but it would have been nice to have that option.Overall experience:This was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had in a long while. The unique atmosphere of DRAGONS: A Game About a Dragon is going to keep it firmly in my mind. I still need to fully complete it, but when I finish that, I plan to play through it again so I can show it to some of my friends. I really wanted to play this game so I could give it more exposure, and I hope this review helps with that.Rating:9/10. It's a beautiful, funny, charming, adorable, and overall wonderful game. It is tragic that it has barely been noticed in comparison to so many other Steam games. Do yourself a favor and buy DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon for its absolutely reasonable price. This game is very much worth the purchase.Looking for more great indie games? Check out my other reviews on Indie Games Treasure Trove! "

												A casual Demon's Crest, basically. A lot of fun to play. It has a good amount of stuff to collect. It also has insane levels of charm. You'll love all the characters. Best Ending should only take you around 2-4 hours probably, but they were a really enjoyable 2-4 hours for me.			"

												Although I found the movement to be a little slow and clunky, it's actually not too bad of a game.The level selection screen reminds you of Super Mario World, along with good level design.  Some levels can become a challenge, but they're still quite easily completable.  I liked the music as well, it's nice and nostalgic.Some seem to dislike the art in the game.  But personally, I found the art to be quite interesting and unique.  The art seperates it from other games in the platforming francise.			"

+:-The overall feel that the game is going for in terms of a unique charm → which by admission makes the game that much harder to cover.-Story has a Looney Tunes style to it, where kids can still laugh, but adults will appreciate it.-Music did do well for me in terms of vibe, felt appropriate.-Art style/animation stand out when in gameplay.-Mix up with bosses and different abilities helped add variety.-Hidden collectables add to play time.-:-Level Design is all over the place. Areas that don't make a lot of sense, and natural direction does not apply here.-Odd bouts with difficulty at times. When I think the game was hard, it turned easy, and vice versa. Difficulty curves take weird spikes and valleys.-UI elements don't stand out.-Overall, a feeling of something missing in terms of a knockout punch.In the end, the charm really stands out, as the style and the overall feel really make the game an enjoyable experience, even with all the problems that the game has. If you're looking for a “good” game experience in terms of mechanics and platforming, then it's not this. But you want a nice experience with some alright gameplay? Yes, DRAGON does the job. And it's got some good humor under the hood.			"

												Rating - 7.5/10Given that rating, it may seem like I didn't really enjoy the game, when in fact I truly did. The art is something different, the writing has some funny moments, and the story is intact. It was a fun experience and I would easily recommend the game, especially on sale. It was a lot of fun to play with the gf on the couch next to me commenting on all the cuteness and murder dolphins.So why the 7.5/10? I just feel like a little more would have solved a lot of the downsides I experienced.The good:- Unique art style- Solid story line- Not terribly difficult- For the price, especially on sale, it is very worth itThe fine:- The writing has its ups and downs- The variety of weapons and scenery destinations- It does get a bit redundant if you can't progressThe bad: (list is essentially a few ""bad for some, not for all"" items)- Gotta use a controller (I prefer that, but know some people are M&K people)- A lot of things you take for granted in RPG type games was missing. Health bars on enemies, how your attributes go up, what the weapons do and don't do, etc. (For the demographic and game itself, a little hand-holding was expected)- Animation is a bit wanting, even for the art style of the game.I say go for it if you, like me:- like dragons in general- are after a fun little RPG experience- want something a bit different than the ""same old thing""- get it on sale			"

												I like the art style and I could tell the developer really tried to make something unique with this game.  However, it does have a fair amount of faults.  I thought the game was a bit boring to play, levels were quite short, most of the time I was simply trying to rush from left to right and not even caring about killing enemies because it was simply easier to play the game this way.  The dragon dies fairly often, mostly because of the enemies that are put in locations where you basically have to get hit before hitting them (you cant jump and shoot).   With the amount of enemies and the weak powers the dragon has for the majority of the game, it becomes a bit anooying to continue playing.The overworld map is not laid out very well, it should of been a bit more organized in my opinion.  You didnt really know where you had to go next, sort of just winged in when multiple directions unlocked at the same time.The Boss fights were not self explanatory and it felt like you were set up to fail in every battle until you somehow figured out a way to beat them.  Difficult Boss fights are usually cool with me, but they have to be difficult because of skill, not confusion.This brings me to my biggest caveat about the game, the achievements... they are stupidly difficulty to get.  I say this as someone who has played a lot of platformer games and am known to be fairly good at them.  The controls in the game can be a bit sluggish and there were numerous times where I would jump and hit invisible walls, it simply made doing ""no death fights"" near impossible,I could go on about how flawed this game is, if you're looking for a solid platformer to play.... However, I will make my final statement now to try and clarify why I still recommend it.I Recommend this game if you get it like I did for $0.49 on sale,  The reason for the recommendation, even though I didn't like the gameplay experience, is simply I respect what the developer tried to do here and would like to have people help them progress into a new project and improve on what they have started here, because there is potential.  There are plenty of bad games out there with no potential and bad developers, but this game, this one has something.  It just needs some fine tuning which I'm hopeful this developer could accomplish in a future game.			"

-Quick Review-DRAGON: A game about a Dragon is a 2d adventure platformer developed by 'Games With Dragons In' and released in 2015. This is a quaint little indie game where you play as a Dragon saving his princess which the king has captured. So it's kind of a reversal of roles, instead of saving the princess from the dragon, you're saving the princess AS the dragon. And that kind of cute premise continues throughout the game!-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Oh no! Your girlfriend has been taken captive by her father, the King! Now you need to go get her back, but first you need to bring down the force field by gathering the 4 gem's which have been given to 4 bosses... You get the idea, this is a pretty typical gaming trope.Gameplay: Control-wise you move the dragon with the arrow keys, you have a flame breath, a jump, and a claw swipe skill (Z, X, and C. In no particular order.) Good luck keeping track of the abilities, this game seems like it was designed with controllers in mind, because I would have preferred to use space for jump, instead I end up getting mixed up and claw swipe instead of jumping over a projectile flying towards me!


Uploaded for the review: Combat Sample - You hve different types of attacks but generall speaking you have a claw and breath attack.

But that's really the few and only real complaints I have about the game. As a whole the game controls very well, it feels like a game designed for kids to play, but I still enjoyed it! The over world reminded me of Super Mario World or Mario 2 main worlds, where you unlock the next level and follow a path of some kind from level to level.

There are various humorious nod's to different items and power ups you get in the game as extra's you find from exploring levels. There are steam trading cards, there are steam achievements (however two of the achievements are a pain in the butt and I can't seem to figure out how to get one of them ""Tied for First"")

There is a type of progression system, as you get currency, you can spend that currency on upgrading one of three properties, basically upgrading your flight, your power, and your health. (although flight may change with breath attacks, or other miscellaneous upgrades.)Conclusion: All in all, I enjoyed this game, the only down sides to it are the semi-clunky keybindings, and I kind of roll my eyes at the name.

												I love how adorable Dragon is! Ohh such fuzzy feelings watching the cute little goofball move around!I'm not sure about the game itself though. The theme is really inconsistent all around and it doesn't speak well enough visual game design.For example, there are a few enemies and terrain obstructions that just aren't visually distinct enough from non interactive/aesthetic scenery. One moment i'm pretending to have a friendly chat with a construction worker and the next there's a freaking dolphin tamer hurling dolphins after me. Like, dude? How was i supposed to expect that was trying to kill me?Viewport is really small, there should be a way to ""peek ahead"". (vague spoiler) On one of the first levels there's something hidden on the side of a cliff. When i found it i expected to be more of that sort of thing and to my dissapointment every cliff thereafter was just nothing but a death pit.I'm not sure if i'm missing something with the skills menu but it's really cluttered but it seems like there are a lot of options here that you can't even use. Maybe they were test features that were left over, but its just that it was so cluttered i had a hard time figuring out what i could do there.The text generally or at least sometimes doesn't really feel appropriate in my opinion. For example I found Dragon's friend Flyss, and the games like ""screw you if you tried to hurt him!"" now why would i have tried to do something like that? Jeez.These are just minor nitpicky details. The graphics are cute but im not that impressed overall by the gameplay. but hey. Dragons!			"

												A cute game with pleasant music. The art is mostly quite nice (though I find the leaps in quality between the background, basic enemies, and the dragon/bosses a little inconsistent.) With decent cute humor.And thats about all I can say nice about it?Technically while I never experienced any crashes, the game doesnt even support fullscreen 1080 (playing games in a window bugs the hell out of me.)The gameplay is...boring? The dragons jumping is very floaty and slow, which if you are too close to certain attacks, makes it impossible to dodge. The metroidvania style ""come back with another ability"" secrets are just annoying in my opinion, the game itself isnt a metroidvania, and it makes that just a chore to do, especially when its completely unclear if your current abilities have a effect.The boss battles are really what seal the deal on my ""Not recomended"" though. I would describe at least one of them as outright unfair. In a fight with two robot men, they have attacks that can be performed without warning (a flame jet attack, and a teleport attack in particular.) As dragon lacks a dodge ability, if the flame jet begins in the wrong spot, you are eating the hit. The teleport attack is even cheaper, ive found no discernable pattern to it other than ""jump around and he will probably teleport in the wrong spot"" but sometimes he teleports INSIDE me and does damage. The fight then goes from dodging attacks until they are vulnerable, to a DPS race where winning is achieved by farming coins and investing in defense. (Offense being seemingly all but worthless to the bosses from what ive seen.)The levels themselves are just annoying, the game encourages getting as much coinage as you can, achieved by killing enemies, however many enemies are placed on platforms only they can fit on, and dragon cant even damage enemies when he is too close to them, nor does he have a jumping attack, or proper ranged attacks. I wonder what the point of the slash attack even is, as it takes great effort to run out of breath attack.I really cant recomend this game, even for a very modest 5$ The author has potential, and could do better assuming they learn from this experience and grow as a designer, but this game certainly screams ""my first game"" to me. The art and music bring it above all the 1$ shovelware flooding steam, but the gameplay does not.			"

												Quite the simple game, but it has its distinctive flair. By that, I mean the artistically drawn designs of the game. It's roughly drawn, but not so sloppily done that you can't bear it throughout the game. Yes, some parts meld together or will confuse you if you can actually stand on it until you try it, and yes, you may die from trying it. Some aggravation will ensure from this game, but I enjoyed it overall. At the very least, this isn't a long game, but rather short. I finished in approx. 3 hours and I bet you can even do it faster than that since I didn't use the guide until near the end of the game.In summation, it's basically a platforming game where you play as a dragon trying to rescue the girl of his dreams (princess).  Along the way, you can choose to get stronger via gold/items/upgrades. At the beginning of the game, there wasn't that much of an explanation of the upgrades, but only how to use the dragon's claws, jump + flight,and breath. But as you play, you will end up figuring it all out. (Althought I wish you could've breathed while in flight...) Much like the rest of the game, where if you are trying to reach an item or defeat a boss, it'll mostly be trial and error until you succeed in the end. If you are an achievement completionist, this game will require you to think and explore a lot in the game to find all the secret items. Some are very easy to find and others are just plain hard to figure out. There is currently a Jap/Eng guide, but even that isn't fully completed at the time of posting this review (3-3-17). Last bit, the story line has some interesting parts to it and it isn't terrible. Some may find it boring and some may find it witty. I found it to be more amusing and funny to personify a dragon like that.Some drawbacks in this game: 1) some rough platforming where an enemy basically occupies the entire platform and you can't kill the enemy unless you get hit once as you try to land there, 2) a bit too much trial and error to figure out certain aspects of the game (IE: there is a gunman enemy and I could not figure out how to kill it ... not even sure if you can kill it), 3) in some stages, off-screen attacks/unviewable enemies will be attacking you, and 4) (to my knowledge and tries) a bit bummed about how the last fight has to be fought - speed + damage related vs skillfully dodging and attacking (hint: look at the achievements and guide). Overall, easy game mechanics that is fun to play and enjoy. If you like a good platforming game, this is to be considered and if you want some puzzle aspects, this game has it too. 7.5/10!			"

												DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon is “aggressively whimsical” according to the dragon who recommended it to me. This is, perhaps, the most accurate two word description possible of this game.DRAGON is a 2D platformer where you control a dragon named Dragon. It is pretty basic – you can jump, hover in midair for a short distance, use one of five different breath weapons (unlocked over the course of the game), and claw enemies. While the breath weapons have different appearances, they’re all more or less the same, save that they allow you to bypass certain barriers (of which only a handful appear in the entire game) and are better against some enemies/bosses (in fact, some bosses require you to switch which breath weapon you’re using to damage them, with different parts of the boss requiring different breath weapons).The game contains six bosses, which are the real highlight of the game – each has their own unique attack pattern, and there’s an achievement for beating them without getting hit (harder than it seems). They’re reasonably challenging, and the no-hit challenges are more so.Sadly, the same cannot be said about the rest of the game. The levels themselves are mostly very easy and simple to the point of blandness. Many of them are very easy to rush through and more or less completely bypass – possibly by design. While in principle they get harder over time, in practice, due to the game’s levelling mechanic, it actually becomes easier – and the final level of the game can actually be completely bypassed without fighting a single enemy.There are collectables, which are somewhat more interesting to grab, as well as a couple of secret levels, but in the end, they’re not enough to really make the ordinary levels all that interesting on the whole – while some of them are alright and reasonably clever, others felt a bit guide dang it to find. Fortunately, the game does let you know that you’re missing secrets in levels by not putting a big green checkmark next to them.The collectables give you various power-ups, making you tougher, making you deal more damage, making you take less damage, letting you glide longer, and similar things. Some of them give you gold – as does defeating enemies – both of which allow you to level up the protagonist in various attributes… which also makes him more powerful. He can be levelled up 18 times in total, and becomes quite tough by the end.In the end, though, the gameplay of this is not the main attraction. The main attraction is the STYLE of the game. The whole game is drawn in either crayons or colored pencils (I’m not sure which), including the backgrounds. It gives the whole game a sort of child-like feel to it, and is very silly. This fits the story of the game, which is also very silly.You see, DRAGON is the story of Dragon, a dragon who has his girlfriend kidnapped by the king. The general and wizard, the king’s associates, seem kind of apologetic about the whole thing, and the enemies in general are kind of gloriously silly and incompetent. You have to dodge sheep revolutionaries, defeat a gay game warden who is actually your friend and you give a pat on the shoulder afterwards, have a chat with a fellow dragon (who, unlike you, doesn’t speak Dragon Common), and generally engage in a silly plotline which is something of a reversal of the standard plot, as the dragon has to save a girl from a… well, at the very least kind of bossy and pushy king, though he doesn’t seem like he actually wants to kill you so much as just make you stop trying to get your girlfriend back.Look, he doesn’t want a bunch of dragons running around his kingdom, alright? I mean, sure, you just kind of sit around watching TV and reading children’s books, but… come on, man!The game’s plotline is very silly, and due to the shortness of the levels, you’re constantly reminded of what is going on as you go through the levels. There’s a number of characters you end up ultimately talking to or interacting with in various cutscenes, and of course in the end you fly to the rescue of your girlfriend, by which point you come to much better understand everyone’s motivations in the game.If you’re not bothered by simple gameplay, think the aesthetic is interesting, and enjoy silly reversals of standard stories, this might be up your alley. If, on the other hand, you’re hyper-focused on gameplay, this is probably going to be a letdown. "

If you want to jump, spit fire and stuff you'll better get yourself an old Gameboy and look for the cartrdige ""Gargoyles Quest"", even though the main protagonist isn't a dragon at all!

												DRAGON is certainy a game about a dragon. It's also a good game that doesn't drag on! Heh! heh...Okay, seriously, DRAGON is a decent platformer. It wraps up a fun adventure in a very cute art style, and a dorky, but likeable main character. The story isn't strong, but it doesn't need to be, and the developer obviously revelled in that fact, making the narrative grow in an amusing way. There are a few nitpicks I might make, but overall I'd reccommend the game.For more on my specific thoughts (and nitpicks) read my full review at https://shellgamesblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/05/dragon-a-game-about-a-dragon/ "

												Dragon: A Game about a Dragon is like playing along to your favorite childhood storybook. After playing Dragon for about an hour I must say it's got a delightful storybook feel. Hand drawn 2D platforming styled rpg is a great way to describe the game. You play as Dragon (Duh, who else would you play as) and your girlfriend has been kidnapped by the King and  you must venture forth and save her. Also, Dragon seems to be puffing the magic dragon if you know what I mean (You'll see when you finish a level) so he may be a little lazy. As the story progresses you make your way through hand drawn crayon colored art and earn new abilities and skills. In my short adventure I earned the ability to breath lightening and ice! Each has it's own benefits, for instance the lightening will stun mechanical enemies. After some levels you will find yourself reading, a lot. Which I haven't decided if it's a good or bad thing. I'm leaning toward good, but I'd like to have seen it with voice overs. Maybe just a narrator. The controls are pretty straight forward, but a little slow. The inability to attack while in the air or jumping is frustrating to me. Here's a clip of the First Look!

												I really like this game, but it keeps in crashing. I love the humorous dialog and the silly game graphics, but every time that I try to leave any stage, my game crashes and I lose all my progress. I physically cant even beat the first level first level for christ's sake. Maybe it's just my computer, but I'm not sure...			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platform KID's game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some different languages.Able to customize your controls.You can play this game with a controller or keyboard.You can play this game in fullscreen or windowed mode.There are not alot of different resolution sizes.About the game.The game has almost the same story as the Mario Series. The girlfriend from the Dragon got kidnapped by the dragon and you need to save her. You have to kill enemies and collect coins. During the levels you are able to find some skills or even learn new things. The game style graphics looks interesting but the music totally ruins it in my opinion. The money that you collect during the levels can be used to upgrade your dragon and make him a bit stronger. There are no lives, there is only health. So far i havent seen a checkpoint too.You are able to skip cutscenes.You are able to level up.Cartoony drawing graphics.Ingame tutorial.Easy animations.There are secrets.There is a story.Music is disturbing and keeps playing even if you Alt + Tab.Death sound is overlong.There is no restart level or retry.There are collectables in each level and a V (check) will shown up once the level is 100% completed.Could be a bit boring after awhile.Other things.The claws and the firebreath has ALMOST the same distance. Which is weird.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10 "

												This game is ok if you know what you are getting yourself into. I received this game for free in exchange for a review, so here is my honest oppinion. This is a kids game. This is the kind of platformer I remember playing on SNES and Sega Genesis as a young kid. There isn't a ton of challenge here for us adulty types with our cocktails, love making, and mortgage payments. Nah. This is for your bratty little tike born because of said adulty activities who won't stop begging to play on Daddy's computer. ""No son, you can't play GTA V. You can play DRAGON."" ""What is Dragon daddy?""  Well. According to the title... It is a game about a Dragon.  This game works fine, the controls are decent and the graphics have a charming crayola crayon pallete. It works well with a controller, which is good for kids because you can throw it on the T.V. I do have one gripe here. There isn't a fullscreen option! Ok, so maybe if your kid has a crappy 15"" 720P walmart laptop you bought them in desperation on black Friday for hope of some peace and quite so the misses and you can once again enjoy said adulty activities, this is fine. But on Daddy's 1440P 27"" monitor, this leads to a fairly small gameplay window. Yeah, about 1/4'th of my screen. I was hoping the trusty ""Alt + enter"" keyboard shortcut would work. No luck. I tried just running it in window mode at my native resolution (2560X1440) or at least 1920X1080, but nope. This game has 3 resolutions. Thats it.  Ok. My work here is done. I'm off for a cocktail and a bit of debauchery. Ciao! -PR0XIDIAN			"

												Sadly, part of what makes a game is the support, and this game has none. Repeated request by multiple users to fix bugs assosiated with starting the game have gone entirely ignored. I would love to give a good review here, but an ignored and frankly unplayable game can't get that. Fair warning, try this the moment you buy it and be prepared to demand a refund.Nothing against the game, just a developer who can't be bothered to fix it.Note: I've actually heard good things from those few whom get it to work...

												Progressed to the ""Brothers"" boss fight, tried it at least twenty times, and then quit. I don't know if I need more health upgrades (I'm really not going to backtrack and grind), but with the health I have - that level is simply impossible to beat. There are two enemies, and both have powerful attacks that simply cannot be dodged. Observing the ""lightning"" attack pattern from one boss, you *think* you can fit your dragon in an empty space, but no, you can't. The game is designed in such a way that the attack is absolutely guaranteed hit to you for a lot of damage. The ""flame bolt"" attack from the other boss enemy leaves no such room, and again, it is guaranteed to hit you for a lot of damage as well. Both of those attack happen, and you're gone.With a slight health upgrade, there's room for a couple more of their mini-attacks to connect, but one of the bosses teleports around and sooner or later you will be hit. You're done.Maybe I need more health upgrades. I have no idea. But this is just too frustrating. A good game gives you clues on incoming attacks and lets you use skill to avoid them; this is not the case here.			"

												Too many people have given this game negative feedback to be honest...This game is actually alot better then you might think.  The hand drawn and colored graphics looks adds an amazing feeling to the game that to be honest i missed initially.Playing this with the steam controller is highly recommended as the game is just brilliant.   Not only for adults but also for children of all ages.   It is a work of art in all honesty...The 2d gameplay and game map that reminds me of nights playing Mario on a nintendo really was refreshing.The backgrounds, music, and gameplay with normal progression system made this game a must buy in my humble opinion and just to support the developers i will also be purchasing this title even though i got it free.   I hope they continue releasing more titles.Great job guys. "

												I would recommend this game if it didn't crash on my windows 10 a lot. I'd get to a really far point in the game and then at some point when I die, the game crashes and my data gets erased and I have to start over at the beginning. It really irritates. Otherwise, this would have been a great game to play. and I would like to see this problem get fixed hopefully soon. Just being honest. If all issues and bugs get fixed, then I'd be happy to play this game again and try to beat it! this game has potential if only it would work properly. It's a shame because I think this would be a great game without the bugs. I hope the creators understand			"

												It's got really cute graphics and jazzy SNES tunes, but you can't use attacks midair and everything that hits you causes an awful lot of damage. This makes the game feel unbalanced against you, especially against bosses. One frustration is that dying enough times automatically gives your character more health next time. this wouldn't be a problem, if it weren't an achievement to GET THROUGH THE WHOLE GAME WITHOUT IT, and there's NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF.  It comes off as a humiliating handicap that doesn't even help much during the game, because everything hits your character for too much damage anyway. I didn't expect to write a paragraph complaining about this, but it was extremely disappointing to find out this game is cute to look at, but not fun to play. It's just frustrating and rage-inducing.			"

												The graphic style of the game led me to expectation of a ""tale told by a child"" as long as most of level designs look like child drawings which was crashed pretty soon by the attempt of the game to be satiric and funny in a story that by no means could be a story told by a child or to a child. The gameplay isn't too entertaining, somehow doesn't feel right and some actions/enemies are clearly not polished enough, requires some farming and have minor puzzle elements which you would care to solve only for completionist motives. Story by itself got too boring too soon and I would also say WIERD. This game was extremely cheap for me but I regret buying it and playing through it as long as I finish it because of pure stubborness and didn't feel any satisfaction at all, in return it make me remember that cross species sex in fact is a real thing for some people in some reason that only they find valid. The afterfeel is that this game is a bedtime fairy tale for young adult/middle age person that have unhealthy affection for fantasy creatures.I wish I never bought it, never played it and never read ingame dialogs.P.S.

												If you can find this game on an incredibly cheap sale (25 cents and below), then get it. You might get an hour or two of playtime before getting so incredibly bored you blow your brains out. This is not a good game. The ideas are good, the game and its execution are not. The graphics are kinda cool, the coloring looks neat I guess, but it's very hit or miss. Sometimes its there, other times its not. The colored looking graphics are inconsistent to say the least. The soundtrack is mediocre as well, and I get it, its a budget platformer, but if you charge money for it, then you should at least put more effort than this into it.The gameplay itself is the worst part quite frankly. The platforming is not fun. It's more of a chore really, and the controls. OH MY THE CONTROLS. They are terrible. Absolutely terrible. A mess. They are not tight. They're very very sloppy. They almost make the game unplayable. Almost.The developers had good ideas here, but they did not have proper execution. Nonetheless, if they make a sequel, I will definitely give it a shot. Conclusion is that this game is not a good platformer and you shouldn't play it. The graphics and story are nice, gut the gameplay itself is not. And that's why I do not recommend this game.			"

												The concept is charming, but the gameplay can be frustrating without reason. You move very slowly and levels often have surprise hazards (like fireballs erupting from below you). If you don't know where the hazards will be, you won't have time to move once they are triggered. This makes some portions feel more like memorization than responding and reacting to the dangers. If that's your thing, you'll enjoy it.There are also times when the game is inconsistent. For example: you can hover by holding down the jump button, but in some situations you suddenly cannot, without warning. The result is you will likely die and have to repeat the level.Overall, I can't complain, as the game was very cheap, but neither can I recommend it.			"

												Note: It says my playtime is 24 hours.  I think that's because the game didn't close properly so Steam just assumed it was on all night.  That's my guess.  Witht he number of bugs I encountered that's not so hard to believe.Overall this game is ok/mediocre.  The graphics are very nice but sometimes it's hard to play because you don't know what you can jump on and what you can't.  This makes them something of a hindrance actually.  Other than that the game is ok but really made more for kids than adults with really basic gameplay.  If you're looking for a platformer with RPG elements my recommendation is Shovel Knight or Axiom Verge.  There are a lot better options that you can get on Steam. This is the type of game where I wish I could leave a ""kindof recommend"" option but overall i'm leaning toward the negative.			"

As a dragon, that made me feel unworthy.The conclusion: I really wanted to like the game. But the combination of poor controls, weird collisions that aren't helped by the hand-drawn style of the graphic and the RPG element that didn't attract me at all, make this a game I won't continue playing.

I'm left to assume the game is in fact invisible and silent to human eyes and ears because all I see is my Steam library of games I've bought with my own hard earned money through labor and skill. Like the 7 cents I used to purchase this game. Well done on a perfect nihhilst masterpiece, but I didn't get any dragons so I'll have to say no to recommending this.			"

												Dragon: A Game About a Dragon is a game that has been advertised on the well-known furry go-to masturbation pit e621. Given that this is a game featuring graphics that look like children's drawings, this made me feel even more repulsed. Was I, in fact, playing a game about a dragon that was drawn specifically to be masturbated to? It turns out that the dragon is a dragon who VAPES WEED AND WATCHES DAYTIME TELEVISION AND GETS HARASSED BY THE MAN, but the damage was already done. ""Am I playing a thing that weirdos jerk it to?"" was the thing that stuck in my head as I played through it.In case you're wondering, the game itself is pretty mediocre and unrefined. The developer had a nice thing going with his 'children's drawings' schtick, but that didn't immediately translate to 'what can be jumped on' when it comes to platforming, because the developer didn't bother to differentiate between the two states. So you'll be wandering around the game, trying through trial and error to determine what can be jumped on and what cannot be jumped on, which is REALLY GOOD PLATFORM GAME DESIGN.Hey, you know what people love to do with cutscenes? Read them, because this game is like a children's book, for adults! (which is why it's been advertised on e621). So have all the words! Have all the words in your cutscene, dogg! That's what they're there for!Also there's a bunch of obligatory RPG mechanics, just in case you can't hack the insane difficulty of jumping over and running past enemies. But upgrading is a tedious and annoying exercise that requires you to run back into your house, smoke some Puff The Magic Dragon, and stare at a character sheet with too much 'character-building' on the screen while it asks you to choose between trading in some gold for more HP, more flying time, or more dragon breath. Instead of, you know, pressing a button on the map screen and going to that directly.So it's a game that's trying to be ""Go The ♥♥♥♥ To Sleep"" without realizing that the only people who think VAPING POT IS EDGY in 2015 are shut-in Christians and possibly babies, and has also been advertised to people who presumably like to jerk it to dragons (among other fictional and non-fictional animals). If you are not one of these people, you are hereby excused from playing. Go in peace.			"

												Do you like dragons? Do you enjoy hand drawn animation? Are games based on a labor of love your thing? Then look no further than DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon. This game, while not perfect, is a real gem, it comes highly recomended*.Note the * - the first time I installed this game, it crashed constantly. Re-installing it fixed this issue for me; however, your mileage may vary. As far as games go, this one's a real charmer. Lovingly hand-illustrated drawings done in crayon, the visual aesthetic is not unlike that of a children's book. This, combined with the tongue-in-cheek humor sets a whimsical tone for a very casual, pick up and play experience that anyone can enjoy.While the game mostly progresses in a linear fashion, the player is able to go through the game at their pace. While this game is 2D platformer, it has both ""Metroidvania"" and RPG element infused within it. Basically, what this means is that the player is always given an option to set their own difficulty levels. For example, if you're having trouble with a boss, go back and explore the levels to find any hidden treasures / upgrades you may have missed and level up. Or, if the player is wanting more of a challenge, they are able to face any of the enemies head on.This is my first review of a game - numerical values / scores are arbritrary, so I'll simply post my final verdict on it. I'm glad I gave it a second chance, as the lovely visuals, charming music, and wonderful world and characters have won me over. Also, you get to play as a dragon, which is always good times. Is it for everyone? Of course not, but then no game truly is.  Is it good value for the $5.99 pricetag? Absolutely. There's a lot of game in DRAGON, and even more love.FINAL VERDICT: If you like dragons, hand-drawn 2D platformers, and adjustable gameplay, go pick it up.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. First of all it has an original child's drawing style that I neither think is particularly bad nor good. The gameplay is a slow jump and run game which is okay but not exciting and it has a Mario3 overworld map which gives you options where to go. The story tries to be funny but really is pretty boring. The levels are somewhat original, but the enemies dont seem to make any sense. You cant really tell if the people inside are enemies or not. A girl with a dolphin is an enemy.. but when you attack someone who isnt an enemy you murder him. It's a little weird. There doesnt seem to be a negative side effect of that though. The music is alright. In any aspect I think this game is neither good or bad. It is very mediocre. I thought it was too boring to continue playing so I stopped. Oh, and it didn't have a full screen option which was annoying.			"

												For fourteen cents I honestly can't complain. The game is functional, there's some funny dialogue here and there and the game mechanics are fun. There are glitches, enemy weaknesses can be nonsensical early on when you're starting the game and the graphics can either be a hit or miss but for the most part but it's enjoyable. The music while not particularly breathtaking doesn't make me want to rip my hair out which is fortunate and the different element-breath types remind me a bit of Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly. Is it worth the full price of five dollars? Probably not, but for fourteen cents you can't go wrong.			"

												DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon is a small 2D light-RPG based game, in which you play as the dragon in an attempt to rescue your girlfriend (who is the Kings daughter)! Controls; 9/10 Very simple controls that allow for both keyboard and controller, can be customized in the options menu. The only problem I had was that at times the controls would stop responding, which is only a problem while going for some achivments (Boss fights without taking damage).Music; 8/10 Great little sound track with a nice blend of music, can be a bit repetitive after a while. I wish they made it available for purchase!Graphics; 8.5/10 Hand drawn graphics are easy on the eyes, its like looking into a coloring book.Story; 6/10 Basic level of in depth of characters, most of the 'enemy' figures are actually friends with you. I felt that there was a lack in detail, but other then that its ok. Story was simple and to the point.Gameplay; 8/10 Gameplay was enjoyable, with unique level design and enemy type, however there was a large lack of melee based enemies, most were ranged. Boss fights are simple if you learn the patterns, but are random in attacks. Also lots of easter-eggs within the game itself.Replayability; 3/10 Once you beat the game and seen both endings, there is little else to do other than achivments.In the end it only took me about 2.5 hours to beat the game start to finish, and get 12/15 of the achivments, so if you wanted you could try to get a refund for the game if you did a speed run, but I don't think I will, for some reason it has a nice charming feeling for a game of its size.Overall Ranking; 7/10 Above Average.Worth the $6? Yep.			"

												Not very long, not too hard but entirely cute according to my two and a half year old daughter who commented almost anything throuout the game. Jumped right in (SteamLink & Steam Controller) just to find out that the controls were a mess. Had to map some keys to the the controller to get ist to work properly, but after that it is nice to play, hits the spot for my taste of humor and has a few spots that are a bit trickier than the look suggests. It's incredibly easy to spend the prcie asked for it for things was less worth it!			"

												I didn't have any expectations when I first played this, and since it was on a sale I decided to try it. And I got a lot of enjoyment from this game with the fun gameplay, ridiculous/cute story and cute artstyle.So now I'll breakdown my points in this reviewGameplayThe gameplay is very simplistic and very typical when it comes to platform games, the only parts that differ from most of them is that you can hover for some seconds before you get tired and using your breath to destroy the enemies (both which have been done before, but it works and makes sense considering that you're a dragon).It's solid and works well, and some of the ways on how you get to the items can be interesting to do. Another part of the game consists on leveling up your stats, which are done my getting money and using it to get better skills or by finding the items that I've previously mentioned.And the boss battles are relatively easy, except the final one if you don't have the necesary stats. ControlsThe controls are very solid and you won't have any problems by controling the dragon. There's no delay in any action and they're very intuitive, although there was this moment when i restarted a stage because i wanted to get an item when suddenly in one of these restarts my character didn't moved, but that's a very rare occurence.(I used an xbox 360 controller for this game, I don't know if other controllers will do the trick)StoryThe story consists on the king kidnapping your girlfirend while you were watching TV, a very simple one. But one of the point that make me like the game consisted on the humor, which is very quirky and cute. A laughed a lot at the amount of ridiculous situations and jokes that the game presented.They mostly consisdt on the situation that they're on, but they're well executed. And it also helps that when the dragon talks it consists on giberish that only a few of them understand. GraphicsSome might not like the crayon style of the game, but it's one that adds cuteness and differs itself from the other generic ""retro"" indie games that appear quite a lot in steam. Even though I personally prefer another type of style this one seems very pleasant to look at and does the job in this game.SoundtrackIMO not the best since it's generic and while right now I can remember some songs I will forget them in a couple of days, but it does the trick and helps with he situation and the mood of them is compatible with the theme of the game.OverallThe game is good and you'll have a fun time with the humor and the style of game, with a solid gameplay and good level design it will be a game that you'll mostly complete in 2-4 hours (or more if you want to get the items). Definetly recommended if it's on sale since it's very cheap.			"

												I wanted this game for some time now, but at the time i found the game not worth the 5€ they were asking, well i got it on sale and i was wrong, this game is worth 5€, it is a really nice little game, took me something like 6 hours to fishing it, doesn't seem much, but the 6 hours were complete with entertainment, story is not bad (would be better if it wasn't so cliché-ish), graphic desgin... not my favorite but it fits the game so it's ok, bosses have their tricks to be defeated making it challenging, soundtrack and sound effects are good, supports controller and the game has some replayability.Things that i didn't like much, the dragon is not able to attack while jumping and there are many times where you can avoid enemies just by flying over their heads so there is not much forced combat except in boss battles... but overall it is a good game, the looks might be not everyone's cup of tea but it is fine as plantaformer..
