												What's sad is that the minigames are better than some of the crap on the steam store nowadays. @-@+-Simple, easy and fun for any audience.-Colourful graphics-Social interaction is cool-Decent minigames-Fun (perhaps a little chessy) music to match the feeling of the game--Not very challenging-Limited amount of space for buildingThat's all I can think of. I played this game forever seven years ago. :DTl;dr: Buy if you want a fun, simple theme park sim. Don't if you want a challenge.			"

												After playing this and the first Thrillville on my PSP, seeing this on the Steam store brought a wave of childhood memories. Buying this game will be one of the greatest decisions of your life. You can engage in conversations with anyone in the park and can even have relationships. The coaster building and park management mechanics are also very well done.			"

												This game , IN MY OPINION, is BETTER than rollercoaster tycoon, With Nostalgia, it brings social Intercation, Cool Rides, a Wacky Scientist named Mortimer who looks like the guy from back to the Future,and overall, the best thing is the park itself, or PARKS, with an s, YUP, there are a total of 5 dif. Parks to play all with 3 areas with totally different genres. the 5 parks are, Thrillville Stunts, the Starter park based on action (duh),Which contains the areas Throttleville, Battleville,and Saddleville (cowboys). then there is Thrillville Explorer, which contains Relicville, Summitville, and Scurvyville ( WOO PIRATES!!!!!). then Thrillville Other worlds, with Uragiville,Astroville, and Oceanville. Thrillville Giants is next, with Candyville,LawnVille, and Casaville. FINALLY there is Thrillville Holidays, with Fallville, Winterville, and Summerville. the only downside is that it is kinda short.			"

												Love this game. Everything about this game I love but it's missing multiplayer and that would be amazing in this game creating together, solving some missions together and even going past the restrictions and making something amazing. I would love to see a thrillville 3. (Edited to stop people freaking out :))Graphics: The game is kinda old now so the graphics are dated but they are fitting for this game and if changed, would ruin the game and for that the graphics make the game unique. Audio: The audio for the game are funny to listen too, helpful to listen and also really relaxing and extremely entertaining. Controls: Controls are extremely simple to get used too and really cannot judge or anything. Super amazing. He best thing about this game is the mini games. You create a massive theme park and you are able to interact with everything from cleaning up litter to entertaining the crowd to riding a roller coaster to playing the arcade games. I have no problems with this game and is worth the money you pay for it.			"

												I had a great time replaying the game. I played this game as a kid on my PS2, and I recently rediscovered it on Steam. After having bought it, I quickly dove into it and had a great time. The controls are simple and not overly complicated, just like the menus. The coaster creator ROCKS, no waaaaaaay to hard mechanisms and controls. The graphics have changed since last time I played it (which is a looooooooooong time ago), but surely for the better. Just the overall feel and look of this game is a great theme park simulater where almost everything is possible and nothing is too complicated10/10, would play again			"

												I had a lot of fun playing both Thrillville and Thrillville: Off the Rails on my PS2. Seeing as how I currently don't have access to a PS2, I had to get OTR on Steam. It's a very fun game, and well worth some of your time. It's similar to Rollercoaster Tycoon, but Thrillville concentrates on more of the theme park in general rather than just rollercoasters (although those are still fun as hell). Managing a theme park is made perfect and simple in Thrillville. While there are definitely some downsides (limited energy for each park??), I think OTR is one for the books.			"

												This game was released in 2007 and was one of the best games ever made and still is one of the best. Playing Thrillville after 9 years gave me the same feeling of when I first played it. It's a very fun, achieving, and the best tycoon game ever made. You build your own rides, customize your own park, interact with others and in the end make tons of cash.Being a park manager with Thrillvile however brings big responsibilities: people trying to sabatage your park, rides breaking down, hiring new staff, firing staff sabataging your business, marketing campaigns and more.Throughout thrillville there is always sometimes to do, wether it be building new rides, training new workers, installing new rides, stalls, games or even having fun on those stalls, rides, or games. There is a big buisness side to this game along with fun mixed in with it.I highly recommend this game as the nostalgia for me is very real and the content inside the game for a 1.5GB game is amazing and phoenominal. Not to mention I bought this game for $2. WORTH IT.			"

When I found this game on steam on sale for $3.99 and with better graphics/less choppiness, I couldn't resist. It certainly lives up to expectations, especially for a 2007 game! JUst love it.			"

												A very fun game.  Especially great if you played it on PS2 a while back when it came out.  Not as fun these days, but I find myself playing it longer than I thought I would.Pros:-The rollercoaster building system is great, kind of weird at first, but if using a controller, it becomes easier.-Since it's a PS2 game, there's nothing to buy, no DLC.  Everything's included.  The arcade games could be full games with a little modifying.  They're not just thrown in, they're nicely thought out, and they're fun.  One's even a 3D flying game, with great controls.-Can talk to guests.-Custom rollercoasters.-Run around your park in third person.-Interesting parksCons:-Power Meter gets annoying.-INVERT CAMERA MEANS THAT IN THE FLYING GAME, YOU HAVE UNIVERTED CONTROLS ON THE LEFT STICK.  WHY.-No decorating like RCT.-Can have only one of each arcade game, but that's fine because of the power meter annoyance.-No landscaping like RCT.-Customization could be better, but it was a PS2 game, though the PC version -could- have been upgraded in some way.  Though, looking at the date of the game, I really can't blame it too much.  What could have been added to make it better?  Not anything I can think of without changing the game entirely.-No tunnels for rollercoasters.-Only building in predetermined areas.Overall:A fun game with not much in the way of you and having fun.  Even though I said there were all these flaws, it's fun.  And they're only really ""flaws"" because I'm used to RCT.			"

												Thrillville: Off the Rails is an adventure of a game, the sheet amount of content makes me incredulous. What makes it even better is the nostalgic feel when you play the minigames you played years ago. The arcade games have more content than most of the alpha games due to ""release"" soon.When your friends are away on spring break, or something like that. Just buy the game and get lost in the vast amount of content that it holds.it has baloons			"

												I wish the original Thrillville was available for steam but the sequel is just as good. You basically build themeparks, eack park has three different themes to choose from, there are also mini games and side missions and of course building rollarcoasters. Its not as detailed as RTC or anything but that actually plays to the games strengths and you never get bored since there are plenty of other things to do besides build. I loves the original for PS2 but the PC port of the sequel works very well.			"

												Ahh. Used to love this game when I was younger. It brings back so many memories.This PC port isn't so bad either. It runs really well for the most part, and is optimized pretty decently. The only issue I have with it is that there's no way to play the game windowed.Aside from that, it's a decent port. I can recommend this game if you liked games such as Rollercaster Tycoon and other games. It even has plenty of mini games to try out.			"
