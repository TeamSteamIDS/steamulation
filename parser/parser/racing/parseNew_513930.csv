												Whatever you do, do not pay for this ""game"". If i sat in my chair for the next 12 minutes and I did nothing, It would be far more fun and productive than if played this game. Steam should not offer content like this. It makes me think they just want to scam me out of my money.			"

												Dont buy. This game looks like a crappy port of a Mobile game that was developed in less then a week. A.I. Brain dead, Game more then likely stole assets, And physics are too drifty in circuit races. Here's a video I made on it.

												Not worth the money so i'm glad i got it free... There's only 5 cars.. It says it has a ""smart and dangerous A.I"" but no the A.I is crap and the driving physics is way too drifty for a racing game.			"

												Expected.As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that this game wouldn't be all that good. It had bad controls as it focuses on drifting above everything else but can't even handle drifting well, it wasn't thrilling and the maps did absolutely nothing to interest me, they were so unoriginal and far too simple. I enjoy racing games for the way they can be exciting, but this one was the exact opposite. It was boring. The fact that this game isn't free is stupid.Do I recommend this game? No.			"

												Good game, Funny af, physics need some work but fckin good, the game got released 1week ago or something like that, if you search fun, with a bit of difficulty buy it! I like the customisation setting.Same with body, and rims.The whole game is good expect some work to do on physics but its 50% good.Carreer mode is insame.If you want chill you got a freeroam mode.Need to add more cars.Good game buy it!

												So one main problem right now? No controller support! why do people make racing games and not give them controller support on release? Other than that its ok at the moment, does need alot of work though.			"

												It's strangely addictive and totally recommended for fans of PS2 era racers. It just needs controller support and a few bug fixes/updates. I think younger gamers will be put off by the arcade style physics and OG aesthetic, but if you're into the old NFS games this should be worth a look.			"

												Ok, this is going to be a very nfs underground2 inspired drift game... witch is good, really good! It has a lot of potential while being at alpha state now. They ve got the gameplay working pretty well and I think there is a learning curve with fully upgraded cars. I only used the S13 now. The cars also really change their handling with tuning, sadly most tuning options only affect the hp. I hope differential adjustment, wheel choice, stabilisators, spacers, weight distribution and reduction will be added soon. Also the map is not really interesting or large at all. But I think the developers should focus on the mechanics for now.The body tuning is on level of gtaV now, not quiet old nfs titles but again, there is potential... it feels more like a tech demo now. Also the paintshemes are not fitting, low res and so on, what about importing own shemes?After all I think if they stick to the graphics quailty they go with the cars and focus on game mechancis depth for now. Because they are allready on a good way there and this is where they can kick EAs♥♥♥♥♥now. They can later create a cheesy career story, add a nice map and combine everything to freeroam. Also I wouldn't add too many cars for now, more concentrate on the few now existing vehicles, giving them character while keeping them balanced, add options and over all keep it compact but make it good.Beside this: the turbo tuning is sick!

												wow not worth the 5 bucks but i see how much work has went into coding the game ui etc.....still needs a ton of work this is beta at best lacking content such as cars dyno a way to tune the parts you just bought etc....the driving is bad racing is worse there is a civic its an FF car and the game is based around drifting in every race so this does not work well while driving the car yet the other cars are FR they do better in the race as you would guess but still the drift factor is way to high every turn at nothing it goes sideways!!!!! and not cuz tha hp lolz  this could be a great game "
