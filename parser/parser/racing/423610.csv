If you've grown tired of crappy endless runners hitting the Steam marketplace, well, rejoice, as there's now one centered around feces. Where's My Mommy? is the tale of young Poopey in search of his mother after a terrible ""earthquake"" pulls the two apart. In his quest he travels through the colon in hopes of rescuing her before passing through the hole that no life has ever been seen from once it passes through, all the while avoiding a plethora of obstacles and memes along the way. But is this title worth the nearly six dollars US currency, or does its Binding of Isaac/Newgrounds style of artwork in the trailer stand as the only aspect of the game worth noting?For the most part the humor is subtle, but it wears thin within the first minute or two of actual game play. Playing as a mound of excrement is a running joke we're seeing quite a lot of, perhaps as an allegory for the Steam Greenlight system and approval process. This includes the recent fecal inspired platformer titled Freedom Poopie that has your tightly packed hero collecting items and solving mini puzzles to clear a level, as well as a number of other bodily fluid inspired entries too poorly done to make it to the storefront. For Where's My Mommy?, however, you just have to jump over or through certain dangerous barriers. Some of them are cheeky, such as the skeletal remains of a hamster, bags of cocaine, condoms, as well as half of what appears to be Spongebob Squarepants and, well, that's about the extent of the humor that isn't internet troll faces on gold coins or the Lord of the Rings Aragorn meme about how ""one does not simply just"" to explain things such as how animal bones and diarrhea will hurt the player. There's no need for those last two to exist here unless trying to bait Jim Sterling into covering this game which, if so, it backfired as it only attracted this reviewer (so far).The control scheme can seem a bit daunting at first but, really, it ends up just three buttons/keys. Q turns you to liquid to pass through porous or grated objects, d hardens you to destroy the others, and both a and the space bar jump. There is a double jump option but, at the time of writing this review, the second pressing of the button to trigger it doesn't always respond as well as it needs to, not to mention I've accidentally gotten it to triple jump somehow on two occasions. The instructions during the practice segments, however, show the Xbox controller scheme, and not the keyboard, so if you forget you have to play a bit of s guessing game to advance. And, really that's the height of the difficulty across the game's three modes of play.Story mode is literally a casual runner experience, and where you'll spend most of your time trying to save your mother. It's a good way to get some practice in, though offers very little actual challenge, or anything of real interest to keep you going other than a random ""Hey, look at that, how'd that get in there?"" moment like the observance of a severed finger tucked away neatly. There's also Endless mode which is literally the endless runner approach to the game with the same level of difficulty, while Sadist mode throws more difficult challenges at you. Of course, those challenges are just the same gimmicky obstacles, but more of them, and all clumped tightly together.All that said, Where's My Mommy? does look good for an endless runner style game, not to mention does have a fairly catchy soundtrack. There are some random elements like harmonized flatulence that may catch you off guard, as well as a man shouting ""I need an adult!"" in the background that I believe is from South Park, but it's hard to tell. Either way, the audio does stand as one of the more impressive aspects, but even that isn't quite enough to save the gameplay, or keep you going.Where's My Mommy? is the most basic of bare bones concepts for the style, though with a stagnant humorous set-up that doesn't last beyond the first few minutes of playing, leaving simpler titles like Mindless Running, yet another cutesy endless runner with a story mode that only costs one US dollar, to be a far more viable option to waste plenty of time on because it knows what it is and isn't trying to reinvent the wheel with the same tools and strive to reach the same outcome. Instead of relying on you to care to ask ""What else is up this person/animal's ♥♥♥?"", that one focuses on being a competent game with a simple story and proper increasing difficulty curve that makes it more a score attack experience than one simply meant to shock you or play up your childish sense of humor, something I admit to have yet still found this title bland.To put it bluntly, Where's My Mommy? is just boring. It's just a one-joke gimmick that plays off the popularity of a genre that is completely over saturated the way it is. There's little to really keep the player going except for achievements, and even then they aren't worth the time or six US dollars for such a barren experience. Even at one or two dollars, you're left with something that loses the power of its punchline almost immediately, leaving you having spent money for something that would have been better received on mobile devices or Newgrounds. Hopefully the developer does or adds more to this game in the future but, as it stands, you can only polish a turd so much before you just accept that fact that it is, indeed, a turd.			"

												Quick Review: A relatively weak and uninspiring Endless Runner that gets boring as soon as the joke wears off (which is quick). At £4.79 or your regional equvilent this is an expensive game for the genre.Longer-ish Review: ""Where's My Mommy?"" is an endless runner that sees you mother get ejected out of your hosts poop hole and into the great beyond. Enter our protagonist a considerably small piece of fecal matter who must go on an endless runner quest to find her. The game has 3 main mechanics; the ability to jump over obstacles, the ability to go squishy to pass through gaps & permeable onstacles and the ability to go hard and break stuff like condoms. While this all sounds like a silly fun laugh that is pretty much it. you amble through the levels basically trying to work out (and sometimes guess) which objects require you to go hard and which squishy. It is bizarre logic most of the time which is which and totally random others. Either way this mechanic definitely did not add to the game and I felt it would have worked much better just giving me things to jump over and dodge.For fans of the genre there could be a fun 5 minutes here but for the price there really is better examples of the genre on the market.For our initial first play of the game check our our video below: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/literal-first-play/160302_wheres-my-mommy-literal-first-playA KEY FOR THE GAME WAS KINDLY PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER FOR REVIEW PURPOSES.

												As I figured when I saw this, this game is a very simplistic, rushed ""Gimmick"" game made only to appeal to the ""Pewdie Pie"" mentalities of the world.. but then again doesn't he have over 40 million subscribers?  ..Well no wonder the developer here is trying so hard to appeal to that kind of mentality.

			Get this ""craptastic game"" right here on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/423610/ If you're really dying to play a game as a piece of crap, ""Freedom Poopie"" is cheaper and a much better game!		

Good for a few quick and simple laughs maybe (or to make your squeamish mother or girlfriend gag), but as far as gameplay and fun, naw.. not for long anyhow.  This game will quickly bore even the most hardcore ""poop"" fans.*** 42% IS MY SCORE, WATCH MY VIDEO REVEW ABOVE TO SEE HOW I CAME UP WITH THAT SCORE ***Not recommended.. Unless you're name is ""Pewdie Pie"" then this game will have definite value because it will make you fake giggle and snort for all of perhaps 15 minutes and get you millions of views and thousands of dollars in revenue, otherwise the value is just not here.. 'nor is it much fun.			"

												Where's my Mommy is a game which uses outdated memes and is about poop coming out of a butt. I don't think there's much else to it. Aside from giving you motion sickness.Here's my video where I discuss why I don't like the game.

												I do not have the right words to describe this game... ""Gross"" is the first thing to pop up into my mind and yes, indeed it's pretty gross. But as a game, it's a solid casual arcade and it's pretty fun to play, but... Yet again, gross. So, yeah... It's a good arcade, but it is indeed completelly full of sнiт in every aspect a human mind can try to comprehend. It's not a sнiттy game per se... All the contrary. The game is well-made and it's fun to play, but... It's about lil' sнiт, that you'll be moving around large intestine forward to... Well... You know. So, yeah. Yeaaaah... I can't even rate this game, Jesus. Well, it's good and not so good at same time. You'll get it once you try it. So... In case if you are, for some reason are looking for some gross but fun games, this ones hits the spot. This game is exactly what you needed in your life and you should probably try it out.			"

												This game is absolutely disgusting. At the same time it's hilarious. The art style is fantastic, even though it's obviously parody-style. The music can be a little much, but it also feels like they're trying to make it funny, so that actually worked for me. The gameplay is super simplistic, I swear this game would sell more if I could play it on my smartphone. It's really DAMN hard though, you have to be really fast...I mean it's a runner game, you get exactly what you expect. Is it worth $6? No. Is it worth $3? Probably not. Get it on sale though, the game is well developed and a decent game to kill some time and/or rage at for a couple minutes before deciding to play something more involved. And disclaimer...I haven't finished it yet. I can't even finish the second level, it's so ridiculously difficult. This was my first look video. In terms of gameplay it doesn't change from this:

												I need to leave in 15 min. Gonna play this new game about running poop. Sh*t, it's been 1.5 hours. DAMN YOU TAMPON. More seriously, Where's my mommy is an independant endless rail runner (which is not my favorite kind of game) but the gameplay is simple to master yet fun, the ost is nice and the game is quite hard ( unlike a lot of its peers which are too easy IMO).I think is the game is quite addictive and pleasant as you don't see the time pass. Kind of reminded me of the time games were released because they were fun to watch and fun to play.For 5.99€ or equivalent, this is a great buy : if you have a few coins to spare, and hours to kill, you should consider making it a place in your library.10/Poop, would visit the colon of a mexican mule pornstar again.

Not because you actualy play with $hit that someone may find disgusting with everything you encounter on your way out, but because trust me when the Poopy start rollin' you will need Asian gene to complete the game. Yes it is challenging!So if you are not in fast-paced runner games think twice before you buy this no matter how cute it looks Graphic models and textures are OK! Sounds and music are OK! Nothing bad at it and nothing impressive.Game runs great, I didn't encounter any glitches or bugs.Price is fair with ammount of fun this game can provide.Highly recommended to fans of 2D runner gamers.

												This game is pretty nasty, but I'm sure that is exactly what the developers intended on. It isn't super deep, but I think for what it is it does a pretty good job and is pretty entertaining based on shock value alone (which isn't for everyone). If you are wondering if the game is worth a buy I would suggest watching some actual gameplay to get a feel for it. I did a let's play of it which I will link, but if you prefer less reactionary material and just want to see the gameplay golden giveaways has also done a non-commentary video of it.
