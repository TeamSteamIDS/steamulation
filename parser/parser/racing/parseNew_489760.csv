												Awesome two-button schmup! Simple but tight controls with a deep skill curve. The over the top explosions and rad soundtrack make it a joy to kick♥♥♥♥♥for Satan. "

												Fun bullet-dodger/bullet-hell with a slightly unique twist to it. The inability to actually steer, and the controls consiting of entire left side of keyboard and entire right side of keyboard, its truly a good time to see how far you can get.			"

Demon Truck is one of those hidden gem arcade games that really showcases a novel mechanic. I should have picked this up long ago. If you are into arcade games with mechanics that are simple-to-learn, yet impossible-to-master like Downwell or One Finger Death Punch, you'll likely really enjoy Demon Truck.Essentially, you only need two buttons; the right mouse button accelerates/shields you, and the left mouse button attacks in random directions. The truck is possessed, and steers itself. It generally avoids obstacles, but if you are going to hit one, you just accelerate/shield through it. By using the attack, you refill the accelerate/shield meter, and vice-versa. Sounds complicated, but it is brilliantly simple. There are neat upgrade choices at the end of each round. Do you want another turret, or would you like to refill your health - that kind of thing.Definately has that one-more-run appeal that will have you chasing your friend's scores on the leaderboards.Pros:+Really neat and novel mechanic+Controls are as simple as it gets - literally two buttons+Each level ends with a choice of upgrades that add a cool high-risk-high-reward component+Super cheapCons:-I'd be hard pressed to find any 'cons' with this little gem - if you know of any, please comment belowWell worth it for any lover of indie games.

												Interesting shmup! Pretty much applying one finger death punch into a shmup, but it feels... Less responsive. One button shoots. The other accelerates/parries.You avoid bullets by ramming into them while accelerating. It is quite satisfying.Definitely a fun title and the music is fantastic.			"

												Great music, great gameplay, two button design is awesome.  Ruined entirely by one fatal flaw.Roadblocks are the only real threat you face.  They pop out of the top of the screen with only a split second given to react.  You're supposed to push the boost button to break through them, but if you're too slow you will take damage.  The truck is supposed to help you by auto-steering around them, but you quickly discover that this gimmick is something you simply cannot rely on.  The view is very zoomed in, so you cannot see these hazards coming in advance.The meat of the game, fighting enemies, is really easy.  You will effortlessly parry enemy fire, chew through bosses, but every run will end because of road hazards chipping away at your health one by one.Yes, I have the reflexes to deal with the roadblocks.  No, I don't think it's fun, because that is the only challenge this game offers.  You're just trying to be vigilant about one small part of the gameplay while you utterly decimate all other threats.  It's very unbalanced game design, and I cannot recommend it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Demon Truck (PC) - A Review - Also, Rank 15 In The World 

			Views: 377		

			Not much more I can add to this. 15th in THE ENTIRE WORLD. Also quite a lot of gameplay, and some nonsensical rambling about kale at one point, I think. Fun game. Highly recommended.		

Not being able to move is odd. Other than that, it's sort-of like Downwell and a Shmup had a demonic baby, that baby built a car, and then sold the car to Doomguy. Also, in that video, I get rank #15 in THE WORLD. So y'know. I know what I'm doing.			"

												Lots of explosions, a cool button masher feeling, and a sick heavy metal midi soundtrack make this the kind of game that will always make you smile... and then swear violently when you explode.			"

												The subject matter,art style and music are amazing. I was under the impression this was a shmup/bullet hell style game. I do like the game but if you included a mode where you could move to dodge enemy attacks, you would have one hell of a shooter on your hands.			"

												Minimalistic arcade awesomess; as simple as it gets - two buttons: boost and run over or shoot to kill. Nevertheless it has suprising depth in those quite simple mechanics. Bought it in sale and it's still worth every cent. Quick game for short burst of demonic joy.			"
