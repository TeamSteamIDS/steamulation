												Bought this game with the intent of playing it on the rift CV1, apparently it just doesn't work at all. I think the version of the game that supports CV1 is only avaiable through oculus home which sucks.			"

												WHAT A SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!  I purchased this game so I could play with with my Oculus Rift DK2 and it worked perfect.  The dev has since removed rift support in this version which already worked simply to force us to purchase it again through oculus home?  Are you freaking kidding me???			"

												BlazeRush is one of the games you get in a bundle, activate the key, idle the cards and leave it in your library to collect dust, but trust me this game needs to played by everyone who like arcadey top down racing games.BlazeRush is about racers who like racing (great story right ?) and there's a corporation that tries to stop them racing by taking over every planet they race in.Of course you are not in it for the story and for the gameplay and let me tell you it's quite a treat.There are  main events and I'll go through each one. The regular races where you need to finish first and try not to get destroyed by the enemy drivers, king of the hill where you try to stay in the lead for 50 seconds and a deathmatch where there's a steam roller behind you and you try to be the final person alive, a time trial mode where you need to finish a lap in a certain amount of time and there's a boss battle in the final mission where you need to use the weapons you used in the game to destroy the ""Boss"". Each of these events are very chaotic and they are incredibly difficult so don't expect to breeze through all the events. The enemy AI is violent and every chance they get they will take you out and trust me you need to play dirty to win.The soundtrack is really great as well and is awesome to listen to when you are playing this game.The graphics are alright for the most part, and I love the cell shaded look for the tracks. The track designs range from mediocre to pretty good. Each track has certain points where you can jump out of the track if you use boosters, but those parts are marked on the map, but it's still sometimes frustrating.Now for the bad things for the game:The one thing I hated was the fact that when you die you are set back so far back that there is almost no point in competing and the only solution is to restart.The controls if you are using a keyboard takes a lot of time getting used to and I highly HIGHLY recommend using a controller.The difficulty comes off as really difficult even in the early stages and not to mention the final act in the volcano planet has a massive difficulty spike and the final boss is quite tough, so be prepared for a challenge.The camera is atrocious, it only follows the leading car at all times so if you are too far behind and too far ahead you will have to use the map to navigate the entire map.Overall BlazeRush is a really fun game and it's pretty difficult as well, while I don't think it's worth the full price, it's worth it if it's in a bundle or on a discount.Final Rating:7/10 - Worth checking outIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about this review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												There are LOTS of “over the top” racing games available. Some have better physics or realistic tracks, some have more versatile and adaptable camera angles, and some have better soundtracks.But “BlazeRush” has a remarkable combination of variety of tracks, outrageous quantity of awards (and a great points system), and just LOTS of quick, repeatable fun with a wide choice of cars to make every race as different as one might wish. I don’t know about multiplayer yet, but I suspect that’s where “BlazeRush” really shines. But what I love? The really cool achievements, a third of which are cumulative. This type of short race game can become a bit tedious, but with so much variety as to cars, weapons, tracks, physics (such as different planets), this won’t happen any time soon. Currently I have about a dozen tracks that I’ve managed to unlock that I haven’t had time to even examine yet. And numerous untried cars as well.As a player with a “bad” left hand, I generally have to be cautious when I buy any driving game (especially expensive ones.) No problem here, except for hand fatigue, as with any controller (or keyboard) game requiring both hands to play. The controls work very well, even when they’re not meant to (as in certain types of tracks or deliberate cool physics gimmicks.) The menus are simple, yet adequate and seem to be anything a player might ask for. Graphics aren’t exactly Earth-shaking, but are in no way lacking. Really, my only issue so far is that the camera seems to follow the lead cars, and a trailing driver may find themself off the screen entirely. (But unlikely for more than a few seconds.) A car leaving the track entirely will find themselves returned, but at a small loss to position.I’ll make every attempt to come back when I have more to say, but if you have REMARKABLY little to spend (for a few more days, at least), I think most people will be very happy adding “BlazeRush” to their collection of FUN OTT racing games.Thank you.

												BlazeRush is more or less a top down (angled view) kart racer. You select from a list of characters and racing along various tracks, collecting power-ups to knock the other opponents off the track. There are 16 characters to select (some are unlockable) along with a bunch of power-ups to choose from. BlazeRush really excells in it's smooth controls and addictive gameplay. I wouldn't have expected this game to be as much as fun but it is awesome. BlazeRush features a full single player campaign and multiplayer. The online multiplayer works flawlessly as well and playing it with friends is outstanding. You battle constantly and the game allows for some amazing moments to happen, due to the fast pace of the races. There are three main game modes: Race (a traditional lap race), King of the Hill (Whoever stays in first the longest wins), and the cream of the crop - Death Race. Death Race is when you are speeding down the track, fighting other racers and avoiding a giant death machine. Whoever is the last to die, wins.

												If you have a VR Headset DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION OF THIS GAME. The developer is NOT supporting VR on the steam version, just the Oculus Home store. This is absurd. I found out AFTER buying the game on Steam. How is anyone supposed to realize VR is not included when the price is the same, the game name is the same, and there ARE people playing this game in VR and posting reviews online?I will never buy another game from this developer and I suggest you don't buy anything either. Having 2 versions of the same game without the same capabilities for the same price is shady. Complete scam. It's like if Battlefield or whatever game was released on Steam and Origin (or uPlay, GoG, any other platform) but the steam version didn't include online multiplayer support. And they were the same price. Wouldn't you feel cheated? That's exactly what this developer did. 0/10. Played for a few minutes in Steam Theater and realized this isn't worth my time without proper VR support.			"

												The racing genre has retained its popularity after many years, but nowadays most titles offer the regular recipe of driving from a realistic perspective, using behind the car, cockpit, or ""first-person"" views. Even so, there are still those who prefer isometric experiences that hark back to the early days of the games industry.BlazeRush is an example of such a modernized experience, as developer Targem Games wants to offer an isometric racing game that's fun, fast, and balanced with a wide array of abilities and bonuses, not to mention varied vehicles with advantages and disadvantages.Even if most racing games nowadays abandon any semblance of a story, BlazeRush still has a single-player campaign that offers a bit of background on the game's universe, its characters, and more. It doesn't take itself seriously, thankfully, and just uses a bit of reasoning to promote a more eco-friendly message, not to mention one against evil corporations.Of course, one of the most important things in BlazeRush is the gameplay. The action takes place on different circuits across multiple environments. You race against a different number of opponents each time and the goal is to ensure you score trophies, which then unlock new stages and events.The actual racing mechanics feel pretty good, but it's important to note that you can only control your vehicle with the analog stick on the controller or the keyboard keys. There's no acceleration or braking, so it might take some time to get used to BlazeRush.Things get a bit more complex as you progress through the campaign, as the circuits are filled with portions that don't have any guard rails, not to mention tight corners and ramps that, when taken with extra speed, can propel you outside the track's bounds.Besides the intense racing experience, the game also features different weapons and speed bonuses that drop onto the circuit from above in a chaotic manner. The weapons range from a minigun to a sawblade launcher, a guided missile, a goo ball that can slow your ride, and much more.The game also drops behind the leader crates with speed bonuses. These range from a lengthy but moderate speed increase to rocket tubes that provide short but powerful boosts, fans that work when you don't make sudden turns, and other such things.In terms of race types, there are quite a few interesting ones. Of course, as always, there are lap-based events where crossing the finish line first is the only thing that matters. There are also King of the Hill-type races where you need to stay in front of the pack for a total of 50 seconds. The most hectic, however, is the Death Race type, in which a giant steamroller barrels down the track towards the competing cars.Many crazy trophies are awarded at the end of the race for all sorts of feats you manage during the actual event. From seizing or losing victory in the final meters to unleashing crazy weapons and perfect boosts, they are rewarded with hilarious mentions.Vehicle variety is pretty solid, with each car/ship boasting three core stats, in the form of mass, acceleration, and handling.While BlazeRush manages to deliver a solid racing experience, it does get a bit frustrating when you're stuck in the back of the pack, as the game teleports you in order to keep up with others. This can get confusing quite fast. It also doesn't do that good of a job when it comes to highlighting your own vehicle. If the cars are grouped up and the same model is used by an AI, you can easily lose sight of your ride.BlazeRush looks decent but it's clear that Targem emphasizes framerate over pretty graphics. The game maintains a really fast framerate at all times, no matter how hectic the action might get. The cars and the tracks also look pretty good but the surrounding environments aren't that impressive.The soundtrack is instrumental only and features quite a bit of dubstep, house, or techno tracks. It matches the action on the screen quite well, so you'll certainly enjoy it.BlazeRush is a really fun isometric arcade racing experience that manages to deliver explosive action, imaginative weapons, and balanced speed boosts to create an addictive flow			"

												Local co-op, check. Local co-op + can play online, check. Immersive and exciting game, check. Blaze rush is an action racing thriller designed to test your Mario Kart capabilities from an angled top down view. For something so simple, the game is ensured to keep you coming back to play again and again. BlazeRush is a violent racing game with extremely simplistic racing controls. There is no specific button to break as acceleration is achieved by moving the left joystick in the direction you'd like to go. There is an arrow drawn to indicate which way you are pointing the joystick. Three main attributes are given to the vehicles which are mass, acceleration, and handle-ability. The three are self explanatory but depending on how you like to play (dangerous vs pre-cautious) will determine which vehicle you choose. Each vehicle is made with a different purpose.  Some are tank like and slow, but are heavy and hard to knock around. Some are hover vehicles and are quite fast, but fly easily when they get hit. The hover vehicles feel like the dominant ones to me but I have noticed online four wheelers are the go to choice. Once you choose a vehicle, it's time to choose a race type. In King of the Hill, the winning player simply has to hold the lead. Deathmatch requires you to be first again however there is a giant steam rolling chasing behind you. Fail to keep up or stay ahead and you'll soon be squashed. This game mode is the best one in my opinion as it's last person standing. The last game mode is racing, where obviously the goal is to come first at the end of doing a set amount of laps. Players are able to choose game type and map when starting a game and after completing a game. This sort of UI keeps everything running smooth jumping from event to event. Playing local co-op mixed in with a few people from online adds another dimension to the game AI's couldn't do. It is extremely funny to come across different play styles of gamers that race online. None the less though, I've seen the AI's take some crazy risks that I would consider absurd. Usually, they play it safe by toeing the line but I've caught a few AI's trying to jump ramps and even over turns to beat me. There aren't numerous power ups like Mario Kart but the essential ones feel there. There are two main power up types, nitro based and weapon based. Nitro based are different as some will provide quick acceleration for a short period of time while some are gradual acceleration over a longer period of time. Weapons come in the form of bioacid that slows the player down, a Star Wars looking plate dish push force, machine gun that fires numerous times, a homing missile that slowly closes in on the target in front of you, and a saw blade that spins vehicles out of control. Power up drops are consistent throughout events. Graphics and design are completely suitable to the atmosphere and game play surrounding BlazeRush. The tires bounce appropriately and the collisions feel excellent. Only complaint is when turning into someone at the start, it doesn't feel as though you can steer them off course by pushing them. It does work when the game picks up and the speeds are different but can feel awkward when first starting a race. Explosions are well done and re spawn graphics and times are excellent. There is even a horn that sounds in deathmatch when the steam roller begins it's speed tirade. Sounds are graphics deliver exactly what they are meant to bring, excitement and suspense when spinning out of control.I would highly recommend this game on everyone's library, for a good sale price of course :). For the full price I bought four copies of the games, so may not be a bad idea to wait. The fact that you can play local co-op and play online simply shows these guys care. Even if you don't have a buddy to play with, the single player campaign will satisfy your one player needs before jumping online to cause some havoc. Everything seems like it was done right here and done with proper attention and care. For future development perhaps add more weapons and game modes? Maybe even add something that disrupts the terrain? There are some cool maps that were designed, would be nice to maybe integrate them with the attacks. Indie Rating : 8.8/10RATING : 7.65/10 Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B+ Overall  B ScreenShots  Different game modes and screen before playing the next race. Player two even gets a vote Character selection screen with the three attributes displayed in 2 player mode Local co-op with someone about to go the wrong way They made it extremely easy to add more players to the game (up to four). The player with a blue circle around them is being transported closer to the group as he is too far back and the other guy who has fire coming out of his engine, well he got blown up while the other guy is speeding away with nitro What career mode looks like 6 player online madness  There were 3 in my party and 3 others already playing a game in which we jumped in  Small obstructions or gaps will appear in some levels  Seriously fix the track Video :  Blaze Rush Highlights Review "

												I have a lot of these ""mini racers"" or ""top down racers"" now, both combat (Burning Cars, Death Rally) and non-combat (Bang Bang Racing, MiniMotor EVO, Little Racers Street, Real World Racing), and while I have only gotten into a few of them, I think I have seen enough of Blazerush to say that it's the best one on Steam. The controls feel spot-on from the moment you begin, and they even feel pretty good with the keyboard. Works well with Xbox360 controller, does not work with directinput gamepad. Acceleration with the 360 controller is ""push in the direction to move"" instead of say a throttle trigger or button, which felt odd at first, but I quickly grew to like it. There are a lot of cars to choose from, all with a cool sort of Micromachines-meets-MadMax type of style. They have only 3 attributes each (acceleration, mass, and handling) but some feel different based on their wheel config (two or 4 wheels, tracked, hover, etc). There seems to be plenty of tracks to unlock, with quite a few different themes, but maybe too many of them have the same ""wasteland"" feel to them.  I know it's supposed to be that way, but it actually makes some of the tracks too similar. Amazon and the snow ones are nice standouts. The main drawback to the game as I have seen (only a few hours played so far) is the lack of upgrades & customization for the vehicles - there are none. No skins, no engine or weapon upgrades to buy, no garage to manage, the only thing to do in this game is pick a car and race. Not a big deal but it is a bit one-dimensional. The game could definitely use more weapons as well,  so far have autogun, saw, missle, slime, & sonic; perhaps I haven't unlocked them all yet, but I havent seen any others in any screenshots. In quite a few ways this game reminded me of Cel Damage, with the wild comebacks and last-second heroics, or knowing you were blasted off the track to oblivion but getting in that last perfectly-aimed kill as you fall down a cliff. It could have taken another page from Cel Damage by including more weapons, and my number one request would be a mode where you choose exactly which powerups are available in a given skirmish race. In other words, maybe you feel like all rocket boosters and buzz saws, so you could make it so only those populate in that race. The game runs at like 300 frames per second, which ran too hot for my gpu, but it has it's own FPS limiter in the options*, so I won't have to remember to change my fps limit manually on my gpu every time I play. Nice! *for some reason when I limit the game to 120 fps, it runs at 111 fps. When I had used my gpu's limiter, I ran at 90 fps and it ran 90, idk why the in-game limiter runs different but it doesnt matter much). The one time I went to play multiplayer, it was a lot of fun but only one round was going on, with about 6-8 people playing. It was a little bit laggy but very fun. All in all, I really enjoy this game, and the mix of challenge vs casual fun seems about right. A good choice if you are looking for a top down mini racer, even without a sale price.			"

												Love this game! I used to play Rock'N Roll Racing and Radical Psycho Machines back on the SNES. This is the same style game and it is still a blast to play.Gameplay: I use an 360 controller. You can pick up and play right away. Controls are easy and response is great. After that you just race and blast the other drivers. There are different game modes, so far I love the race with the giant spiked roller that crushes you if you fall behind.Graphics: nothing crazy realistic but it is not a realistic kind of game. They look just fine and work well for this arcade style game.Music: I'm a bit biased here as I loved Rock'N Roll Racing back in the day and part of that was the great tunes. I don't really notice the music in this game. I will generally mute it and run a play list of classic songs that sound good on the road.Multiplayer: There is online play but not many games available. I think this game thrives on local play. You get the same kind of feel as playing mario kart or mario party mini games, very competative but fun.All in all, if you like fun race games I recommend this one. Two thumbs up!			"

												The game is fun but the dev company's attitude regarding VR is simply ridiculous! I bought the game after March 28 and recently got the Rift, just to figure out that the steam version ""doesn't support"" VR! IMO, this is a scam to make people spend another 10 euro on the game. I emailed Targem asking for a solution and they basically said ""rebuy the game from Oculus Store if you want to play it in VR"". I hope Targem changes its business model regarding VR titles.			"

												I give this game a 9/10.This is a classic top down multiplayer kart racing game. Quite possibly, this game is the best of it's kind in the genre.You can play up to 8 players or bots and there's 16 different vehicles to choose from, each with their unique abilities and stats. There is also a Career Mode where you play the different game modes against bots in different difficulties to earn medals, awards and you can even unlock new vehicles.Pros:There's multiple fun gamemodes such as Death Match, Normal Lap Race and King of The Hill. There's also a good amount of modifiers like Power Ups and Speed Boosts which are a ton of fun too.Now, the time I've spent playing this game so far is the most fun I've ever had with a multiplayer arcade game since my early childhood! It's chaotic, fast and action-packed gameplay keeps you hooked, especially if you play with your friends. When playing with my friends we find ourselves continously gagging with laughter during every match we played. The amount of hilarious wipeouts and tricks you can pull off is awesome and the biggest selling point of the game for me.Cons:I don't think there are any cons at all to be honest. None that I have found.I strongly recommend this game for you gamers that are looking for a really fun experience with freinds. And if you're a fan of top down kart racing games, this is a must buy! I really hope they expand this game into something bigger than it already is and add more content!			"

												It's not a *bad* game. The graphics are nice and, once I got used to the odd scheme, the controls work well. But it never felt exciting to race. There's no sensation of speed, and the catch up mechanic to keep everyone in the race creates a disincentive to put in any real effort until the last section of the final lap. Possibly fun if you have IRL friends to play with, but even then it'd likely only be entertaining in very short bursts.			"

IntroductionBlazeRush is a third-person perspective, arcade racer that combines simple controls with brilliant physics resulting in one hell of a good time. This is the type of game that you may look at and ignore, or you obtain it somehow and let it sit in your library. Well let me just say that BlazeRush is worth your time and money, here's why.GameplayBlazeRush is a primarily single-stick controlled game with power-ups. Think of Mario Kart but at a fixed camera angle and without any real complex driving mechanics whatsoever. Simply point the controller stick in the direction you wish to go, and your vehicle will go in that direction (also indicated by an arrow at the front of the vehicle). I'll say it now that this game requires a controller for precision; I would not recommend using KB+M for it. Now, you may not be into that sort of thing, that's fine. However, neither am I, yet this game managed to actually capture my attention on multiple occasions. Power-upsThanks to power-ups, it turns a pretty standard game into one hell of an explosive, speed-fest. From rocket boosts, to actual (semi) heat-seeking rockets, racing and combat collide in a desperate struggle for first-place. Just as power-ups make Mario Kart highly entertaining, power-ups are absolutely amazing in BlazeRush. The system for obtaining them is also a bit unique. Items simply fall from the sky at random, and people can drive into them to collect them. They fall a lot more frequently for the people further behind the leaders but leaders can continue to collect items that they may need in the future to maintain that lead.Catch-upNow due to the fixed camera angle, obviously some cars may fall too far behind and then no longer be visible. As a result, there is an automatic catch-up system in the game. Fall too far behind and the game will automatically move you close enough to the rest of the racers without giving you any advantages. The system here feels fluid and balanced and never takes away from the flow of the game. VehiclesEach type of vehicle has their own strengths and weaknesses. Tank-type vehicles will do excellently on cornering, but drifting is horrible on them, and their top speed is pretty limited. Racing-type vehicles are great at speed in all aspects, and can drift, but their handling is pretty weak and can easily be pushed out of the stage with various weapons. Flying-type vehicles are a bit balanced in most aspects but don't expect them to shine in any particular aspect.CampaignThe campaign is one of the best ways to actually get into this game. Levels progress in difficulty slowly, introducing you to different environments, weapons, vehicles and power-ups. The AI provides a healthy challenge while not being too over-the-top or rage inducing.VisualsThe graphics of BlazeRush are well designed and attractive, combining a semi-cartoony look with over-the-top explosions for an insanely fun experience. AudioVehicle sounds, weapons, power-ups and other elements of the game sound very good and really give the right effect at the right time. The soundtrack is fairly well varied and entertaining. For an arcade game such as this, it felt right at home.Summary & ConclusionI didn't expect much from BlazeRush but after playing it on so many occasions I have to admit it is quite fun and addicting. It's even more so playing with other people, but the campaign is highly challenging and worth playing too. I'm quite impressed that this game has captivated my interest this much and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes arcade racers in general.8/10 - Friendships will be destroyed this dayIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												I don't think I've ever taken the time to ""review"" a game before, but that's the least this game deserves. I bought it to try out on my Oculus Rift DK2 and it instantly became my favourite experience to date.The graphics are perfect for VR and the current resolution limitations of the DK2. The car models and tracks are detailed and nicely stylised, while the explosions and smoke effects are just stunning. I feel very immersed in VR and it worked perfectly first time and without any tinkering.The controls, physics and handling have clearly been refined a lot during development as they are spot on. The music is OK, but could do with a bit more variety. The tracks are fine but I would like to see some more creative designs and / or a level editor in the future.Multiplayer is great but there doesn't seem to be too many people playing online at the moment. I've only managed to play online twice (probably 20 odd races in total) but everything was smooth and incredibly addictive.I would recommend this game to everyone with a DK2 as it is a fantastic experience in VR and the developer deserves a lot of praise and support for their efforts!

												BlazeRush is not really a bad game. The game looks nice, runs smoothly and I enjoyed it for a little while. But in the end, the game was very disappointing to me.The feel of the driving is pretty bad imo. There's no sense of speed or momentum. You just simply point the analog stick in the direction you want to go (there are no separate buttons for accelerating and braking). Also, the horrible catch up mechanic ruins the competitiveness of the game. There's no point in trying to lead the race until the last section of the final lap. Why do we even race multiple laps if only the last one matters?! Mashed is still by far my favorite local multi-player racing game.			"

												This is the most insanely, incredibly, awesomely arcade racing game of all history. It's not only a game inspired by Rock and Roll Racing but rather an entire redesign/redefinition/reimagination of the whole genre.

												I`m gonna be honest here, the only reason I bought this game is to get 3500gs in star conflict, I really expected it to be another arcade looking game that I am gonna be a bit bored of after one hour. . . . . . well appeartly I was wrong! I was full of sarcasim when I fired it up and started the career, didn`t expect much of it, but after advancing a little and doing a few races, I was really starting to like this game, and it`s unique styling and cute looking hovercrafts, little tanks and cars.✽ graphics:- there isn`t much to say about how the game look, it looks good, more team fortress 2 graphics, nothing special, but again it was never intended to look super realistic or anything, whats really awesome here is that the game support quad HD resolution and what appears to be unlimited framerate( u can enter the desired frames in a box in graphics settings), and it`s not heavy on your system so any low end capable gpu would be able to handle it. ✽ gameplay:- zero learning curve is the right word, it`s pretty straight forward, mind you I used a xbox 360 controller but even with a keyboard and mouse it`s easy, you steer with a joystick and use turbo and press A and B for firing, nothing simpler than that.but all this doesn`t make the game easy, you`ll have to focus and keep an eye on drop out, since there is no dying or anything, even if you fall behind you get picked to the end of the pack and there always booster drops at the rear, so your never left behind, thats what make this game unique in it`s gameplay, because you will have to use a combination of strategies in order to win, you`ll have to be a good race, keep an eye for drop weapons and boost, and keep an eye out for other players shooting at you, it`s also worth mentioning that there are plenty of charcter cars and tracks to pick from and every car is different in term of acceleration, strength and handle. ✽ multiplayer:- I would say that this is the kind of game that you simply play with your family or non gamer friend, due to it`s zero learning curve, the game is build from the ground up for local multiplayer fun or of course online, if you have a HTPC at home that is hooked up to a big TV this game would be a great for parties and gatherings, since not only the gaming experience is fun but also there are not much violance and it has a great soundtrack!!✽ value:- of course value is always relative to the buyer, but there are always a reasonable price and well u know when your being ripped off, and in this case your not being ripped off if you buy it, the game retails at steam for abit less than 10$, and I got it for 8.50$ shorty after releaes, at this price it`s pretty reasonable, and even lower if you buy the 4- pack which is what I did, so each copy would be close to 6$, add to that the special promotion of getting 3500gs in star conflict for each game/user and u have urself a really good deal. gaijin entertainment never fails to impress, and I am glad eastern devs are starting to produce decent games, last time I checked S.T.A.l.k.R series was the only game that cought attention worldwide which is made from an eastern dev. so good job gaijin for the great and zero bugs game, I would also like to say that they have a great and fast responding support team, so thats another plus right there. so what I like about this game. ✔ no learning curve, just dive in and play.✔ fun for family gatherings and parties. ✔ alot of races types and cars to choose from. ✔ game has no bugs on release.✔ awesome soundtrack, of club, dubstep and dance, great for gathering and parties, mention that already :D✔ unique and fun gaming experince. what I don`t like about this game.✘ a little messy and confusing sometimes due to all players sharing one screen and one camera, you could easily lose track of you car.✘ camera always tracking is not one of the best.here is my gameplay video go get an idea of the game :D

												BlazeRush is an arcade style race-battle game designed to keep everyone in the race as much as possible.  The balance is just right to reward skill but to also allow a little luck to pop in now and then.  The game supports both single-player and mutli-player.  And it does not short change the single-player mode as it contains many maps/levels and includes a final boss battle.The controls are slick and the motion could be described as having exaggerated physics.  Note that some people in the reviews here have complained about the controls as the car moves in the direction you point your controller which is not standard in overhead race games.  It took me a few races to get used to it and then it felt quite natural.  Another popular complaint from reviewers is that when your car falls too far behind or goes off the track, the game advances your car to the end of the pack.  Some do not like this ""catch up"" feature but I find this feature keeps the race exciting.There are three race modes -- normal, leader of the pack, and out run the grinder.  Leader of the pack requires a racer to be in the front for a total of 50 seconds.  Out running the grinder is my favorite as it involves a giant grinding machine chasing the racers.  This mode will keep you on the edge of your seat as an unstoppable monster nips at your bumper.  All three race modes have random power-ups that fall onto the track such as weapons and speed boosts.  The speeds boosts though only fall to the car not in first place thus once again causing exciting lead changes in this game.Get this game if you enjoy the fun of back-and-forth battle-oriented races.  It's a little gem!			"

												Blazerush is an excellent game. It's a fast-action party racing game, mixed equally between Micromachines and Rock'n'roll racing. Did I just mention two of the most beloved fun racing games of the 90' ?You race on about 15-20 tracks using different weapons and boost to slow down your opponents. There is a single player mode, but it's not where Blazerush shines. It's by pluging 4 controllers (or up to 8 if you're playing online) than the real fun begins. There are 3 race modes : Race, King of the hill and Death race. Race is a classical, not so interesting mode. In King of the hill, as you might guess, you need to stay first a givin amount of time to win. The best mode in my opinion is Death race, where you're chased by a giant tank that will destroy you if you linger to much behind. You're forced to go forward, but being too much forward leaves you at the mercy of your opponents. There are 16 vehicles available with different statistics (Top speed is the same for everyone) : Acceleration, weight, control. You will find 5-6 different weapons et 3 types of boosts. One good point is that each enhancement is displayed on the car, which permits you to see immediatly if your opponent has a dangerous weapon without looking at the HUD.   Pros  Good controls A variety of vehicles, but quite balanced Many weapons, but no mario blue shell. Each weapon is deadly, but you can react to them.  Easy to join a game : Plug a controller, press start, your car appears immediatly. Decent netcode for online games FUN ! Cons  Not enough players online...Since we bought that game in january, we play almost every lunch break. it's a really underrated game. Play it !			"

												BlazeRush is a fast paced, chaotic. and rediculously fun racer. You can either play offline with bots or even splitscreen with up to four friends. Or play online multiplayer with 8 others around the world! This game brings back the true arcade racing experience but still feels very unique. This reminds me a lot of Rock n' Roll Racing. Where you and 3 other racers battle it out to achieve victory. There's 3 gamemodes on BlazeRush; Race, which you go around the track and fight your way to first place. King of The Hill, where the winner is the person who's stayed in first place the longest (50 seconds). And last but not least, Death Race, where you and others fight to be the last alive, while a giant combiner is behind the track destroying anyone who is in last place. The game runs very smooth. My PC specs are not relatively made for gaming, but I get no frame loss. Even when there's 8 people shooting each other with rockets in a chaotic manner. One of the cons I found is the lack of people actually playing the game online. Which is a total let down because this game will never get old when it comes to playing with friends and sharing some laughs. I just can't seem to find anyone online. I hope more people buy this game. For such a cheap price of $10. This game is definitely worth it!			"

												Get the 4 pack, and give copies to your friends.  The multiplayer is extremely fun (up to 8 players online at once!) , with regular races, king of the hill (trying to stay in the lead the longest) and death races (keep up with the group or the grinder will destroy you! )  We played while on vent, and were just laughing and yelling the entire time.  The only thing that you have to adjust to is the perspective from which you race - instead of looking at your car from behind, you get a track side view and steer based on that.  If someone falls behind it bumps them forward so the camera doesn't have to zoom out too much.    There are random buffs that drop - and literally drop - (boosts or weapons) to help you catch up or stay ahead. What's really awesome is that you can play online multiplayer, while also having multiple people playing from the same machine.  Just plug in more remotes!  And you don't even have to worry about split screen - because everyone that is racing (whether they're looking at the same screen as you or not) sees the same thing.     I have NOT tried playing with the keyboard, nor would I recommend it, as I do with all racing games.			"

												When I first saw screenshots of BlazeRush, I thought ""This looks like a fun little retro-style sci-fi racer.""Now that I've played it I think ""This is what happens when Rock'n'Roll Racing and MicroMachines get in a weird threesome with Renegade Ops!""It has a solid single player campaign,  which introduces the powerups and lets you unlock vehicles.It has really sweet graphics for an isometric racer, including a lighting engine that make night races highly entertaining.It has a good sense of style, with novel and distinct vehicle and track tile designs, but keeps weapons intuitive and easy to identify.It has endearingly wobbly physics that see guns and boosters flailing around on soft suspension - very Renegade Ops in its handling - and powerup crates get punted around the track when cars don't have free slots to collect them.It has MicroMachines-style knockout modes ...except the camera-based knockout has been replaced with a GIANT ROBOT COMBINE HARVESTER!""

												This is one of the best local multiplayer games on Steam - and it also has online play!The ""Death Race"" mode is the most fun you can have with 8 players. You can even utilize a mix of local and network players to spread out, LAN style, such as 4 PCs with 2 players each to get 8. The game always fits every player on the screen, so you know where everyone is at all times and don't lose valuable real estate to split-screen.The graphics are excellent, the physics are killer, and there's a huge variety of cars and tracks. The built in ""tournament"" mode in multiplayer matches is a great way to kill a half hour.			"

												One of the best VR (Oculus Rift) compatible games in my library. This is such a fun and simple game. The controls are really easy to learn, since you only have to steer, shoot, and use a nitro boost. The gameplay isn't exactly the most original in the world, but it takes all of your favorite tabletop racing games from the past and adds a ton of polish, solid controls, and plenty of fun modes to choose from.If you have ever played Mashed (Drive to Survive), Micro Machines, Rock n' Roll Racing, RC Pro AM, or anything similar, then you will feel right at home. Using an Oculus Rift with this is so good it gives you an advantage, since you can look around the track to see upcoming turns and threats more easily. When playing in VR, it makes you feel like you are playing with remote control cars and sitting right next to the track. VR doesn't have to be in first person, and this is an awesome example of how anything can work with it.My only gripe is the compatibility with Oculus Rift is a tad clunky to configure. You have to set the Oculus Rift to ""Extended Mode"" in your settings and set your headset as ""primary display"" in your Windows display setting. Once you do that you will be good to go. Definitely pick this up if you get a chance, this game is a blast to play online and it even supports local multiplayer.			"

No need to arrange anything.  I just wish more games had a system like this so it sustains it's own multiplay community without the need to arrange matches outside of the game. Action itself is solid but requires more than grannys old computer to run properly. I play on a older rig and lag may occur when there's lots of explosions. Achievements. Challenging tracks and opponents. Tricks to learn. Buy it if you are into the genre.			"

												Hidden gem for local multiplayer madness. Plays excellently with four Xbox 360 controllers and matches are short enough to support a ""winner stays on"" turn-taking session for larger groups. The best gamemode is an elimination-style 'death race' but it features traditional races too. Autobalancing techniques are well implemented and there's a really nice variance in handling/weight between all of the cars. Kinda like micro machines, except it ditches tank controls in favor of what I'd call (top-down) shmup controls... tank controls are still there when playing with a keyboard, if that's your thing.The game is designed for party play but unfortunately there isn't a very active online community, so be aware of this if you aren't looking for local multiplayer.

												Micro Machines V3 meets Vigilante 8.If that's a reference you don't get then...BlazeRush is a racing game with literally no brakes. At first I found the controls annoying, but the game is so well paced that it's very easy to get enthralled in trying to 100% each track. Even if you are having trouble completing this feat, retrying (with the same vehicle) is so fast that failing seldom bothered me. This effect also often left me feeling like I'd played longer than I really had.The music in this game is quite fitting. It's quality but there's not much to say besides that. If anything I'd say it's good but probably won't blow your mind.When reflecting on the story and characters there's an interesting assortment of punkish aliens that spice up the game. There's not much story besides racing until you get kicked off planets. This is good flavor text for this style of game though and it never overstays it's welcome.To me this is a clear case of the flaws of Metacritic. At the time of writing User Reviews place this at 89% and Meta places it at 66/100. This game is way better than the latter score.BlazeRush is a black hole of arcade racing fun. It will suck you in, tear you apart, and send you back in time just to play again.			"

												I am only a couple of hours into the game, but I was able to tell from the first race, that it was a really fun game. Got it in a bundle recently and I can assure you, it is worth the cash. The game is a beautiful blend between Rock'n'Roll Racing from Sega Genesis (layout, tracks & crates with powerups) + Revolt (fun factor mostly) + Mashed.I think the only two things I dislike about this game so far are the soundtrack, which is a little bit of a let down in my opinion, and the fact that the camara might get a little annoying depending on your position.

												Wow! This is like the next big thing after Excessive Speed and that wasn't yesterday :D I think I got this in a bundle and didn't pay much attention to it initially. You start the game, yeah, another miniracing with weapons, meh..whoaa it's crowded on the tracks and I cannot follow this camera handling! okay I lost, whatever.. #quit. Now that I gave it some time to let my eyes adjust to the fast paced action on the tracks, I got totally hooked! :D I like that the races are quite fast and short. It's smart how the game teaches you and introduces new elements step-by-step in the beginning, while all the way it's pretty rewarding: you can achieve many in-game badges, unlock new cars and races. You can even challenge yourself to max out all the different cups of the individual races. It just gets so rewarding to play, that you cannot just quit :D I have not finished the game or tried multiplayer yet, but with all of the above I find it tons of fun to play and expect the same feeling online. Great fun, do totally grab it once it's on sale!Update:I have played on and wow it gets challenging :D Races get harder and harder gradually, giving you a bit of a headache, once again, just like old times, a great thing if you ask me :DI have also tried multiplayer, which sadly appears to be dead though, no players left :(			"

												This game can be bought with around 1€ buying the key. Considering that this game is a real bargain! It is really fun and well constructed (one example: turbos compare only behind the leader and it makes the race a lot competitive!) also graphically. There are a lot of different weapons and they have all different usages and this can be even tactical. Every race is really entertaining and this game is replayable a lot of times specially if you have friends to play with in local co-op. The game modes are: normal race, death race (the one which i prefer)(similiar to the game mode in micromachines game for ps2) in which there is a  steamroller that follows the group and get faster and faster until it smashes up all cars and every car gets one point for each car that gets off the road or is smashed by the steamroller it will win the player that totalize 15 points, king on the hill in which it wins who can remain first for 50 seconds.       The carreer maybe isn't so much long but it is a small game for a cheap price and moreover it is a game that is made for multiplayer.. (Even if the career is playable also in local co-op).So really good game, pity that there are so few people to play it!If you want to have fun buy it!!			"

												A weird mix of polish in in-game graphics and pretty amateurish (IMHO) looking menu graphics. The mechanics and controls work pretty well- it uses the 360 controller very effectively with in a way I wasn't expecting, where you rotate the stick around the edges to point your vehicle in the direction the stick is tilted towards. A bit of over-sexualisedness to the female character in the game, but that didn't especially hamper my enjoyment of what's generally a fun weapon-equipped racing title with more to offer than you think you're going to get when you first load it up. Something about it, (maybe the controls?), made me think it might have been a mobile port when I initially started playing, but I don't think it is. Definitely worth a few quid.			"

Pure malicious glee! - 7/10Introduction:BlazeRush looks like your typical Rock'n Roll Racing, Micro Machines, Bang Bang Racing (and so on..) clone at first glance, but it shines out with its own unique gameplay. The main goal in BlazeRush is to get 1st place like in most racing games. Yet, the main focus (and the fun) of the game relies entirely on the destruction of your opponents. All players share the same camera view and the player field is forced to be in this area of view, which leads to a always dense player field with nonstop action. If you fall behind too much, then you will be always teleported to the end of the current camera view. You can reach place 1 from the last place in seconds and the other way around. This way no one can be lapped, but this could be a no-go for any serious die-hard racer. It was a good design decision in my opinion, because it allows the game to shine with its main focus and strength: the battles. And yeah, you will yell, you will curse and you will laugh like a devil.Currently there are 3 gamemodes:1.) Death Race: All players fight for their survival while being hunted by a huge steamroller. The last survivor will get the most points and the first victim the least. This will go on for several rounds, until someone has reached a fixed number of score points.2.) King of the Hill: Only the leading player will gain one point per second. Whoever gains 50 points at first will win. You will respawn, if you die.3.) Race: 3 laps, first one will win. You will respawn, if you die.Pro:very easy and simple controls [keyboard: you navigate your vehicle left and right with your arrow keys/controller: you navigate your vehicle via holding the analog stick in the desired direction (some people don't like it, but I find it even better than the keyboard navigation)]nonstop actiongreat party game16 unique vehiclesvehicles are pretty balanced, all have their pros and consthe vehicle transformations are greatgood visual effectsfitting musicright amount and variety of PowerUps, not too less and not too manyfunny achievements and ingame medalsAI isn't as good as human players, but does a great job and provides fundouble fun with friends4 player local coopyou can join online multiplayer tournaments up to 8 players with your 4 local players!online multiplayer runs smoothly in generalyou can hop in already running matches and simply replace a botvote function for the next map and gamemodetons of evil attacks, evil laughter, WTF-moments and boom boomeven a failure can be so enjoyableNeutral:the visual effects can be excessive for sensible eyesplayer colour is defined by the order of connecting people [host is always red, the second connected player is always green and so on]Contra:you can easily loose the overview from time to time in 8 player matchesonly 3 gamemodes [2 more would be appropriate for more variety]only 6 (correct me if I'm wrong) maps [3-5 more would be appropriate for more variety]steam workshop support would be a great addition to solve the kinda low variety problemConclusion:BlazeRush can be a pretty good party game, if you have friends around. It's really easy to learn and it's so much fun to wreck someone in the right moment. Victory or failure doesn't matter that much, it's enough to hear your friend yelling, when you kick him/her off the the track, to conjure a evil smile into your face. You can even take your friends into online matches to double the fun. This game could be a straight 9 or 10 out of 10, but the small map and gamemode variety harms the overall great impression a lot, because it ruins longer gaming sessions, if you have to see the same tracks again and again (it's still fun though). What a pity! Nevertheless really recommendable.7/10----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion? Feel free to make a comment. "

												Really fun, very polished and super hectic arcade racing at its finest. The main emchanics of this game rely on combat to win more than racing which give it a greater arcade appeal. The game makes sure n players fall too far behind which can be seen by sum as a detriment, while I find it to be a means of keeping the combat racing constantly hectic till you hit the finish line.On a technical note, the game is very beautiful, the physics are very funny (A bit fusrating at times but once you learn to dodge the weapon fire, its all good) and right off the bat, by PS3 controller was working without a hitch (Using DS3 tool) as well as the ability for me to play in 2560x1440 resolution from day 1 which some developers dont include (to my detriment).TLDR: Wicked fun at a fair price with mad polish and wicked arcade combat gameplay :D			"

												So Blazerush is really, really good.It's the best racing game I've ever played in my entire life. I actually enjoyed it more than Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed.Basically you are racing through all these sweet-looking places, with 3-7 other cars, while frantically collecting weapon and boost powerups and mowing down everyone in your way.1 of the key mechanics of the game, that I've never thought I would enjoy, but I actually really do, is that you are never ever truly safe in front. Boost powerups would be constantly be dropped for the trailing racers, and if you fall back too much/get destroyed, you would be automatically be teleported forward a bit after a few seconds.So this translates into such a chaotic mess of a race in which you have to gun down the guy in front and evade that heat-seeking missile with quick zig-zags and body-block the car directly behind you and nudge the car beside you into the cliffs and oh ♥♥♥♥ you just run into your own bouncing saw it's crazy.Graphics are good. Physics are good. Hell, even the AI is good, knowing precisely when and where to shoot you so that you're chucked down into the abyss as you round that corner. I actually enjoy watching AI racing against each other, which is a first in racing games for me.The single-player career mode is quite meaty, in which you are introduced to new game modes/weapons/boosts stage by stage, which I clock at about 25 hours to finish due to the trophy system. Then there's the party mode, in which you can play multiplayer locally vs human/bots, or online. Unfortunately there are too few actual players at the moment, which is a shame, since I really enjoyed the local multiplayer.Anyway, if you end up getting it, the first thing you should do is go into Options and change the Video -> Camera tracks -> Local Players only. Trust me, it's better this way.TLDR: Blazerush > Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed. Get it. "

No sickness, lots of laughs, and amazing performance. It's not often when I beg someone to take to my money, but that's what I'm doing. While this is a great Oculus game, it needs more content. More weapons, more tracks, and more strategy.

Arguably worse are the twin stick controls that on;y one player can circumvent (by using keyboard mapping and a third-party program like Xpadder) meaning no accelerate / brake button.  Moreover, there are no custom cups / grand prixs one can set up.  5/10			"

												I bought this game and played 8 hours or so of it in VR with my Oculus DK2 back when it first came out.   The dev has since removed VR support from this version. They want to players to repurchase the game from the Oculus store fo have VR support. Well screw that, and screw them.   I vote with my wallet. I have a Vive and I use Steam.  If you can't be honest or sell your games on Steam then I won't buy them			"

												Superb local multiplayer racing action here. All the cars feel unique and the items make for intense gameplay. The king of the hill and death race modes are my favorites. The skill ceiling is low so it's very easy to jump in and succeed. The only downfall is the lack of maps. You'll probably run through all of them within an hour, but it's not that big of a deal. The real joy of the gameplay will come from those you're playing with.			"

												Update:As much as it pains me to do this, I've switched my recommendation to no. This game is no longer updated on Steam as it has become an Oculus Home exclusive. If you want the latest Rocket League-like update, it's not here. The icing on the cake is the leaderboards no longer work on Steam. I'm okay with system exclusives in general, but making something exclusive AFTER the fact and stopping support is shady. I won't be supporting the BlazeRush developers going forward. Is the game still good? Unfortunately, yes.Original:Easily one of the best games I've played. If you enjoyed R.C. Pro-Am or Rock n' Roll Racing back in the day this game is for you.  The controls are very intuitive: left joystick controls direction and A and X buttons control boosters and weapons.  The A.I. is spot on. There will be times you cannot believe a computer opponent will be so brilliant and then a few minutes later be surprised at something it does that's totally stupid.  The catch-up mechanic is nicely done. In these types of games it is usually programmed so that cars in the rear simply go faster in order to catch up, but in BlazeRush speed items are dropped in the back while weapons are dropped in the front. Always guaranteed to have some mayhem. Each car handles differently. The physics, while done in an arcade manner, are great. Expect to be knocked off the track lots... use a heavier car. There is a boss race! It is not a very challenging boss race once you find the pattern of avoiding his weapons, but a nice touch that gives the game a nice closer. Not that beating the boss makes you want to stop playing. There are plenty of cups to collect. Cups could be from getting placed in a race, earning so many points during a race, or killing so many opponents during a race, etc.. There are also public leaderboards which is always nice to see how you compare against others. As of this writing I am ranked 47th. :) "

												Oh man, first Toybox Turbos in VR, then this? I'm blown away. First, I played this on a TV with my brothers, I gifted it to my brother who had brought his gaming laptop over Christmas. It was fantastic fun to walk through the single-player portion playing co-op. Sadly this mode is not available for online play, but multiplayer is basically the same thing as single when it comes to game modes and levels. This in contrast to Toybox Turbos which only has one mode in multiplayer.After the Christmas break, I've now played the game again in VR, now on my own Steam account so I do have more actual play time than reported. Right now I have the last level left in single player (so hard alone!), otherwise I've gotten through all levels with at least one cup, most with more cups. The progression is nice, you unlock new cars by getting score and new races by winning cups, which happens automatically when playing :)In multiplayer you have 3/4 of the vehicles from the start, so it works just fine to jump straight into that. The most extreme vehicles have to be unlocked by collecting score, which I did in single player... not sure if the score collected in multiplayer is actually counted towards unlocks... as I went to multiplayer first after finishing single :)So, on to the VR implementation and experience! This game performs perfectly on my 970, which it should I guess, it's a pretty new card. But I was able to run it at a full 75 Hz in VR, 2x supersampling, while recording in 60 fps. No issues. The entire game has been adapter to VR, when booting the game you are surrounded by video screens with a menu in front of you. When racing, the interface there also works very well in VR, not that I look at it very much but you have a map at the bottom and icons where expected, again I never have time to look at stuff I just turn my head and look around me if I want to get my bearings :)So, what have I found amazing in VR? The graphical fidelity is great, there are tons of particles through explosions, smoke and other effects, which looks great. The vehicles themselves has lots of detail, and it's very fun to just pause the game and look closer on the different machines. The large crusher in the death-race mode is especially interesting as you can read text on it and see walkways on top of the huge engine, just brilliant :)Fun stuff that happened, I got the camera begind the death-race crusher, and it felt like I got the thick exhaust smoke in my mouth :D Nutty! It's also pretty great when stuff fly at you, vehicles that are launched in the air and exploding into lots of tiny pieces... feels like being inside a small miniature firework show! Fantastic :DSome people has complained about the control method, which is a bit unique, you just aim in a direction and you drive there. If you've driven vehicles in Halo it's pretty much like that, just with a fixed camera. It's pretty key though as when you get shot at, your vehicle is all over the place! If you play with a keyboard you have normal steering, and I found it much harder to get going in the right direction after getting hit. Again, you might not find this intuitive, but I greatly enjoy it!Conclusion. If you like top-down racers or just fun party games, this is a title for you! If you want a great VR experience, this is that too! I would never have heard of this game, probably, unless they added VR! Lucky they did, because it's a great little game :D			"

												This was a surprise hit for me and I felt obligated to come back to Steam just to leave this review.  I have a pretty a good collection of VR titles both on Steam and on Oculus Home and I keep coming back to this one.  Ignore the playtime here as I play exclusively on Oculus Home thanks to the generosity of the developers who provided an OH key.At first blush it might appear to be a cute 3rd person racing game like Toybox Turbos but the more I play this, the more I am blown away.  It wasn't until I played the online multiplayer and then went back to single player that I realized how good the AI really is. Actually I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best AI implementations I've ever seen in a video game!The graphics are great, the VR implementation and camera works surprisingly well.  Above all the game play is surprising deep and the selection of the right vehicle for the right track and game mode is fairly important although with skill you can use different vehicles for different styes of game play.  Even this is not a complicated process and will just come to you as you progress.  Overall, especially for the price point, I would consider this a 'must have' VR title.  Now if someone * ahem cough cough * would release a first person perspective I would truly be in VR heaven !!			"

												I bought this for the Oculus Rift (DK2).Right from the get go when you load in to the main menu with the fully 3D menu, I got to glimps in to the future of VR. It was clean and ready to go.Then I played the game. And DAMN it looks incredible on the Oculus. This is now my go to game for showing VR to friends. The physics and high attention to detail on the cars, along with the viewpoint, make this a perfect for VR experience.Not to mention the game is a lot of fun and runs fantastically. You will see what I mean if you try it with the DK2, those tiny cars bouncing around, just look incredible. If I could see my hands in the game, I would be lost in another world			"

												I am usually not a big racing fan, but this game does a good job of mixing it up and is pretty fun.  Race around a small track with several opponents, get weak guns (for disorienting opponents), strong guns (for knocking your opponents back a few spots) and boosts (for getting ahead) and it's quite enjoyable.  Add in medals and challenges for difficult maneuvers, and it's addicting.  Good stuff.			"

												BlazeRush is really good.

BlazeRus is on level with those and its got a really fluid online multiplayer as well. The isometric view brings along a slight adjustment curve with the way controls work but it actually adds a layer of skill and creates some interesting opportuniteies for the leading player to be agressive. Awesome.Its fast, it looks decent and the effects are awesome. The music could be a bit better but its fitting.The single player campaign is faily decent with some achievement hunting and car unlocks.This is actually fist local mp fun pick! 90/100			"

Great little arcade racing game!  I didn't expect much going in, but what a blast and the campaign is much longer than I anticipated for a ""cheap little racing game"".  (The campaign was approx 6hrs for me, but I had to redo a number of earlier tracks to keep unlocking some new ones.  The ""Boss"" alone was quite challenging for me and took me almost 45mins on that 1 track alone!  Great time)Very polished, nice graphics, many different cars, good AI, a lot of action, and a ton of fun.  The game even has a leaderboard!  I love games that have that.Hint:  I found the view much better once I changed the ""Camera Tracks"" to ""Local Players Only"" instead of the default of ""All Players"".  (This setting is found by scrolling down on the View Settings page) ""Local Players Only"" centers the view on your car while you race.  ""All Players"" tries to show you what all cars are doing, while nice to see what's going on with the bots, but if you are at the front of the pack you get no notice of anything right in front of you as you start racing at the edge of the screen.9 out of 10.

												After having played this game for 2-3 hours, I was ready to call it near perfect. And for some, it probably still is after 20 hours, but for me it just got too darn random.I think it's very subjective - I believe the developers probably succeded in implementing exactly the game they had envisioned: Pure chaotic, explosive destruction around a racetrack. But I feel the near constant rain of random weapon drops makes luck the supreme factor in winning pretty much any race.The forgiving nature of some of the game modes where you're simply teleported forward to catch up should be replaced by more frequent nitro boost/weapon drops. Imo the leader should hardly get any drops. When I'm in the lead I've often practiced firing whatever weapon I had every time I saw a weapon drop I could reach, just so that I could grab it and prevent my opponents behind me from getting it. That's just a flawed gameplay mechanic right there.Technically the game is perfect - runs absolutely smooth, and the VR implementation with Oculus Rift DK2 is unrivaled. Awesome stuff!Tweak the gameplay to reward skill over luck somewhat, and it's a friggin' classic. (and a bargin too!)83%			"

This is a fun,exhilirating,little cart racer that looks good (particularly special effects at ""night"") with a decent variety of cars,tracks,modes,power up's and progression unlocks to keep it fresh. Single player starts off easy,but gets progressively harder,especially If you're not selecting an appropriate cart. Looking forward to firing it up next time mates are over.

Loads of levels, game modes, weapons, and cars - you never stop unlocking something new. The visuals are world class, and the animation is extremely smooth.

												An extremely fun and hectic kart-racer.  Controlling the vehicle was my biggest hurdle, though I was able to ease into it after a few matches.  In addition to different weapon/item pickups, there are three different game mode and three different track difficulty settings.  The addition of bots are nice and you can even use them to fill in a race if you don't have enough human players available.  All in all, easy to recommend.

BlazeRush could easily have been the near-perfect cartoonish racing gameif it weren't for 3 easily correctable points, only not in this life.The MehIf a racer falls too much behind in non-elimination races it's pushedforward into the fore.  This is clearly a design decision, probably works fine in MP, not so much in SP.The UglyLikely a design decision that leads to awful results.The non-adjustable camera angle is placed mid-air in the middle of the action,at what looks to me – and mind you, I am no fancy northern statistician – a weighted average point of all cars' positions.This is the major point of frustration of this game, as if you fall a bit behind – see ""Meh"" above – you will find increasingly harder to controlthe car or indeed see where the bleep you are going before you are cut out or crushed;  the same thing happens *gasp* if you are too much ahead.Fine, this race is all about the explosions and the bosons and the maiven haven,and not about the racing ahead and winning but this implementation sucks.The BadEven when your car is smack middle of the screen it's still not ideal to controlit from the side of the track, once or twice removed.I understand this is to replicate the RC feel but it just does not work well.I see Oculus Rift options in the menus... is it really wise to be so dependenton a not-yet-released-cutting-edge-freaking-expensive-device to properly controla wacky racing game?  Dev Kits?  What!?  You'll never have me Farcebook!Conclusion: highly entertaining game, potentially frustrating.Get it as part of a bundle – I did – or at a huge discount; not worth full price.			"

												Anyone that remembers Rock 'n' Roll racing from the SNES/Megadrive days is in for a treat with this. The only thing missing are car upgrades, but there's more than enough characters to choose from. Also a load of new race modes like king of the hill and my all time favourite race mode in any racing game: Death Race where racers strive to score 15 points while constantly chased by  a spiked steamroller of death. With 5 points awarded for being the last one to survive the madness that ensues trying to stay alive is just epic. King of the hill is a similarly chaos-filled adrenaline rush trying to be the first to stay in the lead for 50 seconds.Brilliant aracde-fun racer with the added bonus of 4-player local multi-player! Something sadly lost in todays race for pixel-pushing.			"

												// BlazeRush a Crazy Multiplayer Racing Games : //// Schuitje82 - Extended Review //About this game:=============This is a basic game you won't see very often these days. You compare it to the old times like Micromachines and Rock and Roll Racing.Most retro gamers know this game and understnad what i'm trying to tell.So it's a concept that is not new at all, only you not see very often these days.Core Gameplay:===============Core gameplay is to race and woop each other and try to win in most cases. Still there are some modes that gives a small twist to the game that makes this game fun for a longtime.My personal favorite still is the deathmatch battle where a big crusher comes behind you and you need to kick you friends or CPU's from the track before you get crushed by the crusher. King of the Hill is so much fun with human players offline and offline not with CPU's these are lame and sometime hard to beat so that is a little downside with this gameplay option. King of the hill will give you the longest races sometimes because you need to get a certain score to reach before you win the race.Race option is basicly race laps en try to be 1 place what I find mainly a problem with this is that you allways drive around 1st place allmost every lap and allways get shot by a rocket every f*cking time the cpu or player wins and I hate this option.Mutlyplayer:===============This is what this game makes it very cool with the 8 player multiplayer.4 player is only locally supported so keep that in mind only not a big problem.Because 4 players is well balanced and with 5 or 8 it will get crazy and hard to follow what is happening. When I write this review online service is still online and works perfectly and I have played this game many many hours with friends online.You have a lot of options what tracks you like. Short, medium and large and what game options you like to play. It is not possible to choose a specifik track this will be randomlly given to you by the game.Overall:======This is my favrotie race game of the year.It looks great, controls are working fine and it's fun to play for beginners and advances gamers.Multiplayer local is a great addon you mis this a lot in games these days.Online works good and it's fun to drive agains real people. This becuase the CPU is lame ♥♥♥ bad or cheating good in some race options.Personally I give it a 10/10 score !!!			"

												Lemme just get the VR part out of the way.  Why sell the VR edition of this to be an Oculus exlusive...No Vive support if you buy it from here.  You could buy it from the Oculus Home store, or just play it on Revive.  Chances are though, seeing how scummy both this dev and Oculus are, you may be wasting your money for when they decide to close off Revive support.  You aren't missing much though, other than Oculus exlusive updates.  The game's okay; got some unbalanced decisions here and there(single player is bat ♥♥♥♥ dumb, and you HAVE to play it if you want to unlock everything).  From my few hours in game, I feel that depending on your play style, you will find one game mode that you find more enjoyable than the others, leaving the other 2 obsolete for when you have friends over.  Which, btw you will definitely need. Online is a absolute ghost town, no surprise there.Your choice of game modes are your regular old race, a king of the hill ""stay in front"" kind of race, and then Death Race where you get stomped out for being in last.  I personally find the death race to be the most enjoyable, but they all have their own issues.  Death race has an issue with a zoomed out camera depending on how far apart last and first place are.  Also, being the first one to die causes you to wait quite a bit till the rounds over, and trust me, it will happen a lot regardless of your skill... RNG plays a lot into this game, and you will have a lot of moments where you feel completely powerless.  But whatever, its a casual kart game so its easily overlooked.  The controls are a bit odd, but if you have ever played Kirby's Air Ride on the Gamecube, it plays just like the top ride view.  You point in the direction you want to go.  Not exactly a bad thing, but some people dislike that.  Its pretty clear from the screen-shots how it works, so keep it in mind if you choose to purchase.Track designs are pathetically generic, so much so that you will never quite recognize a track when you pick it.  You could just put the game on random track selection and it wouldn't make a difference really.  I'd honestly suggest it, makes the game move faster.  The tracks are all fairly easy to drive on regardless of what racer you pick though.  The racers themselves come in 3 general types, with varying stats between them within the 3 category's.  Honestly, I feel they are well balanced.  Its 100% a matter of your play style that will decide who you prefer to go with.  But, as said before, skill has very little effect on how likely you are to win; ""balance"" doesn't matter when you can just win randomly.  All vehicles have same max speed, and people will rubber band to the player in first.  The only stats that really matter are mobility, acceleration, and grip.So what of that RNG?  Well, considering the match will usually be filled out with AI, you will deal with being targeted in the free-for-all race style.. a LOT! This is what makes the single player campaign so frustrating.  Weapon pick-ups randomly fall from the sky, and you will occasionally have item drops completely avoid you.  You could be in last place in a death race and have no boosts to save you, or be in the middle of the pack and have a weapon dropped right on top of the guy behind you.  Physics for if you do get hit can be random; you could thrown entirely off the track, or barely budge at all.  Sometimes, a clean weapon hit can even throw the guy in front of you further into the lead.  You just never know.  I do need to mention, if you pick a hovercraft, you are pretty much guaranteed to be ♥♥♥♥ed up if you are hit by anything.  The added mobility and acceleration tend to not be worth the trade off.All in all, the game isn't exactly ""bad"".  The devs are pretty scummy for making this Oculus exclusive for VR support, and future updates are even tied specifically to that version.  For this, the desktop version is pretty much complete.  I don't think you will miss anything as far as game play is concerned.  There aren't too many games of this style for Steam, and the ones competing with this are mostly unoptimized, pathetic Android ports.  For $10, you probably will not find the value paying for this.  If you are a fan of local games, definitely worth it on sale, if only for a few hours of casual shared screen multi player.  Otherwise, for what your paying for, you could always get something better.  For a more skilful kart game, Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed would be good to look into if you haven't already got it.  You won't miss much for passing this game up.6/10: Good on a sale, but your money is better spent elsewhere.  Do not buy if RNG racing pisses you off.			"

												This is my favourite game to play when I have friends over. Everyone shares the same screen instead of everyone getting a tiny quarter of the screen. The controls are very simple (joystick to move, a to use boost, b to use weapon). Graphics are pretty good. I like the soundtrack. And it is SO fun to kill your friends and knock them off the track. There's also a single player campaign but I would only recommend getting this game if you plan to play it with friends.			"

												Car controls are relative to screenspace, not relative to the car. If you have any played any racing game before or driven an actual car, you'll be familiar with the concept that steering to the left will make the car turn left. Not in this game.

												Fun, simple title. If you remember these isometric ""around the track"" racing games from older console generations, you'll probably dig this. A lot of similar aesthetics to Rock N Roll Racing. The funnest mode is the death race, where you have to outrun a massive steamroller of death. Probably funner with friends, but well-made and colorful.			"

												It's kinda pointless without multiplayerwell, trailer got me, not the cinematic but the real gameplay trailer, it looks great with those vehicles and blast. I've purchased this game about week ago, and kinda regret it.if you were expecting something like mario kart, or something similar, this isn't a game that could replace those kind of game.the multiplayer is classic peer2peer connection, there is no server(s).graphic is great, everything looks coolssound is okay I guess, I often play on mute because I prefer it.the only minus for me is control, I'm playing with keyboard and it too sensitive, I could do 360 degree turn just pressing a left/right key, it's probably better with gamepad.and the bots, they always far ahead.Playing single players campaign never really hook me into racing game (except the old NFS MW)I never really like the game that requires ""another player"" to fully enjoy the game, there are so many games like that on steam, which pretty much goes hiatus after few week of release.but of course if you were okay with single player campaign and feel good enough to beat the ""cheating"" bots, this game is for you.if you were expecting someone always ready to play this game with you, you'll dissapointed.You can try to host the game and wait someone to join yours, but it might took forever.I've played with someone once and he kick me out of his game after that even with 2 bar of quality network.

												A generic looking game with great DK2 support and not much else to offer.The GoodFirst let me say that the DK2 support of this game is quite good, better than a lot of game on the market at the time of this review and this game is comfortable and easy to play with the headset on.The BadThe controls are far too simplistic, it feels like playing a port of a mobile game. It's no challenge to get around the track at all, no throttle and braking just push the stick in the direction you want to travel.The graphics while appearing “slick” are boring and uninspired, the art direction of this game has no soul and is just a mashup of hoary old tropes. Final thoughts.Go buy ToyBox Turbos instead, it has just as good DK2 support (if not better) has vastly better controls and maps. It's also has an other thing that what BlazeRush game is lacking... a sense of fun.			"

												Video is very poor! I would like to play a version with less video bugs, as the gameplay seems fun. But the video bugs and glitches makes it unplayable for me and my friends. This game gets some very positive reviews. If i'm the only one dealing with it must not be the game, right. However, my pc is more that 4 times better than the recomended specitifications. most of the time the game starts fine, but once we start using items the video glitches as if it should be viewed with 3D glasses. on the Lava map the video glitches the entire time. I have tried low, meduim and high video settings but no changes occour. My best assumption is the game is poorly made.Overall the game is something my friends and I would love to play. But the vidoe is so bad it is not worth it. I hope the gmae devolupers can release a big enough patch to render this game playable. Although I have read several negative comments on the devolpers reaction on the VR versions of the game, I don't think they care about anything past the sale of purchase.			"

												Pros:✓ Fun, fun, fun!✓ Challenging gameplay. This game actually takes a fair amount of skill.✓ Extremely well-polished graphics. The art style is somewhere between Awesomenauts and 1950's comix.✓ Physics are just cartoony enough to add to the fun, but realistic enough that it doesn't feel like the game is cheating.Linux Pros:✓ Excellent controller support. Looking forward to seeing this coming to Steam Machines.✓ Well-adapted to Linux. Didn't have to do anything special to get this to run ""out of the box.""✓ Didn't experience any performance issues under Linux, not that this game is overly graphics-intensive.Other Pros:✓ Kid-friendly (mileage may vary online)This isn't your typical racing game. It's really only a racing game on the surface; most of the gameplay is centered around pushing your opponents off the track with machine guns, flying saw blades, and explosives. Watching your opponent who was in first place blow up and get pushed to dead last is an immensely satisfying experience.[More to come]			"

												If you've got the people this is an amazing multiplayer experience. BlazeRush is a top-down racer with a few different game modes and plenty of pickups to fire at your opponents. There's a singleplayer campaign as well but you'll be finding most of your fun with the multiplayer options. All the racers share the same screen so you get pulled ahead (or destroyed) for falling behind. There's a standard lap race mode, a mode where the person in first the longest wins, and Death Race. The last mode is by far most fun I've had with this game. A giant machine chases all the racers around the track until everyone is eliminated. The person that survives longest nets the most points, and it starts right back up again until you reach a set number. This leads to plenty of hilarious moments as players struggle to stay far ahead with boosters or sabotage the competition with firepower. I'd say it's a definite buy. Online multiplayer's dead though so grab this with 2 or 3 friends.			"

												Good game. The graphics are very good. I do wish the steering was different. You have to hold the jostick in the direction you want to go. So forward you hold it up and then right and left to steer. Kind of confusing and I thought the game was broken at first. Why cant you just steer right and left and not have to hold up? Thats strange.That being said I do enjoy the game. The price is also very nice. Although to be truthful I bought this in a bundle and did not pay the $10 dollar price. The nighttime racing is my least favorite. Just seems like the CPU has the edge in knowing where every powerup is and player is left fumbeling in the dark track. I do give the game designer credit. The game is fun and easy to play once you figure out the steering and they have a lot of different race events. I have not tried multiplayer.Just one more thing if your playing by yourself do yourself a favor and switch the camera view to local players only. That way the camera wont pan out so far back your car looks like an ant. Its under graphics and then  misc.			"

												Top-down racing game, like RC Pro AM or Mashed, with some interesting powerups, nice graphics, challenging gameplay and... bland tracks. There are 2 sides to this game:1. If you want to play alone, the career mode is too frustrating, the races are too random, and it's just a mess when you can do everything properly but your rivals will always sit on your tail (being teleported closer or having boost dropped at them for sitting behind you) and you can be sure that they'll destroy you on the last corner - winning a race is based on pure luck.2. If you're playing it as a local multiplayer party game it's AWESOME. There's always challenge, you don't have one guy winning everything because the game tried to level the playing field and it's a lot of swearing and laughing. It's worth it ONLY if you have someone to play with.			"

												Oculus tomfoolery aside, this game is a 10/10. It reminds me a lot of Mario Kart, Rock n' Roll Racing, Micro Machines, etc. There's an auto-boost mechanic on some tracks which ensures that no player is ever too far behind (think Lakitu), and the physics system and general balancing of the game makes it tough not to have fun even if you're losing. The controls, graphics, and music are all good. There's a nice variety of vehicles which all seem to have unique driving characteristics, yet most of them seem to be on par with one another once you learn to drive them. The game is simple, but there's enough content and the right balance of mechanics to keep it fresh and exciting each time I play. Although I received BlazeRush as part of a Humble Bundle, it's definitely worth full price and more. It's hard to find good local multiplayer games nowadays, but this one was an instant classic for me.			"

												Ok....I got this with a bundle. I could not care less about the game, honestly, I got the bundle for a totally different game. But well, the screenshots of the game were cute, and also I had read that it worked perfectly with the Oculus Rift.....OK, not only it perfectly works with the Oculus rift, not only it is that kind of game that perfectly goes together with VR (it is like you are a big brother spectator of the race).....the game is actually FUN. It is obviously a very simple game, but also challenging, if you are interested in getting all the medals. I am sure the multiplayer will be even more challenging. It is some sort of Motorstorm RC (from PS vita) but more simple and with less details in the scenery. Totally recommend it as a 'casual' game for when you are 'too tired' to play something more serious. And if you have an oculus rift, this is a must buy.			"

												This is the MOST annoying game I have EVER played. Your driving skills does not matter. At all. It's all up to luck, especially when the camera doesn't show the track in front of you so you have to pretty much guess what will be next (unless you know the track by heart).You'll get even more annoyed when you are in the lead and got shot by undodgeable ammo and then boom, back to last standing. Hell, you can't even be in the lead for long, cause there are tons of nitros on the map so the bots will easily takeover.How more annoying it could get?Oh, wait, I thought the game had DK2 support. It does, but only for Windows users. Wow.I've played it 2.5h so far and I won't be playing anymore - I want to play video games to relax, not to be annoyed when after being in the lead for the whole race you get shot and out of the track. I wish I could get a refund.			"

Just totally unplayable.Buy only if you intend to use with the keyboard ( perhaps you could make the Steam Controller work ? ) Then purchase it. other than that the game itself is ok, a small bit of fun perhaps a few hours. The performance is exellent and the graphical effects are suprisingly nice.tested on Linux.its a shame there isnt a low / medium / high recommendation ... im torn.  if you snag it on a very, very low price like i did,  its a few hours  of fun and worth it.

												BlazeRush...That moment where you realize if done right, pretty much ANY game will fit nicely in Virtual Reality! I mean... did the game have to be SO damn good in the Oculus Rift?! Seriously, this is one excellent adaptation, and while it's one of the most unique VR experinces out there it's also a pretty good game if you play it the good old way as well!As for the VR aspect - other devs take note: BlazeRush is solid evidence that you should never ask ""Should we fit VR into our game?"", rather you should ask ""How do we fit VR into our game?""Oculus Rift DK2 gameplay video: http://www.interleave-vr.com/files/youtube-anti-html5video-viewer.php?v=va9mYXsOYy8 (Stereo 3D recording)			"

												A fun and fast racing game. Like an isometric version of Death Rally, but much better. Weapons are great fun, achievements are very well done, and the push to have just one more go is very strong indeed. I've had more frantic fun with BlazeRush than with just about any other game I've played in years.BlazeRush is a great singleplayer racing game. I've tried to get the online multiplayer working, but even a little bit of lag kills it, and with so few people playing, unless you have friends to play with the chances are you won't find a game going anyway.If you are prone to rage, beware!Definitely recommended, especially if you can find it on sale and you have low-ping friends to play it with.

												At first, this is a fun game, with good controls and great graphics. And it works flawlessly on Mac and Linux.But as you progress, you progressively realise there are issues: the camera, the catch-up mechanism, and the difficulty to see you car in all the mess that is going on. Then you are introduced to a « lawn-mower » that destroys the last car in the race: this is not fun, especially when you can only stare at the game until all cars have been destroyed.It’s a good variation around the Mario-Kart concept, but it’s flawed, and short lived. Buy it only on sale and do not expect it will entertain you for long.			"

												The game is made stupidly difficult and thus totally not funny by messing up the controls using a controlpad: You need to aim in the direction the car is heading on screen: forward means ""towards top of screen"", right means ""to the right of screen"" etc and not relative to the car itself. If there was a way to change that, the game would be awesome. With controls like this its money wasted.			"

												The trailer looks good but the game is not so good once you start playing.1. The camera keeps zooming in and out depending on where YOU are.  It keep trying to keep the entire group of racers in view so if they are far apart between 1st place and 8th place, the camera zooms out, and it's hard to see at that point, especially if you are #8.2. Since the game wants to keep all 8 cars in view, and can only zoom out so much, it has this mechanic in which it bubble warp your car up if it falls too much behind.  This reminds me of a very old racing game called Motoroader back on the TurboGrafx 16, except the mechanic works there as there is no zooming in and out randomly on the screen.  And sometimes if you are turning a corner when it happen it just bounce you off the track all together.3. The controls on the keyboard and on the game pad is totally different.Keyboard - you use left and right to turn the car like most racing gameGamepad - your car Go towards the Direction you are Pointing to, which I don't like at all.  Wish there is a way to make it more like the keyboard controls.4. Can't remap the controls5. Power pickups gets knocked away if you already have one picked up and unused.  Which is great for the cars up front but horrible for the cars in the back.  it's hard enough to pickup anything when there is nothing since the cars infront of you grabbed them from you, but even if they can't use it, they still pushes them out of the way so you can't keep up in the same lines as them and hope to pick up the items.  Maybe make it so the cars that can't pick up anything just runs thru the power-ups instead of hitting them and knocking them away. "

												If this game were $3 dollars I would consider it a fair buy. Right now, I feel like I rewarded someone for being lazy.In quantifiable gameplay there is very little. The way that the ""racing"" is treated completely misses the defintion of racing at all; mostly the results come down to a luck and it is impossible to fall behind really. The entire game is rigged towards ""fairness"". The mechanics constantly and incessantly interfere with your ability to drive. The developers have mistaken annoyance for viable gameplay, this wont hold anyone's attention for long. There are much better and cheaper examples of this kind of game.I saw the word ""accessable"" touted around in the marketing materials for this game. The truth is that there is extremely little to this game and what there is is overly simple and unapologetically repetitive. Sure it has that ""can't stop playing"" vibe... for about an hour, then the gameply becomes mindnumbing and you realize that you're executing the exact same meaningless actions over and over again and no matter how prettily it's been dressed up they cant hide how quickly this piece of fluff loses it's appeal.  It is offensively mediocre and feels like a made for profit game.			"

												My favorite local coop game on Steam by a wide margin. Plug my HDMI in to put it on my TV, get a couple controllers, and this game is enthralling. It's also pretty forgiving in the standard race game mode; if you're off screen for any reason, you get teleported back on with a little leeway. That said, that handicap isn't enough to keep someone who's simply much better from kicking your butt every race, which is what you would hope happens in a racing game.My listed playtime also doesn't reflect the most substantial part of my gameplay, which was when the internet died.

												What can i say.. if you loved games like Rock'n Roll Racing, you'll definitely love this one.BlazeRush shines for it's simple and yet amazing gameplay. Solid controls, good graphics, fun game modes, local and online multiplayer, up to 4 and 8 players respectively. Everything is in it.I've never had such a blast playing a racing game as i've had with this one.PROS:• Polished gameplay;• Graphics are good;• Career mode is simple, but addictive; (and has support to local ""coop"");• Good selection of cars, tracks and powerups;• Amazing soundtrack.CONS:• Saddly, online community seems dead. But you can always grab a 2 or 4 pack and play with your friends.PERSONAL SCORE:• 10/10.Totally recommended!			"

												I got this game last night because it looked amazing in the pics and videos.  It's visually just gorgeous!  It's honestly probably THE best looking game I've ever played, and I've played many.  It's a lot of fun racing and challenging as well.  I keep saying ""just one more race"" and want to keep on playing and playing.  I hope the developers make more like it.  Great job!			"

												Really good fun multiplayer game.  I had my boy's football team over and they had 6 players at once.  All game modes (deathmatch, race and king of the hill) are great.  Only downside is that the servers are dead.  Only recommend this game is you are playing with friends.  The single player career mode is good but multiplayer is where the fun is at with this game.

												This is a fantastic arcadey racer from Targem.  With a great, fun single player campaign, to an addictive multiplayer experience, this game is sure to please anyone who might give it a chance.  All racers have their own way of handling, and you'll quickly learn what types of cars you like to race in the most.  The single player campaign should keep you busy for hours alone.  This is a game that is also great for some couch gaming with friends (expect lots of shouting) or playing with online buddies (expect lots of shouting.)			"

												Was sceptical when I saw this as wasn't sure how effective a top down looking game would be like via the DK2. Most experiences worked best on the DK2 in first person view.Well, im happy to say its fabulous. Its like sitting in the middle of a scalectix set watching the cars drive around you. The camera view is perfect for most of the time. (Just a few moment when the crusher drives through your head. And the odd moment when you cant view your car ahead) However the game play is very addictive and the car models are nicely detailed.One of the few games in VR where I can spend a significant amount of time being comfortable and having fun without any sort of Rift Sickness pending.Great work.

												I was skeptical going in that this would be worth playing with the oculus dk2, I had played alien isolation completely through with he dk2 (minus 1 10 min part that caused vr sickness) and had spent numerous hours flying around in elite dangerous with the dk2 thinking until now that cockpit sims were the only real games worth it in vr. Boy was I wrong, this game is fantastic with the dk2. The 3d effect is awesome and head tracking actually works great for quickly looking to see where the other cars are or to keep track on the dozer in 1 game mode.Hopefully we see more games with vr support this well done. It doesn't support direct to rift but it doesn't really matter because they have the option to mirror to the other display. Setting it up was a breeze, turn rift on set it to extended. Load game goto video options and just turn on enable rift mode, apply and away you go. It gets better though under that option is mirror to desktop and then the option to supersample up to 2 times, that increases the rendering resolution and improves the image quality.Get this if you have a rift simple as that. I'm excited to see other isometric style games in vr after this.			"

												As plenty of people have already said, this game takes its cues from Rock N Roll Racing - but wait! - it's also imbued with the giddy spirit of Ivan ""Ironman"" Stewart's Super Off-Road, Badlands and Super Sprint. Barring the time trials which really could do with a ghost car, each mode is a frantic scramble, and while the catch-up system means that the race is rarely sewn up (or lost) before the final bend, it just serves to encourage aggressive driving and never feels unfair.Ploughing through the unlockable cars and levels is relatively straight forward, but with all the kills/points challenges, even getting close to 100% completion will take some doing.

												Blaze Rush is a Micro-Machines style top down combat racer, with strong game play, and excellent visuals. Weapons and boosts appear as ""drops,"" that get kicked around the map, letting players tactically deny options to each other. The campaign has diverse challenges, and should entertain for several hours.The Oculus Ridft support is frankly AMAZING. The camera moves in a natural way to follow the action, and allows the player to move their head to get a better view of what's coming. The cars and course are rendered in beautiful 3D, and the sense of scale perfectly conveys the ""hotwheels"" feel that the developers were going for.			"

												If Borderlands had a GILF fetish and had a baby with the old Micromachines games from the early-mid 90s, this would be the result.Very fun and simple racing game, with decent graphics, a kicking soundtrack that I can only describe as mixed techno/dubstep [probably the best part imo], a fun assortment of weapons and vehicles/characters to choose from that once all are unlocked create a great deal of chaos in the later levels, and some interesting tracks set on a few different fictional worlds. Its a fun mindless game [as with most racing games, dont expect much from the story] right up until the last level of the campaign.I only really had 2 issues with the game. One was that in some game modes, the game will port racers who are lagging behind, back into a closer position to the others. This was annoying as it felt very hand-holdy and quiet often it would port me straight over some pickups that otherwise would have won me a race or two. The other issue, was the final boss. At the end, the 'corporation' from the back-plot sends its 'president' to deal with you. he comes in a spaceship that looks like it was made by mercedes-bens, but armed by the military. He is almost impossible to beat - while most levels took only a few minutes to beat and were the kind of challenge that felt good to redo a few times until you beat it, I had to keep on reloading this mission tirelessly for the better part of an hour. [I'm not exactly one to give up easily, but I swear by the end of it I felt like throwing my controller across the room. XD] He has alot of health that you have to slowly widdle down, and if he knocks you off the track - which is extremely easy for him with his massive assortment of weapons that he spams you with - you loose immediatly. This might have been less of an issue if they gave you a couple of lives to beat him with, but you loose once and its game over. It was, for me, quiet frustrating, and didnt feel at all rewarding when I finally beat the game.All in all, its a super fun simple racer, probably better to play with friends then to play the campaign, really. I personally bought it through a BundleStars bundle, and dont feel its worth the full price on steam. But if you see it in a bundle or on sale, somewhere, I would highly recommend it for a night of pointless chaos.			"

The car physics are really cool and its very simple and easy to pick up. Tried it on my monitor first, with xbox360 controller, and I was having fun. Then switched on Rift mode, and it blew me away.

												This is surprisingly fantastic on the Oculus Rift. Along with TimeRifters, these are the most impressive DK2 implementations on Steam right now. BlazeRush is so well optimized, I'm running 4K downsampling and 16xAA on a 770gtx! Level of detail and clarity are better than anything I've yet seen on the DK2, and performance is silky smooth. Particle effects are incredible in VR. Not to mention a surprisingly fun game that I would have never considered playing on a screen. This is a must-buy if you own a DK2.			"

												Was sceptical when I saw this as wasn't sure how effective a top down looking game would be like via the DK2. Most experiences worked best on the DK2 in first person view.Well, im happy to say its fabulous. Its like sitting in the middle of a scalectix set watching the cars drive around you. The camera view is perfect for most of the time. (Just a few moment when the crusher drives through your head. And the odd moment when you cant view your car ahead) However the game play is very addictive and the car models are nicely detailed.One of the few games in VR where I can spend a significant amount of time being comfortable and having fun without any sort of Rift Sickness pending.Great work.

												If you have an Oculus Rift DK2, don't hesitate: buy this game.The VR integration is smooth as butter: although it doesn't support direct mode yet, extended mode is detected automatically -- and if it isn't? The 'Home' key turns it on and recenters after it's on. On the gameplay side of things: playing this in VR really makes you feel like you're controlling some combat RC cars.

												Bought this game as it seemed to be the only half-decent racing game for SteamOS, plus it had baked in VR support... I'm so impressed!The VR support is superb, right from the get-go, it's dynamic and immersive. A few times I found myself flying through an over-track sign, but I suspect I was probably too close to the head tracking unit - you want to be sat back about 6ft with this for best effect! (Controller recommended therefore!) Having the ability to chose where you look on the track is an amazing benefit (and experience!), as when playing in non-VR, you sometimes find your FOV a bit limiting when you're leading the pack. Being able to sit forward a bit or look around other cars for the best view of your own car and/or the track is just bonkers. Not to mention the machine gun fire and rockets flying around :DEven in non-VR on a SteamOS (Read: Ubuntu with Steam on it) machine it runs flawlessly - A lowly Intel Pentium G620 and an AMD R7 250 (1GB) is more than sufficient to play this at decent frame rates at 1080p - which looks beautiful on my TV!Great job Devs!

												Normally i am not really interested in games like this. For me these games are meant to play at a Lan-Party or locally with drunk/high friends.  But... i bought it because of the Oculus Rift support. And the feeling is amazing! Its like you are playing with little Hot-Wheels or RC-Cars. You're hanging in the air just above the track. The cars have a size of... 4 to 5 cm. And every time the big shredder-car passes your vision you hold your breath because of the thick black smoke that comes out of its exhaust-pipes.If you have an OR you want to check it out for the feeling alone!Apart from that, the game is cool. Nothing really special and i did not expect anything extraordinary.The interface and everything is solid. No complaints there.It seems there are only 3 or 4 different graphic-sets for the tracks. Which is simply not enough. At least they could add more texture variations for the tracks. Just a bit more stuff, different looks. "

												My favorite local coop game on Steam by a wide margin. Plug my HDMI in to put it on my TV, get a couple controllers, and this game is enthralling. It's also pretty forgiving in the standard race game mode; if you're off screen for any reason, you get teleported back on with a little leeway. That said, that handicap isn't enough to keep someone who's simply much better from kicking your butt every race, which is what you would hope happens in a racing game.My listed playtime also doesn't reflect the most substantial part of my gameplay, which was when the internet died.

												What can I say? BlazeRush is amazing when using the Oculus Rift DK2, the whole game plays just a few feet in front of you. You can lean in closer to take a look at the cars, which are very detailed. BlazeRush is a fun packed game and is the longest time I've spent in the Rift, it plays very smooth at a constant 75 FPS and is effortless to get working on the DK2.If you own a DK2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game, this game is a benchmark for future VR titles.Well done to the developers, I'll look forward to thier VR games in the future!

												Multiplayer works. Statistic servers are gone, so you'll get an error every race telling you there is a server error. Don't worry about it. I would recommend playing this with friends, but be warned that the game itself will get old after 2-3 hours of play, so I can only recommend it on sale.This game is a modern RC PRO AM. Isometric racer with power ups and most races rely on getting lucky with speed boosts to win.Most of the stats are meaningless. Acceleration determines how quickly you top out in speed, and all cars have the same maximum speed. Mass determines how much weapons affect you and what happens when a boosted car rams into a player. Handling is how well once can turn though I found it odd that a land car with low speed was nearly impossible to steer while a hover car with even lower handling than the land car drove almost perfectly.The campaign has several varieties for missions, most of them being custom races to help the player learn how to play. The problem with the campaign is the game forces the player to engage with the worst game mode in Blaze Rush: Normal Race. Yes, just racing blows because the game has a catchup mechanic that teleports racers lagging behind so they can always get lucky and pick up a speed boost to instantly win the race on the last lap. 100% crap shoot.However, where the game shines is King Of The Hill and Grinder. Grinder is a simple and fast paced game mode where a giant machine charges at the racer and instnatly kills them on contact. The goal is to use weapons and speed boosts to either kill the other players outright, slow them down to get crushed, or outlast them after the Grinder picks up speed to take out stragglers. King Of The Hill is another game mode like Standard Race, but instead of having to drive for 3 minutes while being in 1st and hoping the teleported opponents get lucky in driving, the game ends once a player stays in 1st for 50 seconds. I like it since it requires constant use of weapons and speed boost due to players being unable to coast until the last lap and get the win.Overall: Short game longevity with a lackluster single player campaign, but with two really fun game modes and a lot of choice in customizing party play when playing online in a party. Would recommend if on sale due to replay value.			"

Having the ability to chose where you look on the track is an amazing benefit (and experience!), as when playing in non-VR, you sometimes find your FOV a bit limiting when you're leading the pack. Being able to sit forward a bit or look around other cars for the best view of your own car and/or the track is just bonkers. Not to mention the machine gun fire and rockets flying around :DEven in non-VR on a SteamOS (Read: Ubuntu with Steam on it) machine it runs flawlessly - A lowly Intel Pentium G620 and an AMD R7 250 (1GB) is more than sufficient to play this at decent frame rates at 1080p - which looks beautiful on my TV!Great job Devs!

												You race a bunch of wibbly vehicles across alien worlds. It's like a mix of the modes of micro machines, pick ups of mario kart and physics of re-volt had a baby obsessed with Sci-fi. I got this as part of one of the bundlestars bundles and thought eh that might be fun. Holy ♥♥♥♥ i didn't know what glory i had found. This game has incledibly solid controls and handling (assuming your using a controller). all the weapons feel quite fun. The graphics look vibrant and crisp. lots of awards for diffent types of kills of events. like if you fire the homing rocket straight up at the sky because of a ramp or being under fire then you get the sputnik award. all rather amusing and add to your points. This is easily worth the asking price with or without friends to play it with. it does support local and online multiplayer and you can even have local multiplayer mixed with online.			"

												Blaze Rush is a Micro-Machines style top down combat racer, with strong game play, and excellent visuals. Weapons and boosts appear as ""drops,"" that get kicked around the map, letting players tactically deny options to each other. The campaign has diverse challenges, and should entertain for several hours.The Oculus Ridft support is frankly AMAZING. The camera moves in a natural way to follow the action, and allows the player to move their head to get a better view of what's coming. The cars and course are rendered in beautiful 3D, and the sense of scale perfectly conveys the ""hotwheels"" feel that the developers were going for.			"

												What is BlazeRush?Genre: fun racing game with weapon pickupsSetting: racing league on different planets until taken away by a corporation --> defeat the bossDifficulty: 6/10 --> AI gets tougher in endgame, lots of luck-based racesLength: 5-15 hours for a single playthrough (depending on luck)Mode: singleplayer campaign, multiplayer Similar games: Death Rallye (which is from a top-down perspective)The positive aspects:- Different cars with different abilities (acceleration, resilience) and looks- enjoyable racing modes (normal race, time trial, last man racing/ escaping a roller, boss races)- quite entertaining multiplayer- winning a race is possible until the end --> you can't fall back much, off-screen cars are teleported back into the screen- game runs perfectly smooth, no crashingThe negative aspects:- only five weapons (Gatling, rockets, slime, sawblade, sonic waves)- weak weapon impact on AI drivers, especially in late game- driving and aiming skill is not rewarded - you can't be far in advance or fall way behind, the game will always teleport those ""fallen ones"" back into the screen area- over-sensitive controls (depends on chosen car)- the camera perspective (isomorphic-like). You can't change it, you get used to it, it sets the tone of the game, but it also makes you go crazy. As being in lead, you sometimes can't see where you have to go, blindly maneuvering around with only little help of a HUD road map. This leads to numerous annoying situations, making the otherwise solid campaign unnecessarily hard and your result depending on luck too often.Result (and summary for those who have no time reading):It's hard what to think of BlazeRush. It is basically a good fun racing game unless you're talking about the camera perspective. being ok in multiplayer for a short game of party racing, the singleplayer campaign becomes a real pain. If you like being rewarded for driving and aiming skill, hands off. If you're looking for a little, competitive fun racer, give it a try.			"

												Multiplayer works. Statistic servers are gone, so you'll get an error every race telling you there is a server error. Don't worry about it. I would recommend playing this with friends, but be warned that the game itself will get old after 2-3 hours of play, so I can only recommend it on sale.This game is a modern RC PRO AM. Isometric racer with power ups and most races rely on getting lucky with speed boosts to win.Most of the stats are meaningless. Acceleration determines how quickly you top out in speed, and all cars have the same maximum speed. Mass determines how much weapons affect you and what happens when a boosted car rams into a player. Handling is how well once can turn though I found it odd that a land car with low speed was nearly impossible to steer while a hover car with even lower handling than the land car drove almost perfectly.The campaign has several varieties for missions, most of them being custom races to help the player learn how to play. The problem with the campaign is the game forces the player to engage with the worst game mode in Blaze Rush: Normal Race. Yes, just racing blows because the game has a catchup mechanic that teleports racers lagging behind so they can always get lucky and pick up a speed boost to instantly win the race on the last lap. 100% crap shoot.However, where the game shines is King Of The Hill and Grinder. Grinder is a simple and fast paced game mode where a giant machine charges at the racer and instnatly kills them on contact. The goal is to use weapons and speed boosts to either kill the other players outright, slow them down to get crushed, or outlast them after the Grinder picks up speed to take out stragglers. King Of The Hill is another game mode like Standard Race, but instead of having to drive for 3 minutes while being in 1st and hoping the teleported opponents get lucky in driving, the game ends once a player stays in 1st for 50 seconds. I like it since it requires constant use of weapons and speed boost due to players being unable to coast until the last lap and get the win.Overall: Short game longevity with a lackluster single player campaign, but with two really fun game modes and a lot of choice in customizing party play when playing online in a party. Would recommend if on sale due to replay value.			"

												Its a riot!  Lots of flames, explosions, cars rolling over and spinning all over the place while you race.  Combine that with colourful, detailed graphics and a bunch of awards for outrageous manoeuvres like being hit with your missile after propelling yourself forward with a rocket and you have a very fun game.   There are numerous vehicles which have various driving performances and a nice set of relatively short tracks. Its quick to load and the interface is snappy.  I do have some intermittent control issues. 7/10			"

												As plenty of people have already said, this game takes its cues from Rock N Roll Racing - but wait! - it's also imbued with the giddy spirit of Ivan ""Ironman"" Stewart's Super Off-Road, Badlands and Super Sprint. Barring the time trials which really could do with a ghost car, each mode is a frantic scramble, and while the catch-up system means that the race is rarely sewn up (or lost) before the final bend, it just serves to encourage aggressive driving and never feels unfair.Ploughing through the unlockable cars and levels is relatively straight forward, but with all the kills/points challenges, even getting close to 100% completion will take some doing.

												It's weird, I bought this game because I have an Oculus Rift DK2 and others said this game was good. I couldn't imagine that the VR would make much of a difference to a game like this since it's 3rd person, but this game is SO MUCH FUN! I must have spent 5 hours playing this game over the last weekend, just against AI drivers. A lot of modern games lack that, ""just one more go"" feeling and this one has it in spades... highly recommended.

												Super awesome mini car game with different nitros and weapons. Great racing tracks ( which you may fall off from ) and multiple cups to get in each level, not just simply finish first, sometimes you have to destroy 4 other opponents, or be first for 50 seconds, or time trials. Multiplayer seems dead but the single player is enough to make this game 10/10 worth it!!			"

												Blazerush is a top down, isometric racer, very similar to games like Rock n' Roll racing. It's got fairly solid gameplay for its type, about 4 different racing modes. Definitely feels like a micro machines game, in a really good way. Like any kart racer, the game can be chaotic, and when it doesn't go your way, it can be very frustrating. When it does go your way, you feel awesome pulling out of the explosions unscathed. The game has a good balance of this and a skillful player can get through most challenges, though sometimes it can feel as if your opponents are snatching all the powerups.The strength of this game is the death tractor races, which periodically eliminate the racer in last over several rounds. You can have a lot of fun boosting just out of the tractor's reach, and timing your shots perfectly to put an opponent behind you for the one moment the tractor appears. However, the other game modes were not fun for me. In one game mode, you must be the leader for 50 seconds. Seems fair, right? But for some reason, in this mode, it always seems like one AI is a lot harder than the others, and pulls ahead quickly. Then you can never reach him because your stuck behind the other ones who all seem out to stop you from winning. The only way to win this mode is to get ahead immediately and dodge all their shots. All in all, its a fun, short, kart racing game. If you're interested, this game will deliver for you.			"

												Really fun fun fun! I got this on the last sale intending to play it on Oculus Rift. I have not tried it in the Rift yet. On the surface it seems like a scaled up mobile game, but after playing it for a while I found that this was really a full fledged osimetric view racing game. I didn't like the 'point a stick in the direction you want to go' controls at first but grew to really like it. This way of control works perfectly especially when things get really nuts and I have trouble seeing my little car. I'm using the XBOX ONE wireless controller & dongle. The artwork feels a little generic but it's original and adds a nice touch to the game. It kind of reminds me of R.C. Pro Am in all the best ways. Also I like that the engine scaled up fine to my ultrawide 3440x1440 monitor just fine. I say engine because the menu's were streched. It doesn't effect the gameplay really but a little love to us ultrawide gamers would be cool. As I progressed through the races I found myself smiling, yelling, laughing, and retrying with a bug dumb grin. It's just ton's of fun. This game also seems to have very low system requirements. I was running MSI After Burner and my Radeon R9 390 generally sat around 350 to 420Mhz with the FPS locked to 60 and VSYNC on. I also had AA turned off. I never play with AA. Also while I have only played single player, I think this would be an insane party game. Makes me want to go get some more XBOX ONE controllers.One thing I forgot to cover was the huge variety in cars, and weapons. They are creative and fun. The game is just very well thought out and a total blast. Snag it! Even if it's not on sale.			"

												This game is a really underrated gem! You should definitely buy it if you have friends to play with.It has everything you can ask for in a battle racing game:- a lot of different unlockable cars (with really different weapon resistance - aka mass, acceleration and handleability)- a lot of carrier missions (that you can play also with some friends locally)- a lot of weapons (rocket, minigun, saw and soundwave to push opponents out of the track, slime to slow them down)- three great multiplayer modes (3 laps race, be the leader for 50 seconds and the best one, Death Race, with a giant rolling cogwheel smashing the slower cars)I think this game lacks just a few weapons (e.g. oil and/or mines) and modes (e.g. bowl/arena)Highly recommended!

												Got the game last night in a BundleStars bundle.  I primarily bought the bundle for this game.  I didn't have a lot of time to play last night but it's pretty fun.  I can't comment on the multiplayer as I didn't try it but I'm not going to be surprised if the population is dead.  I also can't comment on the VR snafu that I read about.  It has a decent amount of single player content from what I've played so far.  I have a controller but it wasn't hooked up so I played with the keyboard and it took me maybe 5mins at most to get the hang of it.  Granted when the rocket packs got introduced things got a bit crazy but it was also entertaining.Looks goodPlays decent on keyboard, I'm sure it's better with a controllerWith friends it'd probably be fantastic but alone it was still pretty fun and I was laughing out loud several times during my playtime.  The AI does act a little odd at times.The only thing I wish it had was a better soundtrack (e.g. Rock 'N' Roll Racing).Other than that, fun game, definitely worth the price of the bundle.			"
