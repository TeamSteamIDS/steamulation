Early Access Review
								This isn't Early Access to get ""community feedback"", at best it's a way too early pre-alpha build that was released by accident. More likely it is another ""give us all your money""-game that will never see proper development. Every promise this game has given is a joke, it might get close to some of the promises at some point, but probably not. Do you want a open world MMO with a player controlled open world, you probably already know about Identity. This is to Identity what Burstfire is to Rainbow Six: Siege - just way too rushed out and not at all close to feeling playable.			"

Early Access Review
								Currently, this game is a mess. It's way too 'early'.It's a shame, I really wanted to like this and I was really looking forward to it. Hopefully the game does get better and I'll take another look when the game leaves early access but currently the game is just an empty world with really rough gameplay and controls.There's not much in the game right now and the load times are ridiculous. I was also forced to install the game to my C drive which is a problem because I've got a really big D and I wanted to put it there.

			This is supposedly a Beta build. I doubt it's even an Alpha build, it's pretty god damn awful, which Is a shame, I really wanted to like this. Back to GTA:O I guess.

								Its almost as if half the studio wanted a Soccer Game, and the other half wanted an Open World GTA Clone, and they couldn't decide, so just went with both, and completely ♥♥♥♥ed it up.This isn't even in an Alpha state, and these guys want the game done and ported to consoles by Christmas 2016..This is IMO a cash grab, and a terrible one at that. I can't give a pro/con, because it is just too damn early.Heres my first impressions. Stay away from this trash.

								I picked the doctor profession, then drove my ambulance (which makes me a paramedic) and after 2 feet of driving, i bumped into a pedestrian and my ambulance started burning so I had to walk. Couldn't steal any cars and didn't find any that were parked. After legging it all the way to the star on my minimap, I'm ready to save my patient, or so assumed. Apparently, there was a statue, and i just stood there and made 5 bucks every 5 seconds. realistic. fun.cancer			"

								This game is a steaming pile of garbage.   Don't waste your money, even if it goes on sale. If you need actual reasons on why you shouldn't buy this game, just watch the trailer.			"

								Most of us when we were babies or toddlers we had an odd fascination with poop. Those of us that did might enjoy this game. BE smart. Listen and read these reviews. Watch full streams of someone who suffered so you don't have to.If you want to play with poop... You can save by playing with the real thing. In all seriousness: I wanted to like this game. I really did. However at the end of the day it is just really bad. Even early access doesn't make it okay for a game to be this bad. Especially at 16$. I personally believe they should take this off steam. Do another crowd funding campaign and try to clean this up. At this point the game won't get any better without going back to the drawing board. 0/10 - For my full review visit TheDrastikMeasure.com "

			SCORE, is a Sport and Profession Driven Open World Multiplayer Game where players compete for fame, glory and wealth on a global scale on and off the pitch.		

WOW... This is rough, has potential but rough. Right now there are lots of bugs, and feels rather clunky. I barley got to try anything before I bugged out and fell through the map. I love role playing games and this could maybe one day get there. As of now I would not recommend this unless you really want to support the developers.			"

Early Access Review
								Update (20160722): I noticed that SCORE was no longer in my account today. I'm not sure when it was removed. From other comments on Steam discussions it looks as though the developers revoked all keys from those who had given the game a negative review. Well played, developers, well played!My original review is unchanged, below:---------NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.==========================================================---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------==========================================================Note: SCORE is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was current as of the date of this review (20160708).SCORE (all caps) is intended to be a GTA-like massively multiplayer open-world action game combined with an online FIFA-like multiplayer European football ('soccer') game.==========================================================----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------==========================================================Graphics - The graphics in SCORE are mostly rather simple and poor quality by today's standards, more similar to GTA 3 than GTA V, but not even quite that good. Buildings and cars are low-poly models with sharp edges everywhere and painted with simple, bland, flat textures. Cars are poorly animated and drive on rails, not responding to anything around them. The few people you see in the game are better looking, but still not great, and don't respond to any stimulus either, including being shot. Player characters look like they have broken or handcuffed hands when holding a pistol.The city (""Legend City"") is virtually uninhabited and you can run for minutes at a time without seeing anything but the endless stream of cars that completely ignore you. It also freezes intermittently, presumably when the world-streaming code kicks in to load another city tile or whatever.It's a shame, too. In the couple of hours that I spent trying to play SCORE I could see that a lot of effort had gone into development of the city and its surrounds. I ran to one of four golden stars on my minimap (no small feat -- it took about half an hour!) to find a weird pedestal thing at a castle and signs up espousing the medieval fair. Screenshots on the store page show beach areas and hills, as well, and the whole thing seems to have at least some logic to the layout from what I could see.The two exceptions to the poor graphics are the water, which looks bad at a distance, but actually rather good up close, especially with the wave motion that's been implemented; and the trees, of which there are only very few varieties, but which look very nice, with well-animated branches and leaves blowing in an imaginary breeze.The minimap also deserves a special mention as it seems to be implemented in real-time as an overhead camera, looking down on the area around your character, with some symbology added over the top. It works really well, but has a big impact on the overall game performance, and a recent comment in the Steam Discussions for the game suggests that it will be removed and implemented in a more traditional fashion in future, which would be a shame.There are lots of graphics settings to play with, as well, but it performed so poorly on my machine that I turned basically everything to minimum to try to reduce the freezes and lag.Sound - Sound is very minimal. There are no traffic sounds, no in-game music, no pedestrian sounds, or much of anything yet, really. There's a nice little nature sound track that is completely out of place in the middle of a city, and you can fire your guns until you run out of ammunition, making suitable gunshot sounds as you go.Gameplay - Starting SCORE takes a short time as you have to create an account; join a club; create a character by choosing gender and a look from four clothing options with very minimal selections available: hats (hair cuts), shirt, pants, and boots; and choose a profession from the small and slightly odd selection: Police, Doctor, Fire Fighter, and Assassin. But don't worry, none of the choices in character creation seem to make any difference, as there's no way yet to complete any missions for your profession and it seems to ignore clothing selections, too. Then you check your real-life email for an activation code, activate your account, and finally you can log in. You then have to wait a few minutes for your character's residence interior to load, but all you can do there is change some game settings on a laptop. After that you leave and have to wait another few minutes for the external environment to load. Yes, load times are very long.After about 10-15 minutes I was into Legend City and looking around, and I quickly discovered that's all you can do in SCORE at the moment. You can't interact with the few pedestrians you see, and even the cars follow their pre-defined paths regardless of whether you're in their way or not -- they just push you aside, causing no ill effects. I found a parked motorcycle and a parked car, but could enter neither of them. The city is devoid of any sort of interactive life, with the beautifully animated tree foliage blowing in an invisible breeze adding to the sense of desolation. I briefly wondered if I was playing another post-apocalyptic zombie game.SCORE stuttered like mad when loading new terrain and Task Manager showed a continual gobbling up of memory, implying a large memory leak. It has Steam Achievements incorporated into it, but only one of them works at the moment from what I can see. The limited in-game writing (such as the news feed and loading screen tips) are badly written and in need of an editor, or at least a proof reader. SCORE also crashed twice on me, but it is Early Access; to me these things are forgivable.The game has promise, but it's much too early to tell whether it will reach the lofty heights the developers have set for it.==========================================================-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------==========================================================Pros:+ A grand idea, and an interesting combination of games+ Potentially good world design (but implemented poorly in the current incarnation)+ Nice trees and water, particularly the animations+ Steam achievements (although they are mostly broken or otherwise unachievable at the moment)+ Trading cardsCons:- Mostly poor graphics and animations- Horrendous performance, very buggy, and poor writing (but it IS Early Access)- But most importantly, there's simply nothing to do==========================================================--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------==========================================================I'm a big fan of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. I've played every game in Rockstar's excellent series and spent more real-time days (weeks!?) than I care to think about in their game worlds. I was really excited to play SCORE.SCORE is a grand idea, but in its current state it is little more than an under-performing demo. If it sounds interesting to you then follow it, certainly, and check back on it regularly. But at the moment I can't recommend it.3/10 "

								Don't we all just love a cinematic gaming experience? 6fps is sooo nice. Even the hud is blurred so you can't see anything, amazing! If you want to feel like a console peasant you should buy this game!However, if you do have common sense you do NOT buy this game until they have fixed it. This game is unplayable at it's current state. Website games is better made than this.Please re-do this game in Unreal Engine or something and this could be gold!			"

								Although still in Early Access, this game has many exciting and revolutionary features woven into its rich fabric of gaming tapestry, including:* Your character can walk... OR run!!!* Sometimes you can enter vehicles* You can choose a job. You cannot actually work or do anything during the job, but you can choose one* Your apartment is very nice* Sometimes some menus work* You can play soccer (that's American for ""football"") if somehow other people buy this game for some unknown reason* The hat selection includes ""hair"" or ""fingerless gloves""* The physics are completely realistic. I didn't once float up into the sky at several million miles per hour... just like real life!* You dont have to worry about bothersome ""other players"" because the city is gigantic and oh there are none* There's a bench and a very large woman sits on it and she may be a giant* Your car catches fire if a woman touches it (Men's Rights!)I'm sure additional features will eventually be added, such as ""things you can do"" or ""stuff that exists"" or ""anything,"" but that is what Steam's glorious Early Access is for!  Well either that or for the developer to take your money and run, one of the two.			"

								Potential and ambition, this game has lots of both.I have been bitten before by games that offered the earth and delivered dirt, but I still take a punt on games such as this. If they deliver it will be a great game.It may be too soon for some, as there is a lot of work to do optimisation wise to get the game running well.I hope the devs have not bitten off more than they can chew, or create a jack of all trades master of nothing game.Graphicss and sound basic right now.Game play ineeds padding out, but this is Early Access after all.Overall, good foundations but still a lot of building work to go,At this moment in time I am looking forward to seeing this grow, don't let me down I still have a Lingering Dead taste from the last game I enthused about at this stage.
