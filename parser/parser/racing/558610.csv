												i don't know, i could theoretically upvote it because its so bad that its almost good......but no, gotta be honest with you, its really just a pile of sh*t like 99,99% of the other greenlight games.  all you do is moving left or right to avoid obstacles and collect protein powder or bars.  if you hit an obstacle, or miss one of the protein things, you have to start the level again.. i would say that most of the browsergames that came out in 1999 had a deeper gameplay and more content.it's just another ""omg so funny XDDDDDDD"" game that some 12 year olds voted for because its so edgy and hilarious to do so. storepage of course shows ""very positive"" because why stop at fake greenlight votes when you can also write a ""funny"" fake review, right?im not mad about the 0,83€ i spent, im mad because valve really doesn't seem to care anymore what's sold on their website. the review system is useless how it is and greenlight is cancer, and you can't prove me otherwise anymore.

												What an absolute puddle of inexcusable garbage. Set in the dystopian streets of Russia where the streets are lined with 1950s greasers and protein pills litter the street, your mission is to trundle down a straight, auto-scrolling street, dodging greasers and collecting protein powder and energy bars while listening to unimaginative rockabilly metal music on a 30 second loop. But there's a twist: You also have to dodge cigarettes and alcohol. If you get touched by a greaser, you die. If you miss a protein powder or energy bar, you should immediately touch the nearest greaser because there's no winning the level. Once you beat four levels of this mind-numbingly awful dogsh­it, there's a twist: Now you can destroy greasers by touching them, and you must touch every greaser on the level.I couldn't will myself to complete four more stages of this mind-numbingly awful piece of trash, but I suspect based on the menu icons that the next four levels involve touching engine blocks while avoiding something else, and the eight levels after that involve dodging women or possibly beating the crap out of them, either activity would be equally believable in the bulk-obsessed nofap world this game seeks to present.Let me just reiterate: This game is absolute garbage. It's not fun garbage. It's not clever garbage. It's not even ambitious enough to be interestingly awful. It would be barely-acceptable as a high school introduction to programming midterm. It's something you'd find on a Flash Game Fun Page in the late 1990s. It's not worth a dollar. It's not worth half a dollar. It wouldn't even be worthwhile as a free to play game. It's the epitome of a sh­it-awful Greenlight game. Everyone involved - the cretins who created it, the cretins who spammed it through Greenlight, and the cretins who left ""funny"" positive reviews to make sure the game is spammed on people's Discovery Queues - should be ashamed of themselves.

												Nice Engrish flash game for 4 euro... Seriously, just look at the store page video. That's the whole game. It should've been a 99 cent game or even a free one. ""Very positive"" fake reviews that aren't even in English. Good scam. At least I bought it for 20 cents and unless you do too, avoid at all costs!If Steam goes like this nobody will play/buy games anymore. Why? Because you can go on any site for online games and play better games for FREE...............................................________ ....................................,.-'""...................``~., .............................,.-""...................................""-., .........................,/..............................................."":, .....................,?......................................................, .................../...........................................................,} ................./......................................................,:`^`..} .............../...................................................,:""........./ ..............?.....__.........................................:`.........../ ............./__.(.....""~-,_..............................,:`........../ .........../(_....""~,_........""~,_....................,:`........_/ ..........{.._$;_......""=,_.......""-,_.......,.-~-,},.~"";/....} ...........((.....*~_.......""=-._......"";,,./`..../""............../ ...,,,___.`~,......""~.,....................`.....}............../ ............(....`=-,,.......`........................(......;_,,-"" ............/.`~,......`-...................................../ .............`~.*-,.....................................|,./.....,__ ,,_..........}.>-._...................................|..............`=~-, .....`=~-,__......`,................................. ...................`=~-,,.,............................... ................................`:,,...........................`..............__ .....................................`=-,...................,%`>--==`` ........................................_..........._,-%.......` ...................................,			"

												Typical russian stuff (that's not a video game) on Steam : garbage gameplay, garbage controls, fake positive evaluations.Unfortunately, there's no Quality Control on Steam, so almost any garbage stuff from Russia can be sold.Russian developers, please, stop trolling the Steam community.

												Only play it if you can pick it up for a couple of pennies in some bundle, and if you want easy achievements.  This isn't anything that hasn't been done better on Kongregate or one of the Flash game sites.			"

												This game is an embarrassment for the people who made it and for Steam for allowing it on their platform. If this game was released as a free flash game in the late 90's, it would still be an embarrassment by those standards. Garbage, nothing of value to be found here.			"

												+Nice progress system, you go from protein to killing bandits+Graphics and soundtrack are not that awful- Game is really unforgiving- You should lose when you miss something, because in the end you'll still end up losing- There's so many games like this, but it does stand out a bit, still not really something out of the ordinary- Looks it suffers from some sort of vote manipulation Overall - 4.2/10 "

												While not a horrible game, it's still kind of bad.  Though, if I'm being honest, I'd say it plays better than it looks like it would.  I got to level 12 before I'd had enough, though I was bored that night, otherwise I probably would've quit sooner.  Having to have perfect runs through the levels got tiring quickly, since you can't touch certain things or miss touching certain things or else you don't pass.  It sucked when I'd just barely miss something I needed and have to do the run over again.  For a dollar, you might get a half hour to an hour of fun out of it, but I wouldn't bother.			"

												Just a basic runner with minimal production values and basic tedious gameplay. About the best thing I can say is that Mad Hunter functions, but it's extremely poor. This isn't even a passable phone game. Don't get it, even at high discounts. There's nothing of value here except the cards.			"

												Mad Hunter is one of the most fast paced and intense scrollers I have played in yearsThough Mad Hunter may seem like just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that made it past steam greenlight it is actually quite a solid game for it's price. I believe Mad Hunter should of been nominated for just five more minutes and for love/hate relationship and won, as the short but very challenging levels always keep you coming back for some more gopman pounding.One thing that can be said about Mad Hunter that I can't say for similiar games is that the hitboxes in this game are actually of superb quality. Though I scream in agony as i miss a detal or hit a fat, i have not once thought I was wasted because of imperfect hitboxes or thought I got away with something I shouldn't have. This means that to play Mad Hunter you have to have true skill which explains all the negative reviews on this fine product.All in all this game is a must buy at it's affordable price and is perfect for people who love tapping their d and a keys in a fury of protein induced rage or enjoy reading terribly translated russian to english.When Gold asks for your universe files			"

												extremely humourous scroller game with comical heroes, cheerful graphics style and funny powerups where you got bigger and bigger from proteins, worse from sigarettes, where you should avoid cops until you buy a motorcycle with a weapons,where you squeak hooligans and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"
