Basic InformationTitle:  Try Hard ParkingStatus:  ReleasedDeveloper:  gearspecsPublisher:  gearspecsGenre:  Arcade RacerRelease Date:  4th of January, 2017 Type:  Single-playerGeneral ImpressionYes, I’ve noticed the game’s title. “Hard” is still an understatement in its case. Was it fun though? Depends on your own vision in regards to entertainment. It didn’t amuse me one bit, having to restart the same stage at least a dozen times because of the ultra sensitive car controls, which you can’t actually tune in any way. Handbrake or not, you will notice from the very start that the cars handle like refrigerators on rollerblades as if inertia itself wants you to fail and hit that reset button one more time.Or simply picky yourself up the floor and go back at the starting position. A timer will be present in the upper left side of the screen and mock your pathetic results at the end of the level IF you reach that far without rage quitting a few times first. So at least the game has its own twisted sense of humor. I have to appreciate that since I’m not gonna demolish a game simply because I can’t play it “by the book”. And here I thought that the Trials Fusion series was hard enough on two wheels. Apparently not even having four does much good. And I can draw some similarities to another one of Ubisoft’s creations, Trials of the Blood Dragon. Try Hard Parking perfectly emulates that faux VHS B-movie feel and even features some iconic car models from films of that bygone era. The dev team’s debut on Steam is thus more tolerable when you consider the price tag and the presence of Achievements (few but hard to obtain) and Trading Cards. It’s not meant to be taken seriously and actually expects you to rage quit. No PC peripherals were harmed in the making of this review or previous play testing period, since that is beneath me. Still, you better be patient in Try Hard Parking or you won’t resist the urge of uninstalling it.It is because of its self-aware sense of parody that I decided to recommend this title. It even allows you to switch the current music track if you ever try to blame that on your constant in-game failures. So I really dig the retro look and sounds and I can’t complain. A title which will surely run maxed-out on nearly all systems since it’s Unity 5 standard fare in the end. I will however, pick on the complete lack of a natural progression, learning curve, call it what you will. This game throws you in the middle of the action without even a proper tutorial. On the options page you have a picture with the unbindable controls and a few meagre tips which serve as much purpose as a “Good luck!”. And you’ll definitely need it since skill isn’t that important when the vehicles control in an unpredictable manner.I guess there is a niche and even demand for arcade games which test patience more than reflexes. While not particularly expensive, you might choose to add this game to your collection when you find it bundled. However, if you truly wish to support the dev team, purchase it from Steam directly and steer its creators towards new projects which will a hopefully be less difficult just for the sake of it. I declare it case closed but not for lack of evidence. Try Hard Parking showed me all it has to offer and I find it guilty. But then I set it free so it can drive others off those pesky neon-lit ledges. And watch them fail. A lot.Strong Points+ Affordable price tag and decent looking/sounding.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Frustratingly difficult at all times.- No tutorial and a steep learning curve.Rating 60/100  This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill.

												Good game but really too short and not really hard. Only 40 minutes to beat every levels. Controller strongly recommanded because the control on the keyboard are awful. It's only difficult when you chase a gold time.Once again, the game is good but a map editor could be very appreciate.PS : if you have struggle to pass one level, go play something equal to your skill. Like, Gone Home or Dear Esther.			"

												I checked out Try Hard Parking when it was in early access and found it made me rage.  If you like a game with a real challenge this should fit the bill.  I did an updated video for my channel.  My rage level didn't max out and my controller survived unscathed so I have to give Try Hard Parking my seal of approval (whatever that's worth). Leave a comment on the video to have a chance to win a Steam Key for Try Hard Parking. I have two keys to give away and will announce the winner on this Sundays episode of Seven Days.

												""Hardest and most Rage Inducing Parking Game in The World"".Gotta say that's actually true.The controls of the cars are sharp, so you are to be very precise, when getting over the obstacles.The neon graphics and the synthwave themed music are pretty nice,Sadly, there are not too many tracks, however, they are quite unique.7.5/10			"

												I Love this game!! The aesthetic and music are superb and the mechanics are on point!I would definitely pay more for a more fleshed out version, more levels, perhaps a level editor...The only thing negative to say would be that you can't use your controller in the menus (but I'm sure that's being worked on).Gearspecs, keep on doing what you're doing, for the love of god!!

												A good game with awesome background music that you can listen while playing.Car controls may be a bit difficult and frustrating at first.It would be great if after completing all the game levels you could unlock new cars with different driving styles (more gentle acceleration, better breaking or turning) to try and improve your best times. This would improve the replayability and longevity of the game too.			"

												Really Ragingly Frustrating. Was Recording A Video For YOUTUBE. Got To Level 4. Couple Minutes Later I Ended Up With A Smashed Battery Pack And A Nearly Broken Controller. Over Than That I Can See This Game Going Far And The Miami 80s Sorta Retro Style Is Amazing And Really Like The DeLorean Too. I Wish The Devs Good Luck			"

SHORT VERSION:I am too noob for this game.LONGER VERSION:I know the whole point of the game is to have sh*tty controls which make it very hard to play but this level of sh*tty and hard is just too much. I needed half an hour and 40 tries to beat Level 1. Not my kind of game.			"

												This is some thought experiment gone horribly wrong.It's like you let your little brother DM and he put every trap and monster in every room like ""ha! bet you wont get past this gauntlet of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!"" yeah, i bet i wont, i'm not inspired enough to give this (what i assume to be) asset flip of a game the time to trial and error my way through the first levelthe controls are ♥♥♥♥ (ex: reversing has some 3 second delay), the UI is an afterthought(with no proper loading screen, it's impossible to know if the still image menu crashed or what), the level design is like the impossible maps you dodge out of in track mania and hey, that game is free and much better			"

												What grabbed my attention to this game was the 80's asthetics and the DeLoreans! I love DeLoreans.Fun game.Only bad thing about it is the delay, and that seems to be a common issue.The game would be so much more entertaining if the delay was removed.I'd like the developer to answer me: Was the key-to-movement delay intentional?
