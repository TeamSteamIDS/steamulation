												Orborun is a game that requires skill. It’s a game that can easily be picked up and played for a couple of minutes but it can also be played for hours on end. The kind of game anyone can enjoy. It’s a game about a running (and rolling; or vice versa) robot and your goal is to set the best time and have the highest score.This isn’t one of those puzzle games that desperately feels like it has to tell you a story just in order to make sense of it all. The game has several modes - Haste, Puzzle and Hazard – and each mode seems to have 15 levels. A new category will unlock as soon as you finish one of these. So finishing Haste will unlock Haste 2, which has more obstacles and is generally more difficult. As you probably would’ve guessed already each mode is focused on something specific. So Haste focuses on speed, Puzzle focuses on getting as many points as possible while sometimes figuring out where to go and by flipping switches and Hazard is focused on avoiding obstacles and falling down holes. Of course, your main goal is to still set the best time and score.Overall the levels are enjoyable and require good skills and timing. Finishing a level will also earn you coins that can be used in the in-game store to buy cosmetic items for your robot.The game gradually introduces some new objects every few levels like ramps, walls and portals.It makes the game more interesting and difficult at the same time. The camera does get in the way of the action sometimes and I think it would’ve helped if it was placed just a tad higher.Collision detection is also a bit flaky; some of the levels require that you bounce off of walls in order to make a left or right, but bouncing straight into the wall will reset you to the last checkpoint. Confusing and frustrating. So you have to move slightly to the left/right before crashing into it. I understand that the robot isn’t built for high speed crashes but if you implement a mechanic like this you have to ignore these kinds of things if you ask me.The game also doesn’t always register when you pick up (collide with) an item. I’ve had several times that I was 100% sure I picked something up but the game didn’t process it. For me it’s not that big of a deal but if you want to set the high score then it most certainly is.Graphics wise the game is simple. Simple but pretty. The robot is well animated and textured, and the way it morphs into a ball (or the other way around) will look good and cool to anyone who likes Transformers.The level design on the other hand is a bit uninspired. The level is set in a gigantic cube with lots of platforms and each of the game’s categories has one primary color. Haste uses a lot of blue colors, Puzzle has an orange colored look and Hazard uses a good amount of green. It’s certainly distinctive.But then again, the colors aren’t the problem; it’s the fact that the levels feel a bit empty. There’s nothing happening in the background. You can argue with me here and tell me that this is for serious gamers that don’t want to be distracted, but then I’d say that any serious gamer could probably look past those things. I don’t want to see a level full with animated stuff, but a few things wouldn’t have hurt.The soundtrack is electronic and it usually has a good, solid beat. You’ll probably have heard all of it after just a few levels, but I guess most of you won’t even notice because you’ll be too focused on finishing a level. The sounds effects are kept to a minimum and can usually only be heard by collecting items, or by the occasional crash into an object (which is rare).Orborun isn’t a very long game. A level usually takes less than a minute to complete. If you can complete it in one turn, that is. A lot of the levels will definitely take a few tries in order to complete them and if you’re a true completionist than it will take you many tries more. Since there are 6 categories consisting on 15 levels each the game should take you at least 90 minutes to complete. And that’s a best case scenario. I think you should add at least a couple of hours more if you want to be truly accurate. And afterwards there are still the Bonus levels to be completed. So all in all there’s a good amount of value to be found here.Orborun doesn’t really reinvent the wheel  but what’s there is (mostly) solid, and fun. Sure, there’s always room for improvement but anyone looking for a game to set a new record (time and/or points) will have a blast with this one.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Not a particularly fun game.  The controls are surprisingly sluggish for a game that requires a good amount of precision.  Also, there is a wall-bouncing mechanic that is infuriating.  If you don't hit a wall at just the right angle, you simply die instead of bouncing off it.  This sounds like fairly common sense, but the way it's implemented with slow turning in the game doesn't work well.			"

Roll for itOrborun is a very fun game, but only if you can tolerate a pretty decent challenge. People calling this the Super Meat Boy of rolling games, and I don't think I could put it any better than that. You're going to get angry, you're going to wail in the agony of defeat, you're going to bask in your victories, and you are going to hammer that retry button until there's a hole in your screen. It's hard to find anything bad to say about the game apart from the control option showing up so often and slightly uninspired visual/audio design. If that all sounds great to you, give Orborun a little of your attention, it's dying to meet you.			"

												God, this is just abysmal. The music is generic and obnoxious, for starters. I feel like I have heard these songs in other games. The graphics are about the only thing here that looks decent, but they're simple and kind of samey.Anyways, gameplay-wise... what the hell. You simply cannot demand precision from a player when 1. rarely is indication of what you're supposed to do given 2. the controls are loose and imprecise, heavily physics-based. The first two worlds are decent if rather mediocre, but I gave up in the first hazard world because the game was demanding something and I had no clue what it was asking, and doing anything other than what it was asking kept getting me killed.The levels are short but there's a lives system, which is 1. an instant mark-down in 2015, jesus christ guys, seriously? 2. Almost pointless due to level length. For some reason you're always moving forward, just like, natural movement, so you can only steer left and right which makes correcting mistakes basically impossible, and it's easy to make mistakes with how loose the controls are. The scoring system is broken as heck, it actually encourages dying to get a better score because points don't reset when you die. Doesn't seem to have any reward for scoring 3 stars though so I never bothered.This game isn't very fun and isn't particularly worth your time. I got it free, which is about what it's worth. It does nothing other games haven't done better.			"

												4.5/10Kind of like a marble endless runner mixed with speedrun. The game is somewhat fun at first. The problems is with the mechanics and control. You always move at full speed and instead of having a jump, or slow down, or any sort of control, you don't. This means many times you won't be able to make a turn, or do anything, if you aren't in the perfect position. This is also due to the terrible slow turning radius which is equal to that of a semi-truck. Since you auto lose in certain parts because you didn't come in perfectly, the game is less about reaction time, and making good decisions on the fly, and memorizing the entire level and doing it over and over. This is also because every part has instant kill walls and jumps, meaning you start the level over again. All the levels look and feel basically the exact same, and more variety would be nice. Many marble games provide good control, while this game takes it away. If you ever lose momentum or anything your ball will not be able to make jumps. Half the time your ball just breaks, which is annoying if you bump the side of the platform, or with any boxes or walls that slow you down. Some parts require you to run into walls but for some reason if you take the perfect angle your guy won't be destroyed. Many parts that flip the screen around and have you jumping from thing to thing or going upside down, its hard to staty focused and keep track of where you should be moving, which causes another problem with the trial and error gameplay rather than the skill based gameplay. Some parts you have no idea where to go next but since you cant stop or anything you just die. Other parts if you don't hit the jump perfectly you will automatically die or miss it. Other parts require you to turn way too sharply and quickly for what the game affords. Go get ""influx"" for ball rolling or something like audiosurf or endless runner for that type of game, this is a combination of the two that loses the best of both worlds.			"

Prepare to RollThis is a fast paced arcade game that is a fair amount of fun. However, there aren't many game modes to choose from but there are a decent amount of levels in each game mode. The game run smoothly and the graphics are simplistic but aren't terrible at all. With that being said i did get this game for free and it is definitely worth it at that price or even a discounted price. At full price maybe not, unless you are seriously interested			"

												The game's only controls are turning left and right.  No jump button, no walk mode... nothing.A few levels require you to pick between two warp points, and you have to trial and error to figure out which one is right.  And the entire level is built on a maze out of these trial-and-error guessing puzzles.No options for... anything.  Specifically for either graphics or controls.(I received this game for free from an Indiegala giveaway.)			"

A Screenshot of Orborun

 Track consist of various obstacles, jumps and different platforms. It's a fun and casual game. I do recommend it!!! PROS  Controls.  To play this game you need only 2 buttons: W and D. Controls responses well and intuitively.  Physics.  I liked game physics. It feels like you are in control but at the same time angle of jump makes huge difference. Level design.  Levels are really well designed. Each level is very unique and different. Yes some levels is a little bit frustrating but once you pass them you enjoy game like nothing happened. Each level is about 15-45s (without fails but you will fail) long making progress fast. Sometimes some levels requires few fails to figure out where to go. Orboruns.  I have to mention it: Orboruns (characters) are awesome. There are various skins and 3 different type (no huge advantages). Orboruns are cute and sometimes they transform from ball to robot. NEUTRAL   Graphics.  Orborun have simple and nice graphics. It could be a bit better, but at the same time it's more than enough for a game like this. Difficulty.  To gain at least 1 star? (not sure how rating is called) is very easy. Gaining 3 stars is really hard. CONS  Achievements/Trading cards.  There is no achievements and trading cards what makes game less achieving. At least achievements would be nice. CONCLUSION Orborun isn't game of the year and is very far from that but it is enjoyable. Simple game with simple controls. Levels design is awesome. It is not must play or story driven game but if you want to waste some time (even 10min is enough) you can run this game and enjoy your time.I recommend this game for people who likes racing platformers.

 Let me begin by saying two things. 
1. I absolutely hate writing negative reviews. 
2. I got this in a bundle for next to nothing, and still feel like I got ripped off. Games of this type generally aren't my style, but I very rarely feel the need to write a negative review even with that being said. The graphics, while somewhat bland, are fine. I wouldn't say they're fantastic, but definitely acceptable. Now that we've got the good stuff out of the way, let's get to the rest of the game. You control everything with two buttons. Just the right and left arrow keys. This game needs far more precision than these controls offer. (I played before writing this review with an Xbox 360 controller, and I will say it was better than without the controller. Definitely. However, the controls were still sloppy at best, and attempting to correct any mistakes is almost certainly fatal.), The levels look all pretty much the same, and it gets very tiresome. The levels are also all very short, but despite this they have a lives system? This honestly makes no sense to me, and half the time you'll respawn in a spot where it's literally  impossible  to avoid dying. The music is also incredibly generic, and in my opinion very annoying. I also didn't find the levels to be particularly challenging, and when it was it was simply do to s***** controls. I tried to put more game time into this before writing a review, but I literally couldn't force myself to do it any longer than half an hour.  PROS:  Decent graphics Controller supportCONS: Horrible, sloppy controls Generic, irritating music Levels grow very repetitive Little instruction as to what your objective is An overall, generally unenjoyable gameAs much as I personally disliked this game, and cannot in good conscience recommend it, I do hope the developers continue to make more games. With more effort and practice, I'm sure they could make something great! This game unfortunately, just isn't.			"

												This reminds me of those easy play arcade games where you just guide ball or person to stay on road because they can not stop. Nostalgic feel for me and I did really like this game. Style is neat (gf said “sterile” but I think it is good) and there is much fun to be had. Soundtrack is good too, works very well with game style and keeps you interested! Not very long but it does not need to be and there is replay value to it.			"

												I bought this game for a signifigant discount during a steam sale, and for that price I found it worth the money. This game reminds me of super monkey ball, but plays a bit differently. You only control directions LEFT and RIGHT. You constantly move forward. The left and right directions somtimes change based on the camera angle (espeically doing a loop on a track), which can cause trouble navigating at times. The music is fun, and the menu system is very quick. It's cute. It's fun. It's also frustrating trying to complete levels sometimes.			"

												This game is very challenging, but is only appealing to a certain group of players.Pros:- Simple Controls, pure skill is required.- VERY challenging, Could be a con I suppose, but I love challenging games.- The graphics are pretty good, it's nice to look at the game c:- Awesome music.- Lots of variety, easily 15+ hours of gameplay for an $6.50 game, pretty good.- Level Design is fantastic.- Speed running is so satisfying.- It's unique. There are not many PC games like it.Cons:- Obviously meant to be on mobile phone.- Without a Gamepad, you are limiting yourself by using the keyboard. The Gamepad is just way easier to use.- Can be very repetitive if you go with the flow, and don't mix it up.- Very Challenging, can be a pro or con.- If you're not skilled, and not determined, you can EASILY get super frustrated and stop playing after only 1 hour.- It takes ""Hard"" To a whole nother level, they clearly made this game knowing it had to be hard, but they went as far as making you hit 1 specific spot, at the exact right angle, or else you fail.  Hard is good, near impossible is not.- Very limited options in menu screen.- Makes you collect coins, but you can't do anything with them, and they dissapear forever after you beat the level.Overall, yes. I recommend playing this game, but I was very close to deciding no, If there was an imbetween button, i'd press that. Like I said, this game is only appealing to a certain group of people. I suggest waiting to buy it on sale.			"

												This is a horrible game. The controls are incredibly simplistic (turn left, turn right - that's it), many of the puzzles require guesswork (which portal leads where?) and the graphics are just plain awful for a game released in 2014. It's obviously a mobile game, and might have been fun on a phone or a tablet, but it's painful on a computer. You should go play something like Marble Blast Gold or Spectraball instead, if you're bent on playing a ball-rolling game.TL;DR: Bad controls, graphics, gameplay. Avoid.			"

												Not a particularly fun game. The controls are surprisingly sluggish for a game that requires a good amount of precision. Also, there is a wall-bouncing mechanic that is infuriating. If you don't hit a wall at just the right angle, you simply die instead of bouncing off it. This sounds like fairly common sense, but the way it's implemented with slow turning in the game doesn't work well. "

												I didn't really have high hopes for this game after seeing the screenshots but I did give this game a shot. And it was well worth it.Orborun may not be the prettiest game to look at but it makes up for it with its addictive and quite unique gameplay. The gameplay is a combination of your basic ""runner"" type of games where you constantly keep moving, collect points or other items and do a certain kind of objective in order to progress in the game. This is all comes with a quite fresh twist with challenging levels varying from basic levels going pretty much linearry forward to level which require fast reflexes or quick decision making. This makes the game stand out from most of the runner games I've seen and this gets me to launch the game every now and then.Overall, Orborun is well worth the full price in my opinion. And this is quite rare thing coming from my mouth since I am usually pretty dang miserly when it comes to my money. A fresh experience to entertain you for hours.			"

												This is a pretty cool game, especially if you end up getting it for free. Only problem is that it gets boring rather quickly. Good concept but needs more features/interactivity.You are an Orbot, a robot that turns from a walking, 2-legged robot into a tightly integrated ball (orb) that then traverses different stages of mid-air tracks. It's kind of a cross between Sonic the Hedgehog and any Mario-World type platformer with less eye-candy and less fun stuff to do.If there was a choice for a neutral vote instead of thumbs up/down, I would've chosen that.Summary: Nice game if you get it for free, otherwise, don't get it.**This review is for the Standard edition, not the Halloween edition.

												It's ok?The game is a monkey ball type where you control an orb as you go from the beginning to the end of the level. Within the levels are various obstacles and paths that block you from going to the end. The level design isn't that bad and the courses are sometimes challenging. However, they are limited and they get repetitive very fast. The controls are fine (?) but simple and the soundtrack is just 2 tracks which play when the other one finishes.Just keep in mind that it is an iOS port and you can still see the micro transactions button. Due to that, the controls are simple and there isn't much you can do. The emphasis is on getting the most amount of points with the fastest time. That’s where the game shines because there are various paths to take and if you are into scores, go right ahead. There are a few issues with the checkpoints where it will spawn you in a way that you will just die again. Additionally, there are bugs which didn't reset the level when I died making it impossible to progress unless I did it in one try and ♥♥♥♥ that noise. The camera also needs work when you go through loops because you don’t know exactly when the controls are inverted. Overall, it’s ok? If you are bored and a few bucks, spend it. However, for 5 bucks, you can buy a lot better games.			"

												Well I played the game and I iked it, it's entertaining, fast-paced and fun to play. Great for short periods as well, the game offers you plenty of levels in different kinds of enviroments, well khmm... actually the envirement is the same but the structures of the level packs are pretty diverse and there are later on lots of levels which challenge you. If you like kind of skill based roll games when you roll on platforms mostly, I can recommend, the price isn't so high but you may better wait for a sale. I am going to summarize the pros and cons:Pros:+ a simple gameplay that entertaines you+ fast-paced game experience, suitable for short times+ plenty of level with different challenegesCons:- repetitive music- lacking challenge troughout the whole game- can turn boring after much time, no real motivation play againThis game is like Monkey-Ball, but you roll with robots in a whole different dimension.

												Starts off easy but turns up difficulty as you progress along the levels, especially if you want to score perfectly on each level. The 3 different modes allow for diverse gameplay. ""Haste"" is mostly easy to finish but hard perfecting your time. ""Puzzle"" will require you to combine the speed with some thinking. ""Hazard"" reminds of a skill platformer in the 3D world, comparable to the trickier maps of Trackmania (or some 2D skill platformers around). The levels might lead to one or another rage quit when you mess them up just at the end. Since they aren't too long individually and there's an instant restart option you can however try again and again and again ... Sometimes you stop rolling and start running, and it feels like the character controls slightly different than when rolling. I still don't know what triggers that or if it's just built into the level.Music is ok. Local multiplayer is provided as split screen allowing up to 4 players to play the map at the same time which might actually be nice if you have friends over. Gamepad worked, but can probably be played with a keyboard too since most of the time you will want to go as sharp as possible.Runs smoothly at 60fps. Graphics are simple, nice and clean.PS: Looping control is a bit fiddly, you need to change button just at the right moment. Control as a whole gets pushed to or over the limits in the trickier hazard levels and since you can't always see where you're going guessing or learning the course by heart is required.			"

												 Pretty cool game, kinda addictive ;) It all starts slow and easy, but the difficulty racks up pretty fast, especially if you aim to gather everything for the oh so desired 3 stars ;) Yes, the game is  missing some options like rebind keys and sound sliders, but I'm sure we'll get 'em later on, as steam highscores and achievments are coming. If you thought the game is addictive as it is, wait till the highscores come around - I personally can't wait ;)Did a first impression video aswell, here it is, if you wanna check it out

												Un juego bastante divertido, bueno para pasar el rato el juego se va ir dificuldando y lo recomiendo jugar con control.la musica... bueno la musica se va  olvidando, eso no quiere decir que no sea buena. lo malo es que la musica es muy repititiva pero es aceptable.en si el juego es muy bueno, muy recomendado			"

												It's a very fast-paced game and the levels don't take all that long to beat (much quicker than say, Spectraball).  There are no audio sliders (only toggles) and the keys can't be rebound...luckily, there aren't that many controls to worry about.  The game runs on the Unity engine, so you'll be able to adjust screen resolution & graphics quality as well as toggle fullscreen via a pop-up at launch.  I tested both ends of the graphics quality settings and didn't notice a difference, which was odd.  The game does award you with coins to unlock new skins and bots, but there's admitedly not a lot of toys to choose from.  I'd recommend ""Orborun"" to those who enjoy being perfectionists and wouldn't mind playing levels over and over again to get the perfect ""run"".   It's not something I'd personally play over the long haul, but for price it's asking, there's a lot of content and play time to be had.

												I like this game. I think it's really fun; but, a fun game needs fun elements. There needs to be Steam Workshop content, there needs to be better turning and physics. Also, the wall thing - walls shouldn't make you die when you NEED them to finish a level. This game needs a lot more improvement.			"

												Flat and amateurish textures, stupid maps, overly simple and clunky controls mixed with pick ups which you often go over but don't pick up because the hit boxes are far smaller than the objects. Top it off with a unhealthy sprinkling of no option menu, no way to rebind and no way to change resolution or graphical settings. Pass. Even for $2 on sale it feels like there isn't enough going for it. Some people compare this with Monkey Ball on the Gamecube... don't listen to them it's nothing like it and no where near as fun. Is it because you are going along a track and are ball shaped? That's really the only similarity that I can see. Yeah, twins.			"

												This game is easily fixable.  The puzzles are interesting but it is a shame there are very limited configuration and controls.  The Auto restart on maps doesn't take in to account if you are just about to fly off the side of the map or not when it resets you.  Sometimes instead of a restart, it is just several replays of how you last died, just in case you missed it the first time.			"

												YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR BALLS ALL DAY WITHOUT ANY CHAFING, OR DEITY ANGERING!!! Really fun. Really enjoy the ""Monkey Ball"" style gameplay as I roll my robot through the levels. Makes me feel all nostalgic in my pants. That being said, it could use a bit of a tune-up. I wish there were some achievements to hunt, trading cards to earn, or more levels to master with the addition of workshop.  Any of the above. In its current state, there's nothing to really keep me coming back. For the price, and especially because of the local co-op and controller support, I still recommend this game, however. Great fun and well made.			"

												I received this game from a loot package from greenmangaming. Honestly? It's fun but there is no way I would have paid 5.99 for it. It's fairly easy and most maps take about 20-30 seconds to complete. It's a simple, but fun game overall. I would recommend it if you see it on sale.			"

												This seems like a straight port of a cheap mobile game. Don’t get me wrong, I love mobile games—but put some effort into the port. A quick search tells me the Android version costs $2, and that seems about right for this version, too. Graphics are simple and blocky, huge controls are overlaid on screen… and I’m talking about the Steam version.			"

												I can't really recommend this one.The developers think it's only 3 year olds and the mentally deficient who will play this game. First level: press A or <- to go left. A few seconds later, as if it wasn't already obvious enough, press D or -> to go right. It's on the first level, fair enough there are some idiots who would probably complain that it doesn't explain or something, but it comes up every now and then, pausing you in the middle of a run to explain to you the umpteenth time.The music isn't all that great in my opinion, it's somewhat repetitive and boring, much like the gameplay.The worst offender is, ""free coins for liking us on all our social media channels"". I'll tolerate this on free games (A free game I would recommend is Eternal Senia, who does this, but for items you can get from grinding anyway), but any game that does it after charging money gets an instant negative review from me. It doesn't matter how good the game is (not that this game is good anyway).Get it as part of a bundle or something, but otherwise don't waste your money.			"

												I like it, really good to play multiplayer. Its not a game with a massive story to it, its not insanely indepth, its a fun party game and its fun. Half the fun is yelling at the screen that you didn't complete the level within the amount of lives you're given. Have to say though, that the checkpoints should be removed as they sort of spoil the achievement of getting through the level.Best played with 2 or more people, you can play with up to 4 (including yourself).It works well with in-home streaming from steam, and it works with my usb controllers too, so it can be used with them.Its not got 100hrs of content, but it sure as hell can keep you occupied for a hour or two when you need something to do, especially if you've got company and wanna play a laid back game. (Levels are prettie quick, so you can pick up and leave whenever you want without consequences.You can buy new skins for your orb ingame with currency you earn from doing levels, extremely easy to unlock when you play multiplayer.
