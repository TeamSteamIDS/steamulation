												This game is terrible.  There is no nice way to say it.The only interaction you really have is moving left and right, and having 2 weapons to fire.  Sounds like it could still be alright?  WRONG!Once you get above a certain 'speed' (and I put that in quotations because there is no way to tell how fast you are going, or control it) the minigun becomes usesless as the bullets fire behind you.  The rockets also ONLY work if they are targetted to something, which (from what I could tell) only seemed to be money and a few doors.So once you get used to this piece of ♥♥♥♥, you hit level 3.  Now level 3 is the definition of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  There are these giant rolling snowballs, which move side to side on the course, and you have to dodge them.  Unfortunately they move side to side 4 times (twice in each direction) per second, and the first one is right at the start before you have any speed.So I went and bought the fastest car I could afford (the blatant Lamborghini rip off), and it turns out which this car, I had about a 10% chance of making it past the first one!  Hooray!   And so I began getting past the first one, and I quickly learnt that I had about a 40% chance of making it past the second one, a 70% chance of making it past the third one, and a 95% chance of making it past the rest,  which doesn't sound too bad, but it really is.  Anyways, so I'm smashing it through with the fast car, and I'm starting to get closer to the end of the level, and you come across these little road blocks, where all 3 'lanes' are blocked, 2 by a concrete block, and 1 by barrels.  Now I've played racing games before, and it's obvious that you should hit the barrels... WRONG!  Each barrel you hit (and they are in a stack of about 7-9) takes 1 damage off you, whereas hitting the contrete block takes 1 damage off you.  Long story short, I instantly wrecked.  Back to the start I go... Oh, and it's worth mentioning that about 5% of the time your car doesn't start moving at the start, so you have to exit out and go back in.So I keep trying, and keep practicing, and I finally make it to the end of the level, and I hit the last 'jump' ANNDDDD... I go *through* the jump.  Off into the abyss, and I don't complete the level.  So I painstakingly do it all again, and go *through* the final jump again.  So it looks like I now need to use one of the slower cars.  The cars where I can NEVER seem to get past the original snowball... (as in - I think I've only made it past it once in roughly 30 minutes - and it takes about 4 seconds to get to it)...Even for an achievement hunter, I would not wish the pain of this game on ANYONE.  It's exactly why developers should be FORCED to upload a Demo on Greenlight before they can even be voted on.Save your money for another game, or a skin on CSGO.  Hell owning a FAMAS Doomkitty would be better than getting cancer from this game.PS.  I was also wondering HOW this game could possibly get ANY positive reviews.. until I actually looked at the positive reviews.  They have varying play time (2-5 hours) and have not unlocked a single achievement (very unlikely since it takes about 1 minute to get the first one).  They all also seem to currently be playing identical games, and reviewing identical games :).  It seems the developer has actually paid for positive reviews....UPDATE: After over 90 minutes I beat level 3.  It's worth noting that you still can't use the Lamorghini on the next level, as it falls through the ground.  Well, it turns out ALL cars do, but the slower ones get launched UP so you land back on the track..I beg you, don't support the developer by buying this.			"

												Ehhh, it's sorta fun... for about 5 minutes.Sadly, even with the price being under a dollar for this one, I cannot recommend it people.  Believe it or not, while this game ""looks"" much better then then yesterdays 99 cent game ""Shake Your Money Simulator 2016"", that game is honestly quite a bit more fun then this one and it scored a higher score in my book.  Here's my First Play & Review video:

			Get this game for under $1 right here on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/457710/ Want to show me your love? Even a dollar helps!		

A and D to move left and right respectively.  S slows you down, left mouse to shoot regular bullets, right mouse button to shoot missles that you collect on the road driving. The standard Unity engine menu that pops up before the game starts is your only options available sadly.Game is alright, like I said for about 5 to 10 minutes, but getting any value or fun past that point will probably be rare for most people.  My recommendation is to save your dollar and put it to better use because you probably won't ever play this game again after your first 10 minute trial of it.  It scored a 51% in my video review, even considering the low price point.			"

Pros:~Car with guns~Some of the cards look cool~Simple controls (left/right & shoot guns/missiles)Cons:~Car flies~So do obstacles~Zone exits do not, and are tunnelsThis game is (apparently?) a bad port from a mobile game, and the lack of menu, control prompts, or explanation for anything shows this deficiency.  I literally couldn't complete zone 2 because my flying car hit the tunnel entrance every time I was lucky enough to get that far.This game isn't worth it's $.99 price, and that's coming from a guy who likes cars-and-guns type of games.  If you can pick it up in a bundle it'll give you something to trade, if you can find anyone who wants the cards.			"

												I beat the game within 15 minutes, using only the starter vehicle. There's supposed to be a story, but it doesn't hold at all. The physics are terrible (I went through bridges on one level, and through a ramp on one of the frist two levels), and most of the you can't even fire your machine guns, so to avoid certain obstacles, you either need to be very quick or just have luck on your side. If it's the creators' first game, it's not /too/ terribly bad, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a dollar to throw away.			"

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/457710/ Road Madness, a game put together as quickly as possible in unity. One dollar price tag and it's still not worth it.		

This game is bad. Controls are pretty horrible, can't turn off music without turning off all sounds, turning off the music requires you to start a game to get to that option, and missiles have no visual indication that they've fired. Even further on the missile issue is that they will only hit the next eligible target from what I can tell.Save your dollar or donate it to charity, either option is better than buying this game.

""Controls of madness""This game is horrible. A DeLorean brings you back to the past inclusive worst controls evar and a gameplay you only know from ancient videogames. Like switch 3 lanes, shoot seeker missiles on piles of barrels without any reason and deny 1-hit monster snowballs. But the game has even more to offer. Fly in Florida Keys under the bridges, use a ramp to float forever in the sky or kindly hooligans with basies cheering you up ...Incorparated with a shop link to some crazy music this game is a dime on the opposite scale of quality.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												I'm gonna try something new to me with this review. I uploaded a ""full playthrough"" of the game available here. It's one of those ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" situations. Because I could write at length about how shabby this game is, but it's better if you just see for yourself. The playthrough is 9 minutes long and includes the whole, unskipped intro, and one death (and level restart). And when you're viewing the last level - which starts around the 8th minute - be sure to notice how I'm travelling faster than my minigun bullets, so when I fire them, they are immediately left behind.I must admit, I had fun with this game. A weird kind of ""so bad it's good"" fun, but still. I was furious with the level 3 bug (impossible to complete level if game is launched at minimum graphics settings), but once I figured out the workaround it was smooth sailing from that point on. Nevertheless, I cannot give a ""thumbs up"" here. Because in addition to the game being objectively terrible in terms of its components (visuals, engine/physics, etc.), it doesn't seem like the authors put in much effort into it. As if it was entirely a scam to sucker some chumps (customers - me and you) out of their money. This is on the same (abyssal) level of quality as Despair and only marginally better then The District. On the plus side, the achievements are easy to get. So is it worth the 1 EUR purely on account of that? YMMV but I'm leaning towards no.			"

												Road Madness is a game with a plot that takes place in the 21st century when the Earth’s resources such as oil are being consumed by the wars. The world has turned into anarchy. The basic plot seems to be taken from the Mad Max movies. However, the plot is not well integrated with the gameplay, as you use your vehicle for racing by yourself while evading obstacles. It is very easy to forget that the game even has a story.I was shocked to see that this game had no manual to speak of. What??? That’s right, no manual and the only movement keys for your vehicle are A and D, left and right, respectively. You don’t move the car forward; it moves forward by itself and all you have to do with move left and right to avoid obstacles, collect coins and missile ammo. The game is divided into 6 levels of racing and action requiring you to reach the finish line without your vehicle losing all its health. The car moves faster and faster as you progress through the level, thereby making it more difficult to avoid obstacles. Also, shooting is more difficult. I can remember blowing up an obstacle with a missile, but I could barely see the missile being fired. That shows poor game mechanics.If you collect enough coins on each level, you can spend them on upgrades or you can buy other vehicles. There is some variety in the types of vehicles, but they feel boring just like the gameplay itself. It feels like racing, but it doesn’t feel like there is truly anarchy and chaos.The graphics are mediocre by today’s standards, but they also have their glitches. I race a car on one level with a bridge, but my car ended up below the bridge while I was catapulted in the air by a ramp. I reached the ground when the car strangely got back on the bridge. I view this as a problem with both game mechanics and graphics. On some occasions, I restarted the game only to see that the car was not accelerating forward at all. I ended up having to restart the level to correct this apparent bug. If you put enough time and dedication to each level and learn to avoid enough obstacles that deplete your vehicle’s health, you can complete all 6 levels. Some levels are based on some American settings, including Alaska. There is one decent looking level in Yucatán, Mexico honoring the country’s indigenous history. After completing all 6 levels and earning all 6 achievements, I did not feel any motivation to play the game again.I do not recommend this game due to the lackluster story, lackluster gameplay, graphical glitches, and no manual. It feels like an incomplete game. It costs only $0.99, but I paid only $0.10 because I included a 90% coupon in this purchase. If you are into farming the game for Steam trading cards and to earn all 6 achievements, these may be the best reasons to buy Road Madness. Otherwise, steer clear of this game. "

												A game that is likely to be fuel for youtube reactions this game has graphics that are below par with 3D consoles of the 90s. Unclear controls, lag from their own animations and a speed that's so fast you can't react to the things you need to dodge (assuming you see them or you're not going so fast that they don't even register the hit) makes this an unplayable mess not even worth the dollar. The third level literally has a ball that is a one hit KO that flies across the screen back and forth to fast right at the start that it is impossible to pass, making this game unbeatable.Got it for 25 cents with a coupon, hoping the cards make back more than that.

												♥♥♥♥...That's what this game is. For a poor start, It runs on unity. To me, the setup and plot is just a crappy blatant copy of Mad Max. The graphics are just terrible. Textures, terrible as well. When you see vehicles that are locked, the price of the vehicle doesn't even fit in the box it was supposed to be in. Like, COME ON. Have you ever played Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing? Yeah, I have to bring another ♥♥♥♥ stain of a video game into the review. Anyhow, there's this thing in the game where if you go backwards, you can drive at an unlimited speed for as long as you want. Pretty crappy and nonsencical, right? Well in this game, if you drive, the same thing happens, you just go on and on and on, and as long as you don't die, you can reach impossible speeds. It just makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense! The text used in the game isn't at all fancy or fits the mood of the game. It's just white-colored Arial font. That's it, nothing special. Last and hopefully least, the weapons don't lock on to ANYTHING. There basically useless. Thank you, this has been my review.			"

 Road Madness   A,D + Left Mouse Click and Right Mouse Click Simulator 2014 ""Road Madness""This ""game"" needs to be renamed to A,D + left mouse click and right mouse click simulator 2014.Honestly, this should not have been released in the state it is, for example: if you drive off a ramp, you will soar through the air like a feather whilst carrying the car's momentum, it will slowly reach the ground as if the car doesn't have any weight to it. I've also had a glitch where you go completely underneath the map whilst driving.The only things positive I can say are only a few things:- The Delorean DMC-12 is a playable car *which makes me happy as a huge Back To The Future fan*- Easy achievements *all you do is complete the levels.. which isn't as easy as it sounds, due to the amount of control you have over the car..*- Trading cards- Cheap *I got this from a coupon for 18p*If you want a game with easy achievements, go for it, other than that.. stay away from this.

												Nope! Nope! Nope!It has really bad graphics, but that's almost its best feature.You can't turn off the music, and it keep restarting the same audio track over and over. The game itself is basically audiosurf with weapons, but you don't feel engaged and the sense of speed or purpose is absent.			"

												This game might of been a fun little game, if not for two major flaws in it. One is the lack of content, having only six levels in it as far as I am aware. The other is all the bugs and glitches in it, like how the minigun is virtually useless as you seemingly outpace your own bulllets almost immediately and how if you click to restart the level quickly your car glitches in such a way that you become glued the starting line.I don't recommend this game.

												LOL this game is just so bad!There is no acceleration or break, the car makes itself to high speed.There aren`t any use of the weapons you got, (1st you faster than your bullets, 2nd the rockets only effective on targeted items (doesn`t work on roadblocks or barrels)).It`s not possible to complete all the stages without getting to much damage, after shows game over, restart or exit, but there is one thing, the car is keep going in the background in a very low speed. If you wait you still could finish the stages, doesn`t matter after that if you hit anything and get the achievements without any effort. LAME.......Facepalm			"

												Holy crap, where do i even start? Your mission in this game is to drive a car of your choice on a straight road from start to finish, while steering left/right to avoid obstacles and shoot targets with your minigun and rocket launcher. While doing so, your car gets faster and faster, until you can barely avoid anything at all anymore. Sounds funny enough, heh? Bad thing is, this game is just a mess, but let me tell you the good things first:- Challenging- So bad that it's funny- Very short- Music is really good- Graphics are okay- Easy to learn, hard to masterHow about the bad things? Well...- Very, very glitchy- Your car weights nothing and starts flying- You are faster than light, so your minigun starts firing backwards- Luckily, it's nearly useless anyway.- Sometimes you go so fast, that obstacles don't harm you- On the bridge level you can glitch through the road- Sounds for weapons seem to be glitchy or too quiet, so they are barely noticeable- Explosions seem to have no sound at all- Car sounds turn on/off together with the music- Many cars to unlock, which are all worse than the car you get for free- Get HP upgrade for the free car, you won't ever need anything else- Options are not avaiable in the main menu, only after starting a game- You controll your car with keyboard + mouse and it doesn't even hide the mouse (entire game needs 4 buttons)- Car doesn't even move the wheels. You just go diagonally while steering.Overall, i have to admit, that it was funny, so i can't really give it a thumb down. Yes, it's a mess, but not bad enough that you don't want to play and complete it at all.If you are curious, buy it. But don't expect too much.			"

												For just under 50 cents, this certainly is not a good game. It is riddled with game-breaking bugs, such as an unavoidable snowball that does not slow down unless your graphics settings are set to ""fantastic"" before starting the game.The soundtrack is okay, albeit a little bit repetitive as time goes on; however, the real ""shining moment"" of this game was when I began to notice every billboard was just an advertisement for the Lucky 38 Casino, from Fallout New Vegas. Seeing stolen assets in games is frustrating when they're free, but when you have to pay for them, it's like being kicked in the nuts. Overall, this game isn't a fun game, and it sure as hell isn't a good game.ACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS: This is an incredibly fast 100%. Even if you lose a level, at the ""Game Over"" screen you can just continue to accelerate and you will eventually reach the finish line and ""win"" the level.			"

When lowpoly roughnecks in a post apocalyptic world weld down the gas pedal, the only option is to accelerate constantly down a straight road.  Dodge randomly obstacles or exploit physics bugs to fly over them in an every increasing acceleration towards the goal.Boring, ugly and uninteresting are just a few of many prerogatives that can be used to describe this buggy experience.

												This game is awesome. If anyone says it is awful they are lying. The graphics are amazing and the songs, mmm, the infinite, looping, songs. They were just beautiful. This game makes me cry because of how well made it is. It is truly a master piece. The background while going 999mph was also stunning. Buildings slowly falling, giant random snowballs moving from side to side. This game clearly took years to make and was clearly not didn't make this game for a quick buck. One more thing: The NPC AI. The NPC's AI is the most advanced thing I have seen  to date        EVER. They just stand still... and HEADBANG! Amazing! I have never seen AI more advanced. Overall, I found this game really awful and should only play it if you are getting payed. For $0.49, it's pretty much saying ""Hey!

												Project CARS is a motorsport racing simulator video game developed by Slightly Mad Studios and published by Bandai Namco Games. It was released in May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Project CARS was originally also due for release on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U but it was later announced that these versions had been cancelled.Gameplay[edit]Features[edit]Project CARS is intended to represent a realistic driving simulation. In order to differentiate the game from the established industry leaders, Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport, Slightly Mad Studios' aim is a ""sandbox"" approach that allows the player to choose between a variety of different motorsports paths and grants immediate access to all included tracks and vehicles.[2] Project CARS portrays racing events spanning multiple days, progressing from shakedown and qualifying runs to the race itself, while changes in weather and lighting conditions are simulated dynamically.[3]Physics simulation[edit]Project CARS adopts an improved version of the Madness engine, which was the basis for the Need for Speed: Shift titles.[4] More processing power available in modern computers allows for the introduction of a dynamic tire model named ""SETA"", rather than the steady-state model based on lookup tables, as seen in previous generation simulations.[5] To accommodate differing skill levels, Slightly Mad Studios offers gamers (with or without a digital wheel) various driver aids and input filtering methods.The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is one of the few Japanese cars in the game.There are 74 drivable cars,[6] over 30 unique locations with at least 110 different courses, of which 23 are real, with the remainder being fictional.[7] For licensing reasons, some tracks are currently codenamed using their geographic location. In addition to real world racing circuits and fictional kart circuits, there are two fictional point-to-point roads inspired by Côte d'Azur and California Pacific Coast.On 6 August 2014, Slightly Mad Studios revealed which circuits would be included in the final game.Development[edit]Project CARS, which stands for Community Assisted Racing Simulator, was made for a total sum of $5 million.[8] Funding for the game was raised by the community and the developers themselves, without the financial aid of a traditional publisher. Through the purchase of Tool Packs players could contribute to development in roles including content creation, QA, and marketing media.[9] Members gain special perks, depending on their purchased tool pack. Members will receive a share of game sales profits generated within the first three years after launch as compensation for their efforts, to be paid quarterly.[10]In addition to community feedback, Slightly Mad Studios have acquired the professional services of racing driver and Top Gear's former The Stig, Ben Collins,[11] Clio Cup and European Touring Car Cup racing driver Nicolas Hamilton,[12] and former Formula Renault 3.5L and current ELMS driver Oli Webb. Cars in the console versions of the game are made from 60,000 polygons.[13]On 26 August 2012 support for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset was announced on the official forums.[14] The announcement stated that at least one Oculus Rift Development Kit has been ordered. Members of the project are able to follow a link referenced in the forum post to read more details.Sony's PlayStation 4 virtual reality headset PlayStation VR will also be supported.[15]It was released on 7 May 2015 in Europe and 12 May 2015 in America for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while the Linux version has been delayed to later in 2015.[16] Project CARS was originally also due for release on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U but it was later announced that these versions had been cancelled.[17] On 18 February 2015 it was announced that Project CARS would be delayed until 2 April 2015 for Europe,[18] and eventually confirmed to be released on 7 May 2015 in Europe and Australia; 8 May 2015 in the UK; and 12 May 2015 in North America.On 12 May 2016, the game was released for HTC Vive virtual reality headset.[19]Cancellation of Wii U version[edit]In May 2015, it was revealed that the Wii U version may not be released.[20] Studio boss Ian Bell said that the game's latest build was struggling to run smoothly on Nintendo's platform - at a 720p resolution with a framerate of 23fps, and revealed that they are not allowed to release a game that is running below 30fps, but ""finding that extra 25% frame time is currently looking impossible"".[21] He explained there is a possibility the game will be pushed for Nintendo's next console iteration ""Codename NX"", with Bell assuming the hardware will be revealed at E3 2015, basing his assumption on rumours[20] rather than following Nintendo's official confirmation that the hardware will not be revealed before 2016. On 21 July 2015, Slightly Mad Studios informed the Nintendo Life news outlet that the Wii U version had been cancelled, with Ian Bell citing at the end of the road the title was ""simply too much"" for the Wii U hardware to handle. The developer is still looking forward to Nintendo's next console iteration regardless.[22] Distribution partner Bandai Namco had since reaffirmed the cancellation.[23]Downloadable content[edit]The game is supported with both paid and free downloadable content upon release. Slightly Mad Studios confirmed that new cars will be added to the game every month after the game's release as free DLCs.[24][25] Project CARS was initially planned to follow the season-pass model[26] but plans for that were replaced with a system called ""On-Demand."" On-Demand was described as allowing a ""commitment to keeping Project CARS up-to-date with the greatest, freshest, and most critical content whilst also allowing players to pick and choose the cars & tracks they want - without being locked in to a pre-paid scheme.""[27] Three expansions, Ruapuna Track Expansion, Aston Martin Track Expansion, Classic Lotus Track Expansion, were released in 2015. All of which add new circuits and cars to the game.[28][29][30] The Japanese Car Pack, which adds five Japanese vehicles to the game, was released on October 29, 2015.[31] The Stanceworks Track Expansion for Project CARS, including Mad Mike's RADBUL, was released on PS4, Xbox One and Steam on Tuesday, January 26, 2016. [32]A Game of The Year Edition was released on 6 May, 2016, containing all the downloadable content, including two cars exclusive to this edition: The Pagani Huayra BC and the Pagani Zonda Revolución, along with an extra track: The Nürburgring Combined Nordschleife + GP circuit.Reception[edit]ReceptionAggregate scoresAggregator	ScoreGameRankings	PS4: 82.19%[33]XONE: 70.11%[34]PC: 82.20%[35]Metacritic	PS4: 83/100[36]XONE: 81/100[37]PC: 83/100[38]Review scoresPublication	ScoreDestructoid	7/10[39]EGM	7.0/10[40]Game Informer	8.5/10[41]GameSpot	8/10[42]GamesRadar	3.5/5[44]IGN	8.9/10[43]OXM	70%[44]PC Gamer (UK)	83/100[45]PC PowerPlay	70[46]Play	6/10[47]PlayStation Universe	8/10[48]National Post	8.0/10[49]Metro	8/10[50]Digital Spy	4/5[51]Shacknews	60%[52]NY Daily News	3/5[53]New Game Network	72%[54]GameCritics.com	6.5/10[55]Slant magazine	3/5[56]Project CARS was generally well received upon release. Game Informer said that ""The game joins a sim-racing field alongside already-established competitors like Gran Turismo and Forza, but it also does things its own way, challenging the ways of the past. Project Cars doesn't radically change the genre, but longtime enthusiasts should take heed of this new franchise.""[41] However, they pointed out that ""cars aren't the showpieces relative to other sim series – you don't collect, apply decals, or upgrade them."" One of their only criticisms were the graphics, which did not compare well against Driveclub, according to Di			"

												Compared to all the awful free key games I've played, this one is at least playable enough to finish it, so I can't really complain.			"

												I can see the image of this game but it's executed poorly.This game is good but there are a couple of glitches which can break your race.Example:If you go really fast you can go through the roadThe car can go really fast!I recommend it if you like a small game with some fun glitches.It's worth the price.

												Road Madness is a game that I can't really recommend unless youre game collector, its a waste of money, even being this cheap (there are more interesting and worth while cheap games tbh).Many bugsNo storyControls are awfulGraphics are hilariousVery Short (30m)The only good reason to actually buy and install this game, is if you go for the trading cards, to farm, sell or level up, there is no other reason i can think of.
