												I'm a big fan of driving games, whether it be GRID, Forza, Gran Turismo... you name it I've played it.Test Drive Unlimited 2 got a lot of bad ratings from companies, but they never understood what it was made for. It wasn't designed for racing, yeah it had a racing storyline on the side, but coming from TDU1, it was all about driving around a beautiful island with your friends calmly and enjoying the scenery.So if you are looking for a game where you drive to 3 million miles an hour crashing at every corner, go play need for speed. But if you're looking for that one game you actually enjoy doing nothing but driving around on... this is for you.Most underated driving game of all time.If I had to choose my most favorite driving game... this would be No. 1.ps. dont be fooled by the small amount of hours I have on steam, I have over 500 on my xbox.

												DO NOT BUY! IS NOW A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!1. Server is no longer operational2. Absolutely no support for new players3. Asks you to creat an atari account which is no longer supported and therefore impossible for new people.4. If running win10 it is a 50/50 chance you will be able to play it, if not then the only way to fix is a clean install of the OS and they may not work the first time. Please do not take this as me saying the game is bad. I have put around 1000+hrs in to the game on xbox and wanted to try and relive those memories on the PC. The game was superb, driving was a mixture of simulation/arcade style, leaning towards the simulation. Graphics were on point for the date of release. It was generally just an incredibly fun game that was totally original :) Now however, you are simply paying money for a product which wont work. Paid full price to find they don't even support the F**KING launcher!!			"

												This game was worth it, when I first bought it servers were running and there were a decent amound of people online, the game was quite fun, you could make your own paint jobs for your cars and upgrade them (small amount). The driving was sometimes annoying, but it was still a lot fun with the open world it had, you could buy appartmens, houses and with them came garages that you could, of coarse, fill up with thje many vehicles you could buy.Now, I cannot recommend anyone buying this game, you will most likely not be able to connect, but there are work arounds, there is a custom made launcher that will force launch the game without bothering with server connection.Well; I guess, since Valve has finally added a refund method, if you think the game seems fun, buy it, download it, attempt to get the custom launcher to work, and if you can play singleplayer without issues, then I say; Go for it; cause you know now, if you don't find enjoyment of the game in its current state, you can get a refund for it. (Just don't play for more than 30 minutes in total)			"

Tdu2 'a world in a game', a game that many people have called terrible, (maybe they need to try a bit more with happy face, maybe try more, persist, and learn it.)

If u get it all easily you appreciate it less, (and that's where cheats lose out cos they are diluting their game). It's best to be in no hurry to get there because you are already here, doing it.

Make new friends, keep the old. Much to discover on two islands. A very replayable game. Casino dlc pretty cool too. I do hope you will get into Tdu2 and I am here every day Steam forum so all is not lost if you are stuck, post to forum ask for helps, and i will try not to shout if I can't see your prob till u state it clear accurate details cos i can't see in til u describe it, goodluck, enjoy, call me :)The Tdu2 Creed.

Hurray! ---Atari broke my Steam Tdu2 last July 23rd 2013. no support atari said tell Steam, Steam said go tell Atari. So I had to buy it again, I now play in retail Tdu2, same game but play hours are not recorded.Tdu2 single player is [imho] 95% at super excellent; more after my word on multiplayer.TDU2 had its multiplayer peak in 2011 [2,000 average number of players online each day] and was excellent and seamless join from singleplay and support was good. Since then Atari went broke, sacked its Eden devs and try to maintain and code and 'update' it by themselves and they have failed  breaking much of the multi and have even broken some of the login process and Uplauncher. Support is not much after 3 years.  Many forum posts complain about not being able to get past the uplauncher into the multi game. If you do manage to set router firewall exceptions for port 8889 and 3478 [not so simple] then you will mostly get into multi ok and all will be good. Backup your Savegame every day.. that's Documents\Eden Games. Copy the whole folder, find a safe place on other drive, create a new folder, name it as e.g. 'May12-ellie-lev22' Open it, and Paste in there. Ok. Do that every day, make new folder each time with new name, e.g. 'May13-ellie....etc. after a week you have 7 backups of your Eden Games, you can delete the oldest one, you still got 6. My backup folder, if it gets more than 50 in it I delete a few, but I always keep the most recent 5.  If your Tdu2 gives error or crashes, go Documents, Cut the Eden Games folder, Paste it to Desktop, Open the recent backup folder you made, Copy  (not Cut) that Eden Games folder and Paste it in Documents. Run Uplauncher all good say Hurray for backup, delete that bad Eden from Desktop, go Play. If still fail ask for helps.Thanks for reading. Have fun! Thanks Atari Eden for creating Tdu2.			"

Thanks Atari. Clowns!Apart from that its a great game, but the wheel support is crappy. And the cars feel like you're driving on ice.			"

												A terribly flawed game. Graphics were dated, even upon release. The car handling is vague and unresponsive, even on hardcore mode. The story is awful. The character models and voice acting is even worse. The car list is diverse if you enjoy European cars, but terribly lacking for Japanese and American models. Buying cars can be a grinding task of repetition. Buying houses is worse. There are countless glitches. Online support ceased years ago.However, even will all it's flaws, I this is still one of my favorite games. The expansive roads of Ibiza AND Oahu are amazing. 2 massive islands that will takes you countless hours to explore. The maps are really the key gameplay elements. Once you adjust to the vague controls, there is a true sense of speed when cruising through the mountains, or beaches, or canyons, or through the city. Though games like Forza Horizon do offer a better overall experiance. TDU2 offers true driving freedom.  Even with the dated graphics, this game can be truely beautiful. With all the houses and cars on offer, this will give an avid car fan who needs to collect everything hours upon hours of fun.Ignore the garbage story, accept the dated graphics, adapt to the steering ambiguity, and you have one of the most fun sandbox driving games available.

												Truely one of the best games apart from some faults. It is know that this game wasn't tested properly before launch and atari even released some free DLC to compensate for that but the truth is that the AI is horrible, the police chase mode is dreadful and the god damn license tests annoying. What this game does good however is cruising with friends or alone. And it does it damn well. The cars are lovely, the graphics maybe a little outdated but not bad at all and the island large enough for hours of exploring and fun. If you're ooking for an actual racing simulator go elsewhere. This is more of an arcadish casual driving game. Personally i enjoy the off-roading the most. Going 250km/h in a beautiful Mercedes ML63 AMG on the dirt drifiting around a corner is fun.Do note that eden games (the creator of this game) is gone so theres no more support for it really. And the servers tend to go down at times. Great game, worth the money. Can't wait for a newer game like this.			"

Posted: April 8, 2014
												Hello and welcome to my review of the relatively old game Test Drive Unlimited 2.I am aware of the fact that the game was released in 2011, I've purchased it in 2013 and I will still review this title because the series are discontinued and I do still enjoy the game untill today.Now something about me regarding the racing genre on PC.I do not like racing games where you can race on a track, in a car which is almost unhandle-able ( in my opinion, ofcourse ).With these games I mean Grid, and partially Dirt.Okay, I did enjoy Dirt 3 and Dirt Showdown without a doubt but in the end, playing with a controller or a steering wheel, it didn't satisfy me enough to keep me playing these titles once in a week or more often.So now back to what I do enjoy in a game of the racing genre.I do really like the open-world idea, having a big map or several maps ( In Test Drive's case: Island ).Driving around without anything forcing you do to anything, making speed and just drive all across the island on various landscapes with a nice sight does satisfiy me.Buying a relaxing car, my Ferrari 458 Italia, Purple with black rims in this case: And just cruising around the island, on the roads with water to the right of me and the city to the left of me, hearing the engine doing it's work is what I like.Not being forced to drive a track, do a race and aiming on finishing first without anything else you can do.Just free-roaming in open worlds with customizable cars which you can upgrade and adjust to any specification you want.And that's for the driving part, now for the experience in terms of sound.The sound of the car, in various situations ( Driving in sand, dirt, or just a normal road ).The sound is different every time, for every car in any situations ( weather too for example ) is just perfect in the game and these small things help me enjoy the game more than I already did.Driving through a tunnel while It's raining in my custom white Nissan GT-R is what I can't do in any other game.And these elements of Test Drive is what makes me want to play the game, the endless options to tune and adjust cars to exactly how I'd like to and then going on the road, hearing the right sound and feeling good when playing the game .. Yeah, that;Now for the other part of the game:Missions, Money, Houses and avatar.Missions in Test Drive are tasks you have to complete which can be anything from getting a high adrenaline bar, but also could be driving above a certain speed and also opposite missions like driving really careful without the person next to you in the car getting sick.These missions are pretty fun for the first few times but become boring quick, but they reward you with money to buy cars, houses and clothing.Money in the game is pretty important ofcourse but I feel like you just have to keep grinding the repetitive missions to finally buy the car you have been wanting for a while.So yeah, the method of money making within the game is something I don't like and that made me want to Cheatengine myself a couple houndred million instead of working for the money I want to buy the car I'd like.Houses and Avatar: Besides the garage part to store your cars, I don't care about Houses or pimping your avatar ( Buying clothes, getting haircuts, etc ).So yup, the car driving part is what I like the most of the game.Okay, for some of you I might have not played the game in the right way, or not long enough but this was my final review of the game.If I had to give the game a score from 0 to 100 I would give it a 85, some aspects could've been done way better ( Money making and missions ) but the driving itself is what makes the game a good open-world cruising game, and pretty unique in it's genre.Okay okay, Grand Theft Auto is somewhat more bigger and to some also better but what I care about is the car driving.In Grand Theft Auto the car driving is only fun when stunting and such with your friends.So that's it for the review guys, I hope you have enjoyed reading my opinion about this game.

												Great game, game honestly gets boring after time but it keeps you occupied that is for sureOk what’s included in this review: Servers, Windows 10 Support!Servers; those of you who say the Servers are down:1. Check server status and the store News page in case there are any issues.No issues?- If you can find 0 issues then it is more than likely the ports are being blocked somewhere, it’s actually really easy to tell if the ports are being blocked! The launcher tells you this! If the ports are blocked the text above the loader bar will be in red; if it is in RED then please search up on Google on how to open TDU2 ports (Skill Level: Moderate), this should take you no longer than 10 minutes to do this TIP: try portforward.com they have a really handy tool that helps you get started.If you know the ports are open inside your router, it’s time you checked your firewalls! If you have windows firewall (as rubbish as it is) you need to allow the application access to the internet usually automatically prompts you to do this on first launch, secondly you need to free up the TDU’s ports as well.Ok when you launch the game the launcher will come up, if you still see the RED text then don’t worry it’s just a minor bug; all you need to do is close the launcher and re-open the game (this may take a few attempts) you are looking for GREEN text, if you have tried at least 10 times:Firstly restart your Router and your PC then revert to the above ^^ statement.Windows 10:Windows 10 at first load up appears that it does not support the game; It pops up with the readme.htm file telling you that the game is not supported, however there is a way around this! First of all close the game.-- Those of you who do not know what Troubleshooting compatibility is, search up for some helpful tips on Google! :) –- Yes you guessed it! You are going to be using Compatibility to get the game working, note: you only need to do this once!Firstly: goto your game library, locate TDU2, right click the game and select Properties, goto the Local files tab, click Browse local filesSecondly: Locate these 2 files: TestDrive2.exe and UpLauncher.exe. Right-click each one separately, click on “Troubleshoot Compatibility”, click “Troubleshoot program”, check “The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won’t install or run now” -> click next, Select Windows 8 -> click Next, click “Test the program...” (needed to save the new settings) -> close the app after it opens -> Click next, click “Yes, save the settings for this program” -> Click “Close”. Repeat this for the other “EXE”, now you are done! Re-launch the game normally from steam and have fun!Please rate my comment up if this helped you :)*edit: noticed the link I provided was erm? wrong? oops, sorted :D			"

												Edit : People reported having more issues on key validation/connection than usual!TDU2 is a fine racing game, there is a great amount of vehicles and stunning visuals set on Hawaii and Ibiza, shops to explore, items to buy, reputation to earn and it has somehow a social-racing experience. Singleplayer quickly puts you up to task, teaching you how the system works: get licenses, complete races, get cars, customize cars, complete championships, buy houses, buy furniture, get bigger garages and then buy more cars. The map is huge, its fun to explore, Hell!, its fun to just pick a random car and drive around the island, for some it's even therapy and it works just fine!...at least the singleplayer.Multiplayer mode is not so multiplayer, constant connection problems logs you out of the game, some players might have their cars shaking on your screen due to connection issues, and 'clubs' which are the ""guilds"" in this racing game, as mostly not used by anyone, believe me... I've tried.After learning not to mind the bad physic system and buying an Xbox Controller so I could play it not so terribly, I find myself enjoying this game very much, there is even a chasing mode which reminded me of the old need for speed games.Once again, It's a fine game, despite its flaws, I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited 2 for any racing games lover.tl;dr+ Great amount of vehicles+ Huge map, fun to explore+ Immserive Atmosphere+ Plenty of things to do- Bikes are DLC only- Connection and launcher problems- Driving physics feel clumsy- Menus for social interactions are not user-friendly			"

												i really wanted to write a review about this much earlier... but i got so hooked on this game that i have to do that now.first of all, i read many of the reviews before i finally bought this game, many people complained about that its too unrealistic.well, its in fact not a racing simulator, nor a driving simulator, and its hard for me to find a correct description for it.the car handling is a bit like at ""grand theft auto"", or the older ""need for speed"" games.just imagine two giant gaming worlds, filled with streets, offroad tracks and a beautiful landscape, detailed cities and viliages, where you can drive 100% freely, without any pressure.all original licensed cars and motorbikes, , no fantasy vehicles!you can go to different driving schools,  learn to handle normal street cars, supersport cars, offroad cars or oldtimers, step by step, afterwards you can participate in races in those vehicle classes.you can provoke the police for car chases.if youre not a fan of this, doesnt matter, you can also just buy vehicles, drive around, for HOURS over hours, discover many awesome places. you can discover hidden treasures, in form of special cars, you can buy houses and decorate them, buy clothes for your avatar, change it's hair and body,  you can paint, wash, tune your cars and bikes... you can crash into other cars, see them lose control :D(the game has a nice,COSMETIC car damage modelling. a damaged car looks bad, but there is no handling change!)you can drive online together with friends or many other people, invite them to cruise around, to races, or create car clubs with them, or just goof along with your cars.as additional feature there is also a casino where you can play poker or roulette against other human players, or alone at the slotmachine.what did i forget? probably a lot, since the game offers such an incredible range of features...best for me are the little niceties, like the possibility to open and close the roof of your cabriolet, to open and close the car door windows, to switch on/off the indicators, that the radio adjusts the volume while the navigation system gives instructions... some other things that might be good to know: the graphics look fine, the sounds are good, the voiceacting is moderate, there is not much of a story, there are two in car radiostations 1.rock and 2. a mixxed playist of hiphop/trance/house/pop/rock, you can chat with other people easily.bad things: -i lost the connection a few times, sometimes i can just rejoin my friends, other times i have to close and start the game again to make it working.  -sometimes the online servers are completly down, (but you can still play in offline mode!)- there are many different ai driven vehicles, but no npcs walking on the streets-the AI is not that smart.last but not least: ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A GAMEPAD/CONTROLLER FOR THIS! keyboard is possible, but not really fun, in my eyes.really sad that i havent tried this game much earlier already, its fantastic and really addicting.its a 100% must buy, even if youre like me, not a big racing fan at all.

												As my car hurtles over the tallest cliff in Hawaii, I take one last look in the rear-view mirror. How did it come to this? For the longest time I was just another loser, content with a mundane life and those brief moments of escapism. Somehow over the course of nearly 30 hours in Test Drive Unlimited 2, I became a monster. Sometimes when people play videogames, it's to get away, like a virtual vacation. But there are those times, where I don't want to be a plumber, a rodent with an attitude, a criminal, or Laura Bailey. I just want to drive around in expensive automobiles. In the real world I own two cars, one of them has a busted alternator. The other? No brakes. Despite being unable to start or stop, I've maintained the same driving job for the past decade. I'm always driving through the same neighborhoods meeting the same people every moment of every day. On top of all that, if Florida is considered America's♥♥♥♥♥♥ then I live in one of its hemorrhoids. But hey, all I need is an hour or two a day of wonderfully escapist adventures and I'm golden.I was a fan of Test Drive Unlimited 1 on the Xbox 360. The handling wasn't particularly good, but the atmosphere and sense of exploration was excellent. With a few fixes, better graphics, and more content, it could be my ideal driving game. I'm not sure what I was expecting with the sequel. I read all of the reviews, noted that there are major problems such as Securom, dysfunctional servers, and so on. I considered the possibility that this game might not even work. But I gave it a shot anyway......I'm at a party...alright..cool I guess. Apparently I'm a woman now. It's just like Skyrim except I'm wearing clothes and I don't think I have a six-foot-long p-.""PepsimanVsJoe! Enjoying your birthday party?""Oh It's my birthday? I had no idea. Apparently I'm a silent-protagonist so all I can do is smile.""Come check out your gift! It's a brand new car!""No way! This is one of those end-game vehicles. I must be dreaming. This is so totally meta.Sure enough the real game begins, I lose my job, only to get an offer to join a racing group for some show called Solar Crown. This is so ridiculous. I head to the used car dealer for my first actual virtual vehicle. ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥"" I say to myself.The dealer? He has small hands. The driving school instructor? A regular Alex Smith. It's no wonder none of them have gone for a handshake, it would be like if I held up my finger so a baby could grab it. After sleep-driving through my first test I say ""Thank you very much."" to the instructor. Apparently I'm a very-thankful-and-not-quite-silent protagonist. The only words I ever say are to express gratitude. On the road, the handling is...well it's about as bad as TDU1. In my mind that's good enough, because I'm finally living the dream again, cruising through hundreds of miles of beautiful Ibiza, and eventually Hawaii. As with the previous game, everyone needs help getting around the islands. There's the drunk guy who wants me to speed, the sick girls that throw up if I slam on the brakes, the random woman who always calls me adorable, and...wait a minute. It's happening again isn't it? The same people, requesting me to do the same favors for them over and over. Don't they have anything to say? While I'm driving we could discuss those bonus features on DVDs, or what tiny-handed men are good for aside from making origami birds out of starburst wrappers. Instead it's always ""I'm going to be late!"" or ""I just broke a nail"" or ""Whoa ho! Look at that speed!""The people I compete with are slightly more developed, but it's also a facade. Miami Harris is little more than an untimely Paris Hilton joke. Then there's the Wilder brothers. Oh look at us! We're so extreme...ly shallow! Tess Wintory never figures out her daddy issues. Her dad Stuart is just a useless old prick. If I'm expected to race against these jerks all the time, at least a little effort could have been expended to develop them. But who am I to talk? I have the least character development of all. Oh sure, I've bought several houses, over a dozen cars, and a couple wardrobes. I've also gotten plastic surgery so many times I've forgotten what I originally looked like. In fact I just got some work done earlier today. The nose wasn't right.Aside from a few minor changes and additions, TDU2 isn't really much of a sequel. In some ways it's even a step back. Motorcycles are locked behind a DLC wall. The races are organized in a Grand Prix setup, with the winner being the person who attains the most points. However that model is dumped for the major championships races because....???? It doesn't make any sense. A casino would have been nice to hang out at, but that's also DLC. All of the other additions seem to be multiplayer-centric, which is pointless when half the people that buy this game can't even get it to work.But does any of that truly matter to me? I got what I wanted right? My virtual fantasy of owning expensive cars, several houses (that I can't interact with), and free reign over a beautiful...but lifeless island. Lifeless except for the same 12-15 idiots who sit around impotently while I drive them around or beat them to the ground in the championships. Nearly 30 hours of this dream has become a nightmare, and I suspect that it won't end anytime soon.So where we did leave off? Oh right...I was hurtling over the tallest cliff in Hawaii. Yes, I'm throwing it all away. Soon it will all be-I hit the rocks, then the water...suddenly I'm back on the road again...my car is a little scratched but it isn't even wet. I knew it wouldn't work anyway, but can you blame me for trying? It's that time again. I remove the bandages from my last trip under the knife and check the rear-view mirror. The nose still isn't right.			"

I can't even do that as it tells me my password isn't long enough despite being 12 characters long and a mix of alphanumeric characters.When trying to load the game up it then brings up an Atari client which then proceeds to download another 1Gb of data.When the play button is finaly highlighted the damn thing crashes. The game doesn't even start. This isa complete rip off and I won't go near anything by Atari ever again. I should be given a refund for a product that does not work!			"

												+ Quality of music selection was decent, and complemented the game's atmosphere+ You can play around with your vehicles' accessories, such as deployable roofs, turn signals, and windows; not at all functional, but it is the little attention to detail that I appreciate+ Fast travel is available for discovered points of interest, stripping away some of the monotony of driving from waypoint to waypoint+ Healthy variation in biomes and terrain types+ Absolutely massive traversible maps (Even better when you unlock Hawaii)+ Reasonable variety of cars available in-game, and your choice of starter vehicles can actually remain viable alternatives for much of the early-mid game+ Off-road tracks are some of the most fun in the game, and could be very creative in design and technical challenge+ Funds are not too hard to come-by, reducing chances you will get bogged down and find yourself in a rut+ Cars, character, and homes are shockingly customizable+ Social aspects are both well-implemented and go a long way to improving potential replay value; being able to drive up to other players in real-time and challenge them to a race by flashing my headlights is a lot of fun, and I felt that it really added to the experience+ Licenses are required to unlock different types of races and challenges; this expanded a feeling of progression- Some of the requirements for leveling up are not adequately explained- Despite the quality of many (not all) of the songs, the overall soundtrack is severely limited; there are only two available radio stations, and they cycle between, perhaps, 14 total tracks- NPC drivers boast fairly awful AI, and prove far too easy to overcome- Occasional, disappointing framerate stutters and other visual bugs that I had expected to be ironed out- Invasive, time-consuming, unnecessary DRM; requires additional downloads and the creation of a third-party account (hosted on a poorly designed and barely function Web site, no less)- Character animations, models, and voice-acting are rock-bottom abysmal- Some game progress (such as requirements found under the 'social' category) requires getting large numbers of human-controlled players on your friends list and in-game, playing with you; simply put, however, this game doesn't appear to boast the player population to warrant this, and it will make these hurdles difficult to overcomeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												I've poured a significant chunk of time into this game, and as far as I can tell, it was all a bit of a waste.This game appears, from the screenshots and trailer, to be a relatively straightforward driving sim, with an ambitious goal of giving you hundreds of kilometers of road to drive on, and loads of cars. It certainly delivers on giving you a beautiful and detailed set of cars (There's geometry in the stitched leather of my Alfa Romeo's dashboard, for goodness' sake!), and an enormous amount of road to play with them on.Unfortunately, it suffers in a few fairly glaring areas.Area 1: Voice ""Acting""There is a serious problem with the way the voice actors were either directed or hired, as the voice acting cannot be more irritating, repetitive and off-key. The dialogue is pretty awful, and the ""story"" which attempts to make an excuse for you entering loads of ""championships"" consisting of the same eight or so opponents would have been better off dropped from the game.(Additionally, if you don't play with a male character, prepare to be perpetually misgendered as they only recorded dialogue using masculine pronouns.)Area 2: DLC HellThe game is littered with ""DLC"" cars which you can gawk at in full detail, get in, and test drive, but which, as far as I can tell, cost Atari Points to unlock the privilege of purchasing with in-game currency. Good work guys.Also, about 40% of the customisation options for your character, houses and vehicles are literally unrelated Atari logos and trademarks. What a load of crap.Area 3: PhysicsI wouldn't call myself an expert in car handling or physics, I don't have real-life racing experience, the closest I could say I've come is playing a reasonable amount of Gran Turismo, and driving a fairly mundane vehicle around city streets IRL, but to call the physics in Test Drive Unlimited 2 uninviting would be an understatement.So yes, I'm expecting some oversteer and some understeer, maybe if I turn driving aids off I'm expecting to have to pay a little more attention to how I accelerate and steer. Fine.But don't make a game where the vehicle's reaction to the road seems to be dependent on my camera position. Cars have literally flipped backwards after a crest when in cockpit camera, but don't do so from behind. I can only assume that it puts priority on physics objects which are in your view? Makes no damned sense.Likewise, cars feel very detached from the road. There's a definite difference in grip between bitumen and grass, which is fair enough, but cars still slide (forwards) on the tarmac. There's also a ""bonus"" system for ""drifting"", though ""drifting"" doesn't appear to actually be possible due to the game's physics setup. I gave up on that mechanic.Area 4: AIWhen in a time trial style event, with just your vehicle on the track, the time to beat is just barely attainable if you make 0 mistakes, and pretty much impossible if you mess up even once.Meanwhile, in a race with multiple vehicles on the road, your opponents drive like your grandmother going to pick up groceries. They weave in and out of corners in a perfect row with no apparent intent to win. If you do get ahead of them, you can simply slow down in front of them, they won't attempt to overtake and break their racing line at all. Completely stupid. If you're going to ask me to win races, at least make it a challenge rather than wasting my time like this.ConclusionFriends don't let friends buy Atari products.How I Played* Female Character* Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller with genuine Microsoft controller adaptor* @1920x1200 on a GTX260 (Earlier)* @2560x1440 on a GTX670* Did not purchase any offered DLC* Attempted to use the Unofficial Patch, but unpacking negatively affected ongoing game performance			"

												I have played over 500 hours on this game on the 360 and i dont regret any of those hours, as this is my favourite game ever made, but dont get me wrong, there are some downsides to it.Lets jump straight into the pros and cons. Pros:1: Extensive and engaging storyline.2: Very good soical racer in its time.3: Lots of things to do after you have completed the storyline, with friends or without friends. 4: An insane amount of cars.5: An installable ""Unoffical Patch"" that grants you even more cars.6: MASSIVE open world all there for the taking7: In its time it had a great community. Cons: 1: Impossible for new players, as registering an account is very difficult, and if you are on windows 10, theres a 50/50 chance you will or will not be able to play. 2: Atari and Eden games were dead many years ago, so dont expect any new updates or customer support. 3: No email verification, so if you forget your password, your save data and your entire account are done for. 4: Some glitches and bugs that can be frustrating, but do not happen very often. 5: Pretty hefty price tag for a game that is this old and may or may not work. 6: Graphics are very outdated, but that is to be expected from a early 2011 game. 7: Servers that are practically dead, in my past few days of playing i have not found one online player, which is very frustrating in my opinion. Sugguestions to beat the cons:1: DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS 10, and research on a way to make an account, im sure there is a way.  2: Install the unoffical patch, as this grants many new cars to play around with. 3: Write your password down. 4: If these glitches do happen, for example hitting a stop sign in some areas will flip your car, do not get frustrated! You can always dodge or overcome these glitches. 5: Buy this game when it is on sale. It goes down to around 4.99 USD occaisonally.6: Not really a fix for this one, but maybe there is some kind of mod out there that can give you a better graphics experience. 7: Find some friends that are playing! Post in the community discussions and look for people that are already playing the game. Overall, this is my favourite game ever made. If one day i become a billionare, i am going to buy out atari and eden games and make a tdu3. Thanks for reading and i hope this helped you make your decision on whether to buy the game or not.			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 is no doubt single handedly one of the most action packed racing games of all time.TDU 2 has forever been one of my most favourite games, and is no doubt the best racing game in my eyes, with the game allowing the player to own a House / Apartment / Yacht, giving you the option to customize depending on the price. Giving the player the right to have their own personal racer in which they are also able to customize almost every part of the entity, skin colour, clothes, looks etc. Giving the player the ability to switch between two islands giving the player a massive open world to have fun with friends. However, this game does have its flaws.The biggest flaw is the games servers, soemtimes they may be down, in which this happening can prevent the player from doing certain things, such as: Taking a picture of your virtual character and posting it so everybody can see what your character looks like. Restrict you from playing online even though you are connected to a internet connection. Stop you from entering clubs. etc.Although even though this games may have it's flaws, it will always go down as one of the most epic racing games of all time, and I don't think that anybody is able to disagree with me on that one.

												Despite how badly they ♥♥♥♥ed the physics in this game, and how cheesy the acting and all that is with the whole Solar Crown story line (I mean WTF really), I actually really enjoy this game and still play it religiously thanks to modders who created the Unoffical Patch and also the new AutoPack mods + Dreampack. Without these this game would have died for me long ago. There is nothing quite like jumping in any one of a big lineup of lovely motor vehicles and cruising around to your own content. As much fiddling as it is to set up, I'd recommened you only play this with a wheel, other NFS would be more your speed. Police chases in this game are not fun.			"

												TDU2. I'll Just get to the point and use the pro/con format. At the end I'll make observations and make an summation.Pros. 1. Attention to detail was given to layout* and overall very detailed citys and villages including ancient ruins with no purpose but as a nice touch. 2. Behavior of npc opponents during races  created challenge. 3. A large selection of vechicles was available. 4. RPG features such as clothing/car appearence and preformance/housing/player alteration was abundant. 5. Basic driving fundamentals (driving schools) available and mandatory to advance. Cons. 1. Layout* and NPC behavior. While driving around ""most"" any curve while offroad at moderately high speed and you want to get sideways a bit? Rest assured that your entrance and exit of the curve has been carefully calculated and a tree has been placed at the exact center of your exit position and sometimes 2 to catch you just in case you swerve away from the first. Want to cut corners where you wish? No. You'll find carefully placed trees at most curves. Think you're clearing that tree? Nope. Suddenly you've rammed that tree head on exactly centered by your vechicle. You'll cut corners where you're allowed to and only in matches where they're obvious to the player. 2. NPC driving behavior.  While driving an 4 lane highway your forced to drive on the shoulder because as you approach 2 npc vechicles one will speed to tandem with the other closing an opening that you saw from a distance. Also say you're in an eight lane highway and want to open up the throttle? No. If any vechicle exists in the road ahead it will change lanes to be in yours.  Its 2 am in the middle of nowhere and you get a lead foot?  Vechicles will pop into existence before your very eyes in both lanes.Approaching an intersection at high speed? cars will race to block sometimes intersecting and crashing while you're attempting to navigate. Driving through the mountains? And approaching a curve?  NPC vechicles will pop into existance race to the curve to beat you there then slow down to 20 mph entering the curve. You want to pass on a curve but dont want to use the shoulder? Consider that all curves are completely blind to you and that an NPC vechicle will pop into existance in the opposing lane as you pass. Want to get close to the vechicle in front of you to get a good passing position? It will slam on the brakes. 2. Graphics.  Microstuttering, visible jerking, tearing of the world ahead. Also textures blinking in and out of existence on NPC vechicles. And no its not my computer. It can handle Planetside 2 at 60 fps no problem.3. NPC while out of vechicles look worse than any in half-life 2 ever did.4. Voice acting that that never varies and grates the nerves.5. Want to use a keyboard to navigate? Hehe.6. Getting some progress in the game? Nope your save game in corrupted.7. Want to play online? Ha ha...8. Need support? (see above)9. Waiting for an update. (see above X2)10.  Want a certain car? Tough luck, its DLC.While fun can be had it seems engineered to annoy the player enough to quit playing while making a DLC purchase at the same exact moment.			"

												TDU2 has two very major and unsolvable problems:1. The physics are just terrible. This is not even a matter for debate- check any review from when this was released. Regardless of of car class or cost, the cars handle poorly in general and have an unreasonable tendency to easily spin out of control even on dry roads.2. Server Authentication. TDU2 has 'online' and 'offline' player profiles- think Diablo 2 with offline and Battle.net characters. These are completely separate saves and you cannot transfer progression from one to the other. The problem is, the Online Servers are constantly down for PC, meaning you cannot use your Online profile. Not only that, but around 25% of the game's content is only available with an Online profile. This is really a dealbreaker.			"

												Well what makes me come back to this game time and again? Interesting story... no, great driving physics...no, interesting characters.. dont let me start on that, voice acting?.. you could say that if you were entertained by the repeating announcement that apparently the Wilder brother are squabbling with Stewart again (who-tf is Stewart I can only guess). However this game has something. You have you car and the freedom to travel around two islands full of nice sights and sunny vistas. You can drive for hours, buy cars, houses or just explore at your leasure.  You can challenge other people whos worlds seamlesly intersect with yours like in Dark Souls. Or you can explore the world without invisible bounds around the roads, a bit like Skyrim in Cars. But even if you stop, the environment doesn't look as generic as for example in Need for Speed or Driver series, so you are really motivated to visit new places.The graphics are great, there is a weather and day/night cycle. The views you get out of some of your Flats/Houses are amasing. The challenges a varied and exciting. There are also a pair of races around the Island, that can take nearly a real-world hour to complete. I mean if I think about it a bit more, this game is the opposite of what I really don't like about other racing games whith dumb driving on the same track over and over again with an extreme example being american Nascar where you just drive in a circle.Sure the characters look like dorks and sound even worse, but then you see the attention do detail the developers put into the game and it's amazing.  Just try to explore the starting location. You will not see it any more after the first minute or so in-game but the effort put into it speaks for itself. If you take your time and look around at the nicely textured babes, whose breast actually bounce around a bit (in a racing game!), the bar with actually some bottles stuffed behind the counter, then you really get into this holiday Ibiza mood. Did I mention  I really appreciate that detail? There are also many cars each with detailed interior, which you can admire.This game however is not without its (many) problems, to name a few:- the characters are just plain silly and the story even more so- you have to set the controls just so, or the driving experience will be awfull- the driving physics could be much better (I miss dirt 2)- there are no pedestrians (to drive over :)  ) anywhere!- the developer is not in business any moreWell thats my 2c, you can get this game really cheap for less tha $10 on steamtrades, so if you just like to drive around, explore and do an occasional race, this is a game for you!P.S. The Characters in this game are ridiculous and remind me of mega shark vs giant octopus movie. They either creep you out, like the same guy you pick at 2 am in car who is ""late for his meeting"" or make you laugh hystericly because their dialogs dont correspond with the situation at hand.Also I think this game in not effectively playable with a keyboard. There are some challenges, you have to complete for a Driving License with a ridiculously volatile car named Dodge Viper, where accelerating a bit too much or steering to far will make it spin uncontrollably.

												In my opinion, it's one of the best racing games out there. It perfectly combines concepts of racing with open-world style games.+ very nice graphics for a 2011 game+ huge open-world, maybe a bit too huge if you want to hit that 100% road discovery+ many extra stuff on top of actual racing (like car-wrecks, photo-locations, a bit of tuning, avatar customization, and much more)+ car control is awesome using a keyboard- all multiplayer races/features are unavailable, so it's single player only- some bugs here-and-there, but nothing too scary- given its age (6 years) and multiplayer unavailablity, asking 20 euros for it (at the time I'm writing this) is a bit too much.

												This is my first game review on Steam. TDU2 is my favourite open world driving game, it's not just about racing. It's like a luxury lifestyle sim, it's incredible and there's no other car game like this! It does lack proper driving physics and bad servers but mainly a positive game. I do sometimes have problems launching the Steam version of this game after clicking Play but at least my retail one works well. Been having NAT issues recently which is another negative. Also hope the servers will stay up for longer. Still enjoy TDU2 though, Logitech G27 Racing Wheel works great with the game and playing online is of course more fun but offline isn't bad either. Old is gold!			"

												I can't really recommend this game nor I can say it's bad.Atari is the worst thing happened to this game but it's so good I just can't press that ""Dislike"" button.I may have played only 79+ hours but this game is amazing. All the time I had with my buddies meeting up in middle of Hawaii and driving around, doing stunts and just having fun. Me with my Audi R8, which I still absolutely love, others with Nissan GT-R, Bikes etc. It was one of the greatest times I have ever had in games. Ever. Speeding through the city with 355km/h while others trying to catch you or the other way. Drifting, random races with other players. This game is AMAZING. Too bad Atari is killing it. It's really a shame. I just lost my profile because I installed Windows 10(clean install) and as it turns out Atari doesn't save your info on their servers but I don't even mind it because this game is THIS fun. Anyway, if you EVER decide to buy this game make sure you are patient, either Atari is going to fix their mistake or someone will, for sure, make private server and we'll race again.			"

												Why get this buggy, never to be updated driving game you may wonder. This is why I say yes in a simplistic -List.Pros-Variety of cars/bikes from Mustangs to Ferrari to Harley Davidson.-Decent Graphics for a driving game of its nature.-RPG Elements. Houses you can customize, a comprehendable profile system, Club Houses, clothes and more.-Two Very Big and good looking Islands with plenty of roads and things to discover.(On that note)-More things to do than just drive against ai. Integrated SP and MP for those who like MP. Public Challenges, Clubs, car wrecks  you can salvage. photo missions, Casino if you get the dlc, decent player interaction, are just a few of the things.-Easy to progress and somewhat ok support for wheels, controllers etc. (Friends XboX 1 Controller Works with this for example)Cons-No developer to update anymore-Registering on the game website and getting Atari Tokes for DLC can be a pain-Glitches and Speed Hackers-From what I hear unstable servers(Never Experinced Myself)-Confusing Police-Some graphical bugs for some(Pink Skid Marks for example)-And a few minor other things that bugs me but does not stop the flow of this gameAll In All I highly enjoy this game and suggest everyone at leasts watches some videos of this game on youtube and go with the open mind that people can exagerate problems (Pro or Con) and give this game a chance. You more than likely  will not regret it. As for comparisons to The Crew. Even though this games developers are included they are 2 Different games and I will play both in the future. If your still skeptical, wait for a steam sale, game gets decently cheap. Happy driving! See you on the street!			"

												I sat through the game for 5.6 hrs, in the first sitting. And to all the Negitive reviews saying the servers are down, there not. i drove past tons of people. one person even challenged me to a race.It also launches fine on Windows 10 for me, tons of realistic cars (the ones u get in real life lol) steering took some time to get used to, but changing to ""sport"" physics seem to help quite a bit. However, i would not recommend with a keyboard and mouse controlls. (feels weird).I use my PS4 controller with DS4 to emulate a Xbox 360 controller. Game has support for other controllers as well.http://ds4windows.com/ - This is for the Windows Ver. of DS4.

 - Tutorial i followed for DS4. (This is actually quite an old vid, DS4 has been updated since then.

How you can interact with the cars, etc.best 5.6 hrs of my Gaming Life, More Review will come when I progress further into the game ^, Reason being you can not get to the 2nd island (Hawaii) without completing Ibizia first. My system isent powerful at all (AMD athlon || X4, Radeon HD 5670, 3 gigs of ddr3) works like a dream on all medium settings 1600 x 900.I currently would give this game solid 10/10.			"

												Though this game is old ( 2011 ) then it is absolutely amazing and beautifull. You get two huge islands to drive on from a-b and race allot of races to earn fame money and glory. You first advance to the new island once you won some races and unlocked it, and the second island is much larger than the first, and if I remember correctly it is the island from test drive unlimited 1.. but very cool and beautifull map.As game progesses you can buy houses and new tons of new cars, and yes you can even go to the casino and play if you feel like it.There is an option when you start the game to play in either offline or online mode.. I highly recommend to drive in the online mode since more options in the game will be avaliable.You can also always just avoid races with other people if you do not like to do so and still play the ""single player"" campaign while in the online mode.( I mostly played the non steam version and have completed the game several times over 100+ houres, bought it on steam on sale but have not played it much since then).

												It is a must buy!Well after 150 hours this game is still fun and enjoyable. If you can get past the bugs, hackers and strange physics you too can enjoy this fantastic open world driving experience. The near GPS perfect mapped roads of Hawaii and Ibiza mean there is plenty of places to drive and explore. The variety of cars is not to bad either. I it is a real shame the studio who made this game went bankrupt but at least the online servers still for now, although that means there is no chance of getting an official patch for this game now. If the physics, graphics or selection of cars is not to your liking then you can easily mod it to suit your needs, just whatever you do play OFFLINE! I personally enjoy just driving about the place with friends or other who I meet in game so have chosen to remove the mods.So if the price is too high for you liking then buy it in a sale, you won't be disappointed if you can look past the points I have mentioned.

You are stuck in an endless loop of error messages saying the servers are down.Can't even play single player without Atari's servers being up.  I wanted to come back and play the game again but I guess they gave up supporting it a couple years after release.  Would be nice if they released a patch so it could still be played in single player without needed the servers online.Defnitly do not buy the game currently as it is a complete waste of money since you can't play it at all.

												TLDR; Multiplayer DOES still function (for me anyway), Meh car handling, decent variety of cars, nice visuals, awful story & voice acting and 2 very large maps (takes about an hour to drive around them). 7 out of 10, ONLY BUY WHEN ON SALE FOR 75% OFFTest Drive Unlimited 2 is an open world driving game with a heavy emphasis on the ""super car"" lifestyle; collecting cars, houses and clothes and various other material possesions. There is a story but its so badly written and voice acted, you wont miss anything interesting if you choose to skip the cutscenes, it's just a weak excuse to have races across Ibiza and Hawaii. The actual racing itself is fairly arcadey, cars drift easily and generally don't have much feeling of weight but some simulation-ness is still present, of you mash the accelerator while drifting and you have the driving aids turned off you'll just spin out. The AI is fairly dumb in the early game, but it can get vaugely difficult when you're getting into the mid to late game. I can't speak about the multiplayer gameplay, but let it be known that IT DOES STILL WORK, just not that well and the multiplayer is on a ticking time bomb of whenever Atari decides to shut down support.Overall this game is worth a try if it's on sale and you like cars and you if can bully some friends to get it as well, you can get a fair bit of play time out of it.

												I've never played such a great racing game as tdu2. The physics aren't in arcade style like nfs games, and also not simulation, it is somewhere between. Every car handles different. There are more than 100 different vehicles (including dlc) and 3 dlc motorbikes. But tdu2 is not only racing game. You can explore 2 beautiful islands with hundreds of roads, socialize with friends and also visit a casino (dlc).

 Good Start , Bad End The game was released in 2011. I absolutley loved TDU1 ,so i decided to buy this one. At the start i was amazed.The Graphics , The Gameplay , The 2 Maps. Everything was great except my PC. Which could run the game with only 45 fps...The game started its lifetime very well. It had alot of cars, Great multiplayer/online , casino , appartments , garrages and all the stuff that one good open world racing game needs. 1 Year after release they announced  The Bike DLC . I was so excited about it. It came out and it was good. The problem was , that u had to buy every bike individually. On that time the multiplayer was working , singleplayer was great and everything was done well for this game so far. But then the problems came. Gameplay/AI The Gameplay/AI had few problems:  Driving Licenses , Cops and Controlls.   Driving License: The problem is that some of the challenges , are too hard to complete or even impossible for some players. Without Driver License u cant progress through the higher rank races.   Cops: Just like the Driver License , here with the cops ... its too hard to outrun them. I like challenges , but for some players this is hell. They are always stoped by the cops , no matter what they do.  Controlls: For the players with wheels this is not a problem. But for players who use keyboard its really hard to drive. In TDU1 was better optimized to drive with keyboard.  Community  Just like the most of the games , they have good community base behind them. There was great  Mods  released by the community moders. It added more cars , skins and everything that one mod can add to the game. But then some ""Bad Modders"" decided to ruin the fun for the most of the players. From this moment ...  The problems started  Late Multiplayer Problems and Site Problems/Closed Studio However , after the good start with the DLC's and Multiplayer , the problems kicked in.  ""The Bad Modders""  developed hacks. That ruined the multiplayer pretty much. For example u are driving Bugatti Veyron with 400 km/h and some guy with subaru drives by u with 500 km/h. It impossible.  Even after that , players were still playing the game.  However in 2014 the site was broken. New players couldn't register their accounts , so they couldn't even play the multiplayer. The multiplayer servers were down every week. It was unplayable. In later 2015 , Atari announced they are quiting TDU Studio. That was the end of TDU.  Overall  I dont recommend this game , even on sale. Its just not worth it. So many problems and bad gameplay. The only good  thing left from this game is the singleplayer mods. Developers did nothing , to even try to fix their game from the hackers.3/10 Not recommended NOTE: The servers may be still working , but its not worth it. U will get only bad server connection and u wont get any new content. Buy at your own risk.  "

												What to know about this game:- It's open world, and it's massive.- Feels like an MMORPG with cars.- Customizable characters, tune cars, create decals, discover locations, find hidden stuff, buy houses, etc.- Very immersive for people who like to cruise around in different cars and enjoy the scenery on the islands.- Freezes on Windows 10, how beautiful.Okay, this game runs flawlessly on Windows 7, no issues. I upgraded to Windows 10 a few weeks ago and tried playing this again with Nvidia surround everything on high at 5760x1080, it ran and eventually froze up after like 5 minutes. So I alt-tabbed and that did nothing, I had to hit ctrl-alt-delete and select task manager and I tried closing the TDU2 app, did nothing, tried bringing up the task manager, nothing. I actually had to sign out back to the login screen of Windows to stop the game and then log back in. So I followed some threads on here and tried lowering my settings and even ran the game at 1280x720, plays the game for about an hour and then freezes. I even turned on Nvidia adaptive V-Sync as recommended by others, and still nothing :DMy level of pisstocity at this point is through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ roof since this is literally one of my favorite racing games and now I can't even play the damn game because of this ""supposedly superb"" operating system. Windows 10 my ♥♥♥. This isn't the only game that acts up either, there are others. It's sad that I have to revert to the painful performance of the PS3 to play a game that I already paid for here on Steam. Yeah I know the game is ancient, but that doesn't justify the bs freezing going on. It would be nice if somebody made a fix for this game to run on Windows 10 without freezing / crashing, but I know it will never happen. With that being said, since I see it happening to a good number of people.... why even sell the game if it doesn't work?Insta-thumbs down. Such a shame because it's such an awesome game, but now it won't run for sht.Don't like the thumbs down?? Here's a band-aid.(funny thing is, I shouldn't be hating the game, but the operating system it's running on)*EDIT* 7/28/2016Come to find out it is because of an update built into Windows 10 named KB3086255 which disables Securom and Safedisc or whatever it's called, which is something that a lot of older games and physical discs used. They disabled it because apparently it can be used as a backdoor for hackers, etc. So the only way to get this game to work is to find a way to disable that, which would possibly leave your PC vulnerable, or dual boot Windows 7 to play this game on (AND AVOID THE KB3086255 UPDATE, which is still a risk I guess). I tested the game on Windows 7 again for more than 2 hours and the game ran completely fine, no problems, Nvidia Surround 5760x1080, everything on High, no freezing, no crashing, nothing. For all the ones out there who are having these issues, I hope I saved you a ton of headaches. Still a thumbs down though lol			"

												One of the greatest driving games, that sadly you may never play. I have owned this game a little over 3 weeks and have made/met 18 of the coolest friends in that short time plus an absolute bucket load of friends using the retail version. I'll cut to the bad news first. Firstly you have to make an account at http://www.testdriveunlimited2.com to be able to play this game and to buy DLC. Secondly, Eden games made this and unfortunately for what ever reson went belly-up. Atari luckily stepped in and took the game over but clearly they haven't got the server side stuff in control. This means you get things like:- Losing friends out of your profile and then sometimes they re-appear.- You can buy DLC and then have them turn into mardi gras pink mustangs ( no joke they are vehicles won through a one on one duel with a campaign progress character).-Some of the MMO aspects of the game fail or get broken regularly, meaning that you won't be able to find and join your buds or invite them to things like games in the casino or to your houses or for just a free-ride drive.- If you want to get the casino and or drive a range of cars and bikes you have to buy Atari points at the TDU2 website which is a turn off for many people to say the least because it can be tedious although myself, I never had any issues with it.The Casino DLC is $10AUD and cars work out to be $1AUD each @ $5AUD for 400 Atari points (Pay by Paypal for less hassle). These things are the worst parts of the game and some come and go as mentioned.Great things about the game:- You drive in an open world and work your way through getting licenses for different classes of vehicles and events on the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii. - Meet a lot of great people and make friends with people all over the world (personally I dont even have a problem with non english players) I just ask them, 'you use Steam? Add me as friend :)' even if they don't use the Steam version some make Steam accounts and add the game to non-Steam shortcuts. Then its easy, the add me and I have Google Translate open in the Steam in game browser so they can talk to me in their own language outside of in game chat, problem solved! :) - Did I mention Bikes? :D- Huge amount of Cars (some are DLC), unfortunately only 3 Bikes (DLC), huge array of clothing and customisations to your character by the use of plastic surgeon and to your cars by paintshops and tuning upgrades, a Casino and many properties that you can buy to house your vehicles. I totally dig the MMO aspect of this game even in it's breaks a lot state. The game graphics may not look as good as say Grid2 but that never bothered me, I like the open world aspect and MMO of the game. I've bought almost all the DLC for the game too because I think the game is worth it especially when you snag it for $5 and there are ways to deal with stuff when the Atari/TDUlife servers break etc like the Steam adding to compensate as I mentioned. Also I should mention that my X-Box controller works very well for me in this game and the game does support a fair amount of G' series wheels but you might want to Google the game to find out for sure if it supports yours.I dedicate this review to all the great people I have met in the game, they 'make' the game in my opinion. Also I'm going to put up some of the screenshots I have and will hopefully get the time to make a Youtube tribute to the game if not also my friends. It may be some time for TDU3 to come out and fingers crossed it will be for PC too. I won't wait around like I did getting this game I wished I'd bought it last Christmas. One other thing. Don't or avoid buying DLC vehicles (Google TDU2 DLC vehicles list so you know which they are) you didn't pay for with Atari points when the servers get attacked/modified and become unlocked to buy with just cash. You need to have unlocked them with Atari points in game and or purchased at the TDU2 website because at some stage they will revert to pink Mustangs only worth around $25k. $1.5 million exotic car turning into a $25k pink Mustang....not cool and you'll just be throwing in game cash away. Also, back your game save up periodically not that I've had any save game corruptions as of yet but there are many who claim they lost all they're game progress. The game saves literally everytime you go to the menu and when you quick travel so maybe that was fixed. Better to be safe than sorry I guess but to be honest I only started religiously backing them up when my Ducati that I legimately got with Atari points turned into a Mustang. Its not happened again with any other vehicle since and I did just rebuy it after selling the Mustang.			"

												Don't buy this game. The launcher is a broken mess and to make things worst, the main menu is bugged - You need to disconnect your internet to pass through the main menu so it sets you to 'offline' mode. There's also a fix you can download that by-passes the launcher so you get a slightly better experience. In 2014 this game was stable and everything ran smoothly and would've been 10/10. But now it's bearly playable. 0/10.P.S The pirate copy of this game has packed stable servers. -hint- -hint-.			"

												While I enjoy playing this Racing game, the lack of servers and steering wheel support makes what I'm sure was a good/great game upon release, fair to middling at best now. As others have stated the launcher takes an age to recognise that the servers are no longer available and this subsequently makes various achievements and areas of the game unavailable such as DLC and the in game casino.

												I have such mixed feelings about this game. The physics are weird; something close to simcade, but it's like the game doesn't know what it wants to be. The graphics are very lackluster with low-poly models, low-res textures, and crappy lighting. The voice acting is plain awful. The sound design is extremely weak. Test Drive Unlimited 2 screams ""low budget"" in every category you can judge it in. And despite all of that, it's extremely comfy. For anyone who's ever fantasized about living in the world of an arcade racer, it's all there. You buy dream houses so you can have enough space for all of your shiny supercars, then you take said supercars and hurtle them across two sun-soaked islands with complete freedom. It's just plain comfy. If that's the kind of racer you want, go ahead and pick this game up. It's jam-packed full of shortcomings and yet it's still able to hit a spot in your inner kid's heart that many other racers can't.			"

												Testdrive Unlimited 2 it's one of the best racing games out there, perfectly combines concepts of racing with open-world style games, still more could had been done to improve physics, but still a very solid game with everything combined. Good graphics Big open-world Extra missions (car wrecks, photo-locations, tuning) Multiplayer races and eventsThe only con i really dislike is, if you have purchased any DLC cars or other stuff, you have to backup your savegame files or you risk loosing everything, and that happens very often besides other bugs and server shutdowns once in while.Few bugs and crashesMultiplayer unavailablity sometimesPrice (its too much when some important features arent available all the time)			"

												Okay, so... Here's an honest review from a player since 2012 on PS3...When I first opened the box for my brand new PS3 title, TDU2, the servers were absolute crap. I took a while for Atari and Eden Games to get it back up. In my opinion though, the single player isn't much different and feels exactly the same. Although, you can't sync to a cloud or see real players and not AI. Anyway, this is PC MasterRace, so let's not get off topic...Regardless of that, here's my negatives... I think the physics could be a world better. This is basically my top priority for anyone who is continuing development, which leads me to say that the Test Drive series is apparently under new management by BigBen Studios, according to some website out there, just search it up to find it.Anyway, here's where I think Eden Games struck gold with the game... Textures, Shadows, Bloom Effects, gameplay, and the never ending list of vehicles. The visuals of the game are absolutely stunning for a 2011 game! Especially for the fact that it can literally run off of your average Dell PotatoBook (Random Number Goes Here for no G*d D*mn Reason)The game has a kind-of linear story behind it, (spoilers incoming) you are a valet who gets into a competition and basically gets rich when you win. You also meet some new characters along the way, and are able to discover things on your own via free-roam.The vehicles are ENDLESS! With even all the competition money you win, you can't even buy 1/10 of what the game has to offer! All the vehicles are high resolution textures and have the best reflectivity you will find from one of these games. The prices of vehicles are realistic as you would expect them to be in real life.Anyway, there is so much that this game has to offer! Look for sales and get the game as soon as possible. You will never regret the decision!10/10 -AjBrodsky			"

Dlc in a game you can't even play most ofthe time because the servers are down. Also you can't purchase the dlc as it's only purchaseable with frickin Atari coins, which of course you get via their site. And the site is down. When finally some dude at atari decides to check the servers and put them online, the game is quite funand yeah when it was released it was great. But now? No. Just no. Atari doesn't give a damn about theirprior products and customers. So not recommended at all to buy now. Just because you can't play it half of the time.			"

												I wanted to love Test Drive Unlimited 1, but there were something missing about this game, hours spent in game untill servers were shut down on 9/29/2012 . Thats where TDU2 comes on. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. Doesn't it all sound fantastic? The ideas that went into Test Drive Unlimited 2 are appealing in every wayP.S. Over 1,5k hrs spent online,and once more unluck me website dont respond and not leting change password, nothing ealse but to buy new copy of game, #BackToGame As far as i see after 6 months breake SERVERS ARE STILL ON so feel free to buy the game, you'll never get bored.

												I love Driving Sims/Games, especially when I have a full racing setup with a Logitech G27 with the Stick Shifter, and a steering wheel mounted on an aluminum semi cage. Love playing this game with the setup and the force feedback makes it so much more realistic. I've also been lucky enough to have visited both islands in the game, and its close to the real thing, but of course they can't possibly recreate it to a T, but close enough to see some familiar roads and buildings.There's a good number of cars available in game, even motorcycles but only available as DLC which I don't think is up anymore for purchase. There are races to compete in, events to accomplish, and even getting your license on each category of cars. There's also 6 bonus cars that's hidden on both islands which you have to find, each car needs 10 parts in order to own them.I don't understand some people that complain about the graphics and other stuff, especially when the game was made in  2011 or earlier. It was made years ago, so of course due to the advancement of technology today would make it look dated. Don't give it a bad review just because you expect the game to look like todays current games. This goes across the board on all games in fact, reading all these negative reviews just doesn't give the game any justice at all.I really enjoy this game, an oldie but a goodie indeed. Wonder if they're ever gonna make TD unlimited 3.... hope so...9/10			"

												Atari is gone, long live Atari! Playing this game requires registration on TDU2 site, which is supposedly dead, but still allows you to register (woohoo). Online, to my surprise, works fine - there are occasional players racing around. The game has its share of issues (you can't get achievements if you install unofficial patch, which makes performance MUCH better and adds extra cars... and other stuff) but its pretty much playable after some tweaking and setting up.Overall, its fun to race around. Graphics are primitive, music selection is limited, having an avatar in a racing game is awkward, but its still fun.If you don't own it already, I can't really recommend this game. DLCs are ridiculously expensive (they apparently still take your money for it, and no, steam $ won't do). But if you own it, hop in and lets play! :D			"

												This is the closest thing to Forza Horizon on PC... for better or worse. And trust me, the worse is pretty bad. But first, the better.The game is spread across multiple hawaiian islands, in an open world campaign, which is pretty awesome. It also has a great selection of cars, missions, races and other things to participate in, such as painting your cars and altering your avatars appearance, clothing and hairstyle. So far, so good, the game really can be quite fun. I'd rate the physics as either one of the most realistic arcade games I've played, or one of the least realistic simcades I've played. But on to the negatives.The game rarely works without modification, I had to use a standalone launcher (which takes away my ability to gain Steam achievements) to make the game work consistantly. Even still, I can only play a couple hours before the game crashes. But really... I'm ok with that. I'll tell you now what really, truly infuriates me.There are certain timed missions in the game, that are absolutely, positively impossible to complete without driving like a balls to the wall, completely suicidal  lunatic. Take Mad Max style driving, and turn it up my 5. Then, add to that the fact that the most unpredictable traffic in the world is included, and the customer who's car you're delivering doesn't want it scratched, or driven off road, and welcome to the most utterly infuriating racing game ever known to man. I literally can't tell you the number of times that all I've needed to complete a mission is one more damn second, and everything would have been fine. But the game creators set time limits that apparently only God would be able to achieve, because not only must you be a driving god, you must also be the luckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the world for traffic not to cut you of and screw up your entire damn race.Now, I know the above paragraph is utterly critical, and even hateful of the game, but I still recommend it... especially on sale. I bought the game for $5, and I've gotten my moneys worth out of it already. I just really wish these particular missions were not made so freaking impossible. The other 95% of the game is fantastic, but that 5% of the games missions completely, and utterly infuriates me. Other than that (and the instability, and utter lack of reliable online support, and need to launch the game through a third party launcher) the game is pretty fun. Just be sure to pick up the universal launcher so you can play offline.http://i-knyazev.ru/tools/tdu2-universal-launcher/ "

												I've had so many issues with this game and I can't even get it to start. I don't get why this game is still sold. The forums of the site are closed and they offer no support whatsoever. Don't buy it. It's a trap.			"

												Its a Great game tho, but if Atari still work on this game it would be AWESOME. sadly they abandon itit gave me several troubles:i lost my savegame several timescannot log incannot connect to serveretcThis is a GREAT game basically.

												I love TDU 1 with all of my heart. I played it so much with my friends. I can remember how much we hyped this game up, everyone was so excited. It finally released and i bought it on the ps3 with my friends, it had horrible server issues and many of us quit playing. I really want to recommend this game, but it just isn't supported anymore, if you want to play online (how the game is meant to be played) you won't have a good time.Anybody remember that really popular road in the city on tdu 1 where everone went to drag race? I miss those days :(			"

												In the part of gameplay, this game made it to the standard level.In the part of music, just made it to the ""meh"".But why I prefer this game? Because of free-style gameplay that drive you to hang on missions and keep driving along the roads or the beaches for enjoying your mind instead of stressed it with boring missions.			"

												This game at release had so many issues. The fact is, this game looked great when viewing videos and screenshots or artwork. But when it came to playing the game, there was always something to bug you. After several patches leading upto the game before Atari shutdown teams that worked on such projects, the game slowly died but fan's tried hard to keep it a-float. Infact, the fan base was the only thing that kept this game alive.Now, the game is full of cheaters, hackers and modders. There is no technical support or admins. The hackers can ram you full speed and won't be knocked over, only you will go flying. Just one of the many bad things that commonly happen now. Oh, & thats if you're lucky enough to even get this game working. I bought this game for my friends, was it install & play? No, infact, it was so fustrating that both my friends gave up and only me and one friend got to truily test this game out.From my experience, the open world was a great idea, the level up system, cash system & club system was very exciting. All of this if you're lucky to get it to work. And if you can't get the launcher to do it's thing, the next big issue you'll probly have is registration and trying to connect to the server.I simply CANNOT say BUY this game, as it's not worth the hassle. I do say however, avoid at all costs. The game will soon be terminated and i'm glad I got to experience this game first hand before it turned to the largest pile of rubbish I've seen by far.Sound FX is good, only two radio stations and no custom radio support. (Fake radio stations) Graphics were also good for it's time. The first Person view is also nice. Some aspects really catch you're eyes and other aspect ruin you're experience completly.Now lets get to some more dirt. If you and a friend is lucky enough to even get it working together, once in the game, you'll be lucky to even see one another as both vanish and sometimes, only you can see your friend while your friend can't see you or the other way around, very fustrating when you want to free drive open world with friends.The good things about this game is actually not as much as you'd think. Logo's offical, the open world, huge, drivng physics, not the best. But when it comes to cup races or setting up events or local races, this seemed to work well. Cups are Singleplayer, not Multiplayer so some things within the game step on the M.O.O.R they claimed it to be. With all the problems, and the time and effort I had to put into this game made me not wanna recommend or suggest this game to anyone after my bad experiences with it.When the community offers you mods, unoffical pacthes, fixes, or cheats, you ahould clue-in & know there is a problem with this game. Also, you want to sit in you're friend car? you can do this, only if you are GREEN for UPNP and ports, if NAT is red, you simply might not be-able to play. In other words, the less security you have, the better chances you have at playing. And trust me, this was no easy task for people with tight security. lolI honestly couldn't recommend this game even in 2012 after I did actual recommend it to friends, after that, my opinion on this game had changed. I still help people to get this game working and thats the most fustrating problem about this game. Some users are lucky and get it working first try, guess what, it means you are not protected as well as you think & are open for attacks, and if you allow the ports, and the launcher still says NAT in red, this means you're networking hub / router isn't as secure or protective as you think allowing open connections once in a while. So those who are happy about it working without the hassle are actually in deep trouble if they were to surf the net. lolAnyways, Here is my results.Graphics: 6.0SouundFX: 6.0Gameplay: 6.0Multiplayer FunFactor: 5.0SIngleplayer FunFactor: 6.5 (First time I ever did this one lol)Total rating: 5.5			"

												Worth buying on sale. It's a good game to enjoy cruising around on the islands using different cars.The driving physics is not the best but still enjoyable to an extent. The game is abandoned by developers though, so servers are rather offline than online.			"

												Good game. Multiplayer works perfectly. Im glad its on sale because it is the only alternative for The Crew and it is better than The Crew on some topics. Working mirrors on interior view for instance. Also, Atari merged TDU 1 with this so you can go to Hawai in this game aswell. Of course repolished with ""new"" 2011 graphics. Sidenote: If you are willing to use motorbikes like you did on TDU 1, you have to pay extra 5 dollars to Atari via their website. You unlock motorbikes with Atari tokens in game. 80 tokens per ""premium"" DLC'ish vehicles and you can buy 400 tokens for 5dollars. I was looking for a game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 but expecting to drive fast stuff so this kinda sorta worked for me. You can move your view via mouse(You have to drag it by left click tho), some nice details like being able to open windows or convertible cars' being convertible for real (You can switch between open-air and enclosed style in action) To be honest, i bought the game to cruise with friends, if you are looking for a true racing game skip this. If you are after open world cockpit view action, thats yoru game.			"

												It was a great game, probably one of my favorites but that was when you could play online. Nowadays I can't even run the game anymore so I don't understand how they are still selling this for £14.99, unbelievable.			"

												Such a great game. Especially for its time. Sadly refunded due to both Casino and Main servers being so unreliable, and they still charge you for DLC's on PC but not console?If you hadn't played this game a few years ago, you have missed out on a great game...			"

												Well, when i bought this game i was expecting a really good racing game since the first one was amazingly enjoyable, but it turnout that it feels incomplete. There are some cars, but not that great amount that it looks like to have, the most badasses cars have to be bought through DLCs...(really disappointed). Physics are really bad, cars seem to lose control when turning, and seem to do not have any grip with the tarmac. Time attack challenges are extremely hard during the license tests (A2 A3 license made me rage quit the game). I really do not recommend this game. Waste of money, unfornatelly. Could've been great.			"

												Game downlaods, then immediately launches the uplay nonsense to downlaod yet another 1 gig, the 'activation of an account' is required but the website is dead, having apparently gone bust. game eventually launches, tells me to hit lots of xbox controller buttons and presents me with just black textures and no way to fix it. Plus it didn't detect my screen resolution and I can't even work out how to start a race.This game is a car crash, avoid, even at $0.01.			"

												I bought TDU 2, as i felt i needed the feeling of driving a Lamborghini (or other nice cars) in exotic locations. Then i realized they left out the Lambos from the 2nd... I played a lot the first part and of course the driving physics are nothing to write home about, but there was a certain feeling to the free roaming going 300km/h in a cabrio Lamborghini or such cars in a huge island, and simply (and very sadly) there is no other game like this, that you can buy houses and nice cars in nice locations. So i didn't hesitate much when i purchased the second for like 20 euros or so. After investing 30 hours in it i realized the developers concentrated and tryed to improve on the wrong aspects of the first game to make this sequel. Which resulted in a worse game than the first.The cop chases are downright broken. I like challenge, but the police cars coming straight at you with 200+km/h in a one direction road, and every few seconds. I think this is a major fault in this sequel. I remember the first TDU and there was nothing like this, the cop chases were fun and challanging in the same time. In a driving game this is important for me.Also collecting points for making facial surgeries? Are you kidding me? I can get past this, as you can just ignore this feature, but this kind of mentality is visible throughout the game. Even if you dont want to, the game reminds you that you should be wanting to become the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of all time. The scenarios and missions could have been made very fluid and easy to believe, but they are just dragging you out of the environment and putting you into a minigame inside of a game.Can't skip the cut scenes before the races, they are incredibly annoying after hearing them for the first few times.Some cars have their gear rations mixed up. I realized in a few cars,i think they were Lotuses, that their 3rd gear is higher than their 4th. Basically these two gear ratios are swapped.I understand they couldn't implement proper collision physics into the game with real life cars. But this is as far from test driving as possible nowadays. But at least the first TDU could somehow make me forget this. I was eager to get all the nice cars, and get some villas in nice locations. But the more i discovered and tryed out in the second part the more i got disillusioned. I just deleted it and i can not reccomend it to anyone, especially at this price. Maybe at a massive discount, but even then, you should stick with the first part in my opinion.			"

												A truly awful game. Test Drive is dead, and for good reason. There hasn't been a decent Test Drive since Test Drive 6. The car physics are not even remotely close to realistic. The voice acting and forced storyline are the worst I've ever seen, and the AI is plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It doesn't help that the level design isn't very intriguing at all either. Save yourself the money, don't even buy it on sale. And god forbid the servers are down (like when I bought it at Christmas), you can't play it at all.If I could rate this game, it'd be 2/10. I only gave it 1 extra point because the car models are nice, and that's basically the only good thing about this game.			"

												I played TDU 2 when it came out and didn't much care for it, but I just found it in the Steam winter sale for only 4.99 so I decided to give it another try... well what a waste of $5.. This game is so buggy, cheesy, and uninspired, it should have never come out. I have fond memories of TDU 1 on the Xbox 360, that game was so fun, looked great (at the time) and was overall a very good game. This game seems dead out of the gate. Graphics are very subpar, they don't even look as good as I remember TDU1 looking, driving system is OK, the ""story"" is absolutely GOD AWFUL. The ""acting"" of the in-game characters is actually worse ""acting"" than you'd see in a   p o r n o film!!! Let that sink in.. I would provide a more full review of this game but unfortunately the game glitched on me and I cannot pass one of the first objectives.. (go to the car club) it won't let me enter the mission so I just gave up.. waste of $5, don't spend any more than that. Buy TDU1 honestly.			"
