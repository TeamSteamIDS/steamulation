												RaceRoom is an excellent sim racer made by the same people behind Simbin, makers of Race 07 and other great sims. It's worthy of serious consideration by everyone who loves sim racing. Don't be fooled by the many bad reviews, there's a good reason for them, which I'll explain later. There's also more good news later.

			Racing the BMW M3 around Mount Panorama, on the brilliant Australian racetrack Bathurst, one of the best in the world. Alcohol Rating: 1/5 - first signs of intoxication, but no problems driving.		

Raceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called ""Experiences"". These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.I haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing ""experience"" to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.There are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.Now the bad news...Many people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.Think of it this way, the ""free to play"" game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are ""Experiences"" - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an ""Experience"".Here's where the problems begin...The three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.To confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.I created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;


RaceRoom Packs 
Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork
By: Strategikal

			A spreadsheet showing which tracks (and how many cars and liveries) come with each pack. There are many duplicates. Two tracks aren't included in any pack and must be purchased individually.		


Whoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!Fortunately, there is some good news...While experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!So, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.Even more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%To give you an idea of cost, I spent less than £30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around £70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.CONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the ""demo"" first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!

												Graphics are decent, sound is great.Not free to play. Demo at best. Start with a few cars and a couple of tracks. No way to earn/unlock cars, tracks or liveries in game. Every thing must be bought with real money which would bring the price well over $100. This type of payment models are the worst. And the sole reason I don't recommend this game.			"

												I used to be a Simbin customer for eight years until 12/3/13 due to the various issues that I have with this title.  First off this game has no single player content like previous Simbin entries save for track test and time attacks.  Next there is no multiplayer save for special promotional challenges and time attacks against another player's ghost car.  Another thing is the sheer cost to have content equal to the legacy titles from Simbin as you will spend $100+ USD just on cars and tracks alone without even factoring in the cost of liveries of the cars purchased.The positive points of this title is that the car audio is a step up from previous entries as the Zonda R sounds better than the GT Power pack version as an example.  Another plus is that the car models are also a step up from the previous entry as they look much more detailed.  Finally the physics are another step up as the cars feel a bit more responsive and can actually tell you when they will let go.Unfortunately the cons are far too glaring to overlook and for now I'll have to say avoid this title as there are other titles that offer more content for your money.

												This game is not bad because is free but thats only if u dont want more games or tracks because if you do then this game its not worth it to buy every car and track in the game you need 13446 vRP points or whatever that means an in real money equals to $146.78 you can buy F1 2013,WRC4 and Asseto Corsa and Grid and you still have $3 leftand thats regular price if you wait for steam sales you can even get more for your money im sorry but i will take 4 good games instead of 1 ok game for the same price if at least you can buy the whole package for $50 i can take that but no they want to ripp you off sorry this is not worth it			"

												I suppose after 250 hours I should post a review. I race with a Logitech Momo wheel and triple 1920x1200 monitors with a nVidia GTX680. This is the best racing simulation at the moment because:1. Realistic physics2. Excellent sound3. Excellent force feedback4. Plenty of cars to choose from - I recommend purchasing at least one of the following Experience packs: DTM2015+, ADAC GT Masters 201x so you get a good set of cars/tracks and then add DTM1992 and Group 5 packs later.  WTCC2014 is also very good but if you don't know how FWD cars drive at the limit, test drive them first.5. Single player has the Experiences, Custom Championships, Competitions and Leaderboard challenges to keep things interesting.6. Multiplayer has dedicated server and allows for large fields.  Of course who you race with determines if it's fun or not.  For the most part the online racing is pretty good and active during the mornings in North America and during the evenings in Europe.  Do not use the free-content races as a gauge on whether the racing is any good. I avoid free-content races.To get the best deal when starting:1. Grab a vRP package from the online store: http://www.raceroomstore.com.  You will get a code to redeem in the Store portion of the game.  Click the [v] button beside the vRP amount then Redeem Code.2. You get discounts when new packs have tracks/cars you've already purchased or if you purchase more than one item at a time (bulk discount).  For example DTM2015 only cost around $10 USD if you already have DTM2013 or DTM2014			"

												Definitely one of the very bests racing simulators available today. The biggest pros are: - incredible tracks (highly detailed, with very good lightning effects and filled with alive crowds).- sound which simply is totally amazing- very good, detailed FFB- very good competitive AI- consistent vehicle choice - there are actual real racing series represented (WTCC, ADAC, Hillclimb, Historic DTM), not just some random cars from different classes- good multiplayer, even thou it's still in alpha phase it's highly playable without lots of bugs- very impresive development pace - this game is getting better witch each update, and updates are quite frequent- It is possible to test drive each car before you buy it (you can test it as many times as you wish on one test track). This is great way to really choose only the ones you really enjoy driving, no need to blind buy and regret money you've spent.cons: some important features, like flags are still missing, but they are on the road list.The games is incredibly immersive, you can really feer like you've been on the track in raceday for real, all parts of it are very well balanced which gives very consistent quality (not like Assetto Corsa, where you get really stunningly looking cars along with tracks which are mediocre at best, poor sounds and totally useless AI). For me it is currently definitely number one, I highly recommend it.As for all those negative comments - just look at the time spent in game by the persons that gives negative comment - it says alot. Also, please bear in mind that this is simulator - you HAVE TO own decent wheel with good FFB to really enjoy it, otherwise if you use gamepad or even keyboard (!) you will have hard time and lots of frustration trying to control the car. Sorry guys, it's not NFS, you wouldn't try to drive real car with keyboard.			"

												THIS IS A REVIEW OF DTM EXPERIENCE 2013!Well, I was looking forward to exciting duels with quite good AI and entertainment like in real DTM races. What did I get ? Game with real tracks, cars and pilots, but WITHOUT PitStops, choise of tires, rules like yellow flags and damage. In the description of the game is: real DTM rules. Where are they ? I hope developers will add this things in free update, otherwise it is the worst purchase of the year!SimBin what happened with you ?!			"

												The most under-rated racing simulation on the market, yet in my opinion one of the best with the potential to be even better. Raceroom Racing Experience (better known as R3E) has improved immeasurably over the past year or so. No longer a featureless hot-lapper as it was in the first early years, R3E has experienced a turn-of-direction toward a proper racing simulation. Developers Sector3 -formerly Simbin - are trying to build a simulation worthy of its forebears - the GTR and RACE series. R3E is steadily but surely becoming what we all hoped GTR3 would be. It's still got some way to go and many core features are yet to be implemented, but R3E is on the right path.R3E has a good mix of approachability and realism. There is something here for casual racers and simulation enthusiats alike. Content is focused on purpose-built race cars, predominantly touring cars and GT racing (with open-wheel and endurance content to come), and in this field R3E is peerless. If you want road cars and supercars as per Gran Turismo and Forza it's best to look elsewhere. Track content is also exceptional both in number and quality. Online racing is pretty stable and offline features pretty decent AI with an adaptive feature that matches the CPU controlled cars to the player's pace for a good challenge every time. The real highlight of R3E is the audio - it's the benchmark, as simple as that. I cannot be understated how much good sound adds to the immersion of a racing sim. Sector3 clearly understand this. It's brilliant,A little more on the 'free-to-play' aspect - it's not really F2P in the traditional sense. There is a very small selection of free cars and tracks with almost no scope to unlock new content or credits by playing, although parts of the game can be played for free such as hot-lap competitions. It's a modular game where the user can buy exactly the content they like rather than paying for a whole game or DLC packs. I think it works well.To summarise, R3E is something of a hidden-gem, worthy of any sim-racer's time. It's a project that's only going to get better. It's certainly my go-to sim.			"

												This game has its drawbacks, but it is the most rewarding and immersive of all the modern racing titles currently on the market. It has clearly been tainted by early reviewers, because it was launched in such an incomplete state that it´s difficult to comprehend why they did it. As a result of this, combined with a terrible pricing model, the game has received a bad stigma, but one which is entirely undeserved at this point in time.So, if you have heard bad things about FFB, lack of content, poor framerates or anything else, rest assured that these issues have been fixed, often to the point of excelling in each area. The development team are one of the most forthcoming, open and honest  in the business, admitting mistakes where they have been made and explaining any decisions they make.But we live in a world where racing sims are on the up. So how does it compare?Where Project CARS lacks complete series, immersive sounds and consistent AI, Raceroom excels in each of these areas. Where rFactor2 lacks in updated graphic shaders, performance and complete series, Raceroom is more than adequate in each.Where Assetto Corsa lacks good enough AI for an offline experience, Raceroom blows all competition out of the water.In summary, this game has fantastic content (albeit with the modular pricing structure - but see below), competitive AI, great netcode, superb physics and THE MOST AMAZING SOUNDS EVER HEARD IN A RACING SIM. Don`t buy content on Steam - go to their shop where you can bulk-buy VRP, spend an average game`s value and build your own game to your liking.			"

												This game could EASILY have become the best sim racing game on steam but is completely ruined by its terrible paywall system that they have. The visuals are very pleasing to the eye and the physics and sound add up to it to make the game feel like a very high end sim. Sadly the microtransaction hell that Sector 3 threw in really ruined the perfect opportunity to make the best simulator for racing fans to enjoy. Its very depressing because RACE '07 and GTR 2 were both excellent and iconic simulation racing games. Maybe if they had followed the path of their previous games, RaceRoom wouldve been a simulator far better than Assetto Corsa, iRacing, or rFactor2 couldve ever been.but no matter what i say, this is gonna get downvoted to hell because fanboys cant take having their beloved software being judged, and thats absolutely pathetic. ""Scores"" Graphics and Visuals = 9.5/10Sound Design = 10/10Physics = 9/10Menu and UI = 7/10DLC and Microtransaction Usage = 2/10Raceroom is an excellent simulator but cannot be recommended due to how much you have to invest to actually enjoy its content.That is, unless if you would be perfectly fine to pay over $150 for the full experience of this game, go on ahead.

												Having initially dismissed Raceroom and in fact, being mostly unimpressed, I recently re-installed to give it another crack. Still being in Beta, I figured it was fair to.I am rather surprised to say that it is genuinely superb and I always come away from Raceroom satified and my racing thirst quenched.Genre-defining sounds (Really, they are the best sounds on any sim, anywhere), Genre-defining AI (again, really. Blows Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 AI out of the water), Pleasant visuals, Intuitive handling, cracking FFB. Can't fault any of that.I see some complain about the pricing of the addons. It's pretty reasonable, especially when compared to the liked of iRacing. Yesterday evening I purchased the DTM 1992 pack of cars and the European track pack. That's 5 very high quality, different vehicles with different strengths and 14 european circuits. I paid under £15 for this (admittedly with some discounts from prior purchases). This little lot would set you back right around the £100 mark, if not more on iRacing. Just throwing that out there.Added to that you can try any car for free before you buy...... Highly recommend, great game and sim!			"

												DEFINITELY A NEW GAME UNDER MANY ASPECTSAfter the big patch FFB is now solid, Multiplayer Alpha is lagless with 20+ cars on track, netcode is stunning (no cars take off to the moon if they've been hit by another car), the AI is ""ok"" (but still needs improvements), tracks updated with the Road Feel are now so much better to drive onto (because of the way new FFB and updated tracks interact), and the sound... well... WHAT A SOUND!!! TOTAL IMMERSIONThere are so many good things under the hood about this game that I seriously hope it'll become more appealing and known to all the simracers out there. Despite the unclear, sometime shady and mind-boggling business model S3 has adopted, this game deserve and deserve a lot! Don't be intimidated by the cost of contents in the store. You don't have to buy EVERYTHING (even if the temptation is high!).Set for yourself a budget, buy what you're really interested into and possibly wait for big discounts... they'll surely come.Race on!

												I haven't played R3E from the beginning. So I don't know what these people are saying, when they are implying that this wasn't always such a great sim.I've got 200 hours on Assetto Corsa. That was the sim that first got me hooked on the scene. Since then I've tried every sim out there. Nowadays I find myself only enjoying R3E. Why? Because of the quality of everything. I think it's probably the FFB that I'm most impressed with. It's the most predictable and sensitive I've seen yet. I instantly see and understand why I mess up my laps. I know that if I were more attentive to the wheel I could've driven better.And so, when I return to other sims after driving around R3E I feel frustrated. The FFB feels so inaccurate I almost feel like deleting every other sim but R3E from Steam. Probably the only other one that comes close is Automobilista. But it's weird that even in that game what feels like a punishment appears as a learning opportunity in R3E, as it should in real life.I think I'm beginning to sound a little crazy, but I actually feel guilty for not playing R3E more. I feel like this game deserves thousands of hours of enjoyment, which I'm unable to provide since my life situation. Other people complain about Sector3 milking cash. I, on the other hand, think that I'm not appreciating the work they have put in this game enough. I feel like the money I've given them isn't enough to show my appreciation for this game.Do I recommend RaceRoom Racing Experience? If you're into serious racing, it's the only game you'll ever need. It's everything one could hope from a sim. So yes, I do recommend it.			"

												Update:This game keeps better and better. The developer is really making a great effort in making this game better with every patch released. Really cool that there are always new packs. No idea why the mixed review this game got. After the last update (march 16'), this game has to be one of the best sim racing games out there. FFB is just epic and the sound is really top notch. Have GTX 980 ti 6GB so the graphics are really good when maxed out and with fps ranging from 150-160 fps there is nothing to complain about. Also with a huge muticlass grid (99 cars i think) and bmw M6 GT3 (coming very soon), R3E is a must buy for any simracers out there. GTO and formula junior were just released and bmw m6 gt3 coming soon what else would one ask for. And yeah any car can be test driven before buying. Is there any other game that offers this?Update: Here are some videos to help you make up your mind

												RRE is a very good game - the physics and everything seem to be spot on, but I can't recommend it due to how the purchasing system works in combination with other factors which mean you don't get your money's worth. You'll have to spend well in advance of £50 to enjoy most of what this game has to offer and while that in itself is not much of an issue, the fact the server framework seems totally unreliable means you'll be sitting around twiddling your thumbs a lot of the time. Sometimes the game won't work, sometimes it will. Your friend just down the road from you may be tearing his hair out because he can't get the game started after the latest patch, though it could be you doing the very same the following week while his game miraculously comes back to life. Throw in the Diablo III-style 'always connectedness' (where you simply have to be connected to their servers even for single player games) and what you have is a game that can be thoroughly frustrating.

												I play Racing Sims now for over 25 years and I can say, I had pretty much all of them including the more recent Titles like Assetto Corsa, iRacing, Automobilista etc.When RaceRoom ""R3E"" was released 3 years ago it was terrible. I think this was when most of the Sim Racer tried the game and never touched it again. BUT over the last 12 Month the Game became a very solid, very pretty, INCREDIBLY GOOD sounding and very immersive Racing Experience with a nice selection of Tracks and an AMAZING variety of Cars. Sure if you want to own every track and every single car it can be kind of expensive, but look out for Deals (Easter Special 50% off, Black Friday All-in-One 49€ etc) and/or buy the vRP directly on the RaceRoom Store and its a lot cheaper. Also you only need 1 car (~€2,99,-) of a class (GT3 for example) in order to race against the whole field of ATM 13 different GT3 cars. Not like Assetto Corsa where you need every single car pack !The Online Eperience is still a bit ruff around the edges, but the very small Developer Team works hard, fixes regulary and keeps adding new features. They also keep updating older cars to lift them to the latest physics models which I really appreciate.Every time I play R3E it puts a big smile on my face in a most positive way !			"

												This is the most complete racing experience imo!You can easilly make your own custom championships with a wide variety of series to choose from.Really good physics and visuals, and with the most bad ♥♥♥ sounds of all!!An awesome and immersive experience.A tip is to buy vRP's here to get discounts: https://www.raceroomstore.com/shop_de/list_page?cat=24And a good idea is also to pick up an experience like DTM 2013 or ADAC GTM 2014 on a sale, this will give you cheap access to a bunch of tracks to start off with. And buy content in packs, that will save you a lot of money.It does need some more work.Mainly with some key features still missing, and the AI should need some more personality.But S3S are working hard, and there are many new longed for features and content on the way!Why not give it a shot with the free content, and then buy what you like.There are also free competitions where you can try out new tracks and cars, and sometimes also win vRP's or nice prizes.

												Not a reviewer so bear with me.Have been driving sims for longer than I can remember and have gone from 16 pixels per car to trillions.Most so called sims are mearly (imho) just games made complicated and hard to drive.I d/loaded this sim in Jan 2013 and to be honest, although having bags of potential I felt there were just to many short comings, my f/f wheel would randomly twitch without warning, I couldn't gauge grip levels, to be honest it felt a bag of crap but here's the thing, I persevered and slowly (very slowly at my age) things came together and times dropped. Don't get me wrong there were still problems and with the lack of multiplayer my interest was waining!Multiplayer alpha arrived hoorah and along with the ongoing updates to physics etc this sim was coming together, some great tracks and cars and now bumper to bumper racing, interest rekindled!Over the last week or so Sector3 have made a huge 10Gb update to this sim and wow, WOW, this already well acomplished sim has turned into the only sim to have.Visually stunning, best car physics of any sim by far and as for sound, have out braked myself so many times as was to busy listening to the Zackspeed Capri cackling its way down the straight, pure heaven, this sim rocks!!!Sector3 have been faultless in their comitment to not only make an authentic driving experience but you get that personal touch the development team are happy to answer questions individually, help to solve problems and keeping us up to date with future content, taking on suggestions and ideas.Got to say I'm hooked to both the sim and the ever growin community on the forum!All this and you can drive for free, test any car before you buy and when you do buy that car you've always dreamt of hammering around the track, it's worth every penny!Highly recommend this sim, leagues above the rest (got 'em all) come join a revolultion in driving. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Just bought R3E last week due to the black friday deal with all content for 49.99€ and must say I'm absolutely blown away by it; it's just a fantastic and truly immersive experience. This is my first review so felt I had to give my opinion to help balance out some of the redundant criticim and negativity surrounding this game/sim.Pros: Sounds (Outstanding!)AI (A lot better than AC or Pcars)Official seriesExcellent FFBTracks - although not laser scanned look and feel absolutley spot on.Graphics - Very good, not the best by any means but much better than expected.Great car selectionPhysics - I'm certainly no expert but has overtaken AC as my new favourite ( Pcars, AC, and Iracing are the only sims I've used)Cons:Pricing structure -I only bought this due to the deal making it the same as buying a normal game for £40. I'm really not a fan of the free to play model or Iracing's subsription and single content purchasing. And what's sad here is I almost denied myself a fantastic sim because of this. If it werent for the deal I'd not have bothered so hopefully the developers can rethink their pricing structure and offer the content for sale altogether like a regular game.This really exceeded my expectation. It's honestly hard to describe but something just feels right about driving the cars in R3E. A real must have in any sim racing enthusiast's library!Edit: Looking through some of the negative reviews here and many of them are just rediculous. Yes, the game's certainly not perfect but giving negative reviews for the fact that the game 'needs' a steering wheel when it's designed as a proper simulation is just stupid. Also saying the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because you have to buy cars and tracks again is just stupid. Do people actually think free to play games are free?? I certainly don't agree with how the pricing model works but I certainly dont expect to get things (of any real value) for free...			"

												I rarely write reviews for games but I feel the developers deserve one for this game. When R3E launched it wasn't that great - it wasn't bad but it was missing something, it didn't feel quite right and I could never get into it, but I did see some potential.  It was free so whatever. As time went on Sector3/Simbin kept updating the game adding content and listening to feedback and things started to get a bit better, but still, I couldn't get into it - Until recently that is. Since December 2014 when a big patch was released R3E has gone from ""Best of the Rest"" of racing simulators to a genuine contender. The driving physics are now really rather good, the cars feel nice to drive and they all do what you expect them to do. The sounds are second to none. Force feedback has improved dramatically, you can feel bumps in the road and can tell how much grip you have, even to the point where I can tell which wheel is losing grip. There are lots of options to tweak the FFB to your liking, but some of the sliders are a little confusing and there isn't much of a descriptions for what they actually do. Thankfully out of the box my Driving Force GT wheel felt good - I upped the strength and set a few options that I like to have just as personal preference but it didn't require much tweaking to get it to feel how I wanted it to. The AI, although not prefect is pretty good. They drive fair, will try to overtake you if they are faster, will try to defend if you are quicker, sometimes they make mistakes and will out-brake themselves or run wide. You'll see them squabble for position with each other. Rfactor 2 and GSCE probably have the most realistic AI, but the AI in R3E is not far behind.The Graphics are really quite good cars look realistic tracks are very detailed and look great, smoke and dust effects hang around in the air for a while and are nice and smooth. The lighting is very well done and there are several times of day to choose from. Driving under trees you get flashes of sunlight lighting up the cockpit and glinting off other cars. It all looks very good and add to what is already quite an immersive experience. Some of the older cars look a little dated (older as in released in 2013) but the newer stuff looks really good. It is is a great looking sim. There is a lot of content to be had here ~65 cars and 20 tracks (48 layouts). It isn't cheap, at the moment to buy EVERYTHING it would cost around £130, But compared to something like iRacing where to buy everything will cost you probably 5X as much plus the subscription as well it is very well priced. In both games you don't need to buy everything anyway. Once you've got the tracks you want then you should be all set and with the discounts you get when buying packs you can get most of the tracks for a really good price, plus if you already bought content that is in a pack then it gets discounted automatically for you so you never end up having to pay for anything twice.You can test drive any car as much as you like, and there are competitions to win prizes and they often dot require you to own the content to enter. just choose the competition and click GO, you can win virtual money in some of the competitions as well as simracing gear.If I have one gripe with the store, it is that if you've bought a car from one of the ""Experiences"" the adac GT Experience for example, then you have to buy skins in order to race those cars in other series - which is annoying and confusing. I already own the Audi R8 LMS Ultra and I want to race that car in a custom race then I have to pay an extra 79vrp to get a skin to make that car work. I shouldn't have to buy a skin to convert a car from one class to another. To be fair a skin is like 50p to buy so its not lots of money, but it still feels like I've been robbed of my content. talking of Skins, you cannot make custom skins for you cars. - It would be great if They opened up the skins to the community The options menu is plentiful and has support for multiple monitors in eyefinity or NV Surround, but you cant change the FOV for the side monitors so you get a bit of distortion to the sides but it not too noticeable when racing. all the keys and buttons are re-mappable and it supports multiple input devices so you can use a variety of controllers all at the same time.Multiplayer racing at the moment is limited to the Sector 3's own servers and as such is really limited. If you want to run GT cars around a particular track in Multiplayer you cant set up your own server, you just have to hope sector3 have a server set up with that combination, BUT there is a patch coming next week that should add dedicated servers to the game and I'll update this review once they come out and I've had a play on them.I wouldn't have recommended this game a few months ago. there were far better sims out there to play and without any multiplayer R3E just wasn't quite good enough to put any time into. But now that it has been improved, fixed, fettled and tuned it really is a great racing simulator I imagine when Dedicated Servers are released you should be able to truly enjoy the racing in this game.

												Very good racing sim. Playing with a logitech driving force gt and i get a very good force feedback from the car, you can really feal the track and the traction of the car. The physics are really good and the sound is just amazing. You get 3 cars and 1 or 2 tracks in various configurations for free, but the rest of the cars and tracks arent all that costly, even more when you compare it to iracing. I just got the WTCC 2013 pack, with 5 cars and 3 tracks for little more then 10euros and there are a lot of content in discount. A great bonus over other racing games where you need to buy cars is that in Raceroom you can try all the cars before you buy them, they let you get a few laps around a track to see if you like it. If you really like racing games you should try this game out, you will not regret it, besides its free to play, so just try it.			"

Product received for free
												RaceRoom is a Free2Play made by Simbin (now know as SECTOR 3), developers of the great GTR Seriesand Race07.The game is a sim racing game, mostly aimed for that kind of people who are seekingfor some realistic fun, rather than some arcadsh-ish driving.The game since it's Free, doesn't give you every cars and tracks.At first, you only get 11 cars, which is a nice number, considering before you only had like 3 cars if i'm not mistaken.Cars by groups: *Silhouette Series:Cougar C14-1Cougar C14-2Canhard R52Canhard R51*P1 Prototype Series:DMD P20Mistral M530*P2 Prototype Series:DMD P21Mistral M531*Aquila CR1 Cup:Aquila CR1 Sports GT*GTR 1 Series:Saleen S7R*HillClimb challenge134 Judd V8So yeah, nice stuff after all, about the Tracks, the game only gives you 3 Tracks:*RaceRoom RaceWay:Comes with 5 LayOuts*PortiMao Circuit:Comes with 4 LayOuts*LakeView HillClimb:Comes with 2 LayOutsNot that many of tracks, considering only 2 of those are played (actually, i think the HillClimb one can only be playable on SinglePlayer, not sure.For get more cars or tracks, you can either buy the single cars or tracks (but this will make you spend more money since they're quite pricey) or you can buy the packages wich comes with both Cars and Tracks.My Advice is to buy the ADAC GT 2014 and the Nurburgring Legends, if possible DTM 2014 as well.Also, i suggest you to get them from the RaceRoom store. Over there, they cost less thanks to the sales.There's 90% of times always one every month soo, you'd better prepare at least 13$ if you want the ADAC GT 2014 for example.Anyways! Yeah, the game is indeed nice. The Graphics are looking pretty, the quality of the Tracks is Top Notch, Online isn't as Dreadful as i thought, Most of people playing, ain't that crazy at all or do stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ on track and at last,The ForceFeedback is also very well done.I'm using a Logitech Driving Force EX and it goes perfect with the game.Screw those mixed reviews. These are mostly because of people's who want all the cars free or because they thinkRaceRoom it's like GranTurismo lol or because of the costs of the DLC's, which i think, it's fair considering if you count them all, you get the price of an AAA+ Complete Sim Racing Game, so it's kind of buying the game but in pieces.So, should you try the game?Yes, if possbile with a Wheel + Pedals for the best experience but a controller will be nice as well  "

												The graphics are great, the physics feel authentic and there's no question that a lot of work went into making this a high-quality racing sim. The business model is sketchy (at best) and resembles EA over the last few years--- free games are probably around to stay, but excessive microtransactions don't have to come with them. I'd gladly pay $20 for unlimited access to all of the content in the game--- or $40 if it included community-creation tools. Just my two cents: proceed with extreme caution.			"

												This really is a top racing sim and its a shame it doesnt get the publicity it deserves. I think its problem is it gets lost in a sea of racing titles but this really is up there with the best. As of January 2015 it sets a benchmark in sim racing for sounds and probably AI as well, the physics are also superb. You can download the base content for free which again is fantastic and there are add-ons which are sometimes on sale. Another great feature is leaderboard challenges where they give away prizes for the fastest times. A great addition to this is a lot of the time you dont need to have purchased the content to take part so you can try these before you buy.Where this game is let down is by a few minor bugs but mainly its so unpopulated online its really a shame and can be tough to get decent races but i think that comes down to the lack of publicity it has had. I cant recommend this strongly enough and as the base content is free its well worth trying it out			"

												Definitely worth recommending! The graphics are very good and so are the driving physics. It's advertised as a ""free 2 play"" game, however most of the content is not. It doesn't mean that you have to buy it though. I love the fact that you can win a lot of stuff in competitions, full packs like DTM 2014 or ADAC 2014 or VRP which you can use to buy anything that is available in the game. The game still lacks some features, for example weather changes or a proper career mode, but I believe that this will be changed sooner or later because we have already received a lot of updates, which improved the overall experience.A really great game, MOST of the people, who gave bad reviews had played for just a couple of hours (sometimes even less), which is definitely not enough to get a real grip of the game.

												Bottom line?  Good racing game/sim with plenty of potential.The constant micro-transactions start to get annoying.  Even with sales on content packs and moderate discounts for purchasing vRP (virtual money) to buy content, the game ends up costing you quite a bit more than what you get at the stage of development it is in.  People can deny or challenge all they want but this thing has been in a perpetual state of Beta for 4 years.  It's actually unfortunate Steam 'GreenLights' products in this state.  They really should be 'buyer beware'.All the content including topping up everytime something new is released whether it's a car, pack or tracks can end up costing in the neighborhood of $200.00.  Many will argue that but I have the receipts to prove it and unless you figure out the system or have someone explain, many players have inevitably made errors as to how they purchased and paid more than they could have.The drivng itself feels quite good.  Since it is a closed system, there is no easy way to inspect what is being done to see how accurate the physics, vehicle dynamic modeling or tire modeling is done.  While there are moments it feels slightly weird, certain cars lifeless or canned, it certainly is not as obvious or bad as some other well known racing games.Visually, for a DX9 based engine, they have produced a great result.  It is missing any kind of rubber build up or active track at least visually.  There is some debris modeling if going off road but no visuals.There is no proper flag system.  There is no daytime, nightime transitions or full 24 hour system.  Damage modeling is non-existent which lends to very pushy, bumping and careless driving in multiplayer sessions. There is some mild engine and gearbox damage with specific vehicles.Pits and setups are limited.  No tire pressure adjustment at the moment and limited chassis setup.  The ability to 'Save' a setup only recently became available and oddly was news as though this was a breakthrough of epic proportions.http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/setup-saving-coming-to-r3e.118058The game models chassis flex.The options allow for tweaking the visuals, controllers, sound and force feedback to the Nth degree.  There are some interesting concepts to the steering and force feedback settings to simulate the rack and pinion steering as well as the feel of the contact of the tire to the road.  How much of that truly can be felt in the game or whether it's placebo is difficult to tell though it does feel generally good in most cars.The sounds are really well done.  Every other game could learn from this.Multiplayer is okay when it works but often there are visual glitches with cars overlapping or stationary images (ghost images) just kind of being left behind around the track.  It needs work.It requires an internet connetion and there is no offline mode which is fine except the authentication servers or whatever they are frequently blow up and and one cannot play.The dedicated forums away from the Steam discussions have unfortunately become progressively toxic only rivaled by iracing.  I find it to be a deterrent since it is somewhat the 'go to' for info but weeding through the frequent snarky responses to everything and the jerks gets old really quick.Compared to turn key options such as AMS though dated in some ways, at least can be dropped into a league and work and rF2 which is also league capable, this still has a long way to go.  If one tries it solely on the free content, I suppose it's okay but it will get repetitive very quickly.  Even with all the content, hot lapping against AI gets old and other than the built in public Multiplayer Lobby which leaves much to be desired and you won't find much that's worth the time.As much as I enjoy driving the game and I'll say it again, it has potential, in the current state along with past issues as Simbin, restructuring and the advent of Sector3 and another restructuring along with the rebirth of Simbin, I cannot recommend it.  They have missed the mark, there seems to be no direction to what should be the logical and that is a massive multiplayer environment and the reality of it being at 'Beta' levels after 4 years with no end in sight is enough to at least be cautious with this before diving in head first and spending a lot of money.

												This title was off to a rocky start but with consistant updates and ehancements has gone from mediocre to most probably the best Sim out there. Though this sim is listed as a Free 2 Play title and comes with several cars and a few track for nothing - you will need to spend a little cash in order to get the cars and tracks you want. The pricing on these addons is quite minimal and you only need to buy what you actually want and when you want it. Oh and you can test drive every car as many times as you like before deciding if you want to buy it.Here's the rundown:Graphics 8/10 - they are by no means bad - in fact the sim looks very natural and life likeSound 10/10 - You can't get any more real than this without getting in the actual cars. Every detail from transmission whine and chassis squeaks to wind, transmission flex, gravel and reverb etc.. have been taken into account. The sound alone give this sim more immersion than the competition. Physics 9/10 This score was a few points lower a couple months back, but with recent and ongoing enhancements to several group cars and more being fixed currently, R3e is more than deserving of this rating. If they get all the cars to the level they are achieving with the ones they already edited - I see a glorious 10 out of 10 coming in the near future.FFB 10/10 - for me it was GSCE that held the title for FFB with AC and RF2 following slighly behind, but R3e has taken that title by leaps and bounds. I know this sounds exagerated, but you have to feel it to believe it - and I've never felt this good behind the wheel in my 15+ years of racecraft.Car Content Variety 8/10 There are tons of cars available - though the list is still a bit on the short side. This is not to say that I don't have enough cars. The fact is I own more than I've had time to drive, but still wish there were a few Group C cars in the mix as those are my absolute favorites. Did I mention that you can test drive every car without buying.Car Quality 10/10 - This title is on par with AC when it comes to detail. The exterior/interior along with suspension and tires are all done with upmost attention to even the small details.Track Content Variety 8/10 Again the amount of tracks are quite limited compared to other titles, but not lacking. Several of my favorite tracks are included (Bathurst, Spa, Nurburgring, RedBull Ring, Suzuka, Nords, etc..) They have also included a lazer scanned Nordschleife into the mix with more lazer scanned tracks to come.Track Quality 10/10 Right up there with AC and iRacing when it comes to track surface and detail. The sky boxes are absolutely believable and the environmental details are more than real enough to enjoy. Multiplayer 8/10 Much better racing experience than most sims I've played, but it still has it's issues. The netcode has been updated recently and seems to be working great, but I have not had enough time with it to give it a better score.Singleplayer 10/10 The AI have been improved greatly and  their difficulty can be set to adaptive which takes some patience for them to settle in, but when they do they are a joy to race with. Also the ""Experiences"" make this title a dream when it comes to playing championships.Community 10/10 This is probably the least toxic sim community out there. Most everyone is friendly and helpful. The devs are also very active within the forums and listen to the players.I'm not sure what all I left out, but I'll be sure to update this in the future. Also: I know this review appears to be written by a fanboy due to the high scores given. I assure you this is not the case. I play many Sims more than I have this. Infact there was a long time which I felt this title was a waste of drive space, but as stated above - it has come a long way.Whether you're a veteran to racecraft or are a complete newbie, give RaceRoom a try. You have nothing to lose since it can be played for free.			"

												Great but unfinished game that gets better with every update. I was looking for an alternative to GTR2 and RRE is slowly but surely turning into that (same devs after all). No ""rewinds"", no bumping into other cars without severe consequences (spin), no drifting through corners at 250 kph... Perfect! Love it! IT IS NO ""Need for speed"" or ""Grid2"" (""Grid Autosport"" was an arcady desaster as well imho). IT IS NOT A GAMEPAD-CASUAL-RACER. The DTM Experience is great if you are a fan of the DTM Series but as mentioned above feels a little unfinished (no weather change, car setups can't be saved,...).With the last patch there is a multiplayer (Alpha) in both DTM and RRE and tons of other improvements.I can't understand these negative reviews because the best about the game: It's free to try out. I can download and play parts of it without paying anything. And if you love it as much as I do you can buy the stuff you like and want...This game will be the next GTR2 once it's finished.I am really looking forward to each update... Pit stops are announced for the near future!			"

												Still not a fan of the free 2 play model, but I am glad it hasn't stopped me from playing the awesome new content and experience the overhaul on the physics since the last time I tested R3E at release. With the (innovative) multiplayer being in place and working like a charm I can now finally call this game the true successor of RACE 07. Maybe RACE 15 should be trademarked as the touring cars are superb for super close online racing. Still only a few hours of online play in but this will grow massively in the coming months.Welcome back Simbin Sector3 to my extensive virtual motorsport games library on Steam :)			"

												2017 updated review! Positives +Free to Play!+Good balance of physics implementation. Above all, REALLY FUN to drive.+Great graphics: very well optimized, easy to get a nice smooth 60 FPS+.+Sound quality and accuracy is arguably the best of any current sim title out there.+Great leaderboard system, accessible in-game as well as through a well polished online web portal.+Still continuously being updated by the dev team. (e.g. tweaked physics models, new content - view the latest changelogs)+Whilst the mini-DLC store purchases may SEEM expensive, you can be selective in what you purchase in order to compete online. E.g. if you're cash strapped, a single car/livery is very cheap, and 'packs' are often discounted substantially. This allows you to purchase only content that you're interested in racing, ultimately lowering the cost of racing when compared to other racing titles.+""Try-before-you-buy"" feature available any car/track - to avoid disappointment.+Most rotational leaderboard competitions are free to enter (even if you don't own the car/track). Negatives -No 3rd party mod/downloads (e.g. compared to Assetto Corsa). However it DOES support memory sharing, which enables you to run 3rd party applications such as CrewChief (must-have), telemetry dashboards etc.-[Reviewer note for 2017] There used to be more negatives listed here, however over time these have been addressed! I honestly can't think of more significant negative factors to mention at this time. Verdict >Vastly improved over the years. When this game was first launched in 2013 (with very little content, and physics models in it's infancy) it wasn't great. After a couple year's growth, I then considered it a worthy complementary in one's collection to Assetto Corsa, Project CARS etc. Now, in 2017, it has become my favourite sim-title, and the first one I would recommend to friends above all others :)TOP TIP: Purchase all DLC through the store - as it subtracts what you already own from the cost (i.e. do NOT purchase content through Steam) for compounded discounts.

												Absolutely love race room racing experience. Along with Assetto Corsa, these are the driving sims I have been looking for. I have always played driving games like Forza, Grid, F1, NFS & various Rally games on consoles then recently got Project cars. At first I really liked Project Cars graphics, Car selection and tracks selection but in my opinion the games play ability was my problem. I tried playing it with an Xbox controller which I found very frustrating and no fun at all. I was told to buy a steering wheel for the ultimate experience. So after a couple of months and much frustration, I said what the hell & bought a £270 steering wheel which is compatible with Xbox and PC. Project Cars was actually much better but I just did not like the game play and car feel on track. As my new steering wheel was also PC compatible I started to look for driving sims on Steam. This is where I found Race Rooms. It was a breath of fresh air. At first, I thought it can't be any good if it's free but I wanted to test my steering wheel out so I downloaded it. OMG! Fell in love straight away. This was the game I was looking for. Excellent graphics, great car choice, great tracks, easy to operate and fantastic game play. No more dodgy handling like Project Cars. To enjoy this game to the max, you need a good steering wheel with force feedback. A couple of months ago I was a bit reluctant to buy a wheel for so much money and was concerned about where to set it up. Anyway I gave in and bought one from Amazon and converted my home office. Best thing I have ever done for gaming. I haven't touched my Xbox One console in months. Recently I have even bought Assetto Corsa too. These are my best racing sims at present which I feel comfortable with and can control on the track. I have bought all the tracks and several car packs. On occasions there are weekend discount deals which can save you money. Also, buy VRP credit from Race Room website direct because you get more VRP then buying add-ons directly from Steam. Also, you MUST have Internet connection to play this game. Anyway, I would defiantly recommend this game with a good steering wheel with force feed back and a nice sound setup. No sim game is perfect out there right now because we all like and want different experiences. One mans meat is another mans gravy!			"

												If you have a FFB-wheel, do yourself a favor and try this game! - The tyre physics are based on the ISI Motor engine powering rFactor and make for fantastic car feel. - The sound is momentarily the BEST(!) in any(!) racing sim out there.If the pricing model is putting you off, try the free content for a few minutes. If you like that, wait for sales. Last black friday you could buy all content for the price of a normal racing game, as if the freemium model wouldn't exist.			"

Posted: June 15, 2015
												In a nutshell, this game combines the best features of other sims and puts them together in one fantastic package.  I'd like my review to start on 1 aspect that has taken a lot of criticism, and that is price.Here is my experience: I bought £25 worth of vRP's (the ingame currency) and with it purchased the following:90% of the tracks, DTM '13 pack, and a car from most of the other classes.I have yet to see a multiplayer game i can't join with the content I own and I have countless hours of entertainment ahead of me with the custom championships I can make with all the different classes.All of this with £25 which compares very favourably with other sims out there.  So I absolutely disagree with criticism that it is too expensive, you just need to be smart with how you buy.  (A quick note with how to get discounts, is you must always buy 1 pack at a time, to see the discount for duplicate content reflected in the next pack you buy).On the subject of gameplay, as i say it's amazing, the FFB is powerful and very informative, at the same level (or better) than RF2's FFB which is regarded as the holy grail of FFB).  Physics feel very realistic the cars feel controllable, you don't feel like you're gonna die on every corner which some sims do.  The tires have a grippiness that is lacking in other sims and when you push them over the limit, you can feel (and hear) them fighting for grip whilst still being controllable in a drift.  Drifting the 4wd cars is an absolute blast!  The sounds are absolutely industry leading and the sense of immersion is just incredible.  Put it this way, once you play RRE, you realise there is more to sim racing audio than just engine noise and tire squeal. (and some don't even do those very well)Multiplayer is a big positive too, you can always find a game running and i really like how it is implemented. Players may only join in practise and quali sessions which means you don't have randoms coming in the middle of a race and wrecking you intentionally or not because they don't really care about the current session.  Anyone in a  race has skin in the game and I've yet to see anyone driving in a careless or trolling manner.  Another great thing is the netcode is really good as well as the fact that contacts are handled well. In Assetto corsa for example, if you scrape some paint off someones car, the car will behave like it's been blown up by hand grenade!  Not here, contacts are handled in a  realistic and believable manner and makes close racing much more enjoyable and competitive.So go ahead and try the free content, I have no doubt once you do, you will be heading straight to the store page for your first pack!

												Purchased the game after just a few laps into the Free-to-play as I was hooked.  The SOUND in this game is inspiring and almost as destructuve as being near a true performance vehicle.  I play on an SLI EVGA 780 system and get wonderful SLI performance of 95% per GPU usage and the FPS never dips below an enjoyable level on surround (3 monitors).The tracks are layed out similar to other racing games but in comparason to GT5 or GT6, Grid Autosport and the like you get a feel of taking a corner and fluffing the apex, braking too late or just destroying your engine with a lap in 1st gear if you enjoy playing realistic.  Did I mention the SOUND!  Graphical quality is top notice so learn the keyboard setting to adjust your seat height, distance from the wheel etc to suit your driving style.  The AI is hard when you start and since I am still only 10 p[us hours into practicing, they just zoom passed me like I am stuck with the handbrake on.  Did I mention the SOUND!  If you can use a stereo sound system with a subwoofer you will be in Race Room heaven.Keep up the great work on devloping this game further and keep the large playing base glued to this game.BEST game I had never heard about.

												Gameplay is awsome. Sounds are awsome. I dont recommend you play this with a keyboard tho. You can join competisions and championships online that update all the time. They have a replay system built in thats super easy to use and actually works really well. The game is free but only comes with 3 race tracks and a couple of cars, but buying other cars and race tracks are cheap and isnt really the issue with this game like everyone says it is. To be honest there are no issues with this game so if you feel like geting into sim racing but dont feel like buying assetto corsa or anyother game, then I strongly recommend downloading this, and also, Ignore the hate. All hate for this game is because people are to cheap to spend a couple of bucks for other tracks and cars.			"

Sounds are the BEST of any racing game currently on the market, every car drives fantastic, physics are great, etc etc. Damage model is a bit lacking but the overall gameplay and quality over ride that.

												This game has a great potential as a NFS, Forza or GT killer. But unfortunately it has no multiplayer, you are stuck only at one car, and you   just race alone with ghost car which made this game more boring.. When I first played this game last year I thought that this will be the online racing game with complete features to enjoy without spending any penny, but I was wrong. Of course there's a microtransaction to be able to unlock those, and I have a feeling that this game would become a pay-to-win just like other F2P games out there. Honestly, I won't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												A few years ago, when the game was released, it could not compete with other simulations. Yet, the developers have put in a lot of work to fix bugs and improve so many critical aspects. Today, I can say I am impressed with the result. The laserscanned Nordschleife is in my opinion the best version available, the force feedback has undergone massive improvements and beats every sim I have tried so far, including rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa. While other racing games like Project Cars have prettier graphics, I personally really like the look and feel of Raceroom and it is absolutely sufficient for a simulation. Where it shines, is the sound. It is immersive and powerful. After years of updates, the physics are great as well. I can honestly say, the game has reached a point where the available content has the high quality, SimBin (now Sector 3 Studios) is known for.Of course, as always there are a few negative things as well. At the time of this review, there is no implementation of weather conditions. If you get off the track, the effects of losing grip due to dirt on the tires aren't really perceivable, compared to Assetto Corsa for example. While there already is a lot you can change in the car setup, a few things other sims do offer aren't available yet. For example, different types of tires or tire pressure. You can select the time of day for the race, but as far as I know, it will be static. Would be cool to have a real daytime simulation and dynamic weather.One big contra is the pricing and payment model. I perceive it as intransparent and unconfortable, as they use a virtual currency and the payment system has multiple steps, as it includes their webshop, Steam and its payment methods like PayPal. Not all the bundles they offer on their website are available directly through Steam. Prices are somewhat hefty, but still well below iRacing.All in all, it is a racing sim with great quality tracks, cars, physics and force feedback. The multiplayer features are solid as well. It deserves more attention, and I recommend trying it, even if you've invested into other sims. The Nordschleife DLC alone is well worth the price and the best starting point. Happy racing!			"

Posted: June 11, 2015
												This game has come leaps and bounds beyond where it used to be. As it stands now, RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E) is a fantastic sim that is easy to get into and fun while still being realistic and tricky.The biggest thing you'll notice immediately compared to other racing titles is the sound. Oh lawdy the sound. No game comes even close to the quality of R3E sounds in every area and best of all they are still regularly updated and improved!Physics in R3E is where a lot of the 'purists' will decry it for not being harsh enough, not being mean enough, not punishing you hard enough for mistakes, but I find all of that as a positive not a negative. The physics feel just as tight and clean as the other major racing sim titles without being as punishing as some of the more 'popular' options.Force Feedback (FFB) has always felt decent in R3E but used to be more of a mixed back for many wheel users. The most recent update addressed this by adjusting the defaults for many common wheels (I use a G27 and it now feels great right away) based on feedback from the community. The results are great and the FFB now needs much less fiddling for the finicky users and feels better than ever on default settings.Content pricing is usually a big issue for most people, but considering the high quality of the cars and tracks the price they ask is very reasonable. Not to mention the price is lower than some other games with similar pricing models.All in all there's no real downside to at least downloading it and trying it as there are free tracks and free cars avaialble for anyone to use along with time trial competitions that run for 1-2 months at a time. You just have to try it! =D			"

Posted: December 29, 2014
												In short: RaceRoom Racing experience is a great racing simulator to those looking for cut-throat competitive AI in offline racing. The multiplayer is shaping up to be great, but in its current Alpha state it's not quite there yet. If you're on the fence, try the free content first and if you're looking to spend a few bucks, consider either DTM '92, ADAC GT Masters 2013 or 14, or the WTCC '13 pack. Money well spent.Look below the review for a comprehensive list of Pro's and Con's after the verdict.Visually R3E is a competitive title, on par with Assetto Corsa. Track textures and detail are what you expect them to be in a 2014 racing sim. Everything looks quite sharp and well detailed. Car interiors are nicely modelled as well, leaving only very few wishes to be desired. A few upcoming titles might look a bit better, but we'll see to those as they get released. Ligthing, color and saturation in R3E seem very life-like and real. Lighting conditions can be selected from one of 5 presets: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Evening and Sunset, with full real-time transitions coming later down the road.In the Sound department, R3E really starts to shine. Or roar.Compared to other simulation titles like Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor2, the cars and engines in R3E sound like they have the punch they claim to have. The sound has just the right amount of reverb to immerse you and make you think you are sitting in fact inside of the car you are pretending to be driving at your PC.On the driving side of thins, there is a lot of good to report as well: The physics feel similiar to other hardcore racing sims like rF2 or GSCE. It becomes immediately apparent whenever you push the car too hard, resulting in oversteer and overshooting a corner or massive oversteer and spinning out - or if you are lucky - just a major slide of the ideal racing line. The game does communicate what is going on under your car really well through the Force Feedback. With a little practice you can judge pretty well just by feel if you are about to lose the rear of the car, or whether your rear tyres have just locked up. This is really important in a racing sim, and in this regard R3E is comparable to Assetto Corsa and Game StockCar Extreme, but still a little off from rFactor2. To be fair, the FFB in rF2 is unmatched by any other sim.If you're not up for racing against other people over the internet, R3E's AI will give you a good challenge. They can be either set to a fixed difficulty level (from 80 to 120%) or alternatively to Adaptive AI, which will ramp up or soften the difficulty depending on how well you do against the AI. In general, Adaptive AI is pretty good at giving you just the right challenge. You have to work really hard for a Victory, but at the same time the AI don't leave you in the dust and you always have some other cars to race against.In their general behaviour the AI race hard against you, but fair. They don't bump you out of the way, but they will use gaps to overtake. They will defend their position with defensive lines and not just stick to a single racing line. (I'm looking at you there, Gran Turismo.) In comparision to Assetto Corsa, the AI in R3E is more aggressive, but still fair. Unfortunately the game is missing an AI agression control, like rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme have. I'd like to tweak the AI not just in skill, but also in agression.Now, some time for Multiplayer! There are no dedicated servers available yet, so you have to hope that your favorite track/car combination is currently running on a server hosted by Sector3 studios. The servers are ""jump in and drive"", meaning that if you don't pay attention you might end on a server that has just finished Qualifying and you start a race from the back of the grid. Netcode in Multiplayer is really solid. No cars warping around, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t contacts and bumps between cars that are 2 meters apart on screen. The community is okay, you get the occasional idiot who wrecks half the field and other people rage quit whenever they lose too many positions for their tastes, but additional features like ranking systems and wrecker bans are on the horizon for the Multiplayer, as well as Dedicated Servers for everyone.Now for the most controversial part about this simulator: The Store & The Pricing: Out of the box you have access to two circuit tracks, a hillclimb track and a bunch of cars from different classes. In my opinion that's decent content for a free portion of a game. Some people might disagree, but everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess.Tracks and Cars can be bought with Virtual Race Points or vRP, and after the latest update with hard earned cash directly. This alleviates my previous criticism about having to essentially give Sector3 free money in exchange for virtual currency.Prices are not that cheap, but they are reasonable. A new car or track will generally set you back 2€ to 4€. You can get bigger discounts if you buy more stuff in bulk, or if you get stuff in packs: The DTM '92 pack with it's 5 cars and a ton of liveries is  ~10€ compared to ~18€ when you buy them all individually.Additional discounts are granted to everyone who owns cars and tracks of a new pack: For example, I get a huge discount on ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack, because I already own most of the tracks and cars in R3E already. I think that's a fair system.There is an option to Test Drive all the cars on the RaceRoom Raceway that is included in the game. You can also take part in the free competitions that are changing regularly. Those competitions feature a rotating set of cars and tracks. You don't have to own them to drive them, and if you're fast you might even win a prize!Recommendations for your first purchase(s): * DTM '92 pack (5 cars with a lot of liveries)* DTM Experience 2013 (3 cars, ton of liveries, 9 tracks)* WTCC 2013 pack (5 cars, ton of liveries, 3 tracks)* ADAC GT Masters 2013 (7 cars, ton of liveries, 6 tracks)Verdict: If you have tried this sim half a year ago, please do come back and try it again! The driving physics and Force Feedback have been vastly improved, along with the new and fairer store pricing & discount system. R3E drives just as well as Assetto Corsa, rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme. It has the best single player AI on the market, apart from GSCE and the largest selection of content (sans Modding) of the currently availlable sims.Pro's* Good Graphics* Great sounds* Very competitive AI* Good driving physics and FFBCon's* Multiplayer a bit bare-bones at the moment* Game can get expensive if you want to have everything			"

												I have played a number of racing sims, in fact most of them, this is one of the best. The sound is the best is any sim out there the Force Feedback on my Fanatec wheel is amazing and the graphics are great. In fact this game isnt even that graphics hungry on my GTX 1080 yet it looks fantastic. The AI is brutal when running in hardest setting and no assists, which is the only way to play this game. I think it is one of the best sims on the market.If I had one complaint it is that the Brands Hatch track is the short cart track not the full track. I am sure that Sector 3 can fix that.I woulds also love if they would put the Aussie V8 supercars in.			"

												I really think this model works. Take me e.g., I mainly play with 80s vehicles so why would I want a bunch of modern GT3 cars? Here I can buy what I want to play, just like with the Race-series. FF is as good as any other sim-racer. You really feel the car and as it should be you can't just put your foot down in a middle of a corner. I honestly don't understand people that rates it down because you have to pay for extra content. I guess they wanted all of it for free, which of course is not possible with a AA-title.I play a lot of racing sims and this is highly recommended. If you are a serious racer, you should atleast try it. "

												This game is very underrated and very good, Menu's are easy navigate. Sound is arguably the best in a racing sim. The dance that has to be done to get best value premium pack outside of Steam is unnecessary. I think RRRE's marketing team need to have a sit down and make more content more easily available on steam and try generate more interest as imo it is more fun that AC and PC's.			"

												RaceRoom is mainly aimed at people who watch events like DTM, WTCC and GT Masters on TV. If you are not one of these people there's a risk you won't understand or appreciate the value of this content, since it's very much tied to real-life racing.R3E is one of the best sim racing games around. The attention that Sector 3 applies to every single car and track impresses me all the time. Like all sims the game is best enjoyed with a wheel or perhaps a miniwheel racing controller, however I've tried the game with a regular gamepad and keyboard, and the game still plays really well. Their business model gives you the basic stuff for free, you then pay for the extra content you want. The prices are reasonable considering how much depth each car offers. The game has three levels of technical difficulty: arcade, sim-arcade and simulation. So you don't have to be a racing game prodigee to enjoy this game.The AI seems to adapt according to what racing event you are doing: it is quite aggressive in DTM and WTCC, which is consistent with the corresponding real-life events, while it is less aggressive in the custom championships.RaceRoom aims for accessibility; anyone with an 'OK' PC should be able to play these games.On the negative side: the game does not explain things like setting up pit stops, the adaptive AI system does not work particularily well, the game site can be clumsy to navigate through.On the whole it's a great racing game that offers content that is different from Stock Car/Automobilista, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa and other sim games.

												great sim game. best played with a wheel. ok with a controller. graphics and sounds are very good. don't expect much from the free content. you can try any car on their fantasy track for free. and you can try different tracks in their free competitions(there's usually 6-8). you do have to pay to get the most out of this game. if you buy one car and one track at a time, it can be very expensive, but if you buy vrp from their store(https://www.raceroomstore.com/shop_en/list_page?cat=24) and then buy some car packs and track packs, that will save you a lot of money. look for multiplayer games on evenings and weekends UK time, otherwise it's pretty dead.

												If you jump into the game just play a race and quit it u'll hate it. This game free version is limited to few tracks, few cars and has really difficult gameplay since It's really realistic.Pros: Car sounds are just absolutely amazing, physix are so real, the game is really hard if you remove all helpers but once you get used to the driving you'll love it. Graphics are really good for a free game and you don't have to max them out to see good result.There is the challenges, you get to try cars on a selected track and you can win prizes if you set a good time which is really competitive.The game is not made for controller or keyboard, it is pure for a wheel if you want to get 100% accuracy while drivingDidn't try the dtm experience yet but looking forward to.One amazing thing, is that the game is constanty updating and there is now the multiplayer which is alpha but looking good.

												As a user of some racecims (mostrly iRacing and rFactor2) I think my review will help who wants some real physics. I've raced in RaceRoom experience (the free content) but I'm very tempted to get some paid ones.• It's a pretty decent game. It tries hard to be a sim but in ""Get Real"" the cars are still harder to get damage by crashes than in real world and misses some rules or safety points for multiplayer - like iRacing does very very well. • Supports steering wheels and FFB.• You can try it free.• You can do a test drive in paid cars before decide to buy it or not.Cons:• Should have something like safety points - people get no penalty for intentional wrecking or irresponsible behavior• Some guys going wrong way all race long without being disqualified(hopefully no one would buy some content to do that)• Off-track slowdown penalty is a bit exagerated			"

												Dont listen to people who only play an hour or 2 then post a negative comment because they have to pay for additional cars! those reviews are based on cost, but this game like the other sims on the market has a cost, yes its free to play but to get the best out of the game you need to purchase additional cars and tracks and pay just like you do for assetto corsa, project cars etc! This review is about the game and not the price, also dont listen to those who moan cos it crashed as its probably their pc full of spyware or viruses, never had a problem with this game at all !I own automobilista, iracing, assetto corsa, project cars, rfactor 2, stock car extreme and race07. Each has their good points and bad points but fort me the best 2 are automobilista and raceroom. Why? because they have plenty of options, championship mode, multiplayer, leaderboard challenges and lots of cars and circuits. I also feel that these 2 are most realistic to driving a real car , sometimes in the other games theres always a lot of oversteer and sliding around. However for me automobilista and raceroom are the best at time of writing this review! it's realisitic, has championship modes, multiplayer modes, loads of circuits loads of cars! Its free to play,  yes, but to get the best out of it best to purchase the other cars and tracks.			"

Posted: May 9, 2015
												At the moment, racesim fans like me seems to live in a golden Age of Racing-Sims as there are a a few promising Sims are out on the market. To put a name to these Sims we've got Project CARS, Assetto Corsa and this game here - RaceRoom Racing Experience (short name R3E).As I was a member of the WMD-Kickstarter-Project for Project CARS I have played it a lot and followed the development-Progress from nearly beginning since its release. I was always impressed by its visual presentation and the dynamic Wether and time-progress... Then there was Assetto Corsa... they started to release an early access-Version and I can't hold to get into it... In the beginning i was a bit disappointed because of the strange behavior of the Force-Feedback. After I tweaked it a bit I had some Fun with it but I don't become the feeling that I always want to play it.And now coming to RaceRoom Racing Experience... I started playing R3E in the beginning of the open beta-Phase. It was fun in the beginning but only good for hotlapping as other features were in development. After a while Sector 3 opens more and more features and deliver more and more content. So we've got Famous racing Series like ADAC GT-Masters, WTCC, the modern DTM and even the most famous classic DTM from the Year 1992. And that's the point where I got hooked in the Game. Despite the other Games, in R3E i've got the feeling to compete in a Racing-Series known in real live. In the other games the Races feel like a loose mixture of cars out of the game...Together with that R3E offers me the best Force-Feedback and the best Roadfeel of all... Not to forget - the Sound of the Racecars. There isn't any other Racesim out on the market the comes even close to the Sound in R3E. Multiplayer-Races are very great fun with close door to door fights. In the visual aspect - yes it is not that high polished like Project CARS and it has no dynamic weather at the moment, but it is very detailed. Especially the Tracks are very close to the real thing and modeled with a high affinity. There are no unnecessary Trackside-Objects that aren't there at the real track what gave me a more realistic feeling.One of the most important parts of a racesim is the Physics-Model... At that Point R3E at the same level as Assetto Corsa. Together with the better Roadfeel in R3E this game is the winner for me. Project CARS falls back in that point - fun to drive in Project CARS but not more...One negative aspect of R3E is the Business-Model of it. It is called Free-to-Play, what it really is, but only with reduced Content. In F2P you have 5 Free cars and 3 Tracks with 11 Layouts. With this content you can do what ever you want - Multiplayer-Races. Single-Player-Championships, Hotlapping and so on. Together with that, there are always a few Competitions online, in which you are able to drive with Cars and on Tracks you haven't bought before. If you want to buy something, it can get expensive. But there are a few Tricks to get it in an acceptable range. So you can buy a Redeem-Code for the ingame-currency ""vRP"" directly from Raceroom which offer a discount from 10% to 35%. Than you can buy Packs in the store which contains content-objects for a discounted price. The Track-Packs are perfect for that. But you don't have to buy a Car-Pack if you just like one car out of it. Than you can buy that single car and that allows you to drive in Competition or Multiplayer-Races in that Class and other things like that. If you are not sure what to buy, you can always ask at the Sector3-Forum. You will definitely get an answer out of the community - or even from one of the developers. That's another great plus for me, that the Developers are in close contact to the Community and take part in discussions in the Forum.In Conclusion I just can say, that R3E maybe isn't the best in every aspect (graphics, busness-model), but overall for me it is the best RacingSim out on the market which hooked me and entertained me a long time now. As it is still in development it will even get better. "

												One of the most underated Sim out there. Whats hidden behind the ""free to play"" aspect is more worthy of a full price because all the content is worth it. CARS:The cars are all well done and balanced so that there isnt always a dominate car but at the same time true to the real life behaviors. A great variety of racing cars, from power heavy turbo cars of the 70's and 80's to modern GT3 cars to Leman prototypes. Official series are represented, DTM, GT Masters, WTCC and more coming... feel free to test drive them all, buy what you like.TRACKS:The tracks are well created from scratch to the point you dont care about laser scanned tracks, even though they are just beginning to utilize laser scan technology into there future tracks. The Sim doesnt allow modding, which from my opinion is a bit redundent since the other sims out there allow it but quality wise dont represent well, leaving you wanting more official quality tracks from the developer. With each track released the detail and quality is maintained, not some hack job addon. MULTIPLAYER: One the best online racing experiences and just getting warmed up. Netcode is very good, even when racing some from the US all the way in Germany, they use a p2p connection, so close racing is possible, being able to squeeze between two cars or riding the back bumper of your opponent is amazing. Currently right now its open servers with rotating tracks, hosting a practice, qualifying and then a short sprint race. In a matter of weeks they will release dedicated servers, allowing any choice of car and track along with many of the standard features.SINGLEPLAYER: Each official series supports the real life formats. If thats not your thing you can create your own championship, picking your own format and track calendar. AI: Rated among the best, making a good training tool of racing hard and bumper to bumper, but be aware, be on your A game, otherwise they will punish you. There will be times they run into the back of you but thats usually because you braked too early or took the wrong racing line, so awareness isnt always there top attribute. You can choose a set pace for the AI or choose the adaptive AI and watch there speed grow with you. It isnt perfect but as they move through development, it improves.SOUNDS: The best, you can ask anyone, even those who race in other sims, all agree RaceRoom has the most immersive detailed sounds currently. They are constantly improving them as well, adding more detail to the car and track ambient. If you dont believe me, check on Youtube and turn up the volume.GRAPHICS: A very clean and colorful look, with motion blur that actually makes it seem like your going fast. Its improved over the past year and as usual constantly being optimized. The cars definitely fit the tracks in detail, unlike some games where the car or track look better than the other. Partnered with the sounds, its quite the visual experience. Runs well on medium range PC's but does not support SLI or crossfire yet. The game supports different times of day, sunrise to sunset, which looks beatiful across the track.HARDWARE: They support just about every wheel out there or wheel pedal combinations.FORCE FEEDBACK: At a glance the ffb features are overwhelming to tune, but there are many guides and user profiles to build off of. Once you have it tuned its quite a unique feeling, driving the heavy turbo cars is a handful and the modern GT3's handle with weight but finesse. They are always working towards improving the ffb and experience. My advice is patience and try out the various tweaks out there.Final thoughts: This is a great hidden Sim that doesnt get the recognition it deserves. Most people dont believe in the free to play aspect and thats understandable, push that asside and you got something great in your hands. I advise to download and test drive the cars your interested in. Price range isnt too expensive, cheaper than iRacing but like I said its worth the price if you were to buy assetto corsa or Project cars. One thing many people miss is the fact once you buy a official series pack, you own the tracks, you no longer have to purchase them in the other packs, your only paying for the cars. My motto is build the game you want, buy the cars and tracks you like and go from there, once you try them you will want them all. Give it a fair try and enjoy the experience.With whats ahead content and feature wise, the future is bright, so dont miss out.Have a look at my Youtube channel to see what RaceRoom Racing Experience is all about.http://www.youtube.com/c/224lemans "

												Now with Multiplayer!This game has one of the best netcodes I have ever seen in a racing game. Racing online feels almost like racing offline against real people, no lag, no warping and no strange collision clipping... with 24 drivers.  Of course this is only true if everybody has a decent internet connection. Even the best netcodes can't fix slow/broken internet :pEven with only the free content it's a lot of fun but the game encourages you to buy more. The price of the content is okay, not too expensive but not cheap too. Tracks and cars are on sale from time to time and now with the addition of content packs you could get some bargains. I for one don't need any car and track because I have my facourites which I want to drive. Buying them costs less than other sims. Especially with rFactor 2 and iRacing which both need subscriptions to play them online.With the 3 physics levels (Novice, Amateuer, Get Real) there is one level for everyone from total beginner to simpro.

												I would highly recommend this if it wasn't Free to Play, wait for the discounts as that is the only time you should invest in the packs. Otherwise it gets too pricey compared to other racing titles that're out. It's a great sim, just pricey if you want a decent amount of content.Pros: Like every other SimBin title, the physics are excellent. Loads of options for the Races, Sounds, FFB, and other things that other devs overlook. I have to mention the sound design, it's one of the best out there right vnow!Cons: Besides the F2P aspect, my only other gripe is the ""Adaptive AI"" option, I don't recommend using it. It sounds like a cool idea, but it needs work. They either brake-check you down straights or simply just crash into you like they didn't know you were there. Maybe they need to be trained for some time, but it's best to just use the other AI option to save the agro.			"

												BETA Review.  UPDATE6/17/15------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, the game keeps getting better, and better.  It certainly has taken some time to get here, but the game and its content very, very good.  The recent patch has made a number of much needed updates and optimizations.  The dedicated servers has seen the online community grow, Tracks like Shanghai and Macau and cars like WTCC 2014 have really set this sim apart.I have no idea how this game has such a low comunity score....well I do, its the F2P model...which really isn't F2P....I would really give it a go, the cars and tracks are some of the best done of all the big sims out there, iRacing, Pcars, AC, imo.UPDATE 11/01/14----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So I bought a wheel G27, and am really enjoying the game.  Much better with a wheel, although a controller was decent and has some advantages, but it is really not the way to go with a sim.The updates that have been done have massively improved the game:  Time of day, updated Force Feedback, track and car physics improved(check to see if which cars and tracks are updated).  It still has a way to go, but is so much better.  The WTCC cars are a blast.  The ADAC GT cars are big heavy beasts.  DTM is somewhere in the middle.  Once the game gets a championship(pit stops and tires) and MP gets out of Alpha there will be a very, very solid game here.I would definitely check it out...it is starting to take up a chunk of my life!------------------------------I am new to ""sim"" racing games.  Always loved a good race game in my youth (a while ago now), Super Monaco GP, Daytona,  Ridge Racer etc...  I bought Ridge Racer Unbounded for a couple of bucks and forgot how much I enjoyed racing games.  The drifting was so absurd, but it was fun.  I started looking at other types of racing games and saw this one and it was Free to play.  UGHH.  No harm no foul trying a F2P game.  It doesn't cost anything.  I figured I would download the game, play it for a week and then be done with it… Well fast forward a couple of weeks; I am having a great time.  Using an Xbox controller, this took a long time to calibrate correctly.  It was quite a challenge at first, I like difficult games.  I really want to upgrade to a wheel... but patience!  I don't really understand most people’s complaints with the game, it seems most people/reviews say the game would be really good if this or that was fixed.  A majority were very minor complaints but together resulted in poor reviews.  The core of the game is strong, but there are issues with the game.  I can forgive them at this point since it is still in Beta and I haven't spent a penny on it.  The game has potential to be a LOT of fun as areas are improved and features added, but it will be interesting to see if the studio can get this title to that point - With the restructuring of the studio, hopefully they continue to improve the game at an acceptable pace! :)Oddly this was one time where the F2P model worked in my favor. I can see someone who wants all the goods to be annoyed with this model, but with common sense and waiting for sales you can probably pay for the tracks and cars you want and get out of it with little spent.  If you want it all or a lot, the model fails.  You would think they would offer tracks and cars in packages for a reasonable savings.  Maybe they will change the F2P model a bit to allow for both ways to owning the complete game? I am just waiting for the DTM Experience to go on sale and I will definitely buy it!!!			"

												After trying out lots of current sims (Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Dirt rally, Stock Car Exreme etc) I still wasnt satisfied! So my search continued - at first I looked back and played on some old sims.Rfacator 1 with DTM and Blancpain mods and also Race Injection with all add ons! THIS is what im talking about, over the top tin tops going hell for leather in believable envirnoments - so much more than cars just driving around tracks, these old sims have a lot of character.So I started looking for a suitable up to date equal. RRE is just that! I didn't think too much of the demo content, but went ahead and bought the DTM 2013 experience. It is so satisfying, great selection of tracks, cars, and game modes. A proper championship to conquer, race against ghost cars from the leaderboards, a competion for fastest lap (with a prize of DTM 2014 for winners). There is so much content that I will actually play and enjoy here!ProsFree demoContent starts at a very reasonable price - dont buy it all at once, buy one experienceGreat AIGreat physicsOutstanding soundGreat performance on Win 10ConsGraphics look slightly dated, worse than Assetto and Pcars but better than almost everything elseMultiplayer still in alpha, it works, but its not as good as IRacing (what is!)Confusing pay model, it is simple in essence, but add ons are avail from steam and direct from publisher tooMy rating:GraphicsNothing offensive, but nothing earth shattering either8/10SoundAmazing, RRE leads the field, nothing can touch it10/10AIVery convincing, much better than AC and PCars9/10ValueFree to start playing and very reasonable prices for DLC9/10FeelGood physics, they dont feel cheap or incorrect in any wayNice FFB, everything is there, nothing is jarring or over doneHandling feels more forgiving that AC but not as easy as PCars9/10Overall85% - Dont judge just from the free content, splash out on an 'experience' (DTM 2013 was cheapest for me £7.80 at time of writing) and really see what this game is capable of!This will be my next purchase for this game ;)

												This game has been receiving loads of updates recently and the more i play it the more i want to.  Plenty tracks and cars to choose from to get you going for free.  The game is very brutal to you for your mistakes. Using Apex Hunt for practise will get you understanding the car and track. Hitting corners within cars capability feels sweet with regard to how you have car balanced in relation to amount of speed, braking or acceleration; depending on the line you take. You have to set the car up for each corner to hit that sweet spot of being in control or not.Brake too hard for a corner and you will lock up and drift wide until you regain grip, brake to late and carry to much speed into corner you are greatly penalised for your misjudgement.  There are loads of Challenges, Competitions and other race modes.Still finding new features each time I take time to navigate through all the in game options one of which that caught my eye was the ability to capture video and take screenshots from the automatically saved replays from your best lap time for each car and track combination.7.5/10Edit 24/11/2016This games's physics, look and feel with evreything else about this game has just hugely changed for the better.  Brilliant racing simulator.  Most defintely worh checking out if you like motorsport.Like a fine wine this game just improves with age.9/10			"

												I'm fairly new to PC Simulation gaming, the main reason I bought my rig was for Race Sims and so far my time has been spent mostly on RaceRoom Racing Experience. I can't quite put my finger on why. the game feels much, much smoother than the other two i've played (Assetto Corsa and Automobilista), i'm yet to give others a go. Along with having a superior sense of speed, I believe the cars handle much closer to their real life counterparts, mainly because i've been behind the wheel of an open wheeler and it bought back a few key memories and feelings. Annoyingly, the game is a money pit, but hey, the base game is free and i'd be more than happy to invest on just the GT series and WTCC series, but... That's not me, I need them all!!! I've had a blast in the masters and WTCC series so far. I'm really, really hoping they can pick up a WEC license at some point, then this game will literally be my go to. The tracks seem pretty solid, Brands Hatch feels really solid, incredibly close to the real version, this is the only track I know from person so the only one I can really push. Other tracks also feel solid, Force Feedback seems to be creditable with a nice road feel and tyre lean coming through the wheel nicely. RaceRoom seems to be the only game to give me a close race all the way through the race, others seem to have the ai drop off a little at stages. My one annoyance with RaceRoom is that I seem to blast the Qualifying 1 or 2 seconds faster than second place but then the ai stick with me through the race, even though my lap times barely drop off from qualifying. Not that i'm complaining, I love bumper to bumper action that the WTCC delivers. But from my amature opinion, I'd chose RaceRoom over Assetto Corsa and Automobilista, but only for now, Assetto Corsa seems to be going places fast, especially now there's a console version to push the developers a bit. Automobilista is a fantastic sim too, so ♥♥♥♥ing fun, i've never even heard of the developers but they've done a banging job! As soon as they get their hands on a new graphics engine, things are going to go pretty sweetly for them. I believe they got there's engine from the first version of a very popular racing sim with an insane tyre model. They're sticking with it because they know the engine so well which is fair enough, it does need updating though XD But yeah... Add WEC with multi category racing and i'll fall in love with RaceRoom.			"

												Great game, almost up there with titles like Asseto Corsa, rFactor2 and iRacing in terms of realistic driving. One of the most immersing sounds in this genre, and nice looking graphics.It's F2P but the price of the content seems a bit higher than it should be.8/10			"

												Don't be fooled by people telling you the content was overpriced. There's lots of it and you can get most or all of it if you get it on sale directly through the in-game store or website for little more than a full-priced game would cost. I payed about 70€ throughout a year and own all but 4 tracks and have access to about every racing class there is (and there's so many). And I could have gotten the same content even cheaper if I waited for some special opportunities.Just stay away from the packages offered on Steam, they are usually way overpriced. An exception is the new Nürburgring Legends pack. The content, if you don't own anything of it yet, would cost you almost 35 € in the store if you count the single prices for the cars and tracks (which you would normally buy within other packs like GT3, WTCC2015 et cetera where they are also cheaper). Here you can grab it for 15€. With this pack you get two tracks with 7 or 8 layouts, including the Nordschleife, and the cars give you access to about 7 classes I think in which you can participate either in Multiplayer or against AI (AI also uses the cars you don't own yourself). Combine this with the European track pack from the in-game store for example and you already have tons of contents for much less than a full price game would cost you.Apparently the new WTCC 2015 pack on Steam is also quite a good deal if you don't own any of the content yet and prefer to have access to all cars of the 2015 series. It offers a wide variety of tracks with it.If you are new to this game, check it out - you get 11 cars and 3 tracks (2 circuits and 1 hillclimb) for free.The sounds are second to none, absolutely amazing.The Forcefeedback has just gotten a complete overhaul so even if you tried the game at an earlier point already it's worth checking out again. It's great, especially since a lot of classes have also gotten or are about to get a physics update. The new content all have great physics, GT3 also has just been updated. This is of course just my personal taste, but with the new physics and ffb, the driving in this feels a lot better then in Assetto Corsa and PCars anyway.Graphics are nice, tracks have much detail but the game seems to be relatively demanding. On my old 7950 I have to set shaders to medium to get a minimum of 60fps with more than 20 cars on screen.Sadly, the game is lacking weather effects and night racing.The AI however is the best I have ever encountered in a racing game. They give you a good fight, they make mistakes and they usually have a very good player awareness. It often feels like driving against real drivers in MP. Sometimes they are buggy though. A few corners can make them problems depending on with how many cars you're racing and recently they started to take not enough fuel for longer races and some of them go for refueling 1 or two laps before a race ends. But things like this are usually ironed out quickly by the devs.The menus are a lot more cleaned up than AC, and a lot more efficiently designed than PCars.Imo, if you don't want to pay a sh*tpile of money for iracing this is the best sim out there atm with a very nice community.

												My #2 next to Project Cars. I simply wish there was a safety car, weather and time progression and dynamic road surface (rubbering etc.). There is just something about night racing. Granted the casual player would not even bother with these features, this is for the more dedicated hard core player. Seems when it comes to racing games there is a trade off that needs to be made between fun and seriousness, in my opinion this is a pure racing simulator and it doesn't try to be anything else. All cars are race spec, there are no road cars, no parts to buy for the car, no livery editor, etc. You get real life counter parts from real series mimicked ala iRacing.The sound is fantastic, the feel of the cars is much improved over the early beta days, the visiual presentation is fantastic albeit a bit dated (DirectX 9). Overall it gives a fantastic race experience that with hopeful VR support be extremely immersive. The studio has a lot of talent and great foundation to make a next generation simulator in the future. Hopefully they realize their vision in the next iteration, I can only hope that the backend gets replaced while the game stays the same title, no need for a RRRE2, just keep it RRRE and keep improving what is already there.I highly recommend it, if you do try this out, hop in the sillhoutte series cars at the raceroom raceway track (both awesome car and track!) and be sure to use a while, you loose a lot of immersion and feel of the game using a game pad or keyboard, its not gonna give you a poor experience. A G25 works perfect here.I have bought nearly all the content for the game and I am not even upset, you can get vRP from the raceroom store, which is cheaper than buying the cars and tracks within the game, first get the vRP reedem it in the game then buy the packs it will save you a lot of money. I recommend buying the packs that have cars and tracks in them, then the track packs then car packs as you wish. It will maximize the content and getting the 10K vRP for 60$ yields you nearly 90% of the content. This is not different than buying any modern game now, just wish they made it simpler than this.

												Superb racing sim, I really don't understand the negative reviews, are people expecting a non-realistic arcade racer? Excellent graphics, sound, physics and AI. Playable even with just a gamepad (though you really need at least this, not mouse and keyboard), with the correct settings - visit the Sector 3 forum for help wth controller profiles. Also realtively cheap, if you just focus on a particular class - the ADAC GT Masters pack is good value, comes with all the cars and tracks you need for a championship.			"

												R3E is really a terrific racing sim! It was perhaps launched too early with many features lacking or functioning badly, but recently, though still in beta, it has really delivered in my opinion.I also have the ""other two"" contemporary racing games, AC and pC and I must say that I find R3E most fun of these three. For example, I think BMW M1 Procar is even more fun to drive in R3E than it is in pC which I find a blast in pC also. R3E is not perfect, at least yet, but it surely has its strengths. Sounds are just awesome and with the recent 9GB ""patch"" they got even better. FFB is also best of the three games and it deliveres the road feel really well and doesn't even require hours of tinkering with settings to get it right. AI is also the most competent of the three by a big margin, so R3E is perhaps the best choice for the single players at least until AC and pC improve their AI algorithms. Graphics are also quite good, although not on par with pCars, but on the other hand, R3E runs also very well on my three monitor setup.But hey, physics are the most important thing, no? Here R3E fares also well. Physics aren't perhaps the most accurate on the planet, but still very believable and with awesome FFB I like the driving feel a lot. I say it again, I think R3E delivers the most fun experience of the three. Still, R3E is by no means arcade racer and leans heavily towards simming side of the genre.As said and at the time of writing, R3E is still in beta and a work in progress. It is still quite polished and offers pretty much full experience already. It has no weather or full night, but it is otherwise pretty much a full deal IMO. Things I dislike the most are annoying load times, which surely improved with the latest patch, but are still on the annoying side especially on the menus. Micropayment system is completely a matter of opionion and it really doesn't bother me. You can have just one experience set and that gives you several tracks and a class of cars and that's basically all you need. If you wan't more, different packs give good value for money and you get discounts for the packs of the items you already may own.If you like sim-like racing games don't hesitate to try the R3E.  You can do it for free, but of course with very limited options for driving.			"

												RaceRoom is all about authentic world class racing series. If you are the type to get excited about simulating WTCC, DTM and GT World Championship auto racing then this game will definitely impress ! Physics are outstanding - the road feel is very prominent and the suspension action is quite noticeable. Audio sounds are the best I have ever experienced bar none ! The experience packages are a warranted pay scheme because the level of detail and customization possible with this game warrants the pricing on these packs. The game is built by a small dedicated outfit from Sweden and their communication via their forums with the games fans is outstanding. Highly recommended racing sim !!			"

												What I liked about this game is that it's hard.You may be asking yourself: but Schon, how is that good?Well, I'll tell you.I've only played 20minutes of this game & it's harder to play then Forza 4.The game starts you off in a easy to control car.But even in that car, it's pretty easy to spin out. (Trust me, I've done it a lot of times)You can set the opponent difficulty to your desire.Loads of cars to choose from, but most of them are DLC, which is kinda unfortunate.Just like the cars, a lot of tracks to choose from, but most of them are DLC'sI can deal with a game having a lot of downloadable content. I mean, it is free, so what did you expect?The graphics & sound are great too!This is my first real racing game on steam. So, i'll give it a 8/10,The Cons would be:Too much Downloadable content.& that's it! I hope my review was helpful!			"

												Raceroom Racing Experience was my first racing sim. I noticed R3E when steam presented me an ad for the DTM 1992 pack, featuring the Mercedes 190E. Since my first car was a Mercedes 190E and I've been watching the DTM since 1992 I had to get the game and DTM 1992 pack.My first steps in the game were kinda rough. I only had an xbox controller and other than that no clue about racing.I went to the Sector3 forums and got immediate help. Not just the usual Buy a wheel kind of advice. Also advice on how to play with a controller.Ever since my first experiences with R3E I got Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, iRacing and a wheel.People generally seem to complain about the payment system. I don't really understand what the problem is. For Assetto Corsa or Project Cars you have to pay about $50 on steam when it's not on sale and then you still have to buy DLC if you want to. R3E is free to play unlike the other sims. Ok, the free version only comes with a handful of cars and no real life tracks, but you can buy every single track and car individually or in packs. In iRacing you also have to buy cars and tracks individually but on top of that you have to subscribe to use their service. R3E's multiplayer mode has been suffering in the past, however, it's constantly being improved. My personal experience wasn't very good in the beginning. I had high ping and was constantly ghosting. That issue has been fixed and in the last few online races I haven't had any issues at all. Raceroom or Sector3 is constantly working on new content, improving the physics, and working on fixing multiplayer issues.It might not be as shiney as Project Cars is, might not have a multiplayer base like iRacing has, but it has a sound which makes the cars sound like cars, has good physics, force feedback, official licenses for DTM, WTCC, ADAC GT Masters and a growing user and fan base.

												8/10 Great race sim plagued by a terrible payment and content structure. I'm giving this a thumbs up only because it's actually a great racing sim experience with excellent single player AI and vehicle physics. Unfortunately you need to always be online to play. Multiplayer is still hit or miss and sometimes you will get randomly disconnected. I sincerely hope SInBin/Sector3 change this game to a flat pricing fee if they truely want to entice more players to the game. The game content is always on sale at least 50% on their website (cheaper than steam prices) so I wouldn't worry about missing out on sales. I've never seen any of the packs at full price. For example the regular price for the DTM 2014 pack is 8318 vRP or about $85 US without a discount on their site! Who would pay that much!? The permanent discount price is there to get you to buy stuff and is a classic marketing trick!If you're looking to get into Raceroom Experience with minimal cost I recommend the DTM 2013 pack and the American track pack. It only costs about $20 USD and gets you a great race series along with 13 tracks...Circuit Park ZandvoortRed Bull Ring SpielbergEuroSpeedway LausitzMoscow RacewayHockenheimringNürburgringNorisringMotorsport Arena OscherslebenBrands HatchMazda Laguna SecaMid OhioIndianapolisSonoma RacewayAfter that things ramp up in price very quickly! It'll cost you $102 USD for all tracks, three different race series and a big variety of vehicles (but not all of them). Detailed below. Keep in mind this still isn't all of the content available, probably around 75% of it!WTCC 2013DTM Experience 2013ADAC GT Masters Experience 2014DTM 1992GTR2 PackGroup 5 PackAmerican Track PackTrack: Circuit ZolderTrack: Bathurst CircuitTrack: Salzburgring* All remaining tracks included in above packs$102.59 USD Order Total (after discounts)If you want every vehicle in the game expect to pay well over $150 USD for all content. My advice is to just buy the $20 package I listed above and be happy with that. It's the 'best deal/bang for the buck' and still gets you a lot of racing action and tracks for that price. "

 My specs: Medion Notebook with GTX 670MX and i7 3630QM (Win7 Pro) + 28"" Monitor (playing in fullHD)Logitech G920 + shifter Why I recommend the game: For anyone, who is into simracing, with r3e you probably get one of the best, if not THE best racing simulator on the market. I can compare to Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 (Demo), Stock Car Extreme, Project Cars, Grid Autosport, NFS Shift and NFS Shift 2.Different to f.ex. Assetto Corsa, in r3e you can only drive real racing cars, no stock versions of them. There are not only features like tyre rubbing or fuel consumption, enthusiasts have many options to mechanically set up the car the way they want.Physics and force feedback feel great on the G920. It doesn't take long to get a feeling for the car you drive. Never the less it can be preety hard to get controll back after oversteering with some cars. Also you can set up the ffb settings by yourself, if the default ones doesen't suit you.In singleplayer the AI difficulty can be set up in small steps, just like in Asseto Corsa. There also is an adaptive mode.As far as my experiences go with multiplayer, I have a pretty good impression of the community. Didn't met a ""NFS crash kiddy"" yet (EDIT: you actually meet some, especially in races with free content). There are not only extremely quick hardcore racers on the way, r3e is also played by some real life racers, even from DTM.Graphics are state of the art and performance is very good. Only things I miss, are ""bad"" weather effects like rain and wet tracks for more slippery action sometimes. Things you should know/some people may not like: R3e may be called ""freetoplay"". I would describe it more like a bigger demo version of a game, which allows to configure its content the way the customer wants it. So f.ex. if you don't want to drive formula cars, you don't need to buy them. There is the option to do as many test drives as you like of every car, which is very fair in my opinion. You also can drive in hotlap competitions with cars and tracks you don't own.You can purchase every car or track seperately or buy packs (what can be cheaper). I recommend to buy VRP on the r3e store website. As far as I know, this should be the cheapest way to buy content.One thing that is pretty annoying, is the fact, that if you bought a car in the f.ex. GT Masters 2014 Version, you still need to buy the same car again (at least cheaper) in the GT3 or GT Masters 2015 Version.To sum it up: if you really want to play the game with as much content as similiar games offer, r3e is a bit expensive but the price is still OK if you buy packs or take offerings on sale. Conclusion: If you are looking for a racing simulation game and you have a ffb wheel, at least test the game in freetoplay-mode.If you are an ""arcade racer"" and don't want to put much effort into playing and paying, this probably isn't the game for you. Never the less you still have the option to give it a try for free :)			"

												RaceRoom Racing Experience is a free to play car racing simulator.  It worked on Win 10, looked good, played good, sounded good.  Has practice mode.  Has 3 to 4 free maps.  Has 6 free car versions.  To drive you can use: keyboard, mouse, game controller, driving wheel.  Has plenty of options.  Has AI drivers with adjustible skill level.  There was no scripted tutorial, but you can use the Practice mode for that.   Try it, if you like Racing car simulators.For more info:

												My first review 3 years ago was appropriately negative.  The game was an overpriced hotlapping app given the absence of AI opponents.  Now the game is my favorite racing simulation (play it more than Assetto Corsa and Project Cars right now).  I'm so glad I gave it a second chance.Heard about the massive update in November so I reinstalled the game and ran a few races and I was hooked.  The physics model is very much improved since 2013.  Combine this with remarkably better FFB and it's basically a new game.  I took advantage of the Black Friday deal and now have all the cars and tracks.  Love running the ADAC GT, DTM, Audi Sport TT, and WTCC cars.  Tracks are nicely modeled and have excellent nuances including bumps and curbs.  I especially like how well they model the loss of grip when you crest a hill.  You can really feel the wheels lift and the car lose grip.  The AI is very good.  Just run a few races and allow the adaptive AI to adjust to your skill and you'll be impressed.  I really appreciate how imperfect the AI can be, making realistic mistakes and getting into trouble yet not careless and running you off the road.  Significantly better than the AI in Assetto Corsa or Project Cars.  AI in those games feels like robots hotlapping in a perfect line.  Especially Assetto Corsa - very boring AI.  Surprised to hear about so many technical issues in other reviews.  Game runs beautifully for me.  Graphics are gorgeous and fps are fast and smooth.  I'm running an i7-6700k &  Geforce 980 Ti so most games fly.  This game seems well optimized given the 30-40 AI cars with no stutter.  Overall this game has come a LOOOOONG way in almost 4 years.  I went from being a harsh critic to huge fan.  Says a lot about Sector3 Studio's commitment to making this game great.			"

												I've never written a review on steam before.  I have 2 kids and I hardly have time to wipe my♥♥♥♥♥because I have to wipe theirs.  I also have a stressful full time job.  Because of that, and because my favorite games are racing games, I went on the hunt for a great racing game to use as therapy.Assetto Corsa:  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But it just wasn't for me.  It's not a complete game, the environments feel dead, it felt slow, there weren't as many tracks as there are in other games, and it just bored me.  I returned it before I took my morning dump.PCars: This game is sexy af but the the ffb is an afterthought.  I also hated that there is no championship mode available.  In all honestly, it felt like a rushed simcade game.  I did appreciate the graphics and variety of tracks, but the actual driving did not grab my attention.  I didnt feel like I was a race car driver.  The half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥one player mode, and nearly optionless career mode was very Star Wars Battlefront-esque by Electronic Sharts.  I blame this microwave, insant gratification generation of subhumans for that game and this one for letting developers ravage them in this manner, although battlefront is much worse than PCars.This game:  Holy ♥♥♥♥.  The driving in this game is ridiculous.  The driving alone is so intense because of the physics engine and amazing ffb, that within one minute I was sold.  You can feel it when you mess up, and when you're about to.  That makes its so rewarding to run a good race or to recover/prevent a fishtail (which these cars do readily).  The graphics are nice, not PCars level,  but definitely pretty.  The game also runs smoothly on my computer.  I love the presentation and the tracks feel alive, but maybe its because you have to focus so hard to place!  Last but most brilliant is the sound.  My God the sound.  The sound is the icing on the cake of the immersion this game provides.  This game is the truth, and I'll go as far as to say it's my favorite racing game ever.  Also, people talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about f2p, but this is a reasonable f2p model because they have discounts for bulk purchases and you can save money by buying what you like.  In sum, ♥♥♥♥ the other games.  This game is the real deal.  The only cons for me is you can't set the length of the race by laps, only time (♥♥♥♥ you for that Sector), and the cars do an automatic 1080 if someone bumps you or you lose traction.  It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid the way these cars spin but I guess you cant be perfect.  But literally, a ♥♥♥♥ing spectator could fart in the stands and you'll go ♥♥♥♥ing carouseling into a hotdog stand and last place.			"

												It's a good game. But WAY too expensive. To buy all the tracks alone it would cost over £80. The game is basically a demo for a HIGHLY overpriced game. All in, it's unfortunate that this is the economic model we are given. If there was a free to play element with perhaps a War Thunder style tech tree or something (Not sure how it would work but still) it would be possibly the pinnacle of racing games on steam. Unfortunately what the end user is presented with is a game that would cost in excess of £150 to fully unlock with no option to earn any of the unlocks by actually playing the game. It's a massive shame. I wish it wasn't like this. It was fun to play.			"

												Im not usually drawn to do reviews, but i'll take the time out to persuade you that this is a quality product. Of the two offererings about of late, Project Cars & RRRE, I would hands down take RRRE. What it lacks (only slightly though) in looks it more than makes up for in AI, SOUNDS (!!!!!!) and game mechanics and handling. The devs also listen to the community and are patching and or updating/adding all the time with changes to UI, changes to daytime/evening time racing, dedicated servers, create-a-championship (for offline players). New cars and tracks being added all the time, and to a VERY high level. A few of my friends have tried both PCARS and RRRE and have also concluded of the two its the stronger product. I will say, whether its an issue with AMD or not the game does seem to run slower than PCARS. But with a few changes in the graphics menu you can get the game running smooth and fast. I would def recommend this to ANY budding racers out there. The G5 cars are the shiz.POWERFUL RRRE!!!			"

												Looks like a worthy successor to RACE 07 series. Still needs a bit of polish especially in the multiplayer department, but is a lot of fun as it is right now. After a few tweaks the physics/FFB system feels quite natural. The devs keep working on improving the game and it's visible. Competitions are one of my favourite modes. They are a great way to improve multiplayer experience, as it's a nice incentive for drivers to improve track knowledge and setups by competing with others.			"

												Highly Recommend this title for its pure driving model, the raceing is good and i love the championships, it has it flaws GFX not as polished as some new titles but the feel i get in my cockpit through the wheel is great.Downside, cost for content just like iRacing it adds up so choose what you want carefully, i got DTM13 on special and was quite surprised just how good it feels and adjustability in game is great AI is pretty good.I only tried this because of the Dev teams History and Past wich traces back from SINBIN with GTR, RACE and such to Papy to my fav title of all time Grand Prix Legends.Dev is still on going with Multi player Alpha havnt tried yet but its growing.The More Content i aquire the more impressed i am with how Great the Physics are  from DTM RWD race cars to WTCC FWD lil rockets to the Hyper Power of the Zonder R they are just fantastic, you tend to over look the Graphics short falls for a bit.Never thought id get into WTCC FWD racing after ""RACE"" and ""RACE07"" but in RaceRoom the look and feel just great, i created my own championship ( as not all of the WTCC tracks are here a couple missing ) and its a FUN lil car to race the AI are actrually fantastic around Mid Ohip i was side by side with AI for 3 straight laps over cutting and undercutting eachother at ever corner with bearly a bump here n there was bloody awsome ive NEVER raced AI on ANY TITLE that allowed door to door wheel to wheel racing until now...

												It's basically rFactor. So of course it has great driving physics. It feels solid real and you understand why you make a mistake. It's not like NFS where cars behave as if they had plastic wheels and were driving on plastic roads. Your car handles like it should, not like a Hot Wheels car. You put too much gas, you get punished. You brake too hard, you get punished. Just like in real. But once you master a car, it'll be easy for you to set a lap time. A clear, neat interface, great sound work, great driving physics, and very decent graphics. All for free. What's not to like? Too bad its new multiplayer is riddled with crashkids, who presumably be shot to death in real life if they did the same. Simbin also likes to stick their flag notifications in the middle of your screen, blocking the apex when in exterior cam. Other than that, go grab this already. And if you have the money, get the BMW GT2 and Audi R8 LMS, they're top notch cars.			"

The total immersion of sound, force feedback, driving feel, is awesome. As for free-to-play, well, that's just to get you going. If you want a real game, you can pick up a racing series pack for a few bucks that will give you a bunch of tracks and cars along with a mini-career. I've got the DTM 2013 and ADAC 2014 packs, there have decent variety.			"

												This is a great graphical upgrade to Simbins racing games and it still has one of the best physics models. It is a tad expensive to get all the content compared to other racing titles but if you wait for one of their big sales it's possible to get it all for around 120 dollars (and it's probably worth it for how great the driving is). It still beats the incredible expense of buying content and yearly memberships for iracing though. Crazy amount of money to play that game.Just want to add that the best way to get content for the game (as others have said) is to buy VRP packages directly from the Raceroom store site (not the game site) then use the VRP when the game has one of their huge sales on. The way I bought content was to buy a couple of the packs when Steam had a really good  sale on first. I then bought a VRP pack and used it on the Raceroom site when they had a 90% sale (they have these great sales a few times a year from what I've seen). Because I owned two of the larger packs already, I also got additional discounts. I managed to get all the packs on the site (except a couple of the single car packs), around 75% of the cars and all the tracks except 5 for around 85 dollars Canadian total. Keep in mind that Raceroom uses US dollars and my dollar was only worth about 72 cents and you see how cheap Raceroom can be if you live in the US. Definitely worth it in my opinion for this incredible sim.			"

This is a sim racing title. Which means you need a wheel to play this game, preferably a Driving Force GT or better. A gamepad will simply not do. If you are looking for something along the lines of DiRT or Need for Speed, this game is definitely not for you.Now that's out of the way, R3E, in it's current state, is a solid contender in the sim racing genre. Physics feel great and the force feedback is pretty much what you would expect from a racing sim. The game has fantastic sounds and AI that pretty much blows every other modern sims out there out of the water. However, the game does have major flaws which I will talk about further down.ProsFANTASTIC AIIt's pretty much the best out there. Heck, I would even go as far to say that it rivals the old Papyrus sims in terms of AI intellegence and speed. They will not  brake early in the first corner for you to pass every single one of them before the first lap. They will not drive into you because they follow a specific line around the track. You can actually see them race each other and take different lines as you catch them while they slow each other down. They will try to take their position back if you manage to overtake them. You pass someone coming out of a turn and the next thing you'll now, they're back at your side for the upcoming turn. They also sometimes cause accidents of their own which spices things up a little. Overall, it's a nice alternative to public lobby online racing.GOOD SOUNDSProbably the best sounding sim we have, next to the V8 Brazilian Stock Cars of Game Stock Car Extreme IMO. The DTM 1992 pack is probably my favorite. You could hear the car suffering when you damage the transmission, and you could also feel that you are slowing down because of it, which you are.Good car and track selectionThere's a decent amount of tracks and cars in this game. No road cars though. Not that it matters much.Nice GraphicsNot much of a graphics guy, but they do look good. Not as good as Assetto Corsa though.A great sim for single racesIt's a no brainer. The AI can provide very challenging races even if you don't crank the difficulty up. Since every track is made by Sector 3, you can expect the AI to be consistently good on all the track and car combo you can throw at it.ConsThe Free2Play SystemThis one is pretty obvious. Yes, you can only choose to buy one pack if you wanted to. But sooner or later, you will want the DTM pack too, which is another $27. And then you find out that Laguna Seca isn't included in the pack. That's gonna be another $5. And then you feel like you want to try the old touring cars, which costs about $10 if you want to buy all of them. I forgot Monza. Another $5 for that. You've pretty much spent twice the amount of Assetto Corsa and get half of its content through modding.NO CUSTOM SKIN SUPPORTSeriously? Every sim racing game out there ENCOURAGES you to paint your own skins by giving out templates for the cars. This one only comes with the stock skins each car has.ALWAYS ONLINEFor a sim that's best for singleplayer, it's kinda ironic that it has to be always online. Not to mention that multiplayer is pretty much dead.UNMODDALEEver wanted to try an F1 car with the gane's fantastic AI? NOPE! Gotta wait for Sector 3 to do it. That is, if they even consider having F1 in this game.Flag rules not fully implementedThis may be nitpicking a little. You can get black flagged, but yellow flags are nonexistent I believe.Despite the glaring issues of the game, the AI alone makes the game worth getting. If you don't feel like going to iRacing for an online race, you can have R3E for a great single player experience. Doesn't matter if you're driving GT3 or DTM at Sachsenring or Nurburgring. You can expect to have a really good time with the AI.			"

												It's quite good, I guess, if you have to make a quick test on a Racing Game, with your VR headset, since it's F2P, but that's it.All the rest is quite decent, and basically everything in the game push you to buy new cars. So yeah, I suggest to spend some money on a decent racing game, instead of new auto for a sufficient F2P game.Not worth the mon..  ehm.. time you will spend on this.Cheers!			"

Pros:- SOUND!!! Best in a racing game ever- the feeling of driving a car... unbelievable. Tons of fun. You have to feel it for yourself. I wish EVERY racing game had so realistic and pleasant physics and driving model as this game!- supports keyboard, mouse, gamepad, wheel... very satisfying gameplay on any of those.- Force Feedback. I mostly hate force-feedback in games and always turn it off (at least on a gamepad), because it's bloody annoying. Here... here it's a pure masterpiece.- camera controls- replays, saving replays, playing replays (really not common thing these days)- you can test any car and track for free unlimited amount of times- well - it's free (but for a price)- highly configurable in every aspect- runs blazingly fast even on low-end hardware- real-world drivers play it for fun too (they are uniquely indicated)Cons:- no story mode/campaign/objectives/modes etc. - something which would certainly make it more interesting- quite expensive tracks and cars when all summed up- graphics are a weird mix of modern and old standards- why I can get way better time than the Zonda R Nordschleife world record?

												Playing Raceroom since 6months now. Ever since the 1st metres i made in the free cars i was sold to the game. Now 6 months later i own most content (all tracks which are beauties - and most of the cars). The circuits are very well build and have a lively atmosphere around them which is in big contrast with the coolness of AssettoCorsa.. The big variety of cars each have their own charactheristics. From WTCC to DTM92, from Group 5 to prototypes, they are all very enjoyable if you succeed in taming them. Sounds are well, you automatically raise your volume..The community of raceroom is very open, fair and sportive but competitive at the same time. Both on and offtrack.Overall i score Raceroom 9 out 10, it's such a joy to play.. Currently we are preparing online private and public competitions. Hopefully the missing features can only add to the experience Raceroom already has to offer.Greetings			"

												For racing enthusiasts or performance car fans this is a definite add to the ""garage"". The sound effects are first class as mentioned in many reviews. Definitely music to the ears and makes the adrenaline pump, simply outstanding. Having completed my racing license and tracking several sports/race cars over the years, I find the physics very good. Professional high calibre racers would be better suited to comment on the precision of the various cars. It would be great to have a career mode introduced to add to the immersion, this would bring me back to the track more often.The negative reviews with thumbs down due to pay to play model are both unfair and unrealistic. RacRroom make it possible to drive a couple cars and tracks free to sample the game, same as a demo of many other games/sims. Then if you like it, help keep the franchise going by purchasing some cars, tracks or both. If you don't enjoy it, nothing invested. For five or six bucks you can have a couple cars and learn to drive them properly. To truly learn a car and track takes a fair amout of seat time, so there is no need to drop a whole bunch of money right off the bat anyway, then, add as you go.Having only sampled the online competions they seemed ok. This is not what I'm after personally so really have no valid input regarding online human v human competition.In summary, this an excellent and fun sim; for a performance car or racing enthusiast you can't go wrong with RaceRoom.

You will hear the car all the way round the track, it's really impressive.There isn't much AI at the moment, but you can do a track test with 6 AI-drivers and supposedly they already use the ""Adaptive AI"" mode which does what it says, it adapts the AIs performance to yours.

												The game is good fun once you get into it. Nearly everyone I've talked to who has truely taken the time to learn the physics, you'll need to adjust your wheel to you, which will take time. After which it's very enjoyable. I've had so much run racing the 1992 DTM cars, and the 2014 DTM Experience is a great singleplayer experience. the full length championships are my personal favorite. However you cannot properly handle the cars on a Keyboard. A gamepad is an improvement, the Microsoft Speed Wheel is probably the best you can do without getting a proper wheel and pedal setup. I have tired all of these avanues prior to getting a Fanatec GT3RS wheel and CSR pedals.  If you want to get into it, look into getting either Logitech G25 or G27, Fanatac Wheel (Porsche, CSR or clubsport), or a Thrustmaster T500RS, or T300RS.  IT may seem like a big jump, but if you want to really apprechiate Sim Racing, it's the only way to go.There are only a few drawbacks I've found with R3E. First, the interface takes a bit to get use to, it's not as intuitive as it could be. Second, The time investment to dial in your controller settings, Lastly the online hoppers are pretty dead overall (although it's still in Alpha, so here's hoping it'll get better in time).			"

And like I mentioned, the sound and sense of speed, is insanely good. Also this has more and better tracks. AC has modding, but I want good and solid original content, which Raceroom really has. The pricing model is indeed stupid. Though apparently they have massive sales over the year, I heard you got the entire game for like $50 last Black Friday.			"

												Edit after a year or so. This sim just keeps getting better. The latest release with the fantastic nordschleife really puts this at the top of the racing hill. They also worked out a few bugs that were sometimes interrupting the fun - no more. What was previously a great game with issues is now starting to really get polished. There is no better sim racing experience that getting into a good online race with this game. Shell out the $20 for some paid content, join some big-boy races with respectful racers, and never look back. The pricing model works well for me because i can buy once (still cheaper than the other sim) and not worry about a subscription. Again, no other racing sim gets my adrenalin flowing like this one - it really conveys the feel of speed and competition. Single player is quite good as well especially for European racing fans, but i'm more of a multiplayer user. Again if you are a sim racer and have not tried this in the last year, do yourself a favor and try it again - then judge for yourself. Even using the free content to get a taste should convince most. There is still the odd bug or two, but the devs pay attention and always take care of the issues that the community brings up - for instance - currently player names above the cars are located off screen for triple monitor users. I believe this is about to be fixed in the next patch (as of 6/13/16), along with taking care of those with low ping to not ruin races. Check out the forums here https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.phpFinal thoughts - at 450 hours played, i really should be faster! But i'm getting there....Original Review: Great racing sim. There are sims that do certain things better (AC graphics for instance) but as a whole package, this is the sim that makes me feel the most like i'm in a car driving and gets my heart pounding. You just feel like you are there, which is the whole point of a sim right? The Raceroom track that comes free is great too, and i like being able to pay for what i want, even if it can get pricey if you want a ton of content. Thumbs up!			"

												It's not the perfect SIM, and never will be. Imo, for the perfect SIM you need them all. I own, AMS, PCars, Dirt Rally, Race 07 and although I enjoy playing them all I have over 400hrs in Raceroom compared to 40+ in other Sims. Graphics rant up to PCars standard, nice and it is dx9, but physics and Emerson are way above. I love this game and my system with only a 750ti can max out most graphics , so those with bigger cards have 4k,VR and silly amounts of A.I at thier disposal. The free to play base game comes with enough tracks and cats to hook you into making some dlc purchases and factoring in costs of buying a game and/or content/season pass, Purchasing starter pack or even the pro pack gives good value.There are some bugs and some key elements missing, but there is a very good community and a good dev support via the Raceroom forum.Single player is great fun with the improving A.I, and some close races can be both fun and rewarding. Car physics and force feedback, especially the dtm/gt3, is some of the best I have experienced, AMS may just nudge ahead but but then loses out on the visual and immersion. Sounds too are amazing and really pull you in with surround sound and cockpit view.I've only played a few multiplayer races and can't really say much about that, usual w reckers on free content servers,not all, but there are some good community leagues and the game itself a host competitions, some of which have prizes to be won.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys track driving and although best enjoyed with a wheel, imo, there is full support for control pad.

												All these years I haven't been able to launch this game. Steam must have fixed something. My AVG virus control and Malware bytes are also running at the same time. That excuse went out the window. Out of the twenty or so Sims I have, I now rate this one at the top. The graphics, driving, handling, audio- well, what can I say about the audio? Don't expect to hear a chain saw buzzing. These are real race car sounds right down to the whining of the transmission. If you wish to purchase ad ons, do so. If you don't-don't. Just enjoy the driveI highly recomend this game			"

												I dont get why people think that this sort of game (just look at the quality of racetracks and cars) will be almost free. This game is more like a racesim constructor. u will get all u need to drive a few rounds for free. but if u want more u have to pay. its totaly legit and fair since u just pay what u want.sure the prices are a bit high but its okay for me. i spended 26€ so far. now i got 7 additional car with 3-7 paintjobs per car. a lot of new tracks and two different race classes.if u dont want to pay. u will get a few cars (should be 5) from different classements and u can drive a 3 courses. this courses have variants so its not getting bored so soon.my thoughts about this game? its realy awesome. the forcefeedback feels realy good. the racetracks looking realy good (okay the race audience could be look better). the cars performing realy good.so all in all this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. just dont expect u will get an triple A title for zero bucks. expect a triple A title if u invest some bucks. ;)			"

												This is probably one of the best FREE TO PLAY racing simulators on the market, definitely worth downloading!However, there is paid DLC for more tracks and cars, and there are plenty of free events to enter with legitimate prizes!I would say 5 stars, but it deserves 4 stars due to paid DLC instead of releasing a complete game.

												From GTR2 to Race07 to this, SimBin (Now sector 3) has produced some of the best racing sims out there. Yes this was a bit of a handfull when it was released but as its been develloped, its been refined and polished into a fantastic sim, that allows for a ton of on and offline racing fun. With added DLC (optional) you can race a ton of cars and tracks (my personal favs are the DTM and WTCC cars). If you have played their older titles, try this one out, it may not be perfect but its still a ton of fun!			"

												I have been playing racing sims fpr a long time and have to say that so far RaceRoom captures the feel of racing better than any other I have played.  It takes a few tries to get the feel of the cars but that is because of the excellent physics engine.  I really hope they move into some rally cars and tracks, but what they have so far will keep me busy for months.Another plus is being able to see the results of real world racers and see how close (or not) you are to their times.

												This is a great game,  Yes for FREE you only get a few cars and tracks, but its not P2W. If you don't have the cars/track then you cant race, so your never at an disavantage. There is 50+ cars to get, but a pack are better value as you can get tracks and cars. PROS:Other than race using you own purchased tracks and cars, RaceRoom has these two great features;* Practice in any car.  Seen a car you like, give it spin for free.  Same track each time, so you can get a really good feel for the car.* Race Room Competitions.   These are free and you don't need to have purchased the tracks and cars. You compete time trails against other players and your ghost car and you are ranked in a league.  CONS:  * Mainly a single player experience at the moment . Muliplayer is good but still in alpha.* DO NOT BUY ANY DLC FROM STEAM. Instead buy content from the game portal, which is connected to your steam account.They have sales and at the moment you can get DTM 13 for £6.20.  It will also give you a small volume discount and if you buy a pack which has tracks and cars that you already own, then you get a futher discount.  For example I have DTM 13, so DTM 14 is £9.20.  I'm making the jump from from arcade to sim racing and this is much more user friendly and cheper than iracing and even Assetto Corsa. Play it yourself and see what you are missing.			"

												My Prefered choice of racing sim 8/10had plenty of experience in racing sims over the years .competed in hindreds of online leagues and compsRaceroom is worth checking out,its free to play  but limited to a couple of tracks and car modelsOther stuff you can buy in the storei bought the euro and yank tracks and GT2 and GT3 series cars for around 20usd in game storeSteam also sells pack add onsSo,Pricing is reasonable,the Bathurst track was 3 bucks.i challenge anyone to find a better representation of mount panorama in a sim,simply wonderful.Online play is good with plenty of options for hosting a Dserver or just joining a league raceSimbin struggled with connection problems years ago but it seems that it is just a bad memory now.however the occasional server update or maintenance may get in the way on the rare occasionEuropean racing is the core of this  sim and you are spoiled for choices of series availablePhysics and feel ,the sounds and the visuals make this the better sim for my taste.Unlike rFactor,its not a game where you must hunt for mods and racing series to play something you like or needbuy what you want and add more as required in the easy to see and use in game storeyou can even test drive cars before you buy them.very coolthe car models are painstakingly copied from the real thing,the Porsche GT2 is simply the best version of the car in any sim and that goes for most of the other cars i have bought.Stats and laptimes etc are all recorded and you can challenge other players in the leaderboard shoot outs for fame and gloryIf you liked GTR1,2 and GT Legends,race07 etc,this sim will feel right at home.if i had one minor complaint it would be damage modeling graphics could be improved,cars can take an atonishing impact and still drive away,most times.i understand why they chose this model.its designed to keep you racing after a heavy spin.so this may detract from the hardcore simmer,but,cars still break or fail so its not so bad.its about resource management id suggest,why waste too much time on what a car looks like when it hits the wall and 300kmh and is out of the race, concentrate on the racing performance instead.8/10			"

												I first played this game back in 2013, and was underwhelmed. On a whim, I decided to fire it up again last week, and I've been blown away by just how much it's changed for the better. If you are a fan of motorsport or racing games, I highly recommend this game. The pricing model is a little cumbersome at first, but if you buy a pack such as DTM 2015, you'll find yourself with a fair amount of content for a reasonable price, and you can add more packs gradually if you feel like something different. The inclusion of licensed motorsport series is a plus, and the track list features some interesting European tracks that I haven't seen in many other racing games. The car handling and sounds are outstanding, and the graphics are quite decent too. The actual racing is some of the best I've personally experienced, depending on the AI settings, races can be quite close and the game does a good job of replicating the aggressive doorhandle to doorhandle nature of touring car racing. Perhaps the neatest thing about the game is that you can try it out before commmiting to buy anything, so don't take my word for it, try it out! I give RaceRoom Racing Experience a solid 8/10.			"

												I have to say firstly i don't write reviews, but i felt i had to as this game is massively under rated.  So much has changed i'm glad i gave it another go. I thought it had lost its way a while back but things have certainly changed for the better. Definitely one of the best sims out there atm, Graphics are good, 3 screens looks good, a little optimization would help so fps are more stable, that said its not an issue, i am running it on ultra where possible and it only drops to 58 occasionally with vsync on. The 980's are coping nicely.Sounds are very realistic and clear, surround is good.The AI are the best in any racing sim right now.The cars feel good, the feedback to the Fanatec Clubsport is excellent, FWD WTCC cars are spot on, that said the BMW is awesome, driven correctly it will stay with and often beat the FWD cars which can be tough on certain circuits.Had a lot of online races and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them, just need to be able to host servers ourselves but the multiplayer clearly states alpha so i'm happy to be able to even race online right now.There are a nice selection of tracks, would like to see some more from the UK but that's my preference.I purchased the majority of my content while on sale, not sure i could justify the full price to be honest as it seems too expensive as it marketed as a ""FTP"" game, which kind of leaves you feeling mislead and maybe a little cheated. My suggestion, try it, get some content on next sale, you will be pleasantly surprised. The free stuff didn't appeal to me at all, the paid content obviously is a lot better (for me).Never know the dev's may realise all they need to do is sell it as a normal game none of this ""FTP"" marketing, then people should buy it.

												Can't recommend this game. You can't play offline since it's server based so the day they decide to pull the plug you are SOL and say goodbye to all of your purchases. The AI is typical and predictable since it's based on the ISI rFactor engine. There are plenty of racing sims that allow for offline play with solid physics that also have multiplayer as well.Many of the DLC are overpriced as well.			"

												Don't let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race. It is a very good simulation but there are some that would say otherwise due to not taking the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal has more positions than just nothing to floored.Now thats not to say that this game doesn't have flaws. After all what games these days don't have a flaw here and there? The only big flaw for me is that the AI has vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the Devs are working on fixing that issue right now. Online races in this game are a real blast in Get Real mode but first I beg you to log practice time in this mode. Based on the multiplayer races I have seen lately people think that get real mode is going to be like driving a normal car in real life.Now the problem with that kind of thinking is that the engines on these cars are made to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so Get Real mode takes some practice but after you master it it is definately the best mode. Another thing the devs might add soon is an offline mode which will be great for unexpected times of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want.In short yes this game has some flaws but so does every other game ever developed so if you really like racing give this a try. I mean its free so you've got nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you don't like the game but wouldn't you have burned that time gaming anyway?			"

												I'll be quick about it. It's a racing sim. Get it. Play the free competition challenges to see if you like it (no reason not to imo). Then and only then consider buying some vrp's from their store when on offer (-30% sth) and buy ONLY packs on offer (avoid getting single tracks/cars since they are included in packs which at some point will be on offer). Stick to my advice above and check it out. They have leaderboard challenges almost every week so you can try new cars/tracks even though you don't own them for free!Check it out:

												This game really does need a steering wheel / pedal set to get the best out of it. Controlling any of the cars with the keyboard is hard. A game controller might make things a bit easier, and the game does support mouse steering, but neither of these is ideal. The free to play content has some very high powered cars which make keyboard control even more difficult, which is one reason that a lot of players give up after a short time.If you've got a wheel and pedals it's a different matter. I love it. The cars feel 'alive' - challenging and fun to drive. The AI is really solid, the sound is awesome and the graphics are nice too. A real gem - the ADAC GT Masters 2014 and DTM 2014 packs are simply brilliant and make for some seriously exciting racing against the AI. It's good online tooUpdated stuff....Some folk are complaining about the ""free 2 play"" description for RaceRoom. I agree, it's a bit odd, maybe the label's a hangover to the old SimBin days. The free content isn't a particularly good example of what the game's actually like. There's a (non-Steam) demo of the ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack available here: http://adac-gtm-experience.com/demo/there's also a DTM 2014 demo here:http://www.dtm-experience.com/en/demo/might better show the game off.The price of the content varies a lot depending on how and when you buy it. If you take a little time figuring out what's included in each pack, it's possible to get a pile of good tracks and a car set for £12 - £15 - the DTM 2013 experience is particularly good value at the moment, even thought there's no sale on (sales come round every month or two). Once you have plenty of tracks, you can buy a single car from a car set (they're free to test) and can then use that car to race against all the other cars in that set (on or off line).If you assume that you'll spend as much as a normal full price game (say £30) then you can get a substantial slice of the content.The pace of development is impressive - lots of good stuff has been added recently like the WTCC 2014 car pack. And there's a big physics model overhaul in the works, along with a new ADAC GTM pack for 2015.One final thing, if you like the game there are some cool 3rd party addons like telemetry widgets and my own Crew Chief app here: https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?threads/offical-release-of-crew-chief-version-2-now-with-volume-controls-and-even-launches-r3e-for-you.2516/ "

												After almost two years of floaty physics, stuttering, bad communication, outrageous prices and lack of racing, R3E is finally turning around. Regular sales bring the content to more sensible prices, the force feedback has been tightened up to give better information about the car, the physics are more precise and very detailed and the setup makes a big difference. Most of the racing right now is in the DTM series, but the challenges are fun and allow you to try several cars and tracks without paying a dime. Visually, it's a bit bright and bold, but the environments look good and clear. Visibility and details are high, and the shadows passing on the dashboard look really nice. The performance on High settings with 8x AA with a 750ti is 60 fps when there's only one car, so I think the optimization is pretty good as well.The sounds are probably the best you'll hear in a racing game, whether it's the samples themselves or just the richness of the chassis squeaking, the transmission, the tires, etc. Everything is there and sounds great. No other game comes close.The interface is still complex and confusing, and some options are only available from the main menu. The FFB is very adjustable, but the settings are not explained much, so it takes a lot of fiddling to get everything right. For me, that means G25 and TH8RS. The modern cars don't default to auto-clutch, which is lame. Because the game looks and sound so good, and now that the FFB is finally letting the new and tighter physics shine through,  Raceroom is becoming a killer racing game. I never thought it could be possible, but out of this could arise a GTR3 people have hoped for. In the meantime, doing time trials, challenges and racing in DTM is a lot of fun.To newcomers: skip the free content and go straight for the competitions, this is where the higher quality content is. It cycles through cars and tracks regularly, so you can sample stuff until you find what you like. The freebies are still the old wobbly garbage from 2012, it seems. I think everything will be updated over time.			"

												Picked this up since it was free, figured I'd give it a try. First night playing, it was ok. The graphics are good. The physics seem good while providing a challenging driving experience. Although it did take me another day to get my FFB sorted. There really is no explanation for what some of the settings do. (or a short rather canned one)Once I got my FFB dialed in, the game/sim really started to shine. I use the Logitech G27 with pedals and H-shifter. A wheel really is the preferred way to get the best experience, though I'm sure there are a handful of controller users out there who can rip it up pretty good.The sounds really are pretty amazing. Especially when you start to drive different cars. Considering I've got 12 hours and 128 laps under my belt in one weekend, its safe to say I'm hooked. If the devs can continue in the right direction with development, R3E has a lot of potential to be great! And don't be turned off by paid content until you at least try the free stuff. Other racing sim organizations (not mentioning any names) do the same thing.=====Update 02/13/2015======After 1100+ laps and over 2 days of total in game time I can say I'm still hooked. The most recent update Feb 2015 improved the AI and optimized the graphics. Dedicated servers are coming soon. I believe this year which will open up online racing leagues.I own almost all the cars. All tracks and all packs but the hill climb. Yes a little pricey, but worth it IMO. The devs stay in constant contact with the community which is more than I can say for other games/sims. New tracks and cars are still in the works, the most recent upcoming new track, Sonoma and the Cadillac CTS VR coupe to be released soon as paid content. R3E has only gotten better since I've been playing it and it was pretty good when I started with it anyway. R3E is definitely to be taken seriously among other race sims currently on the market.			"

I have a GTX 970 and on full settings only utalise 70% MAX with full field of cars.Best racing sim out there without a doubt at the moment.Buy one car in each class and the track pack and its supprisingly good value also.

												So here I am writing a review for RaceRoom Racing Experience. So my first impressions of the game are good, in terms of gameplay the sounds are immaculate and very realistic. The force feedback you recieve through the wheel are really good and racing is challenging especially in multiplayer.Pros:-Great Sounds-Great Force Feedback-Car models look good-Racing is a challenge and you feel like you are in a real car-Has support for all controllers (wheels and joysticks and controllers)-You can make your own overlay for a race and broadcast it live-If you drive the wrong way you ghost meaning that trolls cannot crash you out using a head on collision-Physics and handling are very realistic-Different modes: Novice, Amateur and Realistic-Decent Graphics and fps with support for high end and low end spec computers-Good default overlay-So many things that can be changed in settingsCons:-The free mode only comes with 3 (I think) car series and 2 (I think) tracks-No pit crew/garage interior-No Career mode where you can make your own racer and have any sort of car improvement-Mirror visibility is not great and hard to depict cars until they are too close to try and defendI realise this game is still in development and i am looking forward to more content but I think sector3 studios have done a fantastic job on this game so its a thumbs up from me.Therefore I would rate it 9/10 as there could be a few things that could be improved (like adding some more free dlc etc.) but it surprised me with how good the gameplay was.

												tl:drRaceroom Racing Experience is a competent racing sim but also a good videogame that is easy to recommend to both a more hardcore audience as well as friends of racing games in general. The recommendation does come with a ""but"" or two, some minor, some major. At the very least see bolded part a couple lines below before deciding to spend money on it.The Cons-R3E is a free ""content sold separately""-type of game, which almost inevitably means ALWAYS ONLINE DRM. Occasionally the server is under a heavy enough load for even the main menu to barely work, which is really frustrating as you might imagine.-The collision physics - at least against the AI - are complete BS. Just tapping an AI driver with your car tends to send you into an unrecoverable, Mario Kart style spin for no apparent reason. It's far from undriveable in singleplayer, but I can't understand why such an obvious issue has persisted for years.-While you can turn off all the camera shake to alleviate potential motion sickness issues, it leaves you with a camera that is completely rigid relative to the chassis. With lower cars like formulas and prototype cars it can result in really intense shaking that makes it hard to see where you're even going. I've never gotten motion sick but I had to just stop after a race with the formula 2 cars at Zolder and do something smooth because the constant shaking made me feel a bit queasy. GT cars are much more manageable.-Raceroom is not at all moddable, and the rigid nature of what you need to own to race with cars from a series can be a turnoff for some people.-The FOV setting is a multiplier, but there's no mention anywhere of how wide the default field of view is.I think that's most of them. I'll update later if I remember anything else that I'm not too happy about. On to the pros!Pros-Like I mentioned in the tl;dr section, it's a decent enough racing sim, but of all the sims I do own (iRacing, AC, Rfactor 2), this is the one where I sometimes just put the difficulty to amateur and race with all the magic stability assists and stuff, because the driving remains fun. This is also the only of the aforementioned sims with an inbuilt Championship mode.-The variety of cars and tracks is good. Now, the complete package is ridiculously expensive, but Raceroom offers roughly videogame-priced packages that gives you a series of cars and some tracks to race around on. It's also very easy to be picky after you have tracks. For example to race a series, let's say GRT3 since it's the GT3 class with the highest variety of cars, you only need to buy one of the cars and a livery from that class. That's roughly 3€ total. The AI is free to drive even the cars you don't own. The tracks are the expensive part, at around 5€ each. Still a better deal than iRacing I suppose.-The AI races you hard. It probably only loses to Rfactor 2 in the competition for the best racing AI. The abovementioned collision issues are there, and the AI likes to stick its nose wherever there's a gap for even a second, but largely they leave you just enough room to fight for position without being punted out.-R3E is the best sounding racing sim by far. All the chassis squeaking and stuff really adds to immersion.-My experience is that the game runs really well for how it looks. Not sure how it is with higher performance machines.-Force Feedback might not be the objectively best one, but it sure is extremely customizable.			"

The AI is free to drive even the cars you don't own. The tracks are the expensive part, at around 5€ each. Still a better deal than iRacing I suppose.-The AI races you hard. It probably only loses to Rfactor 2 in the competition for the best racing AI. The abovementioned collision issues are there, and the AI likes to stick its nose wherever there's a gap for even a second, but largely they leave you just enough room to fight for position without being punted out.-R3E is the best sounding racing sim by far. All the chassis squeaking and stuff really adds to immersion.-My experience is that the game runs really well for how it looks. Not sure how it is with higher performance machines.-Force Feedback might not be the objectively best one, but it sure is extremely customizable.			"

												-I've played a lot of racing sims in my day (read old guy) I had nascar back in the day, luved it, had Grand Prix legends (now there was a racing sim for hard core enthusiests), So when I say I enjoy playing this, then its probably pretty good.The physics and damage models are well done. shows some definate time and effort. Bear in mind though; as I haven't had an adac car doing 120MPH all i can do is say that it ""feels"" good. They have 3 settings for driving: novice/not so novice/ and what they call ""get real"" Each one has incrimental setting controls over the previous to the point where you can control the bump and rebound and spring rate of your car. I like this, it's more immersive and should give you better handling characteristics. Which I don't know about yet as I'm still in the novice stage, and you learn real fast not to have a heavy foot. See the warning sign for the corner?...means brake...now! I did try the ""get real"" setting though, and I found it a lot more ""hands on"" if you know what i mean.One thing about this game is it is a micro-economy game. If you want more tracks you need to purchase them along with cars. You can purchase them in packs or 1 at a time, The packs are cheaper to buy cars and tracks ""enmasse"" but more than individual purchases (I bought a daytona car for $3 USD and a track for $2USD), whereas if I purchased a pack it may run me $50 with 5 cars and several tracks. There is a definate learning curve, and if you don't like actual racing simulations then you should move on to a more ""friendly"" arcade racing game. As the AI in this will definately give you a run for your money. Although I found it a tad too pushy sometimes, they have no qualms about hitting you, and that sucks when you 2nd 3 laps in and then your last and 15 seconds back of the pack!! I haven""t gotten into any online races yet (kinda wanna get to the point where I'm not hitting every wall first) But There is a lot of online servers, however for where I am, there seems to be less closer ones with a lower ping. hopefully thats just a time differential.all in all I like this game. I find the graphics nice (but I'm not sight-seeing at 120MPH approaching a chicane lol), and there is a lot of variety. The sounds are nice (deep throaty engines and squealing of tires.), and the user interface is also nice. If your stuck on something and want to immerse yourself into racing, then this is a good purchase, just be patient. there is a definate learning curve. Thank god for my wheel...definately need a wheel!			"

												I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews.  Nevertheless, the reviews were so bad about a year ago that I didn't touch it.  So I did wait until Dec 2015 to try it out after all the patches and changes that seemed to make it worth buying.  I race in iRacing, PCars, Assetto Corsa, FM, FH, and now RaceRoom.  The graphics inside the cockpit and looking out to the opponents is probably the best among these sims providing you have a decent PC and can max out the graphics.  I give it a 9.5/10 for graphics.  The physics are also very good since you can adjust many settings in the FFB.  So if you make a few adjustments, then I would easily say 9/10 on phyiscs.  And with all the adjustments you get for the feel, then nearly a perfect.    The gameplay is focused on DTM and GT3 in my opinion and that is pretty much why I bought it.  No other sims have anything really in the DTM class although I am hoping PCars gets into DTM more.  So if you like DTM, I can tell you this is the best sim for DTM.  I haven't had any issues at all and have to say the negative onslaught this game gets is just not accurate.  But there seems to be a few issues.  Like with the fuel and tire wear set to real, they don't seem to ever go down.  It's 100% all the time so I think that is a bug.  And the AI is annoying until you learn how to avoid them.  But this is one of the best sims out there in my opinion, especially DTM and GT3.  I just don't understand how people can spend 15 min on a game and slam the heck out of it.  Their connectivity issues and setup is more than likely their own setup problem.  Yes, it needs a little help with car setups too like adding tire pressure...lol  But the game feels and looks excellent,  It's worth the money for DTM for sure.Update: 4/30/2016 - RaceRoom is Awesome!  I've waited a month after the 3/31/2016 update that massively improved the GT3 and Prototype physics.  The new physics and new FFB settings, new car setup, especially for GT3, ADAC GT Masters, DTM, and the new Audi P1 along with Nordschleife puts this sim to the stellar level in my opinion.  In addition, the fuel and tire wear now works finally.  Neverthelesss, the new FFB meter to check for clipping is very nice.  I am very critical of physics and so you know where I am coming from, Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the top slot with PCars a close second.  Race Room was just behind PCars.  Unfortunately, Forza just doesn't have the physics at these levels, e.g. you cannot feel the rubber on the road and utilze braking to control the cornering accurately in Forza Motorsport at least yet.  So Forza is last in the physics ranking among all these.  But I am now putting RaceRoom up there at the Assetto Corsa and iRacing level.  I am at the point of saying the physics in Race Room, at least for the DTM, ADAC, GT3 and Prototype classes, is possibly even better than Assetto Corsa and iRacing.  The sound in Race Room is also stellar if not the best among the aformentioned sims and I am not even using 7.1 yet just stereo.  Race Room does not get the recognition it deserves....another point is I am astonished it's onlyh using DX9c where all the others I've mentioned are on DX11 or even DX12.  So it blows me away they are getting this level of crisp graphics viewing the opponents cars and interior that they do....congrats Race Room for pulling that off.			"

												I don't often review games (or anything else), but with all the thumbs down this has gotten I decided it needed my input.  First let me say that I raced real cars for 9 years on both ovals and road courses. I've also sim raced on and off since about 1992.  I'm not an expert on sim racing, but I've tried most of the major players and R3E is among the very best -- I find the physics to be superb, at least when used with a good wheel and pedals.  I can't comment on how it plays on kb, controller or anything else and frankly I don't care.  One of the problems with sim racing is how to represent the loss of traction that one *feels* in the real world through balance, touch and seat of the pants. A common perception in the sim world is that a game is realistic when it is very difficult, but the real world isn't like that -- vehicles only get very difficult close to the limit.  I think R3E does an admirable job of balancing difficulty without crossing the line into ""arcade"".  Is it better than iRacing or Assetto Corsa? I don't know....that's really on a car-by-car basis for me, but some of them are better and none that I've driven are really bad (and even iRacing has had some stinkers).I also don't think the ""free to play"" system is that bad.  You can have some great fun without ever buying anything!  Certain track and car combinations are always available (for free!) in the ""competitions"".  These are really just hot-lap contests, but they are fun and you get to try out the content.....and it is still free.  Raceroom is expensive if you buy all the DLC, but I just don't see a need for that -- just buy whatever series you want to race in, and if you are really cheap just by one car in each class.  Either way it is still a lot cheaper than iRacing.  The downsides of Raceroom:-the severs are usually empty, but then I don't use this for online racing. - the AI can be a bit aggressive, but are otherwise pretty good.  -can't save setups (really????).  I've heard this is coming in the next update			"

												Good casual racing game, not serious but you can alter certain setups on the car.Easy to just find a quick server and race in a few minutes of starting the game.Mechanics and graphics are good, also allows for pad or wheel.Obviously a free game would be riddled with DLC but you can still have lots of fun free or maybe 1 or 2 DLC.As far as free games go, this is my fave.

												This game is rated criminally low on Steam, I guess because people want everything for free. Kinda ridiculous. I agree some of the content is too pricey, but for a reasonable price you can grab two or three packs of cars/tracks and have a ton of fun.The opponent AI and the sound are the best currently available. Handling/physics is great, maybe just a notch behind AC, and the polish of the UI and menus is simple but well done and doesn't feel like a beta like so many sims do these days. No better game out right now if you want to simulate a touring car race season.If you're a sim racing fan, you should absolutely give this a try and see if you want to buy some additional content. It's one of the top few sims available!			"

												...And I thought Gran Turismo was brutal (S-Class License in that game was not easy to obtain, BTW. Fortunately, not a requirement in this one. I also beat GT3 and most of GT4. So I'm familiar with the overall brutality of these simulators.). Then again, it's been ages since I last played a simulation racing game (At least 5 years worth of rust on me); and now with more accurate simulation settings as such, ugh. Made a decent personal time on Get Real (without shattering my car or breaking the engine), but I needed Novice to get a better handle of when to brake overall for next time (I can survive, at least, but I'm nowhere near leaderboard-ready yet at time of post). You botch the braking anywhere (especially blind corners and chicanes), and you can mess up your entire lap, or go off course, or 180-1080 your car, and invalidate your lap (no shortcutting like I used to in GT and NFS; also no more using other cars as guardrails on certain turns either :( ).Not stopping me from playing this more, and maybe getting an expansion pack or two to have more cars to drive with and more tracks to drive on. However, as precise I can get with a keyboard, I lack pressure sensitivity in order to draw a bead more precisely; so my skills are a tad biased (better with a gamepad for these kinds of games). +20.5 seconds (1:43.334 on a track) from 1st place (Leaderboards, that is) is not good enough for me. I gotta shave off more time... If I can clear +10 seconds from 1st, then I'll be a happier driver. +5, and I'll be impressed with myself. This game is not easy, because it's less game, and more simulator. The physics are quite familiar and rather unforgiving (like reality would be), especially in Get Real (and that mode also permits fine-tuning your car's aerodynamics, gear-shift ratios, and just about everything else under the hood; and tire wear is also quite unforgiving too, so keep those in check along with your fuel). If you seek a casual racing experience, I suggest a different game, lest you want to lose some keyboards or controllers in frustration. It can become casual, however, if you're a pro at this kind of stuff.Been awhile since I've had such a detailed racing experience, so thumbs up on bringing back my memories of Gran Turismo (In due time, I'll see you guys on the Nürburgring Course (up to 10 minutes per-lap, and that's with skill and a good car; BIIIG Course (28.265 km long). An ultimate test for drivers, both skill and endurance. Look it up. In GT4, my best time was about 9 minutes, or slightly less than that, and even so, I had difficulties there.)). However, only other (personal) setback is that your real name is visible (security and such, I guess). Just a friendly heads-up for anyone else that feels like crashing into walls and cars non-stop (eg- signing up to play). The heads-up is also for those that would end up broadcasting, and still want to remain anonymous; I suggest going somewhere else for privacy while broadcasting publicly.I can imagine how this will play with Oculus support. Speaking of which, the graphics are 10/10; runs smoothly with high settings, even for older machines like mine, and the graphics are a beauty overall; the sound is also rather pretty too, for you gearheads. If you want an immersive driving experience, or want to relive an A-Spec GT experience, I recommend this. Plus, it's free to play. Despite the 10GB download (mostly locked content), what's not to love? I suggest building some experience and skill before investing in any new cars/tracks/DLC packs. At least, know you can handle it first, before burning your money on this, and then giving it a negative review from poor judgement user-side.See you on the leaderboards, and by chance, on the tracks.

												I've gotta be honest, I played this game a long long time ago when it first came out. basically, and it was god awful. However, this game has become one of the best sims out there. Anyone who thinks differently hasn't gotten off iRacing long enough. The tire fall off is almost nearly perfect, the steering and force-feed-back is glorious... The graphics, don't even get me started! The cut track system is a little nazi-ish and hopefully that changes just a little. That's really my only complaint. Awesome game. Give it a try.			"

												Reason's to get this game.1: It's a Simulator. Meaning real life-like driving, if on Get Real difficulty. Other difficulties are fun to play as well, depending on your driving skill.2. The ability of being able to buy games with-in the simulator that allow you to experience even more real life-like driving content.3. If you are not fortunate to buy the games with-in the simulator, then this game come with 3 free cars with skin packs plus 3 tracks with different routes.4. Again, if not fortunate to pay for the games you also can race for content, do well and you along with 10 possible others can win content.5. Regardless of any content you may or may not of bought, there is always players out there that you can challenge yourself against. A community to find drivers and challenge there records or them yourselves in multiplayer, you choose.6. This game takes skill to play and if you like to test your skill without the ""DEATH"" chance, then the creators went a step farther and allow you to buy for your home reality chambers. Fully customizable driving frames that allow you to take control behind a steering wheel having the feel of a real life like racing experience.7. The initial simulator is ""FREE""8. Much more inside.....			"

												I tried almost every simulation outh there including iRacing , and i was excited for a new simbin title , cuz im a fan of simbim from way back with GT legends and GTR/GTR2 , so i was expecting a good sim, insted i got some Acrila cars that u can not get used to , just like iRacing , u cant feel the road , u can master a track but u cant master the grip, its just unconected... no way neer GTR ad GTlegends and Race07...i dont care  about graphics so thats my opinion on phisics and engine, a big fail from me , but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have missed me .Now a little bit of a content rewievIts not a free game , its a demo, if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep, i hate it , its like Star citizen , selling u a model of something and pricing it not as much as star citizen but still, its a 3D model, and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euros in cash, does it cost that much to designe a 3D model of a car, NO, so what is it , a rip off is what it is , they dont want to make a game, thats why u cant play it standalone with no internet conection, they wann sell stuff like Star citizen cuz they have seen the amoun of money SC earned robing off kids with money, Im OK with that , rip off all kids with money i couldnt care less, but u wont get it from me , i want a racing simulation , that will work even if my internet connection is down, i want to pay for a game not a car or a track. I couldnt care less what tracks name is , or what car am i driving , as long as its a nice track and a good car phisics ,so i play would play rFactor with unlicensed cars and track that work good rather then pay 200e for RaceRoom that has all licensed cars that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyers .. thats what it boilds down too, they would sell i virtual wheels and windshields if they could but they cant so they sell cars and tracks, im not in too that, so what are the alternativesAlternativesGSC as Game stock car 2013 is a better sim on every level, exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the best sim on the market , apart from iRacing that so expensive u cant even consider it in a category of 20-30e and doesnt feel as good as GSCAlso Aseto corsa is better then Race room, and its cheeper , but its not finished So thats my review , boils down too if u have money there is no reason not to try to buy content, but if u suport financial models like that u will end up paying for wind shields ,rims and car skins, maybe even P2W like high octane fuel.If u are smart, u will suport games that dont try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on giving u a pleasure of racing against AI and ppl with as much content as u like , with mods, oficial content etc....so for me there is just GSC 2013 and Aseto Corsa that are on that level of racing, i Racing too but thats for profesional drivers not for a casual gamer..Race room expirience is a money generating machine not a racing simuator , just like World of Tanks is, Star Citisen and all other so called free games . Thank u simbin for not existing any more and making room for real racing gamers over at Asetto corsa and GSC. over and out			"

												Great Simulator. All cars are a joy to drive and the tracks are awsome aswell. The sounds are better than all racegames/racesimulators i played so far.You can feel the road and the cars behaviour trough the force feedback better. So you can catch slides and even drift if you want too.Another thing that realy upped this game is the ability to make championships off your own this realy helped me back behind the wheel of this game.You get a couple of cars to start with for free and a couple of tracks. So you can experience the way it drives and you dont necessarily have to buy stuff.When you tried this game and you like driving/racing you will probably buy content though ;).			"

												(01/2017) Very solid and complete game if you buy the tracks and cars which you like. Now updated with VR support.Good graphics, great physics, great force feedback, a lot of cars, real driver names and liveries, best sound of all racing games.Exiting single player experience with lot of customization and rule sets for e.g. DTM 2015. Sure it's not complete as there are atm no predefined sets for championships. So you have to set up the tracks, car class and rule set manually each time you start with a new championship but this also gives you total freedom setting up a championship with tracks and rules as you like.Regularly updates (content and game) and good support in the forums are definitely making this game a must buy.

												A while ago I saw this game was free and got it, but decided I couldn't figure it out so I deleted it. Recently I've been looking for a decent sim for a good price. You can't get much better than free! I don't have much time on this game, but I feel as though I have enough time to write this review. So here we go.Pros:-BEST PRICE EVER-pretty graphics that run smooth on my weak pc-great physics and AI-large selection of cars and tracks to choose from for a fair price-supports all of my contollers-incredible sound-easy to use UI-the ability to test drive cars BEFORE you buy them-multiplayer (in alpha)Now the cons:-after you buy a car, you have to pay MOAR for more skins-game isn't fully developed, as there are small bugs here and there. not too bad-you have to buy stuff with ""VRP"", which you pay for with real money. It just confuses me.Overall, this is the most fun you can have for free if you're a gamer, and if you're a simmer, this is a great and upcoming sim with high quality DLC for a fair price. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. Hey- it's free!			"

												This game is absolutely brilliant i play it on a regular basis, i have since purchased a fair bit of extra content such as.....WTCC 2014 packs, European and US Track Packs, ADAC GT Masters Experience 2014 & DTM 1992 direct from http://game.raceroom.com/store/ all this is down to the highly enjoyable racing club and most friendly drivers at race department who cover the RRRE racing.And the main reason i also post about this is because after purchasing DTM Experience 2013 & 2014 i found that the PUBLIC servers seemed dead. And when you did get people on them they were idiots that rammed, fortunately for any serious gear heads. If your willing to part with a SMALL amount of cash to go premium at a place called ""Race Department"", they got you covered for a mass of racing sims for like minded people who want to race clean and fair.The premium charge is pretty much standard to be able to race, as it helps ""covers server costs etc"" and weeds out any clowns that would potentially ruin a race.And also to let you know that these games are not dead no matter how much it may look like it, there is a place you can go and indeed enjoy your game and make great new friends.Race Department (RRRE link) http://www.racedepartment.com/forums/raceroom-racing-experience.131/ "

												This is honestly a really solid racing sim.If all you want to do is burn around a track trying to beat your previous time and you get immense satisfaction from the realism of the graphics and sound, then this is an amazing game.If you came here looking for a polished product; leave now. You will not find anyhting like GT or Assetto Corsa for free. I can assure you. It has no multiplayer yet or even a race mode but I just enjoy driving around the circuit in the various default cars admiring the engine sounds and brake squeaks.TL;DR - This is about the EXPERIENCE, not the progression			"

												I didn't like R3E for a while and avoided purchasing any of the content but this game has come a long ways and Sector3 Studios has really changed the game around.First off the free to play portion of the game is more like a demo/base portion of the game. There are around 5 free cars and 2 tracks. This lets you try the game out and see if you like it. You purchase content (cars, tracks, packs, and experiences) based on what you want. You don't have to buy everything and most people don't.The packs are always discounted and go on sale frequently. Any content you have also gets discounted from packs and experiences.Experiences are basically full games that run through the base game of Raceroom. (So the DTM and ADAC GT experiences.)All the content I own I got on sale and I got DTM 2014 and WTC 2013 for free! I won these through the free competitions that are held in Raceroom. They cycle through these competitions around each month. Some are just for bragging rights and some have rewards such as the in game currency (VRP), game content, or even real race tickets.I have all the other big sims and I like raceroom for providing content that the other don't and also providing real race series with the tracks they race on. You can compete on the leaderboards with real race drivers in the DTM and ADAC GT series and they even host races with them from time to time.I definitely recommend trying it out and seeing if you like it. If you do, I suggest waiting for one of the sales either through raceroom or on steam, like the summer sale :).			"

												I am a sim racer since the good old C64 REVS. Since that year I drove nearly every race sim on the market.To make it short: Race Room Experience is definitely the one available.Its the feeling of the game: No other race game has such a good force feedback and sound.The AI is very good.Maybe other title have better graphics (project cars), but this one just feels great. Racing RRE is such a great experience. After a race with a good FFB wheel (like CSW 2), you are completely done.Its so heavy to feel the road and the opponents and hear the best racing sound on the market.Give it a try, even with the free version you can have A LOT OF FUN.Their is so many high quality content available that every race sim fan is happy.My personal favorites are: DTM 1992, Group C cars and Brands Hatch and Salzburgring.

												Downloaded this game because the videos and screenshots looked amazing, but it is far from being finished.  The graphics are really nice, the gameplay is simple but and it is a big but.  The menu system they've tried to do is a little complicated..Also being a free member ONLY, you get only... 4 cars max and only 3 tracks man.In order to get the other cars, which you can see from the video above you must pay real money for, there is no mutlplayer to date, it is greyed out for now.  So they should be releasing it.No multyplayer yet leaves singleplayer only, during there... You are the only racer, you get a ghost car but only 1, no other cars.  Boring!The cars you get I think is 4 max but I only noticed 2, the super car you get and a BMW..Now the handling... It does not matter what mode you select from the 2, amatuer or sim they both drive exactly the same, I tried them both out and both of them handled the exact same no difference to it, you can edit the car setup which is alright but the cars STILL feel the same.I tried to get along with this game, but the massive downfall of you having to buy the other cars and extremely limiting gameplay is a massive no no.I maybe redownload this game in the future for a little mess around with friends, WHEN they release the multiplayer but for now, it is just not ready.

												Gday,I think this game is one of the best if not the best sim i have played.I have put many hours in other sims like Assetto corsa,GSCE,etc,Raceroom has set the standard i think...The sounds in this game are second to NONE,the way it makes you feel you are acually at the track.The FFB and the road feel spot on.If you like simbin games you will love this.It has pitstops and the AI isnt as bad as what people say..it is much better than AC,s AI,but not yet as good as GSCE AI,,this game is still in beta tho,If you love racing sims as much as i do you have to try it out..Its a free to play game with 3 tracks and 5 free cars,The content they have for sale is well worth it,you can also test drive any car anytime before you buy it.The only thing i dont like about this game,and its the only thing,is that you have to be online always..even to play single player, you have to be on the server..I really hope they change this as my internet is not the best all the time.Happy racing......Cheers			"

The multiplayer is in alpha, but i didn't notice any jerking of cars on the road unless that player has 500 + ping. They will add much much more including weather and a night/day shift. It's still beta but it's coming along nicely. Definitly the best out there at the moment.			"

												Game looks great but personally I could not get it working with my Logitech GeForce Pro steering wheel. I was like a drunk driver, all over the track. Frame drops and other issus on start of race didn't help.Force Feedback: TOO MANY CONTROLLS on wheel settings plus these settings get changed for every car, So you have to go through the process all over again (most likely) if you change cars. The default steering was WAY to sensitive so I decreased and then the car felt sluggish and it felt like controller lag. I never felt like I was racing :-(  I also found it impossible to drift due to the problems described with the wheel response and force feedback settings. Maye it's the wheel as I see other people mention the Logitech setups are an issue. I just don't want to spend hrs setting up a wheel for each car I want to use.The grass / track edges seem suck you in. Is that considered realism? I know many games will punish for cutting corners and it should be slippy on the throttle, but should you get sucked into the barrier?			"

												Brought this with some hesitation , going by some of the old reveiws i thought this might not be that good,but took a chance , Well i am glad i did , the handling is great , the force feedback works really well, (brought dtm 2105 and wtcc 2014), The sound is amazing best car sound in a game yet, Graffics on par with asseto corsa not as good as project cars, i have both those games so at this satge only about a hours game play i feel its control and grit of racing could make this one of the best race simms yet, Raceroom have come along way and is listening to the people who buy their games. The only negative is their price structure.I will come back in a week or two to give a better review , but for now ill say well worth buying especially the packs i brought.ps dont go by the free demo , no where near as good as the new stuff in my view,			"

												I tried the game when launched 2 years ago and sure it has been seriously enhanced and optimized.Outstanding sensations, Sound environnement, realism and Force Feedback feeling.Playing on a 3 screens setup (5760*1080 / R9-290X / i7 4930k)  with G25 (DIY piston brake mod)Stable game, no bugs so far, but FrameRate could be better or maybe i miss something in options.  Unfortunately the game has serious lacks like tire choice, temperature, setups saving, ... So i don't know if i recommend or not.As a realism-addict-gamer i would say YES YES YES : the sensations you get when you manage to drive a fast car in this simulator are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.As a customer i would say NO : i'm seriously disappointed about many obvious lacks in the simulation, keeping in mind the money you need to spend to own decent car and tracks choices to practice and challenge. But i could say same thing about our IRL cars: webcams, USB, SDcard etc are cheap and already old stuff from around 2000... so why aren't they supplied by default on every car in the market by then ? Why do we still have to pay hundreds of euros to get that options on a 10-20.000 euros product ? By the way you can drive some car and tracks FOR FREE INFINITELY !! So no surprise if you buy it.I just played 20h and i would already say it did worth the euros :)			"

												This is a Fantastic racing simulator. Very good graphics and over all game play. Be warned for those looking for an arcade like racing game because this is not the game for you then. This is not a bump people out of the way or wreck your way to a win type of racing game. This is a racing simulator and a very good one. The one drawback is that it can be expensive becuase you must buy more cars and tracks as time goes on to really enjoy this game. I bought a pack that was $24.00 usd  and recieved 22 new cars and 9 new tracks so that should keep me busy for quite sometime. You do however get a few free cars and tracks to play and this will help you decide if the game is worth investing in long term. I promise you will be happy if you do and over all its still way cheaper then most other racing simulators out there. This game is fully controller, steering wheel or keyboard and mouse compatible. I am currently using an xbox 360 controller and a ps4 controller (ya i know lol) and they work flawlessly. There is nothing bettter then Pc racing simulators and this is a good one.			"

												Alot of reviews from people that won't give this game much time - Granted, I spent a good while getting the graphics and feeling (FFB etc) right but you will love it once you find that sweet spot. I find the physics of every car much more alive and engaging than similar vehicles on say, Project Cars or Assetto Corsa, with the force feedback (Using a G27) and the sounds being top notch. Easily the best of any racing sim IMO.The mix of content is fantastic and the track list is a brilliant! - A load of tracks you actually want to drive, not a load of soul-less modern build tracks. Not many games can boast the opportunity to jump from a mental super tuned Zakspeed Capri, to a 2014 WTCC Lada, to a BMW Z4 GT3 then in to a 1992 Audi Quattro DTM. And then choose to take each either up a hillclimb, round Bathurst or to Indianapolis!And the graphics, once dialled up are great. I run a GTX970 and that runs everything maxed. Yet while you can see its a game, everything looks very real.The whole, 'free to play, but each thing costs extra, so you end up spending a tone if you get in to it', idea sucks. But with the prices being no so bad, it could be worst. I could be in to iRacing.Give it a try. Buy some decent content and let the game develop over time as you get in to it and you will love it. The Sector3 forum is a great place to check up on what to expect in future releases aswell and what the team are working on - plus, if you don't like something, post it on there and they will have a look and you never know, they could sort it more to your liking.

												 This review has to be a very mixed bag. First off let me say I've been with this game from the start. From closed beta till now. I've seen it go from meh.. to a very decent game. Probably one of the best racing titles I've ever played. I always knew that if anybody could get a racing title right it would be these guys. It has the possibilites of blowing GTR 2 out of the water. Yes it could be that good! However there are some very serious issues here. One is the pitstops. Flat after the Oct. 20 patch they don't work. I understand that pitsops in custom championships are coming and that's okay. They weren't originally advertsied to begin with after all. I can live with that. Impatiently but I'll live till then. However it's the broken pitsops in ADAC 2014 experience and DTM 2014 experience that upset me. Can't say about DTM 2015 as I don't own it and from the looks of it I may never. Working pitstops were advertised for the DTM and ADAC 2014 cars. Heck I owned the DTM 2013. It was the only reason to buy the newer set.   In ADAC 2014 the player's car drives straight through the pits without stopping. Resulting in disqualification for not stopping. In DTM 2014 your car stops but the pit doesn't seem to count. You guessed it resulting in your disqualification. These were advertised features. We have to assume they had this worked out before the advertised it , right? Guess not!  There are many other issues and to their credit they working on them. As the recent hotfix suggests but it's not enough. One main quirk if you decide to step into this game, is BEWARE THE PATCHES! They generally break twice as much as they fix. One over the summer brought the whole fool game down. In it's current state I couldn't recommend this game unless you are very patient. And it will be tested, trust me! It is a near brilliant racing title with lot's of racing fun though and if and only if you're willing to hang with it you will love it and hate it and love it and hate it.... You get the picture. I gave this title a thumbs up because it doesn't totally deserve a thumbs down! However you have been warned! As for the 503 errors that everyone is experiencing. I can't say as mine thankfully have been limited. I must be living right or lucky. Also I need to add that I play only single player not multiplayer. So my review can't address any issues there as I haven't seen them. I really would like to give this game a thumbs sideways but can't. Hence the thumbs up.			"

The tuning options in the game actually do something and make sense.  The cars behave and handle like real cars.  Ultimately this is the classic you get what you pay for, RaceRoom is more expensive, but it really is very well done and worth the investment if you are really into racing simulation games.			"

												Blows your socks off. Feels, looks and sounds so real, it's the raw simulation racing I've craved since F355 on the Dreamcast. Online racing is still beta but it works OK for the most part and is very thrilling. I haven't paid for anything yet and have found no problem in finding hours worth of entertainment in it.I do plan on buying some cars and tracks at some point but the whole vRP virtual money system is pretty convoluted and confusing, so it's put me off as it's difficult to weigh up the price of things.

												As a big fan of Race 07 I was keen to get this game, and when I found it was free I was even happier. When I finally played it, my overall verdict was that there needs to be some game optimization. I can run GRID Autosport on Max but with this game my PC was struggling even at the low end. This is a very graphics heavy game and you need to know your PC can handle it before you start investing. Other than that I love this series for it's car models and the accuracy. Not many other games include disciplines such as DTM and WTCC and as my favorites I couldn't be more pleased. If the game could be optimized then this would be one of my top racing simulation games.			"

												The more I play, the more I like this game. It has several strengths compared to other similar games. I really like the selection of cars and tracks, and the cars in each class are very well balanced so that every car is a potential winner. They've also really nailed it with a good mix of classics and modern racing series like DTM and WTCC.The controls, force feedback and sound is nothing less than fantastic! Beats everything else on the market hands down. Graphics are also top notch. The game has had a rough start, but now it's really starting to shine.Laser scanned Nordschleife is also coming soon, which will make the game even more better. :)			"

												This sim is one of my favorites.Since Sector 3 Studios was born, RaceRoom has received new force feedback, which is acclaimed to be amongst the best. New content has received new physics for cars and new more detailed track surfaces. Also, they are going through all of the old content and updating the cars to the new physics model. Most tracks have now been updated aswell, however they may have finished by the time you read this.Combine these 3 things with genre leading sounds and you have one of the best experiences available in sim racing today.Multiplayer has a unique style of netcode where your ping to each other racer seems to be p2p rather than via the server you are racing on, which is great. Racing standards in most lobbies I have been in is of a good standard.Along side the DLC listed in steam, RaceRoom also has a store in game.The price for cars and tracks beyond the given free ones are very reasonable compared to other sims that charge on a per car/track basis, this also enables the devs to keep adding new content consistently. Content is now available in packs for a discount as well. The neat thing is the way you get a scaling discount based upon how much of said pack you already own. Because I had already bought the DTM packs (DTM 2013 I picked up for a nice $7.50 on sale through steam dlc) and ADAC 2013 pack, when I went to buy the European track pack the remaining 3 or 4 tracks I didn't already own ended up costing me about 20% of what they would have if I bought them individually.One really big thing for me being an Aussie is BATHURST! It's probably the best most accurate version of the track ever made outside of laser scanning.Yep, if you like racing cars with a wheel or even a gamepad, definitely make sure you check this one out.

												Free to Play Racing Sim where you pay for what you want.For some reason this is enough to give the game a negative review. Not me.This game has the best sounding cars I have ever heard in a video game. Period. Nothing else even comes close.It also has outstanding forcefeedback, a big community, and accurate simulation. The AI is pretty good, it's very agressive though. It seems to be a bit dynamic.I can't get enough of it. There's also a lot of real racing drivers that play this game which is pretty cool. It was, and wasn't, surprising to see Mike Rockenfeller at the top of the leaderboards for a few tracks.If you like motorsport and have a racing wheel this is a must play. It's FREE, there's a few tracks you can try and you can test drive every car in the game for free, along with a handful you get for free. It's worth your time and if you don't like it there's no loss. You don't have to pay a cent.			"

												Terrific racing sim. Considering it's (apparently) not the final product, it's a beautiful game with some incredibly well-modelled cars with fun handling and great sound. The price of the addons is more than reasonable, in my opinion. My favourite pack so far has been the DTM 1992 car pack; the cars are just ludicrous fun.Bear in mind that online multiplayer is fairly sparse. Sometimes you won't find any games for any of the car packs you own (aside from the free content), which is a shame. However - and this is a rarity in sim racing games - the AI provide a serious challenge and can often be more fun than racing online.Download this game, buy the DTM 1992 pack and race on!			"

From watching the reviews of RaceRoom on ISRTV I thought I would give RaceRoom a try, I am hooked. This game has the complexity and challenge of iRacing when it comes to the features you get and game play, but with the simplicity of PCars & AC, I give it 5 Stars and then some.			"

												This is by far the best game Simbin have produced. The physics are spot-on, and, aside from a few licensing issues with the RUF brand and a few iconic tracks which are currently lacking (though I'm assured they're coming soon), this is a very complete game. I bought into this during the alpha stage when I was taken aback by the graphics and attention to detail in their fictional Raceroom track, and I haven't once regretted it. I think the likes of Assetto Corsa and Project Cars can only be substantially better by having a better selection of road-going cars and the Nordschleife, available as standard.			"

So watch for a sale, spend your money wisely and have lots and lots of fun.  Multi-player is on the horizon for this game as well.

												I got into R3E many months ago, and while my initial thoughts were negative, I opted to wait and see where SimBin (at the time) were going to go with this title especially as a fan of their earlier titles primarily Race 07 and GTR 2.While initially it suffered from a stagnant development period, the new Sector3 and their current contributions have vastly improved this title to become my now go-to racing sim, with vast improvements in the areas of physics, force feedback, single player and multi-player and the constant rate new content is pushed out.While graphics are impressive, other simulators such as Assetto Corsa or Project Cars lead in this area, not to say that Sector3 have done an outstanding job on their engine with impressive HDR, bloom and dynamic lighting effect. SimBin/Sector3 has always been a leader in bringing the driver the most realistic sound experience in all their titles, and this continues with R3E.With the last major update, Sector3 have done a major overhaul of the force feedback system. Their track developers have developed a new technology to improve the presentation and feedback of their track’s road surface utilising data from telemetry to create a highly dense road surface that features small bumps and imperfections in the surface the increases the quality of the force feedback immensely.AI does leave plenty of room for improvement, while R3E supposably utilises an “Adaptive AI”, I find many times, AI will run up the back of you like a solid lead block, causing a frustrating racing experience at the best of times with little to no effect on themselves.Content is plentiful, with a range of cars and tracks with new content currently added recently including the ADAC 2013 GT Masters Pack and the WTCC 2013 Pack including tracks as part of each package. Still, the biggest question mark is the pricing system, while I have noticed and taken advantage of the pack discounts, standard pricing is on the expensive side. I personally would advise to hold off for specials or car packs prior to purchasing content if you consider yourself the collector, or buy one car in each class as needed. With the new inclusion of the new “Test Drive” feature, you will be able to make a sound decision prior to purchase regardless of the price.As a free to play game, this title is worth the time to experience the improvements that Sector3 have made to bring this sim up to the standard that many sim racers will look for. If you're willing to part with your cash to race new cars on new tracks, then you will enjoy a race or two, whether its a against the AI, online multiplayer with friends, or a quick hotlapping session.

												Overall, I like this game. I, to be honest, expected something along the lines of Forza or Grand Torismo standards, but in my eyes, it met a fraction of those standards. I have to admit though, this is a very nice and sharp looking game when it's on it's highest settings (it set mine to the highest setting because my computer is very powerful). I am very fond of how many cars there are in the game and I love how each and every one of them has their own different sound. Although i'm not a car expert, if fact I don't really know much about cars in the first place....but I still wanted to try this game as I have heard it looked amazing and was a very good free to play game. They were right. Although this game has a lot of good stuff about it, I feel it has quite a lot of negative stuff about it. To start off, I noticed how there was a MAJOR lack of music unlike Forza or Grand Torismo or most racing games combined. This really annoys me because I feel that the music can bring a certain video game to life (ex: Saints Row 3, I actually got hooked on it because I started listening to it's soundtrack and just fell in love). I also didn't like how a good 75% of controls are unbinded at default, which I don't know if that's because the developers just wanted to let the player bind them his/herself or because they were just too lazy. Another problem is with every single car. What I noticed is how they all fail to break especially on very hard turns. I always find myself in 5-6th gear and then a very hard turn comes and I slow down, but I slow down enough that i'm still in 3rd-4th gear which doesn't help with the turn (I stop nearly 2 seconds before the actual turn). This is also a problem because I don't know if I properly binded a key; handbrake. I binded it to space (it shows I binded it correctly in the settings, but i'm just not sure) and when I press space while the car is just rolling, nothing happens. If I use it when i'm turning, slight to nothing really happens. In most case senarios I feel it does virtually nothing, when compared to other racing games where the handbrake is vital to the game. Handbrake wasn't even pre-binded when I started the game. Set aside all the negative stuff about the game, I would like to focus on the positive stuff in the game. What I think I enjoy the most about this is how it's actually more of a formula one racing game as you don't see day-to-day cars in the game like Forza. I personally love the formula one cars because they always give me a sence of how it would really feel if I was in one. With a computer so heavily powered and with a game that looks so amazing as this one does, they make up well to fulfill what I like most about formula one cars. I also like how there are LOTS of cars and tracks to choose from (there aren't many default and free tracks and cars, but there are a TON of paid tracks and cars). Although I don't have a lot of time under my belt playing the game, I can see it will turn out to be a very well made game. 7.9/10			"

												Out of all the latest racing sims coming out on Steam lately this is the one I keep coming back too,  content keeps evolving and improving with every update, track selection is fantastic, cars handle and sound awesome, FFB has also improved from what it was 6 months ago with more updates to come, its also free to play with some great compititions to dip into if you just want to try out the free stuff.......Highly recommended!

												Game title ""RaceRoom Racing Experience"" speaks for itself - good for who wants to get some race experience. I like this simulator. But, ... on my opinion, there are two big issues with simulator.First of all, it pricey.Second, you do not get a change to test a car or a track before buy it. This is ridiculous. Give us a chance to test it before buy it or at least possibility to return it back.			"

												This is one of my favourites games on PC at the moment.  Its still in beta but I've bought ALL the content which says a lot for the quality.  I have a G27 and the depth of immersion when racing is fantastic.  I've played a lot of PC sIms over the years and this ranks highly in my opinion.  If your on the hunt for a new racing sim you cant go wrong here.  I think the goods news is the guys over at Sector3 formerly Simbin are evolving this title all the time and it will only get better.			"

												Its fun, you can use controller for this and it is very sharp and visually pleasing. However, the biggest problem is you can only get so far before you realize you must pay alot of money for new car, vinyl and track. There is no earn yourself a new ride with dedication and racking podium finishs. you spend the money just to race with new vehicle or tackle a different that was not already given to you. if you hate to pay-to-play... please stay away from this game it is no for you.Not to be recommended to the Need for Speed (of any kind) / arcad'ee kids. If you were looking for alternative to Forza Motorsports on Xbox or an answer to Playstation's Gran Turismo, u may survive. This games mechanics and handling is similar to the console sim racers, but this PC sim is way much more serious then the console racers. this serious racing sim has a massive leaderboard filled with nothing but competitive times that other user across the world have placed. it more fun to race against ur friends times then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pro race driver from Germany. it will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if u hoped to be immersed in the game.Again, the controls are solid, the game is sharp and presentable. but the pay to play more will most definitely kill your good vibes.

												I can't recommend this game enough. Sure it has it's foibles, but it is a game still in development and the pros far outweigh the cons.+ Stunning sounds, everything from backfires to suspension tweaks, from transmission flex to wind buffeting.+ Great graphics. Only DX9 sure, but wonderful lighting and colour.+ Good physics. A little more forgiving than perhaps it should be, but they do use race driver feedback, and it makes it more accessible.+ Awesome content. Unless you like open-wheelers, then the content is stunning, from DTM to Group 5, from WTCC to GT Masters.+ You can try out any car before buying it, which is an awesome feature.- The pay model has its benefits and it's disadvantages. Firstly, you only have to buy what you want, which means you can in theory pay less than a normal 'all-up front' game, in which I often find I don't use all the content anyway. The disadvantage is that it is on the expensive side for sure, though much cheaper than iRacing and there is no monthly subscription. You also only need one car from any group of cars to be able to compete with the others, like iRacing.- The servers are still not stable, but is something they are working on, and is improving at a decent rate.- Would be better if the circuits were laser-scanned, though the upcoming Nordschleife will be.

Choose from over one gender of driver to completely personalise your profile.

												Racer check this out. The best racing sim at the moment! Such an immersion gives you none! Sound, gfx and speeeed :D This is really an experience!For some months i have turned my back and was in iRacing and Loeb Rally. Now after the last patch - 31/3/2016 - my racer heart is pumping stronger :D Nordschleife is out!The new Nordschleife is a beauty and huuugggeee fun to race online with enough racers! - (btw I prefer online racing).R3E gives you an amount of content, AI-racing is becoming better and better and you have the mp-part - which lacks of some features so far. With the AI you can race after the patch on SPA and Nordschleife with up to 100 racer grid. Starting from the back and fighting to the leader is fun sometimes for me.  Lets hope for a bright online future ;D The multiplayer needs more online racer and more polish by the devs.The controls are superb for me: In use is here a G27 with a Th8RS shifter and from time to time i like to race in the right sofa-mood with my xbox-controller in ""Sound""-view ;D Try the free part and there is the possibility to try all cars on one track. Check it out! Absolute worth it!For more infos visit the devs-forum:https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?find-new/1901361/postsHave fun!HarryoPS: Leave the FOV on 1.0 - real FOV cockpit view - and change the seat-position to your liking. You will have the best feeling so far your screen is big enough ;D PPS: Just now the devs have released the Audi R18 :D i have to go! Cya on the track and drive with respect online!Edit: 08/2016Do you prefer online racing? Check Iracing: way better online system, bigger community and more more social racer. R3E is for me now in between. Back to iracing for more multiplayer fun.			"

												 Play Simracing since GTR2, so i have a good overview about SImgames. Now we have some good Simracing games like Assetto Corsa and Iracing. The difference between this two games and RRRE is that the Forcefeedack are much more real then the other two games. Enginesound from all cars are more real and you think youre inside your dreamcar. short pro and contra list:+Engine Sound+ForceFeedback+collision detection (much much better then Assetto Corsa)+Racing Tracks (not all laserscanned but real similar to the real tracks)+Racecars (DTM13/14,WTCC13,GTR1/2/3/X,GTMasters,Daytona,Procars and much more)+OnTrack Settings like (control, HUD,Sound, etc.)I miss that in Assetto Corsa+dedicated server still in development (comming soon)+RealRace Drivers use this game to train (Sometimes you see one of your Racestar ingame)+everycar have a own setup what you can edit how you want - steering options for everycar+MP: Friends shown as a star in the Serverlist-/+Microtransactions (You can buy a complete Pack like GTMasters or DTM 13/14.-/+Multiplayer in Alpha Stage (some stuff is missed)-just few onlineplayers-Multiplayer: Training/Qualitime: Players join during sessions, a join lag destroy your Laptime-Setupguide is missing (example. Assetto Corsa explain ingame what every option mean)-MP: Loadtime while joining a server take a long time (maybe 2-3 minutes)Most stuff is in development and the devs are working hard.

												Admittingly, I disliked the idea of having to Pay-To-Play each series, but I have grown accustomed to it.Basically, they have a base game (Free of charge) which they can constantly update over a period of years. On top of that, the people only purchase what they want. For example, don't like WTCC? Don't buy it. Really like Norising but not DTM? Just get the track. I feel as though this is a good step forward for Sim Racing.However, Online Sim Racing Leagues will struggle with the lack of customizable skins for the cars. They might end up editing their game to help these Leagues (as I said, they will only be updating the base game) able to use the game.			"

												Know what you're getting into.It's obvious a lot of effort went into this game; the realism is fantastic. However, be warned that with a high level of realism in the physics and handling comes a higher difficulty, or at least a much steeper learning curve. The game is probably much better when played on a wheel, but with a standard controller you're probably gonna have a frustrating time. I know I did. If you live and breathe racing sims and don't mind taking the time to learn how to control the monstrously powerful cars in this game, go for it. If you're looking for a relaxing blast through the tracks with a more arcade-y feel, this definitely isn't the game for you. Track and car selection is limited without paying, and it would be nice if all of the free cars were grouped in one list so you didn't have to search around, but pay-to-play stuff like this comes with the territory with free games. tl;dr: This game treats racing as SRS BUSINESS, be prepared.

												Great game. I've played Forza, GT...love GT6, but damn! Raceroom is fun. I bought the WTCC addon (but I love WTCC) and it's a blast to drive. The FWD physics is awesome...awesome = realistic durining corning and hard braking. Then I bought the GT3 addon (everything was bought during Xmas sales) and it was a blast, I still need traction control but perfection comes with time (plus i'm using the xbox controller). Buying  some of the tracks is a bit lame, to be honest but that's how this developer pays their employees. I use a 8 core AMD , 32 gbs o' ram with 2 gtx 760's...more than enough for this game. It runs AMAZING. If you love racing give this a shot and get the some of the addons while their still on xmas discount.			"

												Absolutely f***** fantastic!!!!If you want to race real racing cars and not mess about thrashing road cars then this is for you!As for all the negative feedback, yes! it is getting expensive as ive spent around £30 quid on this sim so far, however! What the negative feedback fails to mention is this, YOU CAN TEST DRIVE ANY CAR FOR FREE!!! You do only get a few tracks to start with, but now you seem to get a whole load more cars for free, trust me its worth spending some time with this sim just for the sound and the free test driving..... hop in the Ford Capri Race Car, I spent and hour test driving it simply for the insane noise it makes, id short shift most of the time and then treat myself to the odd high rev just to hear the engine, it actually gave me goose bumps!So then the physics.......... all I need to say here is that actual real racing drivers use this as training, TIMO GLOCK is one name that springs to mind, his profile in game reveals over 4 days of gameplay haha. Yes its a hard game to master and I'm a long way off, if I'm lucky I can get in the top 30% on a leaderboard and ive been playing these games/sims for over 15 years.Graphics are not the greatest but you get the feeling more of the processing power is being used on the physics engine than on processing eye candy. Real sense of rubber and tarmac like you used to get with RACE07.And the sound..... once again its worth throwing a few quid at this title just for the sound. Its sexy.			"

												This Game is awesome.  The physics are superb for a free game.  You do only get 3 tracks, but the hours of gameplay you can make with just the free stuff is endless.  Custom Championships Races against actually good AI or Adaptive AI.  The sounds on the game is basically ear porn.  The engines sound amazing.  No over the top tire screech or very loose ""I'm driving on ice"" simulation.For anyone who does not have a Controller, or a Wheel.  There are settings for keyboard users to make your driving just how you would want it. Steering sensitivity, Throttle sensitivity, Brake sensitivity, Clutch sensitivity ETC.. just for keyboard driving.Honestly If you enjoy Racing Simulator's,  Its FREE and worth your time. (5 hours in and I'm still fully enjoying the game)EDIT:  I am using a Logitech F310 Gaming Controller now with this game. And it works very well.  Just as you can adjust all your sensitivity for a keyboard you can do the same for the Controller.DOUBLE EDIT: The game works fantastic with a Logitech G29			"

												With each and every update this game just keeps getting better and better , RRE competes on every level with any AAA title released to date , this game in my opinion is fast becoming a work of art , graphically and technically RRE has exceeded all my expectations and cannot be overlooked by any sim racer. The driving experience is very realistic and suited to players of all levels. The UI is particularly nice and offers everything you could possibly think you want, options are really well laid out in a manner which suits the whole presentation package perfectly,  a lot of work and thought has went into this title and anyone who loves attention to detail will no doubt agree, this is one of the very best sim racers available on PC , ( if not the best ). RRE also has some of the best force feed back and FFB options I have experienced in any racing title.Simply Awesome 10/10 a must have sim.			"

												I've owned Raceroom for a couple of years now. Originally, I was put off with the lack of cars and tracks, and the price of the DLC but I've bought it when on a steam sale. I own rFactor 2, Project Cars, Stock Car Extreme and Assetto Corsa and this game feels as good to drive as any of the others. Maybe not quite as good, physics wise, as rFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa, but it looks wonderful, as nice as Project Cars.I feel that this Racing Sim is a little underrated and doesn't get the credit it deserves.Plus points:Runs at well over 100 ( nearer 200 ) fps on my system! ( i5 4670k, 16gb ram, Nvidia Geforce 970 gtx, Acer 144mhz monitor. )Wonderful force feedback with my Logitech G27 wheel.Looks lovely, tracks, sky, cars, reflections, very nice indeed.Great leaderboard challenge mode.If you alter car settings you can feel the difference.Online races can be very good, with less ""console racers"" than on Project Cars.Idiot drivers are turned into ghosts automatically by the game, so they don't ruin everyone elses race!Minus points.DLC can be expensive.Game is threadbare unless you're willing to purchase some DLC.Online games are hard to find without DLC.Plenty of online servers are empty.Overall, this game is great fun.I would recommend downloading the barebones version to start with, if you enjoy the couple of free cars and tracks then it's well worth considering buying some DLC.8/10			"

												I'm going with a 'yes' to 'do you recommend this game ?', but that 'yes' needs to be qualified.  If you want an easy arcade style game, as a lot of the other reviews suggest to me, then move on, this isn't a game, it's a serious simulation.  Like most serious simulations, you can't expect to get everything in one download.  You buy the base and then you add the elements that interest you, just like people did with scalextric or electric train sets back in the good old days :)  The advantage of this offering is that the first part is free.  It doesn't include a lot, but if you have some patience, there is enough to get a feel for what is on offer and decide if you want more.I have tried both Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom Experience this past week.  My first impression was that Assetto Corsa was better.  It cetainly has the better interface and the option to set up the cars to some degree is attractive.  RR3 has some problems with it's server and the current Nvidia drivers, but, while frustrating, these are not major issues, assuming these will be fixed in the near futures.  Both simulations promise multiplayer options, although it looks like the RR3 option will be limited to the DM Experience DLC for now.  For me the availability of the DM Experience tips the odds in favour of RR3 for the moment, but I'm happy to follow both for now and see what the future brings.One final word regarding control options.  I haven't tried either simulation with a mouse/keyboard option and I don't think this would be much fun.  A PC xbox 360 controller is what I am using at the moment and I find it adequate for the for the 'amateur', as opposed to 'novice' level of skill.    "

I would say the content they have is only rivaled by iRacing.. however this sim is a whole lot cheaper.The physics are very good, the graphics are some of the best (forget Pcars, that is not a sim) and the sound and immersion are THE BEST.. there is a truly great comunication with the developers and the content/updates are coming out at a great pace.Try it out.

												This is a fantastic racing sim.  It is not an arcade game, it is not Gran Turismo or Need for Speed.  To get the most out of this game will require a wheel and pedal set.  It is free but only comes with basic content, the rest is paid but it is enough to try it out -  more content is very reasonable and there are no microtransactions or subscription.Players include professional race car drivers.  To be the fastest person he will take a lot of doing.  Not really for people who don't love driving race cars and don't mind being beaten a lot.  There are no street cars in this game.  There are ongoing competions and many many hotlap leaderboards.I have been sim racing for a long time and at the moment this and Game Stock Car are all I want to play.If you play this for 6 minutes with a keyboard and then hate it because you are struggling instead of winning everything in sight as on an EA game leaving a bad review is unfair.  Note that these people are in the multiplayer on the free content and if you are worried the other multiplayer is a lot cleaner although there is no safety rating system as yet.If you like driving realistic race cars get this game.

												for a free to play game, not too bad.  i didn't have to pay for anything and hot laps/time attack isn't too bad.  if i want head to head racing i would expect to pay and i hear it isn't well balanced in pricing but the ability to use leaderboards/challenges for free isn't bad.  the physics feel good, as do the circuit layout of the free tracks.

												I noticed that most people who did a negative review of this game played less than 1 hour ......If you ever like'd Race 07 , gtr , gtr2 etc etc , you like this game also .I first bought me a car to get out of the open servers  and found a bunch of people who liked racing!! There are always some servers with atleast 7 / 10 people around.. Tracks are nice and the physics & force feedback are great , not to difficult to drive fast but to get that last second of you'r time you have to practise..Default setups are not far off pace and enough to have a decent race with and be not the one at the back of the field.After a while i bought me the packs i wanted and a few single cars to participate in online races in almost every class there is .So if you only like to drive online against other players the costs are not much more or equal as any other racing game.btw  , single races with the purchased cars are possiblle (even championships) and you get the whole field of cars to that class (not driveable) for free so you don't race 25 the same cars that you have ( buy 1 gt3 and the whole gt3 pack race's with you) :)  Great !So next time you buy a beer in a bar ,  you have to think that that beer also could have been a nice GT3 in this game ...Ohw yeah...  BUY A WHEEL !!!  and try again after your negative revieuw .... this is a SIM..  "

												It was good, but requires MONEY to buy a racing simulator gear. $350 for a decent wheel and pedals. At least another grand for simulator frame. I already have the surround sound system (including 5.1 speakers), but only because I got those cheap long time ago. Racing simulators are the best games ever created, but playing them is just expensive. I'm an engineer making good money, but with kids going to college soon how am I supposed to afford a hobby? They just ask for more and more. And I still have student loans, a drinking habit (microbrews, expensive as hell), car payments, high speed internet, etc to pay for. Nothing left to spend on a racing rig. Fence needs completion too. At least $200 more for pickets and nails. Brother has a nail gun so that helps. Then you have all the richy riches on the web, playing the ladders and sticking in times like they had a professional racing gear. It's just not fair. I'd take any of them on on equal setting. I'd probably raced these games before they were born. But there is no place in town to actually do that. I guess I'll come back to it in about 10 years when the kids have their own money to spend, and I have mine.			"

												Raceroom is a great racing simulator. It has good physics and graphics, and AMAZING sounds. Simbin has done a great job capturing the feel. Now, the downside I'm goign to point out is that this is not entirely free to play. It is essentially a base game with a couple cars and tracks. Extra tracks and cars must be bought. Raceroom is constantly being updated with new content, if you want to buy stuff wait until it goes on sale. Everything eventually will go on sale for at least %50 off. If you ever need any input the raceroom discussion board is a great place as well. ==In Short==: Awesome Racing Sim, but Not Truly FTP. "

												Awful physics and expensive content. Shame, as I loved 07 but Simbin have nosedived with this. If you can spend the money go with iRacing, if not, try Assetto Corsa (sp?). Actually, get both and save yourself the download on this 'high end' sim. Physics... well, they may seem good if you have never driven a car.  Only positives I can find is the sound is pretty good, gfx passable as long as you don't use triple screens and it is free to try so I didn't waste any money on it.			"

												I won't give it a bad review, but you pretty much need a wheel and pedals to enjoy this game. Xbox controller is no bueno.Tried it out on a weekend where everything is unlocked, but normally it appears that you would have to pay for most of the stuff (which is fine, if you like the game, then buy the content). It does appear to be pretty pricey if you buy everything though, even multiple or all the packs.			"

												This is the best sim since Grand Prix Legends. Simply the most fun you can have with your clothes on. Period. If you love race cars & racing this is as close as you can get to the real thing. They even give you a couple of tracks &  3 cars for free, Whats to complain about. Yes Multiplayer is in alpha. So if you do that then you can expect problems. But the single player game is great against the ai. Works fine & is stable on my Pc. Try it. You won't be disapointed. But as said by others. Buy your upgrades direct from the games website. Not through Steam. You can purchace from your steam wallet. It's not perfect yet there still working on it. But it is good.... Very good! Bought some tracks including one I've actually driven on & it's spot on. When you crash it doesn't even cost you anything!!!! Hell I love this game already & I only had it a few days! Works well with a joystick. So you don't have to spend a fortune on a wheel. Now I've got the thing calibrated good bye life...... :-) Sure if your looking for arcade forget it. You will hate it. Go and waste your money on something else. Bore your brains out after 15 hours. This will take you that long to get into it. Trust me I'm only just starting. This can only get better, With more tracks coming online all the time it will be alot better. And when they sort the multiplayer........... Bought 7 tracks & 20 cars for £20 so don't believe the doom merchants. Much cheaper from the games website than on steam, This is one game I don't mind paying for DLC''s as it will keep the game in developement. Real world physics. Awesome sound that deserves some decent speakers. And after all they give you so much for free. How you can whinge about that. If it doesn't work on your system then at least it hasn't cost you anything. I have paid good money for other race games that won't even run on my Pc or have no controller support. This game is quality.			"

												R3E was absolutely terrible not so long ago. The interface was a nightmare and the racing odd with the huge coloured markers etc. If you judge it on that, let me tell you that it's now a completely different game.The interface now makes sense, and is one of the best you'll find out there. The game is F2P with purchases for content (but the ability to enter certain events without purchasing the content and the option to try before you buy). There are frequent sales so you don't have to spend a fortune.Cars are very impressive with the physics being better than iRacing, Project Cars and Assetto Corsa but not quite as good as RFactor 2. Tracks, while not laser scanned, are not too far off the quality of RF2's non-laser-scanned tracks. The geometry is generally accurate, but of course you don't get the exact bumps, but laser scans quickly become out of date so this isn't as big an issue as one might expect. Sounds are the best you'll find anywhere, really expressing the clunky rattling shaking madness of a real race car.Netcode needs a bit of work [cars behave strangely with high pings and disconnects happen], but multiplayer is in alpha I believe, so hopefully that'll improve in time. The usual issues of only 30% finishing and loads of wrecks apply in public servers but plenty of leagues exist to cater to the more serious racer. Single-player features the most enjoyable AI I've raced against.In short, R3E is VASTLY better than it was, and now deserves a place among the elite of sim-racing.			"

												I do recommend this game because to me it feels very genuine, and especially the track layouts are very accurate. The graphics are fantastic, except for the surroundings of the track, but who really cares about that...?It's fun, lot to discover, tracks to learn, cars to handle and the buyable content is a very smart move by the producer,(because you'll want more and more content each priced quite fairly) but also for the customer to spend as much or as little as he himself desires. Good game! I'm looking forward to even more classes and tracks in the future.			"

I run this on an i7 2600k with 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz RAM and 2 780ti gpu in sli at 3440 x 1440 with 20 to 30 cars on grid and average 60 to 80 fps with graphics on max on windows 10.The game itself is ok and can be fun, granted the handling is average but it is fun. By no means is it a sim, thats another discussion, but if you enjoy driving and have a wheel or controller (the game is controller friendly) then you will enjoy this. Only issue is the dlc but if your sensible and wait for dlc sale in the in game store, you can pickup content as you go for a reasonable price.RRE isnt my go to driivng game, but it is good enough that I do keep coming back to it.

												Incredible close racing experience, has become my favourite racing sim/game. Can't often find online race (with anyone racing in) in DTM Experience, but the multiplayer is in 'alpha' so hopefully will soon improve. The few online races ive had have been intense and havent seen even one idiot ruining it for everyone else like in most online racing. Also the REAL LIFE DTM Drivers play this and contribute to leaderboards and competitions. There is a neat 'Test Drive' option which lets you test DLC cars before you buy. Feels great to race, and is very pretty [especially in 5760x1080 Surround/Eyefinity] and it sounds Amazing!I've bought some DLC via the game and it's been pretty good value. The DTM experience 2014 cost me little more than £10 when you convert what i paid for the points to buy it and it is well worth that. 8/10 I Recommend for any serious racing sim lover.			"

For those of you who has  data cap with your internet plan please beware that this game will required you to download everything even though you don't have access to most of the content unless you pay to unlock it.

												Before rating:Even though there is some great graphics in this game and it's free, it just makes you to try to pay real money for different cars and tracks. From a YouTube video I saw, it would cost at least $140 to get all the content. Note you only get 5 cars and 3 tracks for default. I think the worst part is how big the file is. It takes 9.1 GB, meaning it installs all the content before hand. I don't recommend this game, but you can get this game for free if you think of trying it.After rating: After playing some IRacing, I realized how much cheaper this game is. For being a free game that tries to simulate car physics like in real life, this is quite a decent game.			"

												***EDIT-2015***If you had told me at the time I first wrote this review that things were just about to turn around and that this would become one of my favorite games of 2015 (and hopefully later) I would have had you committed.But that's exctly what happened. Big shake ups went on at Simbin and the company is now called ""Sector 3"". But more than that, whoever it was that made the majority of the wrong decisions about this game must either be gone or he/she has seen the light.I have changed my review to reflect the great advances this game made. I will also write a more comprehensive review at some point in the future, but for now suffice to say that this game should be in every race enthusiast library.-------------------OLD REVIEW BELOW-------------------------------It pains me not to reccomend this game. I own every single Simbin game ever published and I still race in a GTR2 league with weekly races where we manage to have 30 to 40 rivers per 1h or 1:30 hour race. Every week, year around.Naturally, GTR2 is showing its age, but it is still the only racing simulator with day/night transitions, full pit experience, large fields and all the other features that make a simulator awesome.We waited for GTR3 for a long time and we were very excited by Simbin early previews of their new sound engine. It was truly something to behold.Then GTR3 fizzled and Raceroom Racing Experience came out as a ""free to play"" game. Initially I was quite impressed. The sound was awesome and far superior to anything else out there. The graphics, while not the best, were better than their latest offering (the Race07 series). The car handling was OK. Nothing too advanced, but passable.Even as a free to play game it had promise and initially we belived it would become something at least playable if not a substiotute for GTR2.After the launch, which only included hotlapping as an activity and an ""Apex hunt"" game that, while a good training tool, seemed forced and certainly no substitute for the missing features. However, since it was a new game  I even purchased about $70 of content, betting on the upcoming and promised availability of AI cars and multiplayer. While we knew that as a league we would be looking elsewhere for our future platform, R3 held the promise of being a good offering for casiual online racing.Then time passed and the only new offerings were cars, tracks and ugly, useless ""liveries"".  The promised AI is still (as of this writing) missing in action and there is no multiplayer to speak of, just boards with hot lapping results.The choice of available cars goes from the uninspired (cars that every sim seems to have) to some unique cars that are indeed exciting, except that they all seem to drive like one another.Frankly, if I could go back in time I would buy only the Zacspeed Ford and the additional hillclimb track. The free cars are OK, with the BMW hillclimb car being the best of the lot and the hillclimb challenge is really the only bright spot in this game. Considering that the BMW and the hillclimb are free, I would suggest thst if you like the genre you download this game, but don;t buy anything else. Maybe the other hillclimb track and a car or two that you fancy. All the rest is just repetitive and uninteresting.There is no weatehr, no day/night transitions, no pit stops, no telemetry to speak of, even the liveries, which are not free and there is no way to design your own, are ugly. To me it is truly unbelievable that a company like simbin released this stillborn game. It could have been so much more, but in truth, they fooled me into spending more than double what I ever paid for GTR2 so maybe they made their money from me for the next two years. But no more. They released a DTM game that suffers from the same limitations (it has AI, but it is very weak) and for the first time since I ahve been simracing I did not buy it.Maybe one day they will come to their senses and they will offer the same features as GTR2 offered almost 10 years ago. Maybe they'll relent anmd let players create their own liveries and the promised ""Adaptive"" AI will really be what they promised. Maybe one day you'll be able to compete against other humans online too, and maybe even at night and in the rain. Maybe.When that happens, buy this game. Until then, perfect your hillclimb skills (that is really a lot of fun) and save your money.			"

												For being a free game, I'd say it's more than decent, but how a car handles feels kind of unrealistic sadly, and there's almost no car fitted for hillclimb really and the amount of cars you can choose betwen right now, both free cars and those you'll have to pay for isn't exactly a big and long list, yet, I guess. Either way, I'd still give this game so far a 6.5 out of 10.[Edit] I won't change my mind about this game being pretty good for being free, however, it sucks that most cars cost real money, and what sucks most is that the loading screen for each race is so extremely long, it seriously take about 2-5 minutes each time you want to do a race, whenever it's for testing out a car, practice or even real race. From a 6.5 out of 10, it takes a spring down to 4.8 out of 10 just because of the long time on loading screen.What also sucks enormously is sometimes when you slide, even the slightst, it's almost impossible to recover from that almost regardless of what car you drive, it's very arcade-ish that part and it takes away a lot of the great racing feeling, because it feels like you're driving on a crappy Need For Speed game...

												I downloaded this game at the beginning of the weekend, and I'm glad I did! Awesome free content. Although there's only a few cars to race with, you can try any of the cars in the game for free. There's only a few tracks for free, plenty more if you want to pay.  So far, using the free cars  and the free tracks, I'm definitely hooked! The sound effects are great, the cars sound like the real deal. Far better than most racing games, and in some ways, better than any racing game I've ever played. Yeah, it's that good! The physics are excellent, and you are given 3 choices for general set-up, abs,tcs,etc. I've found a happy medium with the middle choice, it lets me learn the cars and tracks easier. The tracks are beautiful, and have lots of elevation change, rumble strips, run-offs, etc. Again, I've personally only played on three of the tracks. I really like how you can set-up your race with practice and qualifying. This is something that seems lost on console racing games. My only real gripe thus far is the Ai. I've been racing with the adaptive Ai, which for one race was ridiculously easy, then the next race very hard. And going with that was the aggression of the Ai, when I braked a little earlier for a turn and got rear ended and booted from the track. Really? Sometimes damage seems to happen, other times, you can drive into a wall with no consequences. Glitch? But, gripes aside, this is a really well made game, and for free? Amazing! I will most likely end up buying more content when I get bored with the free stuff. I still can't get over the sounds!...			"

												Let me start off by saying this is an incredible game. There's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them. Multiplayer	The multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races. Payment model	Contrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.Now on to the paymeny model. Paying 50€ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50€. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10€ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.I should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it. Interface	The interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's Some personal insightI do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience. The sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.Graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.As an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving.

												Very cool racing game!On the single player mode you can practice your for bots on the multiplayer mode and you can chase your friends. A game for those who do not want to spend money on games such. Need For Speed (In this case Shift).We have to pay for skins for cars, including maps because they are not all free.A nice little game I recommend :) "

												First of all I'm a big racing sim nut, I dont go for those other titles like need for speed, get a console if you like those games. Over all I like this game, its very easy to pick up, very good graphics and physics, and enjoyable, I only have the DTM add on so far and am enjoying it greatly, I've tried playing with both gamepad and steering wheel and the enjoyment is there for both. what I dont like is the amount of DLC's you end up paying for, I really wish the games industry would migrate away from this, unfortunately this game is by far the worst I have in my steam account for this, and the main reason I havent bought more packs. overall yes its a good game, the multiplayer states its still in alpha, so there are better games out there, personally iracing does what this lacks very well. as for Ai, I hate to say it but Project cars probably has the best AI I have come across in a modern racing game. For those who havent got this game yet, should you get it? yes, but choose a DLC pack that you will like and stick with, dont go crazy buying all the packs.			"

												Not for the faint-hearted. A real driving simulator, unlike the arcade-style garbage saturating the games market. Only 2 tracks & 5 cars in Free2Play mode but has replayability in that you are positioned on the real-time leaderboards. Definately a AAA title.			"

												Hey everyone,RRRE is worth your time.RRRE is a absolute hidden treasure of a racing sim buried under a unattractive business model and hidden behind terrible loading menus. (i believe soon to be fixed)Dig beyond, and you will be rewarded, handling, dynamics, visuals, sound. It has it all. Its also beautifully optimized and can run well (and still look great) on older rigs, but when you have the horsepower crank it up for amazing visuals.This game has continually gotten better and better as the SIMBIN team from the great Race07 continue to work and improve this absolute driving masterpiece.Do yourself a favour pic up Hockenheim in sunset with some gt3's and just sit back and enjoy.dig.

												First of all, this game is extremely hard with a keyboard. Actually i would not recommend to play it without any proper controller. There are 3 difficulties:-Get Real: Its not possible to go around a track without spinning-Amateur: Its kind of okey with keyboard, but the traction control will ruin a lot of your laps-Novice: I havent tried it, cause it contains a braking assistant.The sad thing was, that if the car started to slide, there was basically no chance of properly holding it. Most of the times opposite lock and throttle lift felt like they have no effect at all. In amateur difficulty all cars I tried had horrible understeer ( barely any tiresqueel, though ).The menu system is not userfriendly. If you are used to normal, traditional GUI, then you will have a hard time finding things. After 5 hours of play its still strange, not comfortable to use.On the bright side: The game looks amazing. The challanges can make the game addictive ( so you can find entertainment/motivation to play for  years ). The cars noises and twitches make the atmosphere amazing. You can really feel like you are in the car. In Get Real difficulty there are a lot of settings you can change on the car, so simulator fans can be happy.Summary: I recommend this game for a try, maybe you will love it. Steering wheel is very much needed.			"

Yine de oynamaya değer, piyasada vites değiştirirken debriyaja basmanızı gerektiren kaç yarış oyunu var sanki..			"

												Good graphics, feels like most racing games that I've played but the so far worst thing about it that I've noticed is extremely bad control, first car and so far the only car I drove you esentially had to stop the car to turn the thing and the game is so ridged when it comes to completing laps that if you over stear or under stear and you will you lap is totally wasted because you have to back up and do over where ever you messed up if you can figure out where and I wouldnt have so big of a problem with it.... if they let you change cars and if they do I have no idea how and probably wont for the next year cause there is no tips or tutorials for beginners in the game at all so if you're new to racing games do not and I stress this DO NOT download this game cause its ment for people that actually are able to understand what the hell they were thinking when this game was designed and honestly I get better control from talking to a snail so ask please actually write a tutorial for this game for those that dont have the most expensive racing simulator setup ever created.

												I think this game is one to watch. It really is a very high quality racing simulator especially considering it is free. A little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though. The main problem is that there is no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep playing. In most racing games you win races to unlock new tracks and cars which keeps you wanting to play on. But here you unlock new stuff by buying it. Also the races them self are just against the clock. There is very little sense of accomplishment from just moving a few places up the leader boards. So as I say I think this is one to keep an eye on as more content become available.			"

												Its a decent enough racing sim, only problem with the free to play games is the content that you have to buy in game so that you can at least compete to a competant level, cashcow, thats what i would say this game is to the developers simbin,i havent really played that much to be honest as the car you start off with and subsequnt others that YOU will have to buy to be able to compete, is overall what put me off the game,Either way you look at it, it is a good sim for the racing fanatics out there, just not enough for me IMO,Overall : 7.00/10.00 was an 8.00,but down marked due to lack of cars at start, and having to buy them to get anywhere decent within the game,One thing i will note is that this game has a huge online community and friendly one too,so any body reading my review, the ball, as they say, is in your court now.Cheersmark117h			"

												DTM Experience (purchasable in-game) is overpriced. 40e does not represent the quality of this game as it is. I'd say 20e would be a good price, 25e a decent price and 30e a high-end price. 40e is simply too much unless the 1.0 version of this game will be of significant better quality, which I think it will be because it's only in beta0.2 at this point. So. Nice game, but needs plenty of development and as is, it's overpriced.			"

												*** German translation in comments section / Deutsche Übersetzung als Kommentar ***First of all, my review is based on playing R3E with a wheel (Fanatec GT3RS v2 + Clubsport Pedals v1) and in ""GetReal""-mode only. So the FFB + physics part may not match the driving experience of gamepad users. The driving at other difficulty levels (Novice or Amateur) may also differ.Graphics:The overall graphics are quite nice, but sometimes the whole scenery looks a little bit ""cartoony"". Maybe it lacks better shaders to give the graphics a more real touch. Nevertheless i like the graphics, but improvements are always welcome.The available tracks are well-made. As a sidenote .... i like the swaying trees. These small details adds to immersion.Big immersion breaker: The big colored distance markers!I hope Simbin brings us an option soon to replace these arcade-style signs with realistic corner/brake/distance markers.Sound:Actually R3E has the best sound of all available Simracing titles (incl. the Simulations in beta-, alpha-, pre-alpha-status). But iRacing and pCARS are on the way to close the gap (or are on par with some cars). It seems that more and more developer have recognized now the important role of realistic sounds to improve the immersion.Just a small point of criticism: In external TV-cam the engine should be a little bit louder and lasts longer on departure.Force Feedback:IMHO the FFB is one of the things which needs to improve in R3E. The whole system with different ""FFB effects level"" and its canned effects is kinda old school. It seems that there's too much ""ancient"" ISI-motor stuff in use. (BTW ... Reiza Studios demonstrate greatly with Game Stock Car 2013 what is still possible with the aged physics engine)The FFB effects should come right from the physics (suspension + tires). Just like RealFeel-FFB or/and LeoFFB plugins for rFactor. All these canned effects e.g. for rumblestrips aren't necessary, if the FFB would come direct from the physics. Furthermore some of these canned effects settings makes it more difficult to get the FFB feel right.Also the default controller files aren't that good out-of-the-box. For most players it is necessary to play with all the FFB parameters to find some settings, whereby you feel comfortable with. And there are a lot of these FFB parameters, which actually aren't accessable via the GUI. It might be not an easy ""Start & Race"" and this could discourage R3E newcomers.Physics:Goes a little bit hand in hand with the FFB. If the FFB is badly configured you can't get the right feel for the car/physics. But if you find some good settings for your wheel, then the physics come to live too.A few times the word ""simcade"" was mentioned within the community. I'm not agree with that. Many of us are used to the older sims (e.g. GTR2, rFactor1, etc.) and its kind of ""low grip feeling"", which makes you believe that race cars are very difficult to drive. But that's not the case. Race cars are well balanced and build to give you tons of grip, and not to kill the driver in every corner. Only driving on the limit makes it difficult and will separate the winners from the losers. ;) I think that R3E has implemented this grippy track feeling very well. That's not a reason to call R3E not a sim (or ""simcade"").Multiplayer:Not yet available. Only leaderboard challenges where you can race against ghost cars (recorded by other players) are possible at the moment.Furthermore there are actually almost no official informations about the planned multiplayer features for R3E.F2P, Content & Pricing:Free2Play but actually not much free content. Even if there are almost constantly competitions and try-before-you-buy events, but a little more free stuff would be good.Referring to the not-free content, i think the prices for cars and tracks are quite fair. You can drive a car for years and have much fun on a well-made track, and now compare it with the small fee you must pay for it. Otherwise .... if you want all the tracks and cars, it might become very very expensive. I would like to see some bundled packs as special offer from Simbin.What i didn't like is the Livery-part. I have always liked to paint my own car skins. Now i have to pay for a livery and the available real liveries do cost too much. And if you buy a car, i would appreciate that 2-3 liveries (different ones and not only a changed numberplate) are included at least, just to have a basic choice. Look at the leaderboards ........ almost every driver is driving the provided standard livery. And now imagine some multiplayer races later on, where almost everyone is driving the same car skin.

												I've reconsidered my previous, extremely negative review.The last update for this sim has helped things quite dramatically.After playing for a couple of hours I experienced no crashes to desktop at all and the steering feels considerably better, almost perfect now on my Fanatec CSR Elite wheel.Swapping from my single 2560 x 1440 monitor my old tripple screen 5760 x 1200 NVida Surround setup helps make the sim more addictive.I've always liked the quality of the SimBin tracks as they're full of detail which further adds to the sense of immersion.Despite the relatively high cost if you puchase all the tracks and get a good collection of cars, I think you'd find that this will give you hundreds of hours of entertainment.

												This is pure simulator with almost none of virtual help, it's all up to you and your driving style, I love that in simulators when they just put you in action and leave you to learn about the game through the gameplay. When I started playing I thought this game is all about paying for extra stuff. Yea, it is expensive as hell, but its a good game. Sure, only 1 fictional track for use is terrible. The sound is awesome and so are the physics.First feel: 6/10Gameplay: 9/10Controller support: 9/10Physics 9/10 - Driving: 10/10                      Crashing physics: 10/10                      Crash damage: 3/10 Sound: 11/10Price: 3/10Overall game experience: 9/10 - Very fun but very expensive and a lot of locked stuff ruins the fun gameplay. Especially if you have to pay for every car and track.Edit: Most of the competitions lend you everything neccessery for racing, so you can explore new cars and tracks. That feature is very good.			"

												I'm really torn with this one. I love the driving experience, but the fact you only get one car in the free version really takes makes it hard to recommend. It needs at least two more cars and tracks to play before you are forced to dip into your pocket. It's a shame they've gone this route and really limited the playability. I'd say get it IF you're prepared to pay for extra contect. If not, then it's not worth the download. I'm giving it a thumbs up because what is there, is great.			"

												Extremely difficult, if you do not have a good wheel and pedal controller.  This is indeed a SIM game.  Having said that, if you tweak the Get Real settings or use the Amateur Driving model, then its an approachable game for the Xbox 360 controller on PC, but it will take a bit of patience.  For me, it took about 1 hour of trial and error until I was comfortable with the Amateur Driving experience with the Xbox 360 controller, after tweaking game settings to assist more.			"

												I'd say, quite arcade with sim elements, wait till multiplayer comes out! It doesn't have the best physics or ffb, damage doesn't exist, put damage onm in the menu, 200 kph into a wall, no damge... ._. Cars and tracks are good quality, (apart from the physics) not that expensive, you can test some cars for free! But it's still an Alpha, Simbin says it's beta but it's just an Alpha.			"

												Only in beta but great handling sim, looks terrific, at the moment only time trial type events, no multiplayer or single player races. There is a cost to buy tracks but you dont have to buy all of them just pick the ones you want, unlike some of the other reviews this wont cost much. Give it a try, there seem to be regular updates, for the free to play price its worth a shot UpdateI bought the DTM Experience DLC and i love it, best touring car game i have played since TOCA days. Racing is competitive and challengine, tracks are great and physics are good. I am still dissapointed thatht the main game only has time trial type events, no single player races or multi player races, but DTM Experience is great.			"

												Bottom line here , Good game , cars , tracks , sound all good , its a sim not arcade type racer , yes you need to buy the tracks and cars you want to race ,Yes people moan about paying for the cars and track here is my point of view.Other games your pay ""x"" amount for the base game , then pay normally more for the DLC's that follow , Here you are getting the base game , you get a few cars and tracks all for free , you can practise on those to get a feel for things , Go test drive the different disiplines and decide which disiplline you would like to follow as a carreer , then go ahead and purchase that disiplin and track pack for the chosen disiplin , my point is you do not need to choose all the disiplines and tracks unless you want to race in all , For me Race room is not a ""ooohhhhhh collect all cars and tracks"" type game its a sim and carreer game a game where you follow a specific disipline and go from there be the best you can be in chosing race career , so when you get down to it , you get a game ""Simulater"" that you can get good at then purchase what you want to , you have choice , becuase there are plenty drivers  in each disipline , you dont have to pay for a game then pay the same price and more again for the DLC collection , you pay for what you want and its cheaper then the ""Buy Game , Buy dlc , buy dlc buy dlc , and ,,,,,,,,"" you get the picture , buy the car you want in the disipline not need for the whole car pack and the tracks for the chosine disipline ,,,,,,,, we have a game ""SIM"" that you can choose what you want to do , other games ulimatley you will buy the game and all the dlc , why ? becuase all your buddy's have and you need the same to play with them , here you and your buddy's will no dought get only what you all are good at , Bottom line good game , and ultimatly one of the best sims ever even with the buy in for what you want to do , choice good stuff Simbin good stuff.Yes I know my spelling sucks, a floor of mine , i am working on it....

												A great free to play simulator.  It has better graphics than Simraceway, and the sound quality is seccond to none!  This is the level of quality I have come to expect from a great publisher like SIMBIN and this is no exception.  The physics model is continually updated and they now even simulate transmission wear!  There is also a chance to try out each and every car before you buy it.  I wish the same could be said for tracks; however, once again, SIMBIN is more generous than most, if not all, in this category.  Even if you are skeptical, try it out.  If you don't like it, uninstal it.  I highly reccomend this to everyone from sim junkies to those who just want an upgrade from Need For Speed.  The highly customizable dificulty threshold means that RaceRoom is a simulator which you can grow with and (crucially, for me) does not continually hemmoarge your wallet (cough, cough, iRacing) during the process.  Unlike many games, you truly have nothing to lose beyond a few minutes of your time.  In my case, I wasn't dissapointed in the slightest.			"

												Back when this game launched, it lacked even the basic functions of a racing sim, Offline AI race, Online multiplayer. Which of course deserved the hate and bashing.Fast forward to current, all this had been implemented plus more. The sounds are awesome and properly captures how the real cars sound like. Unlike another sim who overexaggerates their car sounds till its ear hurting.The only con is the confusing content purchase system, which are gradually getting better with the introduction of Packs.

												R3E was absolutely terrible not so long ago. The interface was a nightmare and the racing odd with the huge coloured markers etc. If you judge it on that, let me tell you that it's now a completely different game.The interface now makes sense, and is one of the best you'll find out there. The game is F2P with purchases for content (but the ability to enter certain events without purchasing the content and the option to try before you buy). There are frequent sales so you don't have to spend a fortune.Cars are very impressive with the physics being better than iRacing, Project Cars and Assetto Corsa but not quite as good as RFactor 2. Tracks, while not laser scanned, are not too far off the quality of RF2's non-laser-scanned tracks. The geometry is generally accurate, but of course you don't get the exact bumps, but laser scans quickly become out of date so this isn't as big an issue as one might expect. Sounds are the best you'll find anywhere, really expressing the clunky rattling shaking madness of a real race car.Netcode needs a bit of work [cars behave strangely with high pings and disconnects happen], but multiplayer is in alpha I believe, so hopefully that'll improve in time. The usual issues of only 30% finishing and loads of wrecks apply in public servers but plenty of leagues exist to cater to the more serious racer. Single-player features the most enjoyable AI I've raced against.In short, R3E is VASTLY better than it was, and now deserves a place among the elite of sim-racing.			"

												Free to play is demo mode, that is what Sector3 needs to fix for less negativity, end of story.Cheaper than iRacing and probably one of the best racing sims at the moment.Helpful comunity on their forums, found a good guide for my CSW v.2, tweaked them a bit to my preferences, FFB feels great and immersive, probably if not the best compared to other sims once the right configuration settings are found.Didn't change much ingame but basically had to turn almost everything off on my csw.Best part is ""Get Real"", the cars and tracks behave more realistic than in any other Sim/racing game I tried.Soundgasm, cars sound like they should sound.Graphics aren't the latest but still looks pretty good, there are some newer comparisons between RRE, AC, PC and iRacing on youtube, just look for ""Raceroom Nordschleife Comparison 2016"" to get some of the most recent.RRE doesn't have a lot bloat filters, simple and clean, like it should be for any racing sim/game.There are few cons:1. Can't map the main menu navigation to wheel buttons, there should be no need for mouse navigation, or at least it should be a choice.2. Can't create a single player championship that is saved for later, no one will drive a full length championship without resting.3. Needs people to move over from the dark side :DAs for people yapping about that the sim requires them to be online, there are surely some validations etc. going on to avoid cheats, keep in mind what RRE tries to compete against.And if it realy is a must Sector3 sells DVD versions which can be played offline.

												This has got to be the most underrated racing game or simulation. It may not have the best visuals among racing games right now but it still looks really good. It's FFB even though not revolutionary is something that you can tweak to suit your preferences and it's fantastic when you do.Its problem is its annoying ""race2play"" (a play on ""free 2 play"") UI and it also only has a very few free cars and even fewer free tracks. I bought its GT Masters and DTM 2014 experiences and, man, those are fantastic. They should make separate games for those (but give it free to us who bought them here in RRE). Or at least let us configure the game to select a default ""experience"" during startup.AI in this game seems good. They don't display the ""blind AI"" or ""AI without the I for intelligence"" of other racing games and simulations.Currently this game is still missing some polish on the HUD elements. Like the sector split times really huge and distracting when we only need to know if we're going faster or slower for the current lap. The position bar's fonts look horrible. Those things are really well done on their older games (Race series) so I hope they could really improve this area of the game. Currently those look ugly in comparison to the rest of the game that I turn them off at the expense of feedback since the game does not have a race engineer to tell you what's going on.			"

The engine notes, the bumps, and the little squeal of the brakes are just perfect. AI can put up a fight and react instead of following each other in a line. I feel the content prices are fair and they run sales pretty often. If you like racing GT cars there is a wealth of content here. It's free to try out so you really can't go wrong.

												This game looks awesome and its free. Free is never truly free, but that is the marketing model.This game will continue to develope for years to come. This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better. This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it. Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.			"

												Greatly improved. I played a bit in June and was let down overall. Recent updates have overhauled the menu system (yay) and improved the in-game feel of the cars, as well as added aditional free content.This is still a free-to-play title, with everything that that entails. However, the DTM dlc's are basically separate games that launch from the main menu. And, the 2013 DTM content is playable from within the main R3E.			"

												excellent racing simulator there is a lot of content you have to buy including cars and tracks but i will list all of the items you will have. Lakeview hillclimb, Portmiao Circuit (or Algarve GP) , RaceRoom Raceway, Aquila CR1 Sports GT, Saleen S7R, 134 Judd V8, DMD P20, DMD P21, Mistral M530, Mistral M531, Canhard R51, Canhard R52, Cougar C14-1, Cougar C14-2. This is it but there are loads of other cars that you test drive for free whenever you want and as many times as you want. The tracks unfortunately are not testable. Any DLC cars can NOT be used in races or Championships.			"

												RaceRoom is a very good game. I've really enjoyed the hours I have spent on it so far.This is the short version of the review:Pros +The sounds are superb+The graphics are nice+The car handling is very good +The tracklist is seems very cool+The carlist is very good (Only racecars, mind you)+The menus are easy to use+The in-game interface is easy to understand+Extremely detailed tuning+The AI is goodCons-Very limited in cars and tracks if you do not pay for them-You need a gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game-Tyres seem to last unrealisticly long (Might just be me, I am not experienced in real racing)-Damage can only be enabled on the hardest difficulty (For explanation, see below)-The pit menu is a bit fiddlyThis is the longer version of the review:RaceRoom is a very good simulator racing game. This is how it works:There are three difficulty settings. Novice, Amateur and GetReal.Novice is the easiest. It has Traction Control, Anti-Lock Brakes and Auto Braking.Amateur is the middle ground. It only has TC and ABS.GetReal surely does what is says. It gets real. No assists enabled.GetReal is only usable for those with a gamepad or a steering wheel. On a keyboard is utterly useless.There is a damage model, but it can only be used in the ""GetReal"" mode, which seems odd to me. In the ""GetReal"" mode, you can choose if you want mechanical damage, only cosmetic or none at all. The game also includes a penalty system for corner cutting. You can set it to different kinds of penalties. A slow down penalty, a drive-through penalty or a stop-and-go penalty (Be aware, you'll have to select to serve it manually. Just driving through the pits to serve a drive-through won't work).When you don't pay any money you get acces to three tracks and seven or eight (could be wrong, might be less) cars. Two circuits and one hillclimb course. You can test drive any car you like as many times as you like, but only on a specific track. For the test drive, you can select the difficulty mode. You cannot test drive the tracks, which I think is odd.The game sounds fantastic and looks very good as well. The tuning in the game is unbelievably detailed and quite frankly scarily detailed. I daren't touch it. Overall, I think it is a great simulator which everyone interested in racing should give a try.  (This line of text contains some extra love for the people who read the review this far. I've put more time than I should have into this review) "

Change to 3rd person and mouse controls. Fail to go round a corner in gear 2. Get crashed on pit straight. Decide to start a race. ""Accidentally"" crash someone.

												Before i start i need to ell you that this should neither have thumbs up or down.(Expand the page for the more positive stuff)At first i posted a negative review because  of its STUPID FREE TO PLAY mecanic and how they charge crasy amounts of money to play more than the bad cars (that i have not tuched since i bought DTM Experience) on Raceroom Raceway and Portimao to be able to really enjoy the game. just take a track for example, a less known and popular track costs 3€ and a legendary track like SPA and Monza costs 5€. And the cars, just to buy 1 car (with all paintjobs for it) it costs 3€. To not pay as much i recomend buying one of the EXPERIENCE packs like DTM and ADAC to get some good cars and tracks.Apart from that stupid pay system the game is good. they update the game regulary and are adding new things now and then. The physics are good but not perfict. The sound is great. The visuals are amazing. The adaptive AI should mark a milestone in racing sims and are the greatest feature. If you pay for the stuff in game you will get an amazing game.			"

												There are some truly god aful reviews here. Not liking the game because you have to buy content is not a legitimate reason to leave a negative review.    You have to buy everything these days and why is that different here?   It's cost is comparative to any other title  when yuo add a few content packs into play.  Yes if you add them all you will spend more money then an entire game, you also end up with Laser Scanned tracks, some of the best driving physics a simulation has Graphically the game is a little behind but it IMO actually does a great job at looking the most realistic and providing most realistic feel when racing.    RF2 does an ok job here but being DX9 only is a hold back.  AC is gorgeous but not real,  Project Cars looks like a video game.  PC looks the best, but also has the worst driving model and is not realistic in look at all.  If you enjoyed Race 07, GTR2, and GTR Evolution you will like RRE.  To me this is the spiritual success of these  titles and I will continue to support both Simbing/Sector3 and ISI and their Gmotor efforts.   Ian and Project Cars well lets just say I have PCars but ill never buy it.			"

												Note that this really is not a free to play simulation. The free content is no good. To see what this is all about you have to spend cash to get the good packs. Basically it is like this: If you follow real life racing and have a 250 usd+ steering wheel setup and knowledge of and love for real life racing dynamics... and 100 usd+ to spend on content. Then this is your sim. It is hands down the best simulation of actual RACING ever made and with the recent updates it is very close to life like racing. Now that adaptive ai is working it is also the best simulation for single player. The fact that physics are developed in unison with the real DTM/TT drivers (whom you also see sometimes online) as well as the general engine being awesome makes this the best package right now if you have all prerequisites. If not you will not like it. You need: Expensive steering wheel set (without this, do not get it)100 USD cash for different content (without this, do not get it) Real life racing knowledge (without this, do not get it) Following of real life racing and a love for actual track racing (without this, do not get it) So, disregard the free to play thing. This is a hardcore platform for simulation racing, with a good single player structure as well. If you like some more casual ""game"" style get Project CarsIf you like hot-lapping with road cars get Assetto CorsaIf you like to devote 16 hours a day towards virtual league racing and disregard the rest of your life, get rFactor2 If you want a good simulation of actual racing, that is also a good single player, offline experience and need a full simulation model, get this			"

												It's OK...Pros: Reminds me of Gran TurismoGood physicsCons:SO many paywalls! About 90% of the cars and 95% of the tracks have to be bought! Just release it as a pay to play game and give us all the cars and tracks. Don't give us a slice of the game and tell us to buy the rest. I'd gladly buy all of the game, were it to be released as a p2p game.Like I said, barely any cars for free, and two, that's right, TWO of, like, over fifty tracks.Overall, I give this game a 6/10, purely down to the realistic physics and the fact that it reminds me of Gran Turismo.

												The game is beautiful and crisp. The controls on the keyboard is very difficult, I suggest to use either a gaming controller or a steering wheel. There are some cars that I never heard of which is definitely a plus. Problem with this game is that you have to pay to play on most of the tracks. You only get three tracks and not sure how to unlock them unless you pay. If you are into paying for stuff in games then you should grab this one if not find something else.			"

												I love cars and 3D racing games and this game gives a good explanation of racing with a variety of tracks and cars to choose from but there are four problems. First there is only one track you have to choose from as far as I can see and you have to pay for the rest of them and I use Aussie Dollars not USD, so that makes it even harder for me to buy the game currency. Second there are only two cars you start off with, the Aquila and the BMW. There both great I can tell you that but the Aquila has just poor steering and same goes with the BMW. Third I don't know how to earn the game currrency so that is a big problem for me. Last it said 2 hours to install and it took 7 hours and I had to wait a day for it to fully load.I would recommend this game to car and racing fans but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use has a few hard turns and you have to really judge you turning because the turn, most of the time is hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not going in a full rotation like other games. You also have to wait a couple of seconds before the cars goes from N to D or N to R. Overall I did enjoy the game but its just those few problems that took some of the joy out of playing the game. I would give this game a 6.5/10.			"

Full of exploitersUntil this has been fixed


Well done Ferran Buisan - SPA 
Community Created Artwork for RaceRoom Racing Experience 
By: Erik Taurus

			This is why I won't spend a Euro on this game until this has been fixed.		


I won't be bothered with this game because when we play online or try the leader boards the times are set by people like him.Below was my recommend review, unfortunately the leader boards still haven't been fixed and the below review was written on July 8:th 2015...Potential RaceRoom Racing Experience has as a lot of it!The game is great and simulates the cars close enough, or what I'd recon at least, there are a few things missing, but more on that later. The races can have free practise and qualifying sessions added before the race and these options are also available in multiplayer. The setup and configuration of the dedicated server is very easy. These cars, which in real races are millimetres apart and us being able to do the same whilst playing multiplayer is just awesome! Hats off for near flawless multiplayer code! The free cars you get are awesome to drive and shows that effort has been put into simulating the different behaviours of the cars. There are two racing circuits where one is a more open circuit similar to Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and the other a more narrow circuit similar to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Both circuits are great fun and there are milliseconds to be gained in and out of every corner!I've yet to try the ""Get real"" difficulty to have a look at the different setups of the cars, but I do hope there are some pre-sets to chose from. The Jeoff Crammond Grand Prix games didn't have and see where that lead them... There are however some problems with the game. The first thing is that their marketing plan is confusing to say the least, no need for me to dig deeper into it, read the  other reviews and read the guides for the game if you are to buy content.The actual tracks could simulate more realistic features like best grip in the race line, and I'd like to see different type of weather too, like rain for example. The leader board is a joke because the fastest laps on it are now impossible to beat as changes to the tracks have made some ""short cuts"" invalidating the lap. A reset of the leader boards should be done ASAP! Sector3 Studios are working continuously on the game and with that in mind and seeing the potential it'll bring RaceRoom Racing Experience very far!			"

												First of all, I think DTM Experience might be the best racing simulation out there.  I hope that RaceRoom emulates it more and more as I'm sure it will.  Raceroom itself is still in beta and therefore it doesn't have much other than doing practice sessions with AI.  I took advantage of a sale recently and got all RaceRoom content for about $70.  That's a few dozen cars and 15-20 tracks I think.  That's a great price especially compared to another race sim that I've spent about $1,000 on (iRacing).  RaceRoom is a lot of fun. DTM is a little lacking in content (no pit stops, no rain, no mp) but some of that should come later.  At least I know the multiplayer will.  Even though it's lacking in content it is one very, very good racing simulation.  I highly recommend it.			"

												- Terrible microtransaction business model.- Horrible development, the game ran better over a year ago and has suffered from constant connection issues, lag and stuttering since then, and when an update finally arrives, it makes it worse and they can't seem to fix the main issues as they claim the ""need"" to be online because of how the store and steam wallet are set up. (no online server connection = can't play)- Claims to be a ""simulator"", but without the essential features. (tire pressure, etc.) In fact, RaceRoom uses the same physics engine as AMS and Project Cars but feels like your driving on a skateboard and once you compare Pcars to RaceRoom you will see the simularities and realize that Project Cars feels more realistic and also comes with better graphics, VR support, tracks, and cars along with dynamic weather/night for a fraction of the cost ($29.99) compared to the content prices in RaceRoom...Just sayin.Be cautious. Don't make the same mistake I did, If your looking for an actual ""simulator"" experience, then rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa are the way to go with MUCH better value, physics, features, content and moddibility. Even Pcars blows this game away. These guys (Sector 3) aren't interested in giving the community what they want for a better experience, they are just out for your $$$ by peddling content and a half baked VR via a microtransaction model.This game is dying. My advice if your looking for games in this genre is to pick up AC, PCars, and rF2 for a fraction of the cost of owning only 1/2 of RaceRoom content (unless you have the money to burn and hard drive space to spare)			"

												This game could be THE game but it is not. For several reasons: not enough content (or so unaffordable) and no multiplayer mode. Graphically, the game is beautiful with a nice management of light and shadows, well reproduced circuits and steering feel very involved. But the game really costs too much to unlock (between 50 and 60 € at least) and thus be able to enjoy the game fully. I advise to wait an effort from SIMBIN with the lower prices of the various components of the game and the appearance of multiplayer.			"

												This game could be THE game but it is not. For several reasons: not enough content (or so unaffordable) and no multiplayer mode. Graphically, the game is beautiful with a nice management of light and shadows, well reproduced circuits and steering feel very involved. But the game really costs too much to unlock (between 50 and 60 € at least) and thus be able to enjoy the game fully. I advise to wait an effort from SIMBIN with the lower prices of the various components of the game and the appearance of multiplayer.			"

												RaceRoom is an excellent racing sim, one of the best actually. It has amazing graphics, physics and sounds. It runs smooth but there's one flaw and it's somewhat big. The real downside of this game is it's purchasing system and expandability. Remember, this game is free, but in reality, it's not. There is a plethora of cars and tracks, however, you only get a very small handful of each as Free to play. And I mean pretty small where I'd be dying to try the cars and tracks that you would need to buy each one separately, which to me is a gimmick.Overall, RaceRoom is a great game and all, it's just that the developers had incorporated a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ expansion system. In my sense, I would've rather paid for the game to get all of the features in place of it being free.			"

												First of all, I think DTM Experience might be the best racing simulation out there.  I hope that RaceRoom emulates it more and more as I'm sure it will.  Raceroom itself is still in beta and therefore it doesn't have much other than doing practice sessions with AI.  I took advantage of a sale recently and got all RaceRoom content for about $70.  That's a few dozen cars and 15-20 tracks I think.  That's a great price especially compared to another race sim that I've spent about $1,000 on (iRacing).  RaceRoom is a lot of fun. DTM is a little lacking in content (no pit stops, no rain, no mp) but some of that should come later.  At least I know the multiplayer will.  Even though it's lacking in content it is one very, very good racing simulation.  I highly recommend it.			"

												Multiplayer contains alot of trolls with no admins to get arid of them and im a big fan of multiplayer when It comes to online games. But for this game, you get at least a couple trolls here and there in a server. They often like to ram you off the track or use their car to block part of the track. Drivers like me would rather roleplay and play the game the professional way. It only takes one troll to ruin the server gameplay and there is no body to take care of the issue. If trolls were not such a big problem, I would recommend this game, but I don't. Just about ready to uninstall this game if multiplayer doesn't get any better.			"

												Simple as this:I do not like the format much, Pay to Play twists me the wrong way and I would not like to see it re appearing too much andtherefore I do not have a lot of experience with this sim as I would rather pay for something up front, however, I can still say that this is a fantastic sim by Sector 3 Studios and well worth a look, but, for now, whilst I am in the financial deficit I am in, I shall stick to the cheap-and-cheerful Race 07, which is cheaper, just less advanced by this in terms of the same engine (in terms of physics, graphics and sound) and the... not so intelligent Artificial Intelligence, which are MUCH better in RaceRoom. Overall, If you are willing to spend a lot, get this game, If not, get another - older - game, which would be cheaper.			"

												This game has come a long way from the very first time I tried it back in early 2013 and is very solid for a Beta release, it has a lot of potential for a f2p game. The sound is amazing and the physics need just a little improvement. The tracks look amazing and the tracks made by the developer are fun and challenging. My only major critisism is the AI which is a long way in my opinion from being complete, they will ram you time and again if you're on a turn and they accelerate faster than you. The control system could use a little work and be more descriptive on how the sensitivity settings for controller (using a wired Xbox 360 controller until I can afford a descent steeling wheel rig) because after many sessions of tweaking the settings for steering acceleration I am still lost on how the settings affect my controller. Other than that this game is definitely worth a try if you are looking into Racing Sims. 9/10			"

												I actually don’t recommend RaceRoom Racing Experience BUT...I took a moment to look through some of the positive and negative reviews prior to writing this and realized some things which actually changed my opinion of the game from the perspective of functional game content.The one criticism I have which has not changed is the sound. I’m not a professional racer, I don’t know what it sounds like to be behind the wheel of one of these monstrosities, but when I play a racing game with a 5.1 surround system I expect it to feel raw and powerful. Instead, I found all of the vehicles to sound unbelievably anemic and whiny. Again, I have no idea what these cars may sound like in real life, but this is a game. It’s disappointing to see such aggressive speed machines yet hear whiny little RC cars.Now one of the first things I learn was that this is (at least in some capacity) the same people responsible for Race07. I recently gave that game a whirl and had a nauseatingly terrible experience with it. Whatever they learned from those past titles they have clearly refined it and mastered it for RaceRoom. I know a lot of time has passed between the two, but it’s hard to think this quality sim is from the same people behind Race07. Great job, devs; keep up the iteration and self improvement!The next thing I took a step back from complaining about was the Free-to-Play model. Many of the negative reviews pointed out the frankly incomprehensible way in which content is being sold. I think the model is confusing and poorly thought out, but I don’t think the fact that you are expected to pay for the majority of the cars when the game and a handful of vehicles are completely free is a point to merit a negative review. The game is extremely detailed and - as best I can tell - extremely faithful to the physics behind circuit racing. RaceRoom isn’t a Free-to-Play racing game in my eyes; it’s a demo for a well crafted racing simulator that allows you to pay for exactly the content you want if you decide that the mechanics interest you.I didn’t much enjoy it, but RaceRoom Racing Experience is a free demo for a very high quality racing simulator. If you’re into this genre and like what you see in the screenshots, you should absolutely try out the game. There is literally nothing to lose by trying it out.			"

												This game takes so much away from my laptop. I cannot get the most out of it. I'll have to upgrade. I really wish this was a 29.99 game and included just a few of these series. I would have bought it outright. This pay for this and then something else comes out later that you want to buy and damn no money. I hate this type of scenario. Just offer it up at one price and get everything. Or break it up into two or three games for 19.99. You would have a customer. I am sick of getting excited and then haivng to uninstall and then three months later hey they got DTM and then downloading it once again but then finding out that you cannot access all the tracks.

												♥♥♥♥♥game. Cars feel like driving through a foot of water because when you turn they don't respond nearly like they should. I have a DFGT and have played other racing sims, such as iRacing, Project CARS, Assetto Corsa, etc. I don't claim to be the best at them, I suck pretty bad actually. But this game just flat out doesn't feel right at all. The steering response is simply horrible.On top of that, setting my DFGT up so that it would actually work properly and give me 900 degrees of steering in this game was a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I've had no problems in any other game with this wheel, but in this game it literally took me 30 minutes just to figure out how to get 900 degrees of steering, and the solution was to disable the hand animations, which speaks to the poor quality of this game. Don't waste your money, if you're going to buy anything in this game, get iRacing and buy things in that instead, it's a much better investment.			"

												2 words..... BUY NOWand i dont mean buy the game!rather than a free game that you have to pay to play,why not just charge for the game?the game is average at best, but every car you want costs money, you get about 3 to choose from, practice session just gave me false start regardless of how i set off!buggy game that i would not recommend even at the high price of free!you will end up spending £60 just to drive the cars you want! couldn't see the track half the time in racing as dash was too high, not very good physics either.shame it could be so much more			"

												RaceRoom is truly awesome and flawless, the game play, the way the car handles and look is fantastic, I play on a laptop and use a controller so for me its totally awesome in either single, multi-player mode or in a challenge, all is easy to access from the menu, Plus, before you buy a car you get to try it, woohoo, most good games here are $40 to $100 and I havnt spent anywhere near that in this game and I own a number of cars and tracks, So yea I recommend this game to all fellow racers, grab the game and look in your rear-view mirror, wait, too late, I just passed you.

Product received for free
												Pros:+ Cars drive, feel and look great+ Amazing sound+ Good immersion and sense of speed+ Amount of quality content+ Test drive all cars before buying+ Free competitions with the possibility to try out a big variation of content+ Comes with 2 free tracks and a few cars+ Solid netcode and fun multiplayer+ Gamepad supportCons:- Obscure payment model with in-game virtual currency and microtransactions- Overpriced content (even with the regular discounts)- Not much going on in multiplayer. For paid content it's even worse.- The vast amount of microtransactions split the small public multiplayer community even further.Conclusion:This could be one of the most fun and populated racing sims out there if not for the publishers greedy payment/business model. Actually I like the idea to only pay for the content I want. Buy all tracks and your favourite cars of the series you want to race in and you're all set. But in reality the way it is now it doesn't work out. The pricing is not clear and fair enough. The public multiplayer community is split and barely alive. There is not enough going on online to justify buying the content. I was torn between giving the game a thumbs up or down. But from my personal point of view it all comes down to the questionable business model imposed by the publisher which keeps the game from being populated and more successful. In the current state I simply cannot recommend it to someone who likes to race online a lot.			"

												4/10which is halved of what i'd give it normaly due to lies about this being full game.+GraphicsSoundPerformanceAdjusting difficulity - Somehow allways feels fair no matter what you set as diff %-Demo verssion not a free game inspite of how it is presented (Halving the score)Very uninspired track selection (give me something original! - Tatra test track and such)very uninspired vehicle selection (most of it is locked behind paywall annyways)Frusrating lack of value on Packs of cars/livieries/tracks (20ish EUR per one and you get like 8 EUR tracks?!)I did enjoy this game once i realised that it is DEMO but i would very much appritiate if i was told that it is DEMO prior to playing it, the initiall shock was bad.  Game looks and feels great, what little of it i did play allways seemed to be good and difficulity of it was (inspite of my lack of skill) allso fairly aceptable. I did not encounter anny game breaking bugs and my constant out of track ventures were due to lack of skill. So they did pretty god job on that front and i praise that.Trying to play championship with 2 tracks is stupid tho so i am not inclied to dignify this point too much: content is excellent for DEMO, pathetic for annything but demo.Car selection is not too sad tho you only have access to 2 overarching categories (prototype and can cars) couple of choicess within each one, fairly solid content for this demo.I did have major problem orienting myselve in menu, the track, car icons are way too large, list that would expand once you click the specific icon would be better. Furthermore structure of the menu itselve is kinda wonky - it'd be great if you could select category (prototype, can, formula, etc) than went to brand or year selection and than chose liviery. Right now you choose year AND category on one screen (WTCC 2013 example) and than individuall vehicle. it is not very intuitive is what i am aluring to.Another missed oportunity and another damned Freemium demo. Skip this game and opt in for something more substantial.			"

												EDIT: its been a long while but the previous info still seems true. RaceRoom Racing experience is an ok racing game, even if it does feel rough around the edges. I am not sure if its ""finished"" now or not, I just know it doesn't feel like it. I will say that this review is pretty terrible. I just can't seem to find any of the info I want to put out there. As of now you at least have my opinion.As of this review: The game looks ok at first, and in all honesty I want to Like RaceRoom Racing Experience but it just feels so, so unfinished. At this point though, with the devs undergoing ""restructuring"" the future does not look bright for RaceRoom Racing Experience.The game in my opinion is not even finished enough to do a positive or negative review, at this time I cant recommend that you play/ get it, but I dont think you should write it off just yet.

												Untill this gets servers you can set up and controll I wont be purchasing any content. The content is expensive for me and the game is quite limited. Despite that I like the Physics and Graphics and the sound, tracks the controller options. Just wish there was more to do than well, race... 2 player on the hill climb would be fun, togue battle, how about custom number and name board on the cars? paint design, create ur own race team... buy upgrades and progress through racing classes and pass licence tests etc, earn money how about some production cars or rally tracks/offroad surface/snow dynamic weather?... there is just so much more that im used to in a racing game, that is missing from every SIM...Got a long way before I can reccomend it unless you are a pure Racing enthusiast.

												Raceroom experience was a very frustrating experience!Update :- I have found a way to fix the main problem that I have with this game and that is to change traction control preset 0 from 0 to 100 in the car setup in the garage before a race (i.e. in practice or qualifying). I think what I was experiencing is called power on oversteer. Though I still cant believe that it should be anything like that bad in a real car :(Note this wont help you brake or go around a corner, it just means you wont spin off the track into the corner when you gently accelerate !I cant believe the developers have made this game so inaccessable when all they need to do is change 1 variable and it would be 30000 percent more playable to people who try the game !Btw I come at tihis as someone who generaly prefers more sim like games like gt legends, grid, dirt, test drive unlimited 2, nfs shift 2, race injection etc. But even with hundreds of experience on probably 20 different racing games I couldnt make it around a lap without it crashing from oversteer !I still hesitiate to recommend this game because of the sheer anount of frustration this issue caused meHere is my original review :-Raceroom experience is a very frustrating experience!This is mainly down to what I consider a fault in the physics model !The frustrations are :-1 (and this is the big 1) ) When accelerating out of a bend the car oversteers and crashes back into the bend it has come out of ! This is most noteable on raceroom raceway, on the corner at the start of the start finish straight. The track goes around a corner and up a hill, yet the car just uncontrolably spins with oversteer back towards the corner if power is applied.No amount of opposite lock corrects it, and it doesnt feel like the back end is trying to overtake the front end due to too much power. It feels like its turning in a circle for no good reason. Grrr !Though I have a feeling this is a common fault with a lot of so called sims. How many cars in the real world do you see spinning into the corner they have come out of ?This issue is probably more of a problem on raceroom raceway than most tracks. But that track in the standard yellow car (Canhard R52, sillhoutte series ?) sure does highlight it!Btw I have a g25 wheel and pedals and a fast pc (gtx970 etc). So I dont think my problems are down to my setup.Also I have witnessed many many drivers having the same problems on that track, so its not just me. Though the experienced drivers do work around the problem.2) If you do crash off, then the game takes 20 seconds to get going again. Either the car wont move at all or it just spins you into the opposite direction or you end up doing doughnuts. It will not spin and point in the right direction ! It doesnt matter if you are really subtle and gentle on the power or really heavy the result is the same ! Grrrr!I think other than this the physics are very good, the sound is very good, the graphics are a slight improvement over race 07, but not as good as say need for speed or project cars.Oh and I think the actual online multiplayer mechanics are good, which probably makes it one of the best online racing games, sim or otherwise on the pc (if and for me this might be too much of an if :- If you can adapt your driving style to ignore what I consider to be faulty physics).I like the way you can test drive the cars before buying, though generally the content is too expensive. Particularly buying multiple items doesnt give enough of a discount.Anyway, it would be a very good game, if it wasnt for what I consider to be a fault in one aspect of its physics model that makes it soooo frustrating :(			"

												Impressive demo but I hate the IAP, free limited play model. Graphics, sound is superb. The interface is terrible and a little confusing so far. Can't see pictures of cars available for selection before a race. And the load times... TERRIBLE. And I'm running this using a 16GB NVIDIA GTX, SSD drives, with 32GB ram. I guess my $3500 laptop isn't fast enough for this game. It runs smooth but load times are unacceptable.			"

												I am really enjoying this alot.  Had this on steam years ago but didn't actually play much and never bought any content that seems at the time rather highly priced.Sometime or another an update wrecked my FFB and I uninstalled and forgot about it.Now about 2 years later I try it again.  It really is very nice and very immersive.Buying 1 pack from stream and then later much cheaper now when I buy ingame store. I guess a big part of that is content I now already own from buying that first pack, so in the end prices are really not too bad.I am enjoying driving at Nordschleife with this sim much more than I ever did with either AC or Pcars.The combination of great sound, graphics, forcefeedback and overall feel really puts you in the driving mood.   The new update has a massive improvement to the AI.  This just got a whole lot better			"

												Even at this BETA  stage, I recommend it.  Superb graphics, immersive feel.  Hold off on DTM Experience until SimBin provides sliders to adjust AI.  Right now, as of this date, AI is not very adaptive and is just too easy.  As well, the game needs more detail as a simulation.  I want to know what my tire temps are so that I can know how to set up my suspension etc etc.			"

												It takes a little dedication to get used to the game.The handling is sometimes a little quirky, especially when new to the game.Though, when figuring out how the steering exactly works, and lap times are going down, the game really stimulates you to continue - whether on the same track, in the same car, or in the same competition.I didn't buy any vRP (currency) yet, so I haven't bought any new cars or tracks, but already, I managed to spend over 20 hours into the game. And I don't play games that much, so for me, that's a lot ;)If racing is really something you enjoy, I would recommend you check it out. Probably, a lot of you will ragequit out, because the handling is a thing to get used to. However, with a little bit of practice, even the 2 free tracks are good to drive on, and even when experienced, those tracks are great fun, and still full of challenge.Nevertheless, if racing is not your type of game, this might not appeal to you fully.

												For all the positive things I read of the game, I decided to give it a try at last. It was a fairly large download but nothing too crazy. I started it up to see a rather weird menu interface with slightly poor readability and no menu music, just bland sfx.I decided to try out a practice, single player game. Of the limited selection of cars, I picked the very first one. I sat and waited for what seemed like 5 minutes for the game to load. Now I have a fairly good PC and I've never had to wait more than slightly over a minute for ANY of my games to load, yet this takes forever. I alt+tabbed out to check my email, reddit, facebook and checked the game again and it still hadn't loaded.But after a while it did load, I needed to see if the gameplay was worth it. I started up my engine, to a very good sounding roar (I expected the good sound quality based on reviews) and hit the track. To my disappointment, the car felt rather sensitive to turning or it would skid very easily. I've played Race 07 extensively and I've never spun out or oversteered by accident. How is this game proving to be the worst driving simulator I've ever played? I'd never spent a cent buying the other cars either, because the sample cars didn't give me much hope. All in all, I tried 2 other cars, had the same issues and I quit the game. The loading times are obscenely long and there is too much online verification involved. But hey, I got to listen to some realistic sounding engines. 3/10. (I love car engine sounds).			"

But hey, I got to listen to some realistic sounding engines. 3/10. (I love car engine sounds).			"

												Let me start by saying, first off, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want to play more than what seems like a ""DEMO"" of the game.  Second, I got a few issues with the physics when using a game pad.  It is very twitchy even with light throttle on every car when you are not in 3rd gear or higher.  I have been on race tracks and in real race cars.  You can tell when you are getting close to the edge of the handling capabilities.  This game seems to either give you massive understeer, then when you manage to make a corner, you got the twitching problem when trying to get power down out of the corners.  I find myself having to be in one or two gears higher than I should be just to keep control of the physics at the lower speeds.  Having a spedometer when you are outside of the car would help also.  The only way you can get a speedometer or tachometer is to have your view from inside the car.			"

												The Game looks great! The tracks and cars are detailed. However, the controls are incredibly difficult to setup, if it detects your input. I used a Xbox One controller and could not control the vehicle at all. It says it's free, but you have the option to pick three cars on three tracks, then you have to pay an exorbitant amount for the rest of the game, much more than a AAA game would be. If you're goinmg to make a free game, make it free. If you're going to make a game that costs money, then make it cost money, but don't lure people in with the facade of free only to try to charge them more moeny than Fallout 4 or GTA V costs!			"

												First things first;  This is no Arcade Racer. Its a Racing Simulator. That means its content is more ""geared"",.. lol,... towards, reality racing.Now, I don't understand why a lot of people would say any game is broken, when the problem, is their hardware. The only reason I could see fit to complain, would be if the devs, make changes to the game's system requirements, that make it so you can no longer play the game, without spending more money, on new hardware (This is made Worse, if the game is an upfront paid for game to begin with)[Demos are excluded].If the game stops working on my system, I know that as long as I have all the files, downloaded (no missing or corrupted files), that something within my system has changed. NOT THE GAME. LOL Especially, if others are able to still run the game. Really come, now!!! Why would you even fix you thoughts, to blame the game, if you yourself, have it running on another system within your own home? Not to mention that your friends are ""NOT"" having any of your issues. Why are you so unlucky, so the game is just bad for everyone else also!? I'm thumbing up for this game. Oh yeah, wait,... Pay to win. Its free now with 11 cars and 4 tracks. It was like that from what I remember. I just recently found this out a few days ago myself. Double thumbing now. Pay to win with a game that's free to Start playing, I've looked around the game and found the Platinum Pack deal,... (while it could be better priced),... Ok and do-able, though I haven't bought it yet [Everything is included in the Pack]. Now your Free to Start Playing / so-called Pay to 2 Win game can be Just a paid for game, with full content.  So, yes! I'm wanting to ""BUY"" the game. I'm just saying all this imo. I think that what makes a p2w game is when getting certain paid content delivers a big advantage over f2p players, and when that certain paid content is unreasonably expensive. But, once again, this all mopoGood job, Sector 3 Studios/Simbin Studios!			"

												One of the best free2play racing games I've ever played! It's seriously amazing. I'm not a pro and I've never driven a car, but the handling feels pretty realistic imo! It's pretty hard at the beginning, but I mastered the novice difficulity in ~30 minutes. Definately give it a shot, it's free!Edit: The AI is way too aggressive. They wreck whatever they see. I'm trying to peacefully turn, but NO. They have to bump me and make me do a 360 turn. Fix the damn AI.			"

												This game crashes every 20-40 minutes for me (i5-4670K and GTX 760).  Until they fix that I'm not paying for anything.  The handling of the cars seems really good once you get the steering wheel settings sorted out.  There's no single-player vs. the AI or multiplayer right now, you just drive around a track by yourself and it shows you how your times compare to other people's.  The menus are the most ridiculously confusing thing I've ever seen too.If they fix the crashing problem and add actual racing to the game, I'll be happy to get the $40 DLC.  But until then it's a no go.			"

												Totally fake and unrealistic car behavior, physics, sound and graphics. Maybe not as bad as iracing, where it doesn't matter how fast you drive it always feels the same, but bad enough that you have to even in a demo purchase cars and tracks. Just crap all around and as a perfectionist, I have to say that nothing so far competes or compares to F1 2013 in realism, physics, graphics and sound !!!			"

												Wow. I can't remember the last time that i hated a game so much that i decided to spread the word about its awfulness.RaceRoom is the absolutely worst racing experience of a life-time. I love the racing genre and i've played them all. This is one of those games that has tons of potential but is ruined by its incredibly boring core game-play and the details of its design-choices. However, it doesn't stop there.From the clunky, bloated and confusing UI to the hopelessly boring ""challenges"" of learning the tracks to the rear-wheel driven impossible-to-steer cars you get to drive in your very first race (!), i have never before come across a game in which there were so many different things that i disliked right away. It's as if the developers want to scare you away from the idea of a free racing game and/or donate this product to scientists who are doing patience-research on modern man. It wouldn't surprise me if the developers themselves are scientists who have no idea what fun is in a video game. The multi-player button is greyed out and thus inaccessible, possibly because you're expected to finish all the ""challenges"" first. Something i would guarantee that 90% of all those who try the game never will. There's no AI to race against, but only single ghosts of times to beat. So who cares about beating a ghost when you get absolutely nothing for it at the end of a race, nor have any fun whatsoever during the race?RaceRoom is a remarkable monument to what happens when you go too far with making something that used to be fun into a professional ""experience"". Valve are frankly risking the credibilty of Steam to put this ""game"" into the racing genre. It belongs in the software section along with 3DMark and Folding@Home. It's chores. It's so complex it becomes stupid. It's a huge waste of time as nobody but the most desperately unemployed people in countries no longer with a functioning welfare system looking to win one of the sponsored tournaments to sell the winnings to pay their rent and heating bill will be able to stand for longer than a week. I can't even see the most serious professional race-car drivers enjoying this. There is no fun-factor whatsoever.If you ended up being disappointed with Gran Turismo 5, stay away from RaceRoom. It's even more boring than you could ever imagine. Simbin Studios have made a shameful hit on the entire racing genre this day.I you'd like fun mixed into the formula of a free multi-player racer, try something like Trackmania Nations.			"

												I will cut to the chase; it is so, so difficult to reccomend this game, even to a proper petrolhead.When you first download the game for free, you will be bewildered with a very awkward UI menu layout. It took me a few minutes to get to the track at first, when really this could of been achieved in under 20 seconds. On the track, you will be star-stuck with amazing graphics, I will not lie about that. The graphics are up there with any top race sim. Start driving, and hooray, a good car noise, and the developers have programmed the game well to work with a force feedback racing wheel.But that's it. Now for the negatives. The cars (even the slick racers) understeer so inaccurately. I'm no mega physics guy, but I know something's wrong when a leading class race car won't get round a bend at 40mph. Obviously there is no tyre shreak to warn you; you're on slicks. I tested to make sure it wasn't just a simulation of cold tyres = no grip, but after countless laps the car continued to behave like it had tyres 1mm wide.Surely the elephant in the room is the DLC. You start with about 4 cars and two tracks. That is fine, it is free after all I suppose. But add the DLC costs up for all the tracks and cars, and you are looking at triple figure sums. Honestly, I'd rather just pay £35 for the game outright and get everything, without a free version.You can take this with a pinch of salt as it's just a minor person's opinion. But playing for 2 and a half hours (which doesn't sound like much) has made me stand by those opinions. Since it's free, just go ahead and download to see for yourself. It's like a lot of modern games these days; very pretty, but no actual gameplay.			"

												This seems like a good take on a racing simulator. But it lacks a lot.First, the free content of the game is limited and will bore you fast (1 track, 2 cars), I feel like we could have had a bit more, even if we get free testdrives of other cars on weekends. Also there is no multiplayer apart for laptimes and that makes it just you on the same track trying to get better times.Graphicwise and simulation was it is great, nice graphics and it gives a realistic handling. The ingame purchases are a bit expensive for what I'd aim for, but they are good and if you can afford it really take the game further.It's free to play, so It's a goodie to have but overal it isn't quite finished yet.

												This game crashes every 20-40 minutes for me (i5-4670K and GTX 760).  Until they fix that I'm not paying for anything.  The handling of the cars seems really good once you get the steering wheel settings sorted out.  There's no single-player vs. the AI or multiplayer right now, you just drive around a track by yourself and it shows you how your times compare to other people's.  The menus are the most ridiculously confusing thing I've ever seen too.If they fix the crashing problem and add actual racing to the game, I'll be happy to get the $40 DLC.  But until then it's a no go.			"

												Totally fake and unrealistic car behavior, physics, sound and graphics. Maybe not as bad as iracing, where it doesn't matter how fast you drive it always feels the same, but bad enough that you have to even in a demo purchase cars and tracks. Just crap all around and as a perfectionist, I have to say that nothing so far competes or compares to F1 2013 in realism, physics, graphics and sound !!!			"

												Wow. I can't remember the last time that i hated a game so much that i decided to spread the word about its awfulness.RaceRoom is the absolutely worst racing experience of a life-time. I love the racing genre and i've played them all. This is one of those games that has tons of potential but is ruined by its incredibly boring core game-play and the details of its design-choices. However, it doesn't stop there.From the clunky, bloated and confusing UI to the hopelessly boring ""challenges"" of learning the tracks to the rear-wheel driven impossible-to-steer cars you get to drive in your very first race (!), i have never before come across a game in which there were so many different things that i disliked right away. It's as if the developers want to scare you away from the idea of a free racing game and/or donate this product to scientists who are doing patience-research on modern man. It wouldn't surprise me if the developers themselves are scientists who have no idea what fun is in a video game. The multi-player button is greyed out and thus inaccessible, possibly because you're expected to finish all the ""challenges"" first. Something i would guarantee that 90% of all those who try the game never will. There's no AI to race against, but only single ghosts of times to beat. So who cares about beating a ghost when you get absolutely nothing for it at the end of a race, nor have any fun whatsoever during the race?RaceRoom is a remarkable monument to what happens when you go too far with making something that used to be fun into a professional ""experience"". Valve are frankly risking the credibilty of Steam to put this ""game"" into the racing genre. It belongs in the software section along with 3DMark and Folding@Home. It's chores. It's so complex it becomes stupid. It's a huge waste of time as nobody but the most desperately unemployed people in countries no longer with a functioning welfare system looking to win one of the sponsored tournaments to sell the winnings to pay their rent and heating bill will be able to stand for longer than a week. I can't even see the most serious professional race-car drivers enjoying this. There is no fun-factor whatsoever.If you ended up being disappointed with Gran Turismo 5, stay away from RaceRoom. It's even more boring than you could ever imagine. Simbin Studios have made a shameful hit on the entire racing genre this day.I you'd like fun mixed into the formula of a free multi-player racer, try something like Trackmania Nations.			"

												I will cut to the chase; it is so, so difficult to reccomend this game, even to a proper petrolhead.When you first download the game for free, you will be bewildered with a very awkward UI menu layout. It took me a few minutes to get to the track at first, when really this could of been achieved in under 20 seconds. On the track, you will be star-stuck with amazing graphics, I will not lie about that. The graphics are up there with any top race sim. Start driving, and hooray, a good car noise, and the developers have programmed the game well to work with a force feedback racing wheel.But that's it. Now for the negatives. The cars (even the slick racers) understeer so inaccurately. I'm no mega physics guy, but I know something's wrong when a leading class race car won't get round a bend at 40mph. Obviously there is no tyre shreak to warn you; you're on slicks. I tested to make sure it wasn't just a simulation of cold tyres = no grip, but after countless laps the car continued to behave like it had tyres 1mm wide.Surely the elephant in the room is the DLC. You start with about 4 cars and two tracks. That is fine, it is free after all I suppose. But add the DLC costs up for all the tracks and cars, and you are looking at triple figure sums. Honestly, I'd rather just pay £35 for the game outright and get everything, without a free version.You can take this with a pinch of salt as it's just a minor person's opinion. But playing for 2 and a half hours (which doesn't sound like much) has made me stand by those opinions. Since it's free, just go ahead and download to see for yourself. It's like a lot of modern games these days; very pretty, but no actual gameplay.			"

												Is this game an alpha? I'm almost offended by the fact that the game feels unfinished, but they already have a DLC on sale. Simply make the game paid then! You almost cannot feel the game without paying (meaning one or two free ""tracks"". All the real ones are paid for), there is no story-mode, the physic is not well done (no car damage, no aerodinamics, very limited tarmac/grass friction) and you cannot assign more than one button to the same action (meaning that I need to choose if I want paddle shifters or stick, but never both).The game feels like a copy of ACR, and doesn't live up to his competition.Otherwise, the menu system is very nice, once you get used to it.

												Can't say much about the base free-to-play game since I really haven't played it (just a single race) but the DTM Experience 2013 DLC is a must buy!  Got on sale at the Humble Store for $6.24!  This is one of the most realistic racing sims I have played...the sounds are incredible!UPDATE:  I really can't recommend this game based soley on the cash grab that it is.  Even during Sector 3's summer sale the addon packs are quite over-priced.  Sector 3 really nickel and dimes you for every little tiny aspect of this game.  During the summer sale if you were to buy everything on sale it would have cost over $100.  I bought Assetto Corsa with DLC included for less than $30.  I bought Project Cars for $35 and the DLC is dirt cheap!  If you have a wallet that is fat full of cash then go ahead and buy everything Sector 3 wants you to buy.  Afterall, it's a great sim to race in but if you value your dollar look to a cheaper alternative.			"

												It's really fun, but it takes a bit of time to learn and get familiar with. And although this is a ""free"" game you actually have to pay real money for most of the cars which is a major turnoff. One car is about $3 in real money but if you win a competition you can get the equivalent of a free car. You can however test drive all of the paid for cars in singleplayer, with no timers or in a race. You just drive those unless you buy them, when then you can drive them in all races including Multiplayer.Pros:-Awesome graphics-A somewhat good variety of cars-Amazing sounds, everything from the roaring engine to the backfiring of the exhaust-Content in this game can be bought with your Steam moneyCons:-Most the cars cost real money or a difficult competition-Ok damage simulation-Most of the tracks are lockedIt's only worth the 17 GB, 5 hour download if you really like cars.

												First thing to say is the sounds are utterly amazing. And that is pretty much it as far as amazing things go. Downloaded the free version that gives you a hillclimb, two tracks and a few cars for free. Ive spent the last 1 or so in RaceRoom and its too much of an arcade game experience for my liking. However, it is the best arcade racing game that i've played. The sounds are what blew me away the first time I went for a spin. But sadly physics, realism and the like are lacking. Being a huge Dirt Rally and iRacing fan I can say that this game is too much of an arcade feeling for me to serious enjoy. But the sounds are truely eye popingly good. These sounds with iRacing would be unbeatable.Looking for something real = Dont buyLooking for an arcade racer thats very good = BuyBut just try the free version first.			"

												Great experience!Most of the cars feels ""easy"" to drive at high speeds, and i mean it like they seem to be smooth just like the real ones, Ive seen too many racing games where you reach the top speed and the car starts to wobble like its made of jelly! Seriously!? these cars are built to be stable aS ♥♥♥♥ at top speeds! and in overall the handling feels solid and you can adjust these cars endlessly. One of the few CON´s i can think is that it still sometimes feels kinda un-polished (dont mean the cars alone) and there could be more players in multiplayer... and speaking of multiplayer, most of the drivers there seems to drive clean. Sure there are some rammers but they are the ones who generally get bored of the game very early.It also has the finest track ever made! You can complain about the pricing of the cars but atleast you can just buy one car from each group (and test it before buying)So overall i think this is the best racing game at the moment. AND the sound effects leave any other car game light years behind!Try it, buy it, love it!			"

												Well... No. At this (as they say) early state of development there are many reasons to just say 'no' to this game. I played a whole lot of racing games and racing sims and still I'm not fully aware where to put it Raceroom Racing Experience in. Sometimes, driving in R3E feels reasonably realistic, sometimes it's ridicoulusly arcade-ish. Let's have a list of good aspects of R3E; There is a great AI, which often fights and struggles the same way you do. I don't want to say that they're completely flawless, hell no, but compared to other racing games, the AI in R3E is damn good.The tracks come in a very polished manner and for me it was a pleasure to see such detailed tracks, full of life. Codemasters still does a better job in this but well, you can't be good at everything, right? Also the cars look nice - not great, but nice. It's pretty hard to say when it is ""enough"" regarding details, because theoretically it's never enough if you want to simulate things. But sure there are restrictions in terms of hardware resources. And it's 'free' to play, so they want to reach a big audience of course.All along the words 'free to play' is the biggest flaw in here. When you first download the game, there are waiting 2 cars in your garage on 2 tracks, with 3 and 2 versions of it. Of the the tracks is a R3E Fantasy track, which - don't get me wrong - is damn good.Sector 3 Entertainment offers a test-drive in every car you may want to drive, at least. But let's face it - if you want to have a full garage, you're about to pay at least 120€, which is too damn high, considering that the cars are not even realistically balanced or even physically correct - yes, they are nice, but nice doesn't want me to pay that much money. I purchased the ADAC GT Masters 2014 Package, the Hillclimb Package, as well as the track Bathurst and the Ruf GTRS12 (basically a Porsche 997 GT3). Hell yeah it was worth it, I had some fun, especially on Bathurst, and with some of the GT Masters tracks and cars... But the game still feels incomplete, everywhere pops up a ""BUY NOW"", ""BUY NOW"", ""ON SALE"", ""ON SALE"", advertisement everywhere - incredibly annoying. I don't think that they ever change this, so this alone is a reason to give it a 'no'... On top of that comes the questionable physics and behaviour of some cars and the lack of settings of track conditions.Oh and it was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to get my Force Feedback into a playable state, although it fully supports my Logitec Driving Force GT (I know, it's far away from being the best, thanks! :D ), which to me was a antipathic moment, also...Go download the thing and try it yourself, but invest some hours before you buy something.

												I'm one of the Alpha Testers of the game and no, I don't recommend the game. Not because of Alpha problems which are expected from all games, but the engine is not optimised. I get a fair bit of lag with NVIDIA-610M at the Lowest possible graphics. Which are pea soup quality. Now I don't really have problems with fairly new games, and no problem with the old games when it comes to performance. This is the first negative.Second is, I don't think game mechanics are realistic. Probably depends on the person, but I didn't like them. A.I. is not good as expected from Alpha and CB, it can be easily patched.Rest assured, if you play it on easy difficulties and have a high end machine, you will enjoy the game. Rest? I'm sorry.			"

												Do game companies not understand, making people pay for a full game, not only, will bring them money, but it will also strengthen their fanbase, I love the devs, but they made a poor choice with the marketing for this game, it's not F2P, it's Pay4Fun, and if a game is like that, might as well pay full price for a game. If you have 100's of dollars to spend on it go ahead, but I just personally don't want to, and for me, the physics on this specific game aren't even that good, reletively speaking to games like Assetto Corsa, rFactor, and Project cars, which have pretty solid physics engines (rFactor barely xD).

												Great franchise ruined by F2P cr@p! 5 € for a track? Really Simbin?!RR > RACE 07 - graphics is better, but that wasn't hard to achieve after 5 years.RACE 07 > RR  - everything else. I won't write why F2P model sucks. No. There are other things which completely ruin experience, too.Menu design is super ugly, terrible, broken and confusing. Big wheel design is super idiotic console  thing. What this s.it is doing in pure PC game is beyond reason. It's one of the worst menu designs I ever saw! And my eyes are hurt every time I have to navigate in menu because of terrible font rendering. And then, game doesn't see my gamepad. Really? It works perfectly fine in RACE 07. Contoller setup is poorer from 07, too. I can't drive properly because of lack of many options from 07.Game has ALWAYS ONLINE DRM!!!  NOT RECOMMENDED!!!UpdateI tried it first time after February because of sale. Gamepad now works. Still super ugly and confusing menus. Auto-shifting is broken - it goes up auto, but you have to manually shift down. Still only time trials.Update II 5th July, 2014.Sound is the best among racing simulations! It's just oustanding.They introduced Competitions which is great way to experience content you don't own and if you are excellent driver, you can win various things. Kudos for that.I installed game again because there is 50% summer sale, and Simbin sent month ago some free vRPs (I got 800) mostly for people who don't play it anymore. Now some bad things. You need to drive PERFECTLY in time trials! You read it right. Even if you slightly hit off road and I mean you didn't cut curve, your lap time is invalid! Ha ha ha, NO! Solution - drive as amateur in Leaderboard Challenge, then it's like old RACE 07.And then, there is a bug (reported by others) which put my PC into hibernation and then just restart it. WTF?!			"

												This is a story of a lot of missed potential. The controls are nice, the visuals are nice, and the cars feel very weighty and responsive. But, that's about the end of my compliments.Why this is labeled as ""Free To Play"" is beyond me. you get one, maybe two cars and two tracks for free. literally everything else you have to pay for. The tracks that they show off on the front page? Yeah, you have to buy all of those individually. I don't call that free to play, I call that a demo. If it was labelled as a demo and that the full game had to be bought, it'd be a different review. But, since they tried to pass it off as a free to play game that had loads of content, only to mock the person when they get in with entire screens and sections as paid DLCs, it feels like a massive case of false advertising. And the Driving assists, oh god the driving assists. they come down like a bag of bricks and you can't turn them off. I spent a good half hour searching for a way to turn off the auto-braking, because it made my car come to what I can only describe as a complete stop around even a small corner.unless you have money and patience, I say stick to the competitors, because this is a blatant money-grab.

												I went into this game expecting great things, having loved Race 07 as it was my introduction into pc sim racing. played the game, as a racer its pretty good, but compared to the competition, Assetto Corsa, Project CARS, hell even Race 07, it just isnt good value for money if you want to buy more cars/tracks, to buy 3 cars and a track costs about £10, if you want to buy every car, track and livery you are looking at well over £100. and even if this was the best racing game ever made, with the best physics, graphics and features, it would not be worth that. if you want to spend that much on a racing game i would recommend a monthly subscription to iRacing or rFactor 2 which will certainly cover you in that regard. For a utter beginner into pc sim, it is not to bad, but for everyone else this will simply drain your wallet with not enough reward, not compared to its rivals.I wish they made GTR 3 instead.			"

												It's been a couple of years now since I forked out real world money for a handful of tracks and cars for this game.Still there is no racing to be found either online or offline outside of the DTM ""dlc"". The name of the game is a lie. Still just time attack modes and a token practice mode against AI. The driving experience itself doesn't feel as good as other games from the developer's illustrious past and the immersion provided by the sound and graphics is merely passable.If you're only using the base content, then it's worth a go to enter the competitions and work your way up the leaderboards, but if you intend on splashing out some cash, there are mch better options available. I'm a keen sim racer and try out all the different sims that come on the market but can't recommend spending money on this.			"

												RaceRoom Racing Experience is what the title tells you, a Racing Experience, that is what I thought, until I downloaded this game. Basically this game is a Racing game, like all the other thousands of Racing games but this one is different, IT'S FREE TO PLAY! (Now isn't that something you dont see everyday...) Anyway! Back to the Review! Now the first thing I'm gonna jump right into is the AI. So basically the AI is exactly like you in this game, except 20x better. They are even better at turning in this game,""Turning? Isn't turning ment to be the easiest thing in the whole game?"" Now thats  what I thought when I downloaded the game too, until I played a match of Singleplayer, this also brings us to our second thing I want to talk to you about, the turning, yes, the turning. Basically the turning is terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE. Alright so you want to take this basic turn at a slight fast speed? WELL NOPE! You are basically screwed. The turning is so bad, I don't know if it's meant to make it feel realistic or something, but it is still terrible the turning. The third and last thing I have to turtore tell you is how all cars are... you guessed it... Manual... It makes me cringe just waiting for it to change each several gear to reverse, I swear it takes 5 slow seconds to reverse... WHY? This is a Racing Game, NOT A,""Take A Driving Test for your License,"" GAME! Unbelivable. Well that's it! Thank's for wasting 1 minute of your life reading this review on this awful game! I swear the graphics don't look as good as the trailer shows them.			"

												This might be the only time to actually waste money on this game considering the 70% off. Otherwise, the amount of money spent on this game just to collect cars and tracks is ridiculous for what you end up with compared to their older titles and hate to through in consoles, but FM and GT games, then not to mention the upcoming Project Cars which I'm part of and is in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guys are putting into their new game (Project Cars).

												Pretty nice graphics, don't mind the microtransactions but I refuse to spend money until they fix the AI.  The AI will just slam your car with blatant disregard and, I'm sure it's all in my head, but it feels like when they hit me I go flying and skid out.  When I hit them basically nothing happens and they can maintain control no problem.If they fix the AI I'd buy Laguna Seca, a few cars, and I'd race that track till my fingers bleed.			"

												Ok so now i have played this game for a solid 3 hours and i am going to tell you guys the +ve's and the -ve's+veThe sound is absolutely fantastic. You can hear exactly what a racing driver would hear in cockpit and as you go to the outside camera angle the car engine sounds different which is amazing.The handling model is pretty nice with great force feedback. The traction is realistic as well, you got to be patient with the acceleratorAll cars are really fun to drive and each car seemed to have its own characteristic which was fantastic to see in a game which is free.-veI have a XBox 360 controller and it seems like this game hates controllers. When i was coming into a hairpin i press the brake button but the car didn't stop and went straight on. I know where my brake button is. I use the same button for F1 so i am used to it and this issue seems to happen over and over againThe online may only be in alpha but its almost perfect. ALMOST. apart from regular lag spikes for 10 sec and you go down from 1st to 4th in a race. It is so frustrating as a gamer to be leading and then lag spike and boom 4th.Also a issue is that not many cars and tracks are given for free so you need to buy most of the cars and tracks using virtual credits which you need to buyDecession time: The game seems to have more +ve's than -ve's but that doesn't make the game better. The issues i have listed are massive issues which can cause people to rage quit and make a hole in their computer screen so right now, i don't recommend it but hopefully after a few patches the game should be one of the best racing games around. There are other small issues that i don't really care about atm: no time transition, only sunny weather, no dynamic weather			"

												I truly wanted to like this game and invested time and money to purchase the car and track bundles. The game is fun when the servers are working and you don't get hit with the dreaded 503 server error that keeps you from logging in to play.  What's worse is if you purchased any of the DTM or ADAC experience Add-On's, only to find out they are also UNAVAILABLE when the server is out.  I suggest looking into Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, or even iRacing (considering it's designed online only and much more consistent in providing a fulfilling experience)  Thread carefuly.			"

												The best thing about this game are the sounds. The price model is bad. You can get a better AA-AAA racing title that is just as good for the price. Their older game GT Legends GTR series and Race series are just as good if not better. If Simbin/Sector3 re-release this game as a standalone game with steamworks for multiplayer with dedicated servers and traditional DLC I may consider buying. Get the older SimBin titles NFS Shift 1/2 and Grid 1 and Autosport and Project CarsYou will thank me laterUntil major changes are made.........			"

												I have played a lot of racing games in my time mostly on the various playstation sytems. Looking at the screenshots of the game and the trailers it looks quite something, when you download the game however things change. Firstly the 'Free to play' element is a 5 cars on a 5 tracks quite disappointing but it cost nothing. First thing that annoyed is the braking signs that  suggest that target audience is 3 year olds, colour coding? aren't the distance signs good enough for a simulator.Anyway, after starting an event in a stick shift I was quite pleased to see one hand went to change gear when required, my illusions were shattered when I came to a corner though. I pressed the right arrow key the steering wheel imediately went to full lock and I understeered into the wall so I thought fair enough I was a bit fast but I expected for the car to at least attempt the corner, (for example gran turismo you can enter a hairpin flat and you will take a curved path into the wall). I tried the next corner at a snail's pace (light sweeper probably a 3rd usually, I took it in 1st )giving an impovement, enough that I made it round. Something that bothers me is the fact it just says speed on the display is it km/h or mph? considering I was doing 190 in first in a DTM car I doubt it's either.Next I took a paddle shift prototype, the paddles did not move at the correct which also bothered me. Furthermore, the camera is positioned so close to the steering wheel that it seems the driver is trying to rub his chin on it. Next the sounds, it's free to play I know but I expected it least to sound like an actual race car as this was. tunnels make exhaust notes but the tunnel I entered was extremely underwhelming.All I can say is at least it wont cost you any money just time			"

												I tried this and it failed to impress me. I love racing games and have been playing them for 15 years on PC. I couldn't get my wheel  which admittedly is pretty ancient) to work properly, found the cars seemed to have no weight. Looks pretty enough but if actual gameplay sucks then its not worth the price of admission. In my humble opinion this doesn't hold a candle to the brilliant but old Papyrus Grand Prix Legends, which is still a challenging and enjoyable experience even ten years on. I can't recommend this game really but if you can get abetter controller it may be worth the time giving it a try but the free content is pretty limited and should really be described as a Demo not Free To Play. Disappointed as so many race games seem to be aimed at the console market, Codemasters used to produce some fun driving games but now fill their arcade racers with fantasy city tracks and boring drift courses, Isn't that what NFS was for? Perhaps I'll have better luck with AC. Meanwhile back to Grand Prix Legends ha ha. I also found the menu system here really clunky and poorly thought out, I quickly got bored with the free content and wasn't charmed enough to risk good money on this yet . I know it is still in development but it still needs a lot of work to get it sweet.			"

												Because of Assetto Corsa, I was very optimistic about indie racing simulators, and this game was free, so I thought I'd try it out.  It turns out, it's merely a freemium game, with full-on microtransactions, and you can't do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money. It's essentially the Real Racing 3 of computers, except Real Racing 3 allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent.Let's talk about the game itself. The physics kinda work, but the car feels slippery, much like a bar of soap, and the graphics are representative of a phone game-no, not even, Real Racing 3 looks much better. Especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best.Is it a bad game? Not necessarily, I'm guessing the game is merely developing, but I feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state. Definitely get Assetto Corsa instead, it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this pay-to-have-fun affair. Or, if you're broke and need a free racing game, I'd recommend Trackmania Nations Forever, which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer, or even the demo of GRID 2, which has online multiplayer.

												'Good' graphics, sounds amazing and had some good points about it here and there, but that's about it. It's a good racing simulation, with somewhat realistic effects and physics, but it's not top-notch like full retail games out there. The catch here is it's being announced as a 'free to play' game, when obviously, it's not. You can download and test it for free, on one track, on one car, beyond that, you WILL have to pay for anything else, and i mean PAY it with your real money. I didn't even went to see how the currency on this is, all i can say is it's NOT worth it. Paying for EVERYTHING in (theorically) a free to play game is not ok. You can't try the tracks, you can't try the cars, all you can do is PAY, and then PAY some more. It's not a F2P, it's a demo for a possibly good game, but the urge to try it fades fastly, when you have to be a 'wallet driver'.			"

												I really thought this would be the next gen Simulation racer that all PC gamers are looking for, while it has all the right stuff, decent graphics, not the best, but much better than the likes of Race 07 and other Sim bin games. The sounds are great too, and the physics are great, but it's missing the most essential element: Multiplayer.On this basis alone I cannot recommend this game, you can only do time trials so many times and for so long. Another big reason why I won't recommend this game is because, although this game is free to play, the micro transaction system is too expensive. I have done the math and nothing is worth paying that amount of money for, you even have to pay for the realism mode, I mean, who does that on a supposed racing sim?The free stuff is not enough to keep you going for more than a few hours, there just isn't enough free content to even make this a viable free to play option.Also, the big attraction to Race 07 and other titles are all the mods you can get, this game does not support modding, so it seems, and you have to pay for everything you want, this I'm sure has detered many previous Sim Bin fans.If Sim Bin are prepared to drop the prices on all their tracks and cars, and introduce multiplayer, or at least bot cars, then I will consider reviewing my recommendation.Edit: Even on 50% Easter sale on all cars and tracks, I decided it wasn't worth it. Perhaps if Sim Bin put a 50% discount on the DTM experience, then I may just buy that, as the DTM Experience opens the Beta multiplayer  mode.			"

												Didn't get any feeling at all with this game at all. I suppose you need a steering wheel to be able to enjoy it. And free to play? Yeah right... in singler player only. If you want to play online you need to hand out €30+ wich I didnt know beforehand.. If it would have a better feeling to it I would certainly be willing to pay for it, and I would apprechiate if that information was handed to me before I downloaded it and registered.. I think I'll just hang back a while and wait for a better option.			"

												P.O.S. nuff' said. seriously though, it gives you Single player, no racing with friends, unless of course you buy it, but wait thats not all! you also need to buy more tracks other than the TWO they give you, unless of course, you don't mind the game getting stale within a few races. cars? of course they have a couple, see that sweet ride over there you want? BAM! transaction. im surprised they don't try to sell individual wheels to you as well.			"

												When I first saw the gameplay video and screenshots of the game, I thought it would be a realistic and exciting racing game with tons of features. Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your ""racing experience"" being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(			"

												Very poor driving experience, the game is HD but the graphics don't excel.The menu is very hard and mazed up.As an actual ingame footage... on every challange you are allowed to controll your car after 3 seconds on which if you continuously press the acceleration button you will lose controll of your car immediatelly. No to mention that everytime you are forced to start the game on a curve.There are 3 dificulties that you can chose BEFORE you enter a race, once you are in it, you cannot adjust them.Novice- the one that the AI breaks like your grandma'Normal - the decent way to play this gameaaand Advanced - unplayable from keyboard Few tracks, few cars. You are forced to play a specific car on a specific race. The game looks ok from the outside but its not worthing the time waiting to install.Cheers,predatorX			"

												RRRE lures you in with a premise of the Free2Play game model where there is actual fun to be had for free and you will not have to spend tonnes of money on every single piece of content.Unfortunately, that is the case for RRRE, which cleverly uses the trademarked ""FREE2RACE"" term, which means yes, you can race for free, but barely.RRRE is not as good of a simulator as previous Simbin titles, meaning that other similar alternatives like Simraceway and iRacing will be the way to go now for the old Race07 crowd.Do not spend money on this game if you're expecting old Simbin quality.

												Update to review below: I keep getting spam emails from Raceroom despite trying to unsubscribe numerous times. Avoid. -----Game is a half decent driving sim but is ruined by the fact that anything that goes wrong leaves you facing the wrong way on the track. I can understand it happening sometimes, but when it is everytime something is badly wrong with the physics engine.For reference I have played iRacing and Project Cars with steering wheel so know what end of a car is what.

												The graphics may not be too grand, but the gameplay is really nice. what made me give up of this game was the ""pay-to-play"" logic, in which less than 10% of the tracks are available for freebies, you have to buy the rest. ""Oh but this is to support the developers since it's a F2P"" They made way too few tracks and cars available, even by the F2P-demo logic. not worth it.

												Sorry, but no.  The UI is all over the place--it is easy to tell that it was designed for a steering wheel, but why does the main menu look like a messy CS:GO buy menu?, the game's overall atmosphere, the levels and lack of sound effects (other than the exagerated car noises)--makes the game feel lonely and soulless--even the in-game messages feel robotic. and remind me of The Office when Dwight makes a birthday banner that simply reads, ""It is your birthday."", and finally the fact that any other car or track other than the one they give you is prompted with a overlay to purchase in-game funds make this game feel like a cash grab.

												Where to start....For one, you only get 5 out of the 38 cars for free. The rest, you have to buy. Now, maybe this wouldn't be nearly as bad if you could actually choose the cars, but no. You're stuck with what they've already chosen, which means you could end up driving in a class of cars that you might not want two.Secondly, ona similiar topic, you get 2 generic free tracks out of 14.Third.I couldn't find a way to rebind keyboard controls. The handling system felt off as such. (I know this is supposed to be played with a wheel and pedals, but I've played plenty of sims without. rFactor 1 and 2, other SimBin titles, Assetto Corsa, etc.) The UI was pretty bad as well.			"

												I downloaded this game with the hope that it would be a decent play.  After dicking about registering with far too much information, I managed to navigate the horrific menu and get into game.  I was then greeted with a lovely CTD, no problem, I'll check my drivers and try again. After several attempts and a bit of research I tried running in windowed mode, which worked! I finally get in game and then the real disappointment set in, the handling is terrible, the physics (what physics) are broken and it just doesn't feel right; you shouldn't have to pretty much switch the enging off to negotiate a slight bend in the road.  Even using a controller, it appears that the controls are pretty much off or flat out, which brings me to my next point.  This game just isn't optimised for controller use, seriously, controlling a cursor with a stick just shouldnt' even be considered by any devs any more.  Other people seem to be complaining about the content.  I haven't had the patience to fully explore it yet, although I will keep it installed and give it another chance on another day.			"

												I have no idea why i downloaded this, first of all it did not even open, had to verify the cache and to redownload more 600MB, well at least it worked, first glance was meh, i mean the UI is outdated, and looks like few years old.What it is funny is it detected my xBox controller, and told me its xBox controller, name it, so i did, and i clicked on race with the mouse, and the practice begins, and i am like vrom vrom, and well, nothing happened :|, i clicked the settings to find my controller profile empty, even though the game knew it was xBox controller and asked me if it was a wheel or a gamepad or keyboard..Forget it about the control, how on earth 17GB game does NOT have a tutorial, i mean mobile games have it :|, had to push the standard buttons to change the view or anything and i had to just open the control menu to look it up "" i changed to keyboard to save the time assigning everysingle button"", and i was like oh yeah its working now, thats a good sign, i guess..i started with the first car, the control is decent, but i have to say you have to accept the fact that NO ONE without wheel and KNOW how to play will even make a few turns, no assists what so ever, i dont mind because its simulator not NFS, but Project Cars sim too, and got assists too for new drivers..I hated the first car, so i started to looking up for another car, and i found only 1 more car is avilable the rest is locked for real money, well at least let us try a BMW for a start then let us play with Fiat :D, i mean for real, if EVEN i want to buy those cars, with the horrible cars avilable for me to test, i will NOT EVER buy another car, no way in hell..And about the graphics, its like old flat cars with some AA and the track and the surronding is old, VERY old with only motion blur and post proccessing to make it look better, the thing is the AA and the post made the cars not realistic at all, no details what so ever, GRID 2, Dirt 3, Project cars even NFS Rivals or freaking NFS hot pursiut looks better than these cars, its just sad, the oversized game makes me think of GTA, the horrible optimaization and compressing..IF and only IF you are smart, you could EASILY say this is either demo and remove 15 GB or something and let everyone try it and make the full game with all the cars avilable, or freaking DLCs, not forcing me to download 14GB ish to try only 2 or 3 cars, with 3 tracks, i mean what have you been drinking, i think most of the negative reviews because we had to download 14GB just to TRY the game, and with a little to nothing of content..I have no idea why some people saying this game is good, its decent for free game yes, but the financing is s**t, you act like you force us to give this game bad review, couldnt you use your brains and make test and see if ANYONE will like the concept of downloading 14GB of NOTHING ???.I dont know if whoever download the game and liked did NOT saw or tried any other racing games, or have plazing download speed, cause it took like 2 days to download and i am really angry because i really for the first time WASTED my time even playing it.

												Not too fond of te very expensive micro transactions. This game pretends to be free to play, but the fun is over quite quickly once you realize how little you get for free. Almost everything is locked behind microtransactions that get quite expensive if you want to have ten or so tracks to choose from and let's say 20 cars.

												this game has great potential, but the physics make no sense, i dont touch the steering at all and i start swerving left and right, i turn a little bit to the right and i spin out at 20 mph. there is NO WAY to control your car, and the fact that almost all the car models are locked and you have to buy them is kinda dumb.

												Wow. Would you look at that, a game that would have been good, had they not done it like they did that garbage game NFS Shift. Its not a drifting game. The handling of the vehicles of this game are extremely horrible- at the best. Don't waste your time. I realize tires grip differently at high speed. But in real life, these kinds of cars designed to stick to the road WAAAAY more than they do in this game. Garbage, uninstalling it as well.			"

												I own Race07, which had a few bugs, but it was way better than this, reasons why:3 or 4 cars avaliable for free (ive only used it for about 40 minutes, and ALT-F4'd out after frustration so ive not used all  of the 'free' vehicles)only 2 tracks, and you cant even unlock the others (if you could, i would have used cheat engine on it ages ago)Graphics are not great, yes a step up from Race07, but not as good Grid Autosport (in my opinion)Pysics Model - ok, i dont have peddles or a wheel, but the cars fell like they have no grip, downforce, or anything (this could be argued, using a keyboard is not really that good, however i had no problems on Race07, i happen to also be quite talented at using a joystick and throttle slider for racing sims (precise throttle, steering etc...), but even that left my car spinning and sliding all over the track - ALT-F4)Sorry - free to play, are you serious?How long do i have to wait to load a track, really, 2-3 minutes, thats extremely slow, especially for my system (fx4100, AMD r9 380)positives:many FPS 60+not really anything else to say, but i wont be playing this untill vast improvements are made.2.5/10			"

												嗯，还是发现这是免费游戏才下载的，费了很长时间下载下来然并卵。进游戏时进不去，总是file error，说什么c盘什么文件什么什么的。后面有一些乱码。我的电脑配置绝对没有问题。gta5我是开了1080p中高画质的，系统是windows10，我不希望有人说我是因为电脑不好所以带不动游戏。我进了属性恢复了我的文档默认值。然并卵,对此还是感觉相当的失望，但从之前的评测来看，我的问题貌似比较罕见。Ah, I found that it is free to download the game before, it took a long time to download, and then i think it is waste time. When i ran the game, always file error, saying that the c;/  XXXXX file. Behind some garbled. My computer configuration is absolutely no problem. gta5 I opened 1080p high-definition, the system is windows10, I do not want to say that I was so bad because the computer does not move with the game. I entered the property returned to the My Documents default. but the problem didn‘t solve. This is still feeling quite disappointed, but look at the previous evaluation, my problem seems relatively rare.			"

												Just another free to play game that isnt free to play - you download a huge amount of data to race a few cars and even fewer tracks - Its not even a good sim (I never felt that RACE07 was a good sim, and this just has the same problems, multiplied). The cars have way too much grip and way too much oversteer - braking is always assisted and the cars are far too stable to feel like racing cars. Unless you have deep pockets, suck at racing sims, and want to feel like youre accomplishing something, just steer clear of this one (no pun intended).			"

												welcome to warm butter on melting ice simulator! where, unless you have a million ♥♥♥♥ing pounds to spend on racing simulator full experience controls, you ""drift"" into every ♥♥♥♥ing thing in the game. the controls for mouse and keyboard are so bad that i couldn't evenmove untill i changed the controls. even the control settings are♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have to double click what you want to change and then click one of the buttons it actually recognises: all mouse buttons excluded. good thing this peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥is free, because if i had to spend £15 on this then i might have to accidentally slip and fall on to a ♥♥♥♥ing wall of chainsaws multiple times. (dont question that)the graphics might be ok; i wouldn't know. because it takes a ♥♥♥♥ing supercomputer to run decent graphics. if you have a super computer and/or full experience racing controls, then this game may be for you! if not, i advise you not to waste your time.TLDR: if you have a computer layout alike to normal humans, DONT. if you are a millionare with everything, on your own head be it.

This game i had to lower it to lowest settings and it still lagged a lot. #2 I use a x-box 360 controller with most of my games. this game it kept saying that my joystick was pulling left. I checked it with my x-box and it was fine. I tried with a keyboard but bad control and lag made it super bad for racing. #3 When I wanted to stop this highway to hell , it wouldn't let me. I tried for 15 minutes to get out of the game and it would just do nothing. Its like they don't want you to quit this POS. All together I would give this game a -2.5 out of 10.			"

												Well I thought Origin asked too much (aka EA) when it comes to their microstransactions for all their games.  While the client for the game might be free for Raceroom.  The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely.  Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class.  Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are.  If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track.  Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.  Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price.  The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile.  They do include several tracks in the package.  So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release.  But you can clearly see they state ""Open Beta"" as of April 10, 2014.			"

												Good game, not bad that you can initially get it for free, but it has a classic part that you really need to buy the pack to make the game worth it, far too much is not available in the free part. Gameplay is not quite as I expected and I feel that GT Legends by simbin and even GTR Evolution played much better, this has a real arcade feel not simulation. All in all, not bad for a bash but certainly wont buy the pack to unlock everything.			"

												Possibly the worst game I've ever played. It runs fine on my PC, but the game is just terrible. If you accelarate too quickly it waill spinout. If you go off-course, ""invalid lap"" shows and you have to restart. The controls that you start off with are not like the normal WSAD. Instead, its the arrow keys. I have no idea how this is 8GB on my HDD so I would just wait for the Devs to fix everything wrong, then I would download this game.			"

												Booted it up after awhile to see if they had added MP races yet. They haven't. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on pCARS or Asset Corsa. They also seem to have taken a page iRacing's exhobetant pricing model, without rememebring that iRacing is able to charge that much because they essentially have the organized MP market cornered, ESPECIALLY for Oval racers.  (I mean NASCAR THE GAME is just a disaster, and that's really it as far as Oval Racers these days, unless you can find a copy of Nascar 2003, and even then you're lucky to find a race a week in an organized league, as opposed to every two hours like clockwork with iRacing, sorry got on a tangent there). But they don't offer any of what those game do, just endless hotlapping.So yeah, iRacing, Asseto Corsa, and pCars all have this beat hands down, and the last two aren't even officialy released yet.So yeah, would not reccomend you waste the HD space, even for the free version.

												Games Alright for a eacing game and it does have some free cars. Thats the good.The bad is the menu system is garbage. The servers are hard to join and the races are laggy. The multiplayer is dead. good game, dumb design.Better off buying a game that you can host your own servers, or atleast have local servers running.			"

												Garbage... rather expensive garbage for what could be a great game if it ever got finished.The graphics do seem dated but for a game that seems geared to be a simulator if runs great.You only truly get one option to realy play and that feels like a techdemo at best.I used a MS Xbox stering wheel on this and found the options were good for fixing most of the sensitivity issues however the peddels were way to sensitive and I could not fix that ingame.I found the game whould freak out with the accelarator (due to sensitivity I asume) and make me veer right and ither hit a wall or make me invalidate my lap and with that the lap invalidation (track box) is way to sensitive in places.If you like me were or are looking for a game to TEST a steering wheel then by all means try this but you will need to register an email account to the game.

												I am having too many game issues to give it a ""thumbs up"" recommendation.  For the moment I must vote ""thumbs down.""  If the game and business model improves I will revisit my recommendation.imho,ymmv: )editupdated 10/15/2015 after ~7 additional months...This game is still in beta after 30 months from release date of February 2013!!I am currently run the ADC pack, DTM 2014 pack and WTCC 2014 pack in RaceRoom beta.Many improvements have been made in the past few months.  However, I still cannot give it a ""thumbs up"" recommendation at this time.On the positive side the FWD cars in the WTCC 2014 pack are simply lovely to drive.  Good handling and excellent FFB make for a plenty of enjoyment taking these cars around any track.  The awful GUI is gone!  Items that need to be addressed by Sector3Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI is decent and quite clean by having good player detection coding.  AI aggressiveness needs to be added to game.  AI are ""on the rails"" when it comes to collisions - your car is not on the rails so if there is a collision between you and AI then you will likely spin out and the AI will continue running.AI needs more options and settings to make them more realistic and less automated.Business model - Having items and picks split between S3 store and STEAM is simply awful.  S3 needs to have all of the items available for sale grouped together.  S3 needs to dump the VRP and only list currency.S3 servers - Having two sets of authentication (steam and S3 servers) is redundant and causes more issues for end user.  S3, dump your servers so players can still play RRRE if your servers are down, steam is down, or if players internet is down.There appears to be no option to calibrate wheels and pedals in game.  My gear was recognized and works well.  However, I want to calibrate my pedals (set a small deadzone at start and set the travel of when I hit 100% of throttle or brake) and the game will not allow the user to do it.  S3 needs to add in a calibration function like the one used in iracing or rf2.Overall, it appears to me as if S3 has been working on building out the available cars and tracks and only recently are starting to focus on adding in features and updating features already in the game.Ouch!  As of today the game only has a 53% approval rating!: (			"

												Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game.  Let me also say I am not opposed to paying for good quality games.  That being said I am a HUGE Iracing fan, which is hands down the best race sim ever made.  Iracing is also expensive as each car and each track costs money and it's a subscription service.  The differenece here is they are up frnot about what you will need to pay, this game is microtransaction hell.  It's very confusing and when you do figure it out your looking at hundreds of dollars.  So right there I lost interest, and I didn't even get to the bad joke they call realistic physics.  Anyone that thinks this game is realistic has never actually driven a car on a track.  If you can play the game with a mouse and keyboard it is not realistic.  There is no way you could control a car with a mouse at freeway speeds let alone in a race.			"

												I have played this for over a week now & can say that I like the driving feel on the circuits especially in keep it real mode (or whatever its called) Once you get the steering settings right its real good. Hillclimb mode however is basically crap. It simulates way to much speed & doesnt feel real at all.Graphics are smooth & look great, the sounds are top notch right down to the gear change exhaust pops to the race brake squeels.The dissapointment hits when you find you have 1 circuit & a handfull of cars to play & everything else costs. The online challenges from what I can see mainly revolve around the DTM Experience DLC which you have to pay for (think its 34.99US) When you consider the latest Grid Autosport is $49.99US on steam & offers a widened track, car & game mode variety including multiplayer, I think maybe a better option.That said, I am yet to play Grid Autosport and am basing my thoughts on heresay.In all, Race room is refined in circuit mode but lacks depth without putting your hand in your pockets.

												8 GB for 1 race track is more than a little too much,. i'm guessing all the DLC is included from the start off.It's a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent - and it has external wheel and pedal support at least. It's not bad. But hardly great either.I just have it installed because I don't have any other games that support the wheel.In order for this to really be worth recommending, it'd need a few more tracks, and MUCH cheaper car/extra track unlocks.There's some bugs where you drive through obstacles, and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap - you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets,.. it's a bit frustrating.

												I have played this for over a week now & can say that I like the driving feel on the circuits especially in keep it real mode (or whatever its called) Once you get the steering settings right its real good. Hillclimb mode however is basically crap. It simulates way to much speed & doesnt feel real at all.Graphics are smooth & look great, the sounds are top notch right down to the gear change exhaust pops to the race brake squeels.The dissapointment hits when you find you have 1 circuit & a handfull of cars to play & everything else costs. The online challenges from what I can see mainly revolve around the DTM Experience DLC which you have to pay for (think its 34.99US) When you consider the latest Grid Autosport is $49.99US on steam & offers a widened track, car & game mode variety including multiplayer, I think maybe a better option.That said, I am yet to play Grid Autosport and am basing my thoughts on heresay.In all, Race room is refined in circuit mode but lacks depth without putting your hand in your pockets.

												8 GB for 1 race track is more than a little too much,. i'm guessing all the DLC is included from the start off.It's a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent - and it has external wheel and pedal support at least. It's not bad. But hardly great either.I just have it installed because I don't have any other games that support the wheel.In order for this to really be worth recommending, it'd need a few more tracks, and MUCH cheaper car/extra track unlocks.There's some bugs where you drive through obstacles, and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap - you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets,.. it's a bit frustrating.

MINUSVery limited game A couple of tracks, and a couple of cars and that's all. Everything else is pay as you go. The Free2Play version seems more like a demo to me. Multiplayer in Alpha stage With such limited selection of cars-tracks and a virtually non existent campaign mode, multiplayer is your only resort as a free player. Very fragmented with DLC owners. And not solid enough yet.PLUSinteresting handling model - you can have fun with a 360 controller and feel pretty realistic. Close to Forza motorsport for any Xbox owners out theregraphics nothing next gen, but on par with every other AAA racing game out there.excellent soundFor me, no not in this state. If it ever became a full price title full of content (100+ cars, 20+ tracks at least) and a campaign mode that would be interesting, then yes, i would definately recommend it. The game as a game is not bad, but the pay as you go model (especially when a track/car pack has 25€) for me is wrong enough to steer me away from the game, the way it is implemented here.			"

This game has an incredibly engine and I found it really really fun but then again I can't really love a game that expects me to pay for a car and then ontop of that have too pay for a livery for each car (the same price as the car itself) It's a complete let down and it goes too show how much Micro-Transactions have infected all of the ""Cool"" free to play games these days.

												I would not suggest this game to anyone, I love racing games, both simulation and arcade but this one, it's just too bad it decided to be a free2play game instead of a real game.It doesn't have many cars and tracks for a game that is supposed to be updated often.You have to pay for the stuff and it's overpriced, give me a all in one pack that will also contains all future content for a fair price then that would be good but unfortunately, it is not the case, you can see that the developer is just one other among the incompetents and greedy sheep of the modern gaming industry.As I can understand, if you buy one car, you can only choose one livery but I am unsure about that so do not totally trust me about this one.It is probably one of the only racing game that has DTM, the only one that I am aware of but when it comes to WTCC you're better off with RACE - The WTCC Game and GTR for GT.I'll be honest, the difficulty is pretty though, pretty much harder than every single rally games I have played (almost all of them), harder than F1 games and harder than pretty much everything, maybe that I am not used to this kind of racing (DTM), I'd love to but I hate how their game works, sell the game then that's it, no microtransactions, no in-store content or at least, make us able to buy a bundle that has everything in it and that would also contain everything in the future and no crap such as what Ubisoft did - selling a season pass then selling an ""expansion"" that you have to buy even if you own the season pass.Other than that, the graphics are great but the worse point of this game is that it has no offline mode.In short.Negative:1. No offline mode.2. Overpriced content.3. No bundle that has everying in it for a fair price.4. Does not have a lot of content for a game that is supposed to be updated often.Positive:1. Great difficulty.2. Great maneuverability/gameplay.3. Great graphics (even If honestly, I do not care too much about the graphics as long as it is all the same everywhere unlike some games in particular).Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game because of its big flaws.4/10			"

												I honestly don't even know how or where to start with this game. It has no form of tutorial, guide, basic series of single player practice sessions to show you what you get with the game, what you have, game modes, anything. It is basically just a very very old school pick a series pick a car, hit race....that's pretty much it. I find it quite surprising that it has so many users with such a bad interface and menu structure. As a user you honestly don't know where to start.After some trial and error I eventually discovered that most cars need to be bought, you only get....actually I don't know what you get because it doesn't list anywhere how many or which cars you do get. It's just such a bad user experience. Even ACR with all its problems and browser client mishmash was far supperior.The first time I started it I basically just got the background cinematics and no menu. After googling around I found that you have to set a start parameter for the steam version. Why isn't this set as standard? Didn't I just install the game through steam?So after you eventualy get it to work, you have to wonder if you actually have any sound, because there are no effects what so ever in the menu. No clicking efects, no music, no nothing. I played around with my volume until I entered a race and it was too loud. And finaly we come to the actual driving experience....well...if you use a controller or keyboard you are basically hosed. The cars are mostly unconstrollable unless you have a wheel, and even then I'm not sure the default settings are ok. After much fiddling around with sensitivities, adaptive steering speeds and other settings, I managed to get a relatively ok setting. It worked fine for the car I was using at the time, but as soon as I changed cars, well I needed to see what I could do again.The menu/interface thing is quite buggy and unintuitive. You have a back button to go back to the game and if you hit back inside the game, as in to go back to the main menu...it takes you back into the matchmaking menu...so basically and infinite loop of back buttons. Now on to the plus points:After trying out multiple cars, I do have to admit you could ""feel"" when one car was heavyer, or lighter, or had softer suspension and that is a very very good thing. It becomes pretty obvious that underneath the bad interface it is running a very good simulation engine. On the polish oldtimer you can feel the heavy engine at the back trying to oversteer the car. On different DTM cars of the same era/class you can feel the different personlity of each car. I really like that. For example you can tell the Audi V8 is very heavy compared to the Merc 190 or the M3, you can feel that the Mustang has much softer suspension but is stil quite light. The FWD cars do understear in slow corners, and they do lift off oversteer just like they should. Dips in the road do make your car unstable and sometimes create wheelspin (this also sais a lot about the quality and detail of the tracks). This is especially noticeable on some longer high speed corners. The vibrators on the side of the track do unsettle your car and can make it jump up in the air. So yes, the racing engine underheath is very very good.The graphics do look good for a racing game. There's not much to say about them. Everything runs smoothly no stutters, high FPS. The amount of detail given to the sound during racing is quite high. It has suspension and pannel squeking. I'm quite dissapointed to be honest, I really liked all their previous games and those did have much better interfaces and functionality. This is just slopy in so many ways.From what I have played so far I am tempted to try it some more just because that surprisingly good engine underneath that crap interface. I haven't yet found out how exacly you enter a multiplayer race, there are some challenges and some servers, but instructions are scarce at best. I don't even think there is any form of experience or leveling, but if there is, I wasn't able to find it.			"

I have played one car with one track, and .. very disappointed.The car felt sloppy from the outside view, sounds were passable but repetitive, graphics seem dated and the menu system looks a mess.Never mind the pay for better cars / tracks .. judging from what I have seen, this is going nowhere fast ...

												A couple cars, couple variations of the same track and a large amount of mini-transactions.Kudos to SimBin to allow you to drive more than one car instead of buying them, although the rest are for real money. It has some potential to be a fun racing simulator, but I can already see that SimBin only wants your money.I must say, it is pretty fun for the first couple minutes, until you look at the store, ALL cars are for real money, nothing you can earn by playing; A career would of kept me playing.If you are intrested in these types of games, spend your money on Assetto Corsa - A amazing game, definitely recommend it - Instead of this milking factory. Not worth 10gb of storage space.3.5/10			"

												WowHowoverly unrealistic can you be?I bumped a car from behind and in UNDER 0.25s it finished a 360.  Now I understand the need for realism in racing, its actually fun.But that isnt real at all.Also you try to learn the game?  It teaches you by throwing you head first into a super over unrealistic race where braking and cornering at the same time isnt bad... its IMPOSSIBLE.Yes when you race you don't want to do that, thats a given.But if you brake and turn you dont slow down at 1kilometre per second........(just so you know it would take 300seconds to stop if you turn and break on the first corner of single race default)Which is completely unrealistic......If you like realism in driving gamesPlay Need for speed ITS BETTER THAN THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Great physics, great sound, decent graphics...boring game.  Slim vehicle lineup with some great tracks (many tracks you can't find on other games).  My racing group and I bought in only when the 80-90% sales were on.  Simply put the pay-to-play ""free to play"" nonsense ruined what should have been a serious contender for Project CARS, AC etc.  It has the quality to compete, but the purchase model is stupid.No AI use in multiplayer games also diminishes the appeal.  The tracks are nice but the environment is very sterile (akin to Assetto Corsa).  Great controller options and technical options but doesn't deliver much in the way of envirionmental options, etc. This is the game which should have been great.  We all openly agreed we'd have paid a normal $60 pricetag but everyone I race with is turned off by the silly pay-per-car junk.  That's the only reason I can't recommend this unless you stumble upon one of their big sales.			"

												You may ask yourself about this review, that this dude couldn't possibly know what he's talking about, he hasn't even played a full 30 minutes! Actually, I played 0 minutes. Because I couldn't get to play. Here, is why. [I have also, a link at the bottom of this review, to show you visually what I went through.]Firstly, on start up, my mouse cursor goes straight up to top of screen at a fast rate, and IT WILL NOT STOP. The only real reason I was able to login correctly is thanks to the arrow keys and the enter button that is found on my keyboard and I'm sure many many others as well. I couldn't acess the menu option because again, mouse was all over the fkn place. LEt alone select any game modes, and it is listed that it has at least partial controller support. Which leads us to the NEXT FK UP. :DSecond! The game screwed up my controller profiler or SOMETHING, and caused me to have to restart my rig. [Which I did not want to do at the time, but I was FORCED to by this games doing. Thanks.] Here is how! When I connected my controller to my pc, via wireless gaming adapter from Microsoft. [drivers up-to-date], it popped a notification on screen saying, ""Device Found. Profile Loaded"". My controller did not function on the menu whatsoever, and I wouldve loved to maybe see if it needed to be enabled or configured, but again I COULDN'T because of the mouse issue and no way to navigate the menu ANY OTHER WAY[keyboard/controller]. The controller will flash with a ful green circle as if its trying to connect. It scared me for a moment because before I could fully test my controllers status, I thought that this thing just screwed up my profiler and would cause me to have another task to endure to getting it fixed, [which ended up being a pc restart]. I did find that it was actually connected the whole time, before restarting, I went on to big picture mode, to find the controller was working and navigating through the menus, YET IT STILL FLASHED. Even after disconnecting and offing the controller, when turned back on, it would only flash, but still be connected. So I restarted PC and it fixed. But how did I get out of the game? Well you'd be surprised, because THAT is the THIRD topic of error I want to announce.THRIDLY. I could not exit the game for the life of me, I had to be a ninja on top notch to figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out. And after everything going on previously, my mind was already strung out. I couldn't click on anything obviously, a double esc press can't exit you out, you press escape, you MUST CLICK Yes or No buttons. But I couldn't because it was zipping to top of screen. So I tried windows button. Lol nope. So I tried to start task manager, but every time I'd go to click on it when it appeared and I was ""out of the game"", It shot me back to the horror-puzzle free to play that I downloaded apparently. Because it was just that, a puzzle, on how to figure out how to get the♥♥♥♥♥♥to work, and it horrified me in the process. I've done enough troubleshooting today.In short, the only thing that was racing in or about this, was my mouse cursor. And myself. It has ♥♥♥♥ed my entire day up, all of this happened and it's not even Noon yet. BRUH. Race-outofmyfkn-Room Racing Experience. [Mouse Cursor Edition] And devs, I don't mean to sound overly harsh, but this literally has ♥♥♥♥ed my entire mood for gaming the rest of the week, for ANY genre, just any game in general. And even if I were to get it fixed, the drive for me to play it has completely vaporized, and wouldn't be worth a fraction of a second more out of my life TBH. It probably wasn't worth all this effort anyways. This was overall,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥saddening.You've really outdone yourselves, guys. Congrats. Now Devs, go out to Wal-Mart, and buy the whole team a slice o' fkn cake, how about it?? Good day. Lol[  Link to evidence

												I could never find a way to switch the controls. I right clicked, left clicked, pressed every button on my keyboard. The was no way to fix the controls the way I prefer them. I never wanted to finish one race. If you want a racing game, find another free one, and tell me about it, because right now I'm only keeping this around for decoration in anarchy arcade.			"

												An expensive, unrealistic arcade racer which simply can not be taken seriously as a race simulator. If you are after a sim with great force feedback, good tyre physics and realistic car handling, this is not it.RaceRoom's bling doesn't make this game any less dull and uninspiring.Many will enjoy this title, but many enjoyed Need For Speed and Grid2 as well, so go figure.Serious sim racers don't waste your money on this.

												Good racing sim. However paying $40 for DTM experiance is a bit much for a half polished game. Good potential but not their yet. Also why must you always need an internet connection? Even when racing againt A.I and the internet connection drops out I have to completly restart the game losing everything. Really fun when 30 laps into a race.			"

												I have been racing sims for over 15 years, this is bar far one of the worst I've played. The cars turn on center of the axis, in the center of the car. If you don't know what I mean by that, it means if you were to shove a pole vertically through the center of the car, and then spin the car on the pole, that is how the cars feel in the game. Just not very realistic at all. This game is just not good, well it's a ""game"", not a sim.			"

												Physics in this game are horrendous. Cars have a smaller turning circle than a 18-wheeler, and when you have the FOV inside the car, they sound god awfule. Stock track selection is just plain stupid, and the stock hill climb track is absolutly terrible. Also, I am actually amazed on how stupid the controller reaction in this game is. If i ever so slightly tilt the joy-stick to the upper right/upper left, i loose 100% traction, and send myself into the wall, also its NOT the same thing with the throttle! I don't understand that one bit. If i have to go out and spend $100 on a actually decent racing wheel to play this game correctly, then I wouldent consider this a ""free"" game.4/10 - Please fix this mess of a ""Racing"" game.With love: Meme Antique Store.
