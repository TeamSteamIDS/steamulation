												I remember seeing this game from Warehouse Clearence Shops when I was about 13 for around £2.99. It was a toss up between a game called H.E.D.Z. Extreme Destruction Zone and this and I bought this. From the outset the game seemed simple, drive around In vehicles fitted guns trying to shoot other vehicles. However the game designers had other Ideas.I remember reading the booklet over and over and still not grasping what the point of the game was, it has to be one of the weirdest freakin' games I've played in terms of storyline and strange language. I really liked the graphics everything bar the vehicles looks like its made out of that Magic Sand stuff that stays dry under water and seems to shimmer and flush luminous colours. There are always things crawling over and under the surface like the ladscape is some giant, lumpy moth-eaten rug and you meet these creatures on a seperate screen who you interact with and buy stuff from who just make no sense at all and seem to live inside an advent calendar for no reason. And then you die. Over the years My copy fell victim to numerous scratches and became unplayable, when I saw that this game was on steam I thought I had to play it again. I think I have to agree with the description that mos of the pleasure that is to be had in this game is trying to work out what exactly whats going on and what you are supposed to do. You are kind of learning a foreign language with this game, but I think that's what gives the game it's appeal for me. It is a genuine oddity, a one off freak that you may never fully understand. And that is what has brought me here. Maybe I seek some sort of closure on what has been puzzling me for some time: Vangers, what was that all about? "

												1998 was the year of Grand Theft Auto (the original one with the top-down view), Planet of death(pod) and Vangers. Vangers didn't catch on much back then, because there wasn't any genre it fit. Even if it does some things similarly to GTA (open world top-down driving game with missions and unstructured gameplay), its premise and game world are much more confusing, and most reviewers and players couldn't warm up to it, though some did. (Actually, that probably hasn't changed.)What sets Vangers apart? Voxels: Vangers has been implemented with a voxel-like world (that was before the prevalence of polygon-crunching graphics cards), which means that the terrain doesn't have a surface made of textured polygons, but is sculpted out of tiny cubes (like square pixels make up a digital photograph, but in 3D). (Think minecraft with finer grains.)  This means that you can deform the terrain: vehicles leave tracks, weapons make craters, you can move under water, through tunnels (sometimes hard to spot in the top-down view) and, with the right equipment, even burrow along like a mole. Unfortunately, this is also the reason why Vangers still runs at 800x600: if you upped the resolutions, either everything would be very small, or the Voxels would appear larger, and everything would still be blocky.SciFi: Vangers is set in a confusing world, or rather a ""Chain"" of worlds (do read the ""preface"" eventually), with seasons that affect gameplay, weird installations, the purpose of which is initially unknown, and strange creatures that talk in riddles. You need to discover much of  the gameplay as you go along.So how do you get a feel for the game? Review the controls in the options - you will need to move, turn your vehicle over and use the KiD a lot. Set the game to fullscreen. Then click yourself (somewhat to the right) through the prologue into the buying screen, pick up a shipment of Nymbos, exit the burrow, click on the lower right panel to set your compass for Incubator, and take off. (I set my camera to zoom and tilt, but not to rotate, because  it is very easy to get disoriented.) You'll find that with your small, lightweight car, terrain matters a lot. There are roads, some obvious, some not so much, and unfortunately, you need to stay out of the way of stronger Vangers for the time being. Reach Incubator, sell the Nymbos, get some Phlegma, trade it back to Podish, buy better cars and equipment, ask the councellors about the things you saw, figure out how they work and how to reach other worlds in the chain, take part in races, take down other Vangers and loot them, become a motorized Scifi mercenary.If you like off-road driving and can keep going in the  face of confusion (and if you don't mind a time machine trip back to when screens had 15"", 640x480 was a good game resolution, and 800x600 looked definitely wonderful - and games had to ask before saving 64MB of persistent world), Vangers will reward you with huge and deep world full of surprises -- and driving.I can safely say that there hasn't been any game like Vangers since 1998, because if there had been, I would have played it. (Hard Truck Apocalypse, also published by Buka, comes close, but it doesn't have voxel terrain and isn't nearly as strange as Vangers.) I'm very happy that it has been overhauled to run on modern systems. P.S.: I just found my old Vangers mousepad with the yellow and blue liquid and the floating mechos!--------------------I just wrote the following in a forum post, it may help inform your buying decision.So some people may be thinking, ""that's an interesting game, but chances are high I won't like it much"" and then conclude that they'll buy it if it ever goes below 4$ or whatever. Those of us who know and love Vangers know the game is worth more to us, but I can understand that people who are curious are reluctant to buy.In that regard, if you like top-down off-road racing, with small vulnerable vehicles that can roll over and right themselves and do both small and really long jumps with a built-in spring device that charges up, you probably won't regret buying this for the full price, because if you get frustrated with the alien SciFi, you'll be able to just go and tool around the area some more in your mecho and have fun.

												Hello and welcome to the world of Univang! It's not a very friendly place, nor is it safe for an unwary traveler, but those who embrace the spirit of exporation will always find what they need. You assume the role of a Vanger - one of many inhabitants of the Chain, having nothing and no one to rely on except for your armoured mechos and the skills to drive it. Soon, you're being thrown out of the safety of Escave and face the Road that welcomes the new arrival...Perhaps the best way to describe Vangers experience is ""a newborn baby exploring the world for the first time."" In the terms of your knowledge about the surroundings, or your relative power to other beings living here, you pretty much equal nothing. There's no one to give you comprehensive information, no one to explain all the laws and principles governing the Chain of Worlds. You can ask, and you will receive some answers, but don't expect them to be clear and on-point - most of the advisors you'll meet talk in riddles. You don't have any goals, other than the little tasks that Escave rulers give you from time to time, so you'll probably feel helplessness in your first hours of playing Vangers. And that's exactly what the game is so good at - the world around you is very complex, very vibrant with life and full of secrets. But you have to work hard in order to comprehend it, making exploration the most important part of the game.Traveling the roads of Fostral, you'll stumble upon many objects and devices of unknown purposes. Some of them might affect you in different ways, some of them might open up to give you their contents. Cycles change around you, busy vangers on coloured mechoses drive by, following their own goals, and it's up to you to earn enough reputation in the eyes of advisors to get access to more secret knowledge.That being said, don't be discouraged by the apparent lack of understanding at the start. The game still has a lot of features and options to help you. Gather some oddities around Escaves, sell them in the shops and receive money to buy upgrades for your mechos. Earn enough, and maybe you'll be able to even buy a new vehicle, faster and better armoured than your basic model. Participate in local races to please the advisors and earn their trust, and surely they won't forget your brave efforts. Most importantly, get to know the Road - it's there that most of your battles will occur.Soon enough, you'll find yourself travelling across more and more worlds, some large, some tiny, but each with its own riddle to solve. The deeper you pierce the Chain of Worlds, the more options will be available to you, until the moment you'll finally get a glimpse of the true rulers of Univang... But that's still far away, and until then you'd better get used to hauling cargo and doing some passenger runs.Remember this: no matter how pointless and futile your actions might seem at first, no deed will be left unnoticed, and sometimes you have to keep trying over and over to earn your first results. Is it worth it? As a person who beat the game thrice already, I say definitely yes. The more you learn, the more interesting it becomes, and those first hours of confusion when you are just starting will be something you'll remember with nostalgy by the time you'll be ready to leave Univang as a mature and experienced King of the Road. Good luck, fellow Vanger! Say hi to Parafin from me.			"

												Vangers is unique.It's gonna pound you hard at the beginning - the weak minded will not prevail.Only after you resist enough to buy a new Mechos, things starts to make sense.And it's pretty rewarding for players avid for a good story and that feeling of ""what's gonna happen next"".

												Game may be unfriendly to new players, but this is what makes it so rewarding, when you finally manage to figure out - how the game world works and to understand shards of storyline, given to you by npc's. There are always different ways to complete goals. If you want money - you can complete quests, trade, or rob secret stashes. If you want to go to the next world - you can complete a difficult race, or prove you are worthy by some other way.Graphics look awesome, despite the game's old age, thanks to voxel engine which makes everything look even more alien.On the downside - ingame quests are very difficult. Sometimes you will even get tasks, which are impossiple to complete on the current stage of storyline. Offroad driving is nearly impossible, your car will not just go slower or stop  - it will spin uncontrollably whith the slightest press of a button.			"

												Old game, yet unique and fascinating. It was the first RPG-like game I have ever played and also my first 3D-like game as well. Differently from the modern games you have around here, you make a mistake, you die. Even when you get familiar with mechanics, maps and gameplay in general, you will constantly be ground to death by some mechanical flies, drowned in a pool of mud, shark-like creatures that tear armor apart and so on. You cannot be an ordinary player. You must be the chosen one. You must be a real Vanger, the one for the road.Pros:- Rich game setting with it's own vocabulary- Lots of different items, some of which you have no idea what they do- Lots of different mechos, from fast fragile ones to slow heavy-armored ones- A game that sometimes requires you to flee and hide instead of blasting your way through- Different endings, one of which makes you feel very lonely- KusowocksCons:- Difficult game, requires a lot of patience (which to me is a good thing)- You die a lot and sometimes forget to save...- Removing old Boorawchick from his Escave doesn't let you enter the Escave with the creepy doll of doom- Difficult vocabulary for starters- Geer'AH			"

												An obscure classic from my childhood, Vangers is just as bizarre as I ever remembered. You are a newly born Vanger, birthed by the Eleepods... you don't even know what a Vanger is, and no one will tell you... and as far as you know, an Eleepod is a caterpillar with strange soft hands, they are one of the 3 bioses that inhabit the worlds of 'The Chain'. The only thing you know about Vangers is that they are a kind of warrior created by something called ""the infinite mind"" in a world that just makes no sense... or does it... You'll be taking nymbos to Feenger at Incubator and taking part in the holy race, the ""Eleection"" where you must ride to Podish in your Mechos while carrying your own Eleepod, exploring the worlds of the chain, collecting plenty of beebs, assisting the Eleepods, or beeboorats, or the zeexen to fulfill their dark, existential quest to collect the larvae from which they are mutated...Gameplay-wise, this is an RPG/Racing/Open-World/Sandbox game the likes of which have not been replicated since this games conception in 1998.I saw other reviewers say this game is like learning a language... and it definitely is.It's a strange and esoteric experience. One that so many should definitely experience. I'd been trying to get this game to work again for years, only to recently discover a steam version was released this year. And for only $6, you cannot go wrong. I would pay $20 for this game... TL;DR please buy this game and discuss it with me because I've never had anybody to discuss this game and it's messed up story with before and I need that so badly you have no idea			"

‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;All mimsy were the borogoves,   And the mome raths outgrabe.“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun   The frumious Bandersnatch!”He took his vorpal sword in hand:   Long time the manxome foe he sought —So rested he by the Tumtum tree,   And stood awhile in thought.And as in uffish thought he stood,   The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,   And burbled as it came!One, two! One, two! And through and through   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!He left it dead, and with its head   He went galumphing back.“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?   Come to my arms, my beamish boy!O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”   He chortled in his joy.‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;All mimsy were the borogoves,   And the mome raths outgrabe.So, imagine that, but with cars and guns, racing and trading, and on alien worlds.

												Finished the game for the ~18th time in the last 16 years, nothing has changed.It's still the same solid game it was back in the day, with a story that will make your head spin. This is both it's strong point and it's weak point since the vast majority of the story comes in cryptic dialogue but once you decypher what is going on, you're in for the ride of a lifetime.This is a good example of a great game that withstood the test of time, and the current generation could benefit from playing a game such as this, where deep plot points and unpredictable gameplay merge in a form of art we call vangers.keep in mind, it's a little weird, even for those used to these kinds of games, but in the end, you'll thank yourself for picking this up.

												One of the most epic games I have played since 1992. This game has never been surpassed by any other in terms of how the world is thought through, plot, atmosphere and gameplay. I know that outside of Russia it was not successful back in 1998, primary because the game was non-format at that time and it was not understood. It was true indie game which came an epoch before these games bacame mainstream. And now, when the time for such games finally came, I am glad to see it republished for wide variety of people.By the way, I still have soundtracks from Vangers in my playlist.			"

												Prepare yourself for the journey into the queer and insane world of Vangers, because this one won't be easy.I would strongly recommend reading manual at first, because if you just run the game you may easily get lost in it, won't understand a thing and drop it after an hour.I beat it four or five times I guess and I really love the game. The universe is amazing, gameplay is just thrilling. It's like ELITE+Carmageddon+LSD. Just masterpiece.If you liked Vangers and in good terms with RTS, I would also recommend checking the Perimeter game from the same developers. One of the most original RTS of all times.			"

You may be able to find nuances and shortcomings in the game, but where it hits - it hits as hard no other game out there.This is the game where AI can get ahead of you in the quest line, where future went so crazy you can't tell the difference with fantasy, where there are secrets yielding arcane power and endless possibilities.

												Vangers is a game that I played and loved as a kid, and before this randomly popped up on steam I would have sworn that my brother and I were the only people who loved this game outside of Russia. It was kind of under the radar when it was brand new, but it really captured my imagination as a kid.After playing through it again as an adult, I can say that even without the nostalgia goggles it's still a great game and if you aren't the kind of person who needs photorealistic graphics to have fun, there's a really awesome style completely unique to this game. I love the game, the story, the setting, and everything about it and even today it really holds up in my opinion. Support whoever the heck re-released it and buy it today!			"

												It takes a bit to open up, but Vangers' first world of Fostral quickly becomes both a frustration and a beckoning challenge to master. Every sidebar command works to aid new players who might not even make it to Incubator for sometime; the Kinetic Device provides both risk and reward with the promise of escaping most early-game combat scenarios. There's more than a few build-out options available for those who trade quickly and often, and the goodies to find even before gaining your first Spiral (like deserted Cirtainers and packages hidden under the cross-hatched scaffolds) make exploration a good investment.Above all, the game world is frightening, beautiful yet teeming with odd and deformed entities. All hearsay appears dubious, even what the Advisors tell you! Read the feelies for this game and you'll begin to understand how effective the worldbuilding and game progression for Vangers is.			"

												Amazing game, Love the gameplay even after all these years (originally bought it in a discount bin with like 14 others back in 1998). Everynow and then this is a game you can just pick up and have fun with if your anything like me. This review is all my opinion wich might be slightly biased due to nostalgianess hehe.Graphicly >_> or w.e if I mistyped : This game has aged well if you compare it to indie games from nowadays, It doesnt stutter and the specs you need are uber low. Altho I like the style it is aged so well to me check out some gameplay if your not sure but for me its gotta be: 8/10Gameplay: You have a top view car which can jump, roll, shoot, Go trough motha****** portals to explore diffrent (more hostile) worlds where you can sometimes do a small puzzle or a race for example. You gotta like the gameplay and wittyness that is in it. 9/10Story: Not a too great FORCED story.... buttttt If you take the effort to read all the dialoge you can get a clearer view, Sometimes you need  to remember a cryptic statement to ease out a later puzzle world, But overall the story is how much you want to be drawn in by it. GREAT ROLEPLAYING GAME if you are into roleplaying, as there is no real storyline thats forced so you are like a blank slate since you start a game.    7/10AN: I dont have alot to complain about this I hope FIXED version (my original NEVER would let me go trough the LAST FREAKKING PORTAL TO END IT LEGIT) apart from missing the >>>Cheatcodes<<<< and multiplayer in this release While multiplayer I can live without Replaying the game with cheats was a fun thing to do to explore stuff.Verdict: I love the style, I love the execution even now for this classic. It should still be cheaper(LIKE 2,99 MAX) for the amount of time it would take to fully clear the game on a good run(without cheats sometimes you just get stuck in a run if you cannot find the right artifacts in the worlds) But if you are looking for a Nice racing/shooter with a unique feel that so many games seem to miss nowadays this is deffinatly a good one to pick up:= 8/10 TOTAL SCORE! ITS A CLASSIC :3~epic			"

												Nice world liveing its own life, stack of things 'to do' and good share of exploring if exploring for you is something bigger than just 'going up to every summit'.But allso theres The plot. 'Inadequate' reality with sour past and miserable present. If you'll not 'get it' from first interactions with inhabitants, and wont be turned in to understand them, story wont touch you. But if it cought you, it will dwell deep in your mind. Questions that are unanswered for reason in gruesome tale with no 'right' ending, or at least ending with answers.If you'll love it - try it. If you'll want more intel on what was it all about - try Perimeter (dont forget P-files), since its about same world and same events. Same in that shady twisted way as is everything about Psychosphere. Take it 'close' and it will hurt you, cause you'll crave for answers but will get lost in speculations and lies.Its sad, its complicated, its worthy. Its good.Only substantial negative that i can bring up is unended story, cause there was no progression after Perimeter 2 (that wasnt good for gameplay, but story was told), and not like there would be...

												Now, I know I don't have any time at all on this game. That doesn't matter.What matters is this is childhood looking right at me in all its neon green and orange goodness with the odd characters, quirky lines and the chaos of armored car combat.I spent many a long summers day through summer break playing this when I was a wee grub, starting off carting nymbos and phlegma to and from Podesh and Incubator.It wasn't too long after that I found the glory of owning a bigger and beefier mechos that carting more of those baubles became so much more profitable.Bigger mechos meant bigger guns as well. Oh, the joys of blowing every little cart and car off the face of Fostral, picking up their cargo then puttering on back to Incubator just to sell the spoils for more beebs.After that first big race and toting that little eleech to the finish line, securing the key to a new world and opening the doors to many many odd adventures, finding artifacts of great power, and even capturing the great larva for whatever strange reasons I had at the time.I never did finish the game, but I came close to it at one point before the poor potato of a computer I had at the time♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed, my hard work and grand machos lost forever.Seeing this game on Steam just screams for new adventures and shenanigans to be had.10/10 reliving childhood never felt so great.

												A trippy, unique game with neat deformable terrain.Reminds me of a more active verion of Autodeul - drive your vehicle around fighting, winning reaces and trading. There's a decent amount of weapons available and lots of vehicles to choose from. When you are powerful enough you can start traveling between the worlds and dig in to the underlying story of the game.Don't let the odd syntax throw you - a good chunk of this game is exploration and discovery, and figuring out what the hell everything is is all part of the fun.Highly recommended if you like a challenge, vehicular combat and/or exploration. PS> If you have defraction grating / Valient Vision 3D glasses, be siure to break them out for this game - the first world of Kestral is amazing with all the contrasting yelllows/reds over the green landscape...

												As you may have already guessed from the mixed reviews, Vangers is not everyone's cup of tea. It's a bit like a video game equivalent of a Gene Wolfe novel. A lot of bizzare situations and objects described in a convoluted, difficult language. If your first reaction is ""why make things purposefully difficult and convoluted?!"", don't buy this game. If, on the other hand, you're intrigued and are ready to persevere, there's... still some annoying stuff you need to confront!First of all, do take a look at the trailer and the screenshots available on the net. I've never had a problem with the visuals here, but apparently some people do. Worlds here have seasons, each with its own color scheme, so you can't really see everything during your first 20 minutes or so. Secondly, the original came with a hefty manual which explained a lot of what you see on the screen. Without it, you'll probably have to spend a bit of time figuring out where the buttons are, such as going to the shop (bottom right), leaving (top left), proceeding with the dialogue (top right), saving (yellow circle). The default controls are absolutely terrible (I don't think they were this bad in the original - the devs must've botched something, or maybe I did when installing...) You don't have to change everything - just select what you like for basic things like turning, firing, opening (e.g. when approaching an escave from the surface), fullscreen, etc., and you'll figure the rest out later. I also dislike the music and just turn it off right at the start, but YMMV.For those who have trouble understanding what the game is like at all, you (a vanger) are essentially driving a vehicle (mechos), exploring alien worlds, doing some trading and errands for the locals, competing with other vangers. The plot gets really, really thick after a while - particularly after you win the favor of some of the locals, and are granted access to one or more cursed worlds, where the artifacts are. The ending is one of the most amazing things ever done in a video game, but I won't spoil it. Suffice to say that it's more than a plot twist and more of a life experience for you.			"

												Mixed feelings about this game.I bought this title shortly after it came out, many years ago, and played it a bit. Never forgot its unique game design, open world style, and cryptic stories. Since then, I've been looking for longplay videos ever since, until this came along on Steam and I figured I might just try it again.And yes, something about this game still moves me. I've always read that the slow and relentless pacing of this game will reward in the end, once you get the hang of the mechanics, and get access to the other words, weapons, quests and such.Unfortunately.. a lot of design choices will result in a harsh and unforgiving experience in the first 10 hours of gameplay. The (old) game manual is a must to explain practically all mechanics, as well as the user interface and the many definitions, as they are not quite explained in the game itself.Practically NOTHING is intuitive and will take quite an investment in time to comprehend, including the in-game dialogue, which makes reference to so many foreign definitions per sentence you will find yourself completely lost in the first hours.Some of the problems include camera rotation (even if turned off) inducing instant motion sickness, unintuitive UI buttons, very hard to click UI buttons, no safe harbours in the open world (constant fear of attack e.g. while configuring your compass), impossible to complete quests early on, frustrating AI (e.g. continuously jumping mechos), frustrating vehicle mechanics, all leading to repetitive behavior and excessive game load/saving. I had hoped a new release would address these shortcomings, but alas.As a last ditch effort I tried to activate some cheats, only to find out these have been removed ""out of principle"" by the game designers in this release.I have to conclude that, even after all these years - and it hurts to say - certain game design choices invoke such frustration for me, I cannot continue to play and would therefore not recommend this game despite its cult following :(			"

												A highlight of my youth, together with Fallout it defined my tastes for videogames. Thanks to its Steam re-issue I was once again able to enter this quirky world. Loveable aliens which have little to nothing in common with most sci-fi creatures - they are more mischievous kids than evil overlords. Unique voxel graphics which make the game truly timeless - and still pictures can't capture its charm, it really has to be appreciated live from inside the game. Unforgiving controls will drive you crazy for the first hour but then you'll grow to take it as just another challenge. Highly recommended!			"

												Vangers was the first game I owned that captured my imagination.  I played the game extensively in the windows os;  I still have the original install disk.  Over the years I managed to get it to work on various flavours of the windows os, although in some versions of windows the graphics did not work.Then I switched to Linux and you can imagine my delight when I found a Linux version of Vangers on Steam!The Linux version is actually a little bit more difficult to play than the windows version.  There is no joystick axis support in the Linux game, and although landscape is deformable, there is no option to save the landscape to disk in the Linux version.  That means that one of the exploits I used to use to get big mechos fast no longer works in the Linux version.It doesn´t really matter.  Once you know how to collect beebs efficiently, it does not take long to make enough to get whatever mechos you want.If you are a beginner to the game, you might want to find the online manual and you might want to do a google search for vangers hints and tips.  The game will throw curve-balls at you from time to time.  They are avoidable once you know how, but to avoid them you will need experience in the game, or you will need to read a guide.In all my years of gaming, Vangers is one of the few games that captured my imagination.  If you would like to get your mind stretched a little bit, if you like exploring, if you like sandbox games then I highly recommend Vangers as a game that might be right for you.  The whole game, start to finish is a learning experience, and even after you play through a couple of times is still an enormous amount of fun.  There is so much to learn, so much to find.  I wish you a very happy  journey in the Vangers Universe.			"

												So I never got to fully experience this game. I did not know what to do and the manual was not helpful(too much text)(too lazy to read). The game mechanics are well rounded, I found the enemy AI to be quite aggressive. For a classic game such as this, I know that there are no updates. But here's the review.Mechanics: Well rounded and very stable. Though it did take me about 1 hour to figure out the controls, and another half hour to figure out how your car effects the environment. Once I figured it out, I could actually play the game. Once playing the game, I didn't neccessarily fall in love with the mechanics, but I'm smart enough to know that they are well built mechanics. I did not run into any glitches in the game, rather the game is very un-userfriendly if you don't know what you are doing.Mechanics Rating: 7/10Story: The story is presented in text and didn't seem very interesting to me. Caterpillar people just doesn't ring any bells. But if you can past the absurd setting and characters, then the story is a good story. You play a runner for the caterpillar overlords and do something, I mostly skipped the story because I was having trouble finding out how to play the game. I never got far into the story either so I'm reviewing the front cover of the game storywise.Story Rating: 6/10Artwork: I happen to be a fan of all types of artwork in videogames so the dated looks don't effect my review. This game is in 2.5 D from a top down perspective. I at first did not know the difference between up and down elevation wise in the game but after some time I figured out how the graphics system worked and the hints that are made for up and down and passable through. I want to grade the artwork by 2d and 3d standards but I can't single one portion out. The tone of the artwork is slightly disturbing in a good way that complements the story. The character models are all well built and there is no flaws artisticallyArtwork Rating: 8/10Replay Value: I personally don't want to play this game but if you like the game, it holds an immense replay value.Replay Value Rating: 4/10Price to Hours Ratio: $7 : (approx) ~20~Price to Hours Rating: 10/10Total Rating: 70/100			"

More options may be coming in the future, I am very excited.			"

												I have sadly not played the original version, so I can not speak for the nostalgia points this game may have. However, this is supposedly a rework of an over twenty year old game, and I have failed to notice any concepts that were elaborated or worked upon. The simplest of the goals of remaking a game should be porting it to higher resolutions and framerates, adding a detailed graphics option, and perhaps a tutorial - hell, just tooltips, please! If you don't have these basic details, how could we start to speak about other additions, such as achievements, soundtrack, trading cards, and so on?Now, graphic updates may be optional, and I am not going to judge this for having ""bad"" graphics. They are, however, ugly. The weird colour palettes and the use of shapes that in no way fit together create a chaotic and utterly unfascinating view, not to mention the annoying font used. It reminds me of when I used to kill boredom on my Windows XP Paint when I was 9, fumbling shapes and angles into a vibrant mess.I read the introduction lore and some other details as well, and I found them cheesy and unimaginative, with frustrating tones and effects that accompanied it. I doubt I would have enjoyed any of this had I even played the game near release.Would not recommend. At all.			"

												Eyeball Ache! Unsure what to even do!Okay so I've been a gamer from a very young age (As young as I can remember) I started gaming on a C64, onto various Amiga's then to PC's and various consoles on the way.I've played many eyeball ache games, strange, bizzaire, weird and confusing games but this one has to be the worst of them all.Even for a game from 1998 this is terrible.My first impressions from the start screen was OUCH! My eyes, literally hurt from trying to read the text which is the same ugly bright green and the background! Almost... very little contrast.I guess on a very old washed out CRT this wouldn't have been as bad as on a modern monitor but still...So I finally navigated the eye-ball destroying menu.To then be presented by some weird alien thing, a screen and various blended in ""Graphics"" which I found out are buttons...After clicking around for a good 5 minutes I couldn't work out what to do...After seeing gameplay videos on YouTube I'm not going to bother spending the time to work it out, especially as the game is phyiscally hurting my eyes.I do old games, new games and this game... is a definite no from me.

												The interface hurts the eyes. Reading anything is quite an exercise. Not only that, nothing is intuitive. You can click that big red bug shaped button during the preface to skip it, but do you get any hints? No. Took me quite some minutes to figure out how to actually start the game per se (go out in the car). Not that it got much better. Maybe it's because it's the first car, but damn does it suck. You get stuck into something all the time and you often see other vehicles struggling doing anything.The camera doesn't help much. You have a bird's eye view, so you don't always know whether the place you're going is straight or a ramp or whatever else.Maybe there is indeed a game below all these layers of purposefully questionable and confusing design, but I don't see any incentive nor have the patience to discover it.

												I'm unsure of what the Vangers is about even with playing an hour. I even struggled playing an hour due to horrid handling of the player character movement and horrid color scheme. Even for the late 90's this is pretty bad. I'm sure deep, deep down this game is wonderful but I doubt any newcomers to whatever Vangers is won't get far. Perhaps if this is some game you had as a child and are feeling nostalgic, by all means purchase this to relive your childhood. Others should steer away from this game. If you do decide to purchase this or obtained it through a bundle and would like to buy, map keys to a controller for perhaps a slightly more enjoyable experience.Overall : ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆			"

												Unessesarily obtuse, its a chore just to figure out the basics of what this game wants you to do. It throws a bunch of barely comprehensible jargon at you right from the get go and rather than try and wean you into the games world, it just dumps a bunch of nonsense on you and expects you to wade through it. If it had the gameplay to back it up, this might be a worthwhile task, but its basically a clunky combat racer, so even if you struggle your way to an understanding of the games alien language, all you get for your trouble is a below average gameplay experience. If you want to play a game that makes you learn an alien language but is actually worth playing, try Outcast instead			"

												Honestly, what is this? It has a lot of positive reviews, but I don't see how it is possible unless they're lies.The screenshots look better than what shows on screen, I don't get sick from games or motion but this one gave me a headache and made me want to throw-up. It isn't worth the hard-drive space it takes up.The UI is illegible, there are clickable words that fade into the background and the background is green and so are the buttons so anyone that has any type of color sensory deficiency or color blindness will not be able to play this game. When you hover over a word, it becomes a darker green making it slightly easier to read, however it isn't easy to even get the game started to play.Configuring your car is a chore; half of the buttons are unlabeled, and the ones that are aren't color-blind friendly ( I have full color range despite males having a high chance of having some color blindness ). There are insect icons which apparently mean Play, etc... There are various slots to put equipment for your vehicle.When you get into the game, which is difficult considering there is no play button, you have to click on everything to figure it out and the ui is completely non-intuitive. If the goal was to create something which is difficult to play or navigate, they've succeeded. They've locked out anyone who is color-blind or who has any type of minor color-blindness from playing the game, etc.. They've somehow found a way to make people sick by playing this.... I think this will be the only game I have on Steam that I'll either remove from my account or hide permanently.Clicking on the alien that says something makes the ui ""blink"" along with the other green slime slots.When you finally get the game to start, your own same-colored-people attack you while the red targets do not. The controls are alien; ie Activate KID apparently makes you jump, or it was the other one. ""Accelerate"" is fast-move-forward while move-forward is 'normal""-speed-forward or slow-forward.The camera options are dizzying.Steer clear of this one.			"

You are the Vanger - Merchant, Slave, Roadster and sometimes a heartless Killer. (Don't worry, you wont be the killer as often as u play that sneaking oneshot archer in Skyrim ^^)The Story still amazes me, the Characters are well designed and the different Worlds are beautiful.Today...i long for a remake.

												God, I put 18 hours into that, and I still only made it to my second world. Chose poorly and landed in Glorx where that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Boorawchick takes your mechos away if you don't have a rubbox for ruBeecation (best part is I even had one from rubbing the hidden compartment at Oboorez' place during Heroism, just didn't have it equipped) and forces you to partake in the nuclear war. Spent 4 of these hours just shipping shrubs to Ogorod and valosin from Vigboo to Lamposso to get a new mechos that doesn't explode on the lightest touch so I could actually collect those ♥♥♥♥ing nucleobooms for 4 more hours and then I finally gave up because it just didn't seem to get me anywhere. Never got promoted from slave to even try my hand at the peeperettes. tl;dr: ♥♥♥♥ the Buro and his stupid Manual, and the Beeborats in general. Even the Eleepods were better, and those were real ♥♥♥♥ing raffas already.In all seriousness though, if you like weird games that require tons of dedication, this game is pretty rad.			"

												This must be some nostalgia thing, because the actual software here (won't even call it a game) is just garbage.  I can't even tell if the positive reviews are some sort of practical joke.  Well, you got me guys, you got me good.			"
