												Great concept... Not so great gameplay.Was really hoping to like this game, as it looked funny, and more of a movie car stunt simulator than anything, if you go based on the trailer video.The controls are atrocious, turning corners is more like a suicide mission, and when get some air time, these little wings come out of your vehicle.Unfortunately, they are not practical, and are nothing more than eye candy.So if you were expecting to fly the camper in this game... Forget about that idea.The graphics & sound are on par for this style of game, and it is entertaining, but since this is a driving game, the driving mechanics should function properly, and I personally find they do not.For that reason, I cannot recommend a driving game, if the driving is not that good.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												Four tracks and three vehicles to choose from - a camper, bus, or van.  Make your selections and then start escaping a giant spider or maybe collect some chickens - even if your goal is to finish the laps and collect the coins, stars, and shield.  Camper Jumper Simulator is one of those games that you don't expect much from but end up having entirely too much fun with it.  Sure, your vehicles control like a nightmare.  And yeah, sometimes you may go flying randomly.  But it's all part of the charm of the game.  It's not game of the year or anything but I definitely feel the few dollars paid were worthwhile.  Though I do think adding multiplayer would take this game to a whole new level.  I couldn't imagine the chaos that would occur on each track.

			Camper Jumper Simulator is a ton of fun to play even if it does control horribly. But that adds to the excitement of escaping giant spiders, crashing through signs, avoiding giant tripods of death,...

My Thoughts:If your seeking something cheap, fun and funny then give this a try. just don't buy into it expecting  a serious or highly polished racer.Game Details:Camper Jumper Simulator is a crazy, racing game with lots of puzzles to discover and solve. Challenging trails with lost of shortcuts that must be found to win. Lots of hidden secrets and challenges! "

												Camper Jumper Simulator:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Camping has never been up there for me when I think about holidays, to be truly honest with you. I might have to re-think this, however; renting a motorhome might be quite fun after all. So let me ask this question to all you fans of camping . . . is this really what happens in camping trips? Because if it is, my next holiday will be a camping jumping one!Camper Jumper simulator is a racing / parkour game where you drive a motorhome, a school bus and a kombi van on the four tracks available to you.  The main objective in Camper Jumper Simulator is to go as fast as possible for three laps around the track within a certain time limit to win a golden trophy (silver or bronze too). That applies for three of the four tracks. By achieving a gold, silver or bronze trophy, you will unlock additional features. Before each race, a screen will come up with a set a challenges. So if you already have a gold trophy under your belt, you can now concentrate on achieving these challenges. These vary from collecting crystals in a difficult location, to doing a lap without using a bridge, and plenty of others. For the gameplay aspect, first of all you can only use the keyboard at this stage, which is ok but it would be nice to be able to play Camper Jumper Simulator with a gamepad. As you go around a track, you will be able to collect coins, blue crystals and/or even run over chickens (poor things) - I like chickens! Especially wrapped in pancetta and cooked for 35 minutes in a hot oven! (that’s my camping cooking tip for you!) Plenty of obstacles to avoid; rocks, flamethrowers and aliens, to mention a few. Plenty of crazy driving which will include jumping over buildings using ramps or even jumping from the top of a hill. When you do so your large vehicle will suddenly grow wings, and by the way, it’s very difficult to fly this type of machine, let me tell you. Drive over blue arrows to give your vehicle extra speed but make sure not to damage your engine too much.Graphically the game looks good, the frame rate is over 60 fps on 2560 X 1440 resolution. Funky soundtracks too. My biggest issue here is the camera overview which you control with your mouse. If you don’t position the camera properly when you are driving, the game is very hard to play. Bear in mind, you need to move the camera here and there to spot blue crystals and other items.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Good graphics-	Good number of challenges per track-	Fun to play-	Good pricing-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Camera overview needs to be better -	Vehicle very difficult to control in the air (with the wings)This game is a fun to pass the time. 6/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

			I have no idea what the hell did I just play, but this game has very laggy camper vans and school bus that have wings and then flames come out and then some tripod robots from the movie ""War of the...		

This is my first and last video of this game, so if you're a drooling button basher, then sure, this game is good, but if you actually like to play games and not just bash buttons and drool all over the keyboard while doing so, then this game is not for you. I don't know why so many people like it, I just laughed cuz it was so stupid.I'm sorry, but you must be 12 years old or younger to like this game.1. it LAGS really bad.2. there are no graphic or control settings, you can only map 6 different buttons, you can't even look around freely.3. handling is terrible, vehicles just slide around4. damage is horrible, textures / models glitch really bad.5. sound effects are not that great either.6. what is the point? you just drive and smash and then aliens poop some red light and then helicopter flies and fire comes out and then wings grow from underneath the camper van when it barrel rolls thru the air and then you see some breaking bad dudes with toxic barrels rolling like ROFLs on back of the camper vanned bus school and then you see red and then there's a ramp and you have some dingo bingo you have to collect like in crash bandicoot and then some barn does crash and you fly backwards and then collect some bingobongo and then you drive and you're not even sure if you driving or flying in an alien ship disguised as a camper van with glitched out sides and then you finish and go to poop.this game is only good for 1 time giggles.

												Camper Jumper Simulator gameplay is quite frankly suicidal, but in a good way. While you can do laps and there is a circuit, don't expect to control the vehicle as you would do with typical racing games. The physics of the camper is, well, extremely over exaggerated. But for sheer mayhem and demolition fun, the game is crazy with lots of skills to master.Make up your own mind with this gameplay:

												I did a Gameplay of Camper Jumper Simulator ep1. It's definitely fun for the $2-3. But T=the first few levels so far are more racing thanm jumping, although you are airborne quite a bit. I highlly recommend a controller, keybord control is difficult.
