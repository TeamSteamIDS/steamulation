Dear Devs, please do us a favor and include a Tutorial in game!Don't make me browse through 20+ topics untill I find out which button does what.Just to help you people, for Xbox 360 Controller:(A) - Boost, when you collect enough boxes and the msg appears on the screen.(X) - Break, you also tap it to drift on turns.(Y) - Change your camera view.(RT) - Accelerate, if you disable the auto-acceleration on Options.And for the tricks, there is no button for it. Your car will flip if you take only half of the ramp.As for the game:It's really good, very fast depending on the music you pick, and I think I can say the controls are ok. I wish I could race some other cars, even if bots.I had some problems avoiding barricades that I couldn't see, because everything has the same colour, and flashes.And one great problem that is probably a bug: Sometimes, after a jump, a turn appear, and it doesn't matter how hard I stear my car, it won't reach the track, and it's unavoidable to fall.But I do recommend this game, as I also recommend Beat Hazard, Melody's Escape and AudioSurf.

Early Access Review
Drive Any Track (DAT) . Review writted for Early Access v0.5.1.I write this in english to reach more ppl, but that's not my main language, feel free to let me know if I do some errors.If you are bored to read, go bottom I posted a little video.You understand how to play in about 5 min: Select a track on your hard drive (mp3, flac) DAT analyse your sound and create a track regarding the content If nobody have already used this sound, you are the creator of this track If the sound have already been used, you can select other best players as ghost (very cool to learn)Then the game start, all you have to do is keep sync with the sound by keeping inside bars If you are sync, you get 4x score bonus, or less if you are to late You can collect some bonus and use a boost, jump, flip to make points When you are in advance on the synch, you become super sync and get a 10x score bonus This is not a race, all you have to do is the best scoreWhat is missing actually in this game, for me, and I hope dev will now transform they little nugget into an awesome music game: Not enough beats effects, would be cool when the background city have more visual effects, something to make the game a lot more immersive (fireworks, flash on beats). It really miss a button to preview your sound. Must to have You can unlock new cars but actually you don't know why You cannot rebind keys, I think that will come in futur. Actually if you play with a pad you don't have to rebind there is only 1 button but maybe for keyboards users that can be usefull.To finish, I like too this EA Game cause the devs are present and love they baby, wait and read the feedbacks. So that's a good, really good start for me ! 100% recommended if you like to follow growing games and be a part of itHere is a little video if you are boring to read text and just see what look the game in actual state. I do 2 times the same track so you can see a new track and a track with a gost (and in both I suxx :-))

Riff Racer, what a game. To be honest, I did not expect it to be so good. This is one of those games that you put your music into and they generate a racing track, which fits the music. Even though it's in Early Access, it does its job better than other game of the same genre.Below the final verdict is the complete list of music that I've played for this review.Pros: Terrific surroundings (skyscrapers, spotlights, etc.) It does a really good job at converting the music into the track you are driving on. The drops are amazing, boost pickups are synchronised with the beats and even landings fit the music! Even though it's a racing game, I did not expect to see drifting in this game. It's awesome! There are jumps, flips, pickups, boosts and other stuff. There is a wide choice of vehicles that can be used in-game. Also, you can buy skins for them using ""chips"" you earn while playing. One of the main benefits (in my opinion): the graphic details are astonishing even on older computers. The game uses a low amount of system resources. There are no lags or disruptions in the music you're playing. Even if you crash, the music keeps going. This is not the case in Audiosurf, though. Even when you crash, use boost or in any way change your speed, the landscape is always synchronised with the current music. I don't know how they did it, but it's amazing. There are achievements and leaderboards.Cons: There is no music that comes with the game itself. If you want to play, you need your own music library first. | This feature has been added.  No autoplay/playlist option. When you finish a song, you have to pick the next one by hand. | This feature has been added. Achievement Unstoppable is not working properly. The player is supposed to unlock it when he completes a level without hitting any barricades. However, it can also be unlocked by restarting the level as soon as music starts to play. No advanced graphic options. I know I have mentioned in the upsides that you don't actually need to lower the quality as it runs just fine on most of the computers. It is still a good idea to include more options. Some barricades are extremely hard to see and therefore avoid, especially after jumps. If the music file is more silent than usual, the game sounds might be louder than the music itself. I only had this problem with The Writer, but there should be some kind of a detection system that would lower the game sounds, if necessary.The final verdict:There are quite a few downsides, but they don't really matter that much. I really enjoyed my time in this game so far as it is an awesome experience for both your ears and eyes. There is no quality loss when songs are played, there are leaderboards to make you compete against others and, above all, the game runs smoothly with low loading times. Buy this game. What's better than listening to your favourite music while playing a fun game?The list of songs I played: Shawn Wasabi - Marble Soda EXGF - We Are The Hearts Adiemus Max Min - Anonymous ZHU - Faded (Steve James Remix) Maraaya - Lovin' Me Marc Reeden - Take Me Away Freestylers - Cracks ft. Belle Humble (Flux Pavilion Remix) Clokx - Catch Your Fall Felix Jaehn - Ain't Nobody ft.

												So, I fire up Riff Racer: Race Your Music!. What do I want to listen to? Riff Racer allows me to select anything from my MP3 files, so I pull up my MP3 list of songs and decide on Gojira’s latest album (Magma). I decide the title track will fit my mood perfectly. Ahead of me lies a neon track, spanning off into the horizon and far beyond what the naked eye can see. The music queues up, the song begins and my car starts accelerating. I deftly maneuver around an obstacle, and then, heart racing, I take a slide around a bend in the track, narrowing missing the rail as I get my car under control, hit a boost point, and go flying off of a jump, only to barely land on the next section of track. Before me waits an amusement park loop which I take at super boosted speeds. The music blaring, the track continues to form before me, the beat and dynamics of the song dictating where the game will take me next. A few minutes later, I cross the blue finish line, having finished with 100% synchronicity, good for quite a few points. I now hold first place on a track of my own creation.StoryThis isnt applicable. The story is really the track and how it responds to your musical selection, and how you respond to the track in turn.GraphicsThe graphics are quite cool looking. As mentioned in my intro, the tracks in Riff Racer are neon constructed out of and into nothingness. The horizon is ever your goal, and Riff Racer sends you there full throttle in a glowing world of bass, beats, and guitar (or whatever makes up the whole of the songs you select). To an extent, Riff Racer’s graphics are minimal, and yet you cant help but draw similarities to games like Tron, albeit beefed up and modernized.Overall, the graphics in Riff Racer aren’t mind blowing, but they do look really cool. I would give them an 8 out of 10GameplayThis is where Riff Racer truly shines. As a game that creates your experience around the music you select, Riff Racer does an exceptional job of being a dynamic, time and points based solo racing game. You can never see very far ahead, and so you will be constantly reacting to the world as Riff Racer shifts and creates the track based on the dynamic of the music.There are loops, jumps, obstacles, boosts, and plenty of twists and turns that offer opportunities to not only race full throttle, but also to get your drift on. My own best drift was right at 16 beats. Jumps are also timed, and you score more points based on how many beats your jump is good for. Depending on the angle of release on your jumps, you might also spin in the air, which counts as a trick that also garners you more points. Additionally, any special moves help to fill up your boost meter.Your boost meter is an essential part of Riff Racer. Basically, boosting allows you to stay ahead of the beats, which is your ultimate goal. You want to at the very least try to stay with the first beat at all times, but getting ahead of it will net you even more points. In addition to tricks, there are also coins and boxes all along the track that will also help fill your boost meter. Finally, there are also boosts along the track as well. The more you stay in boost mode, the more points you will earn. Points will allow you to rise in level, which will earn you bonus coins.Speaking of coins, you will earn those in each track by running over actual coins and boxes, by creating a track yourself (which, in Riff Racer, means you were the first to drive a track with any given song), by beating existing top 5 scores, and so on. You can use the coins to buy different cars and different skins for said cars. There is a notable difference in the various cars. The skins are just cosmetic.The controls are tight and fully responsive. Any time you are out of control in Riff Racer, it is because you over compensated, generally as a reaction to having to make some split second decisions. You can of course play the same track over and over, so once a track for a song has been created, it will always remain the same, and you can memorize the twists and turns in hopes of getting better scores.Riff Racer does what it needs to do perfectly. I give gameplay a 10 out of 10.SoundThe sound is always 100% in your hands in Riff Racer, as it is always determined by your own musical preference. The music playing is always your own choice, and that is 100% the in game sound.So, this is an easy 10 out of 10 as well. It is exactly what you make of it. You are 100% in control of what you hear.VerdictAs a music powered game, Riff Racer shines in every way. Played for hours at a time or a few songs at a time, Riff Racer keeps on giving and giving. You wont ever really tire of the experience Riff Racer provides, and Riff Racer is a game you will continue playing 5 or even 10 years from now. This is what I would consider a must own for any music and/or driving fans out there. Good times will be had aplenty.			"

												I was hesitating on this one since a lot of rhythm type games that generate tracks from user audio files feel kinda bland or else they have the problem of only being fun if you are using EDM tracks with heavy, distinctive beats. I was watching some trailers as well and was hesitating because I couldn't really discern what the game was doing with the tracks that would make them truly feel like you were playing the song.After spending just a short amount of time with it, it's winning me over very fast. It's called Riff Racer, which suggests guitar riffs, which suggests it should be fun with rock music, whereas a lot of music/rhythm games that procedurally generate tracks are not super good with rock tracks. I was super impressed to discover that playing rock tracks in this game feels very satisfying and the game can specifically detect if you are a playing a rock/metal track.As I was playing these rock songs, which don't have the heavy, distinctive beats that EDM tracks have, I kinda started to warm up to the things the game was doing to make you feel like you were playing the song. It was less about individual beats and more about the energy of the song. Placing a speed boost right when the chorus takes off. Dropping a huge ramp right when the song tears into a guitar solo. Shifting the lighting and colors to fiery hot as the song picks up speed and volume. Where Riff Racer lacks at emphasizing the individual beats of a song, it seems to excel at getting the visceral energy of a song just right. Of course I'd advise you to mostly pick out a songs that suit a game about hitting ramps in a fast car.The game has great controller support and the controls are fantastic. The driving feels almost as good as games like Mario Kart or Sonic All-Star Racing Transformed. The drifting takes a bit of getting used to, but its starts to make more sense the more you practice it.It's an arcade racer, so it's all about racking up points. Unlike other rhythm games, which focus on hitting the good objects and dodging the bad objects, Riff Racer does something slightly different. Hitting the good objects instead builds up a boost meter that you can use to trigger a manual boost (in addition to free boosts lying on the track). In order to get the most points, you need to go as fast as possible for as long as possible, hit collectibles, hit ramps (especially at an angle so that you can spiral jump for extra points), and execute long drifts around sharp corners. The faster and fancier you drive without falling off the track, flipping the car, or crashing into things, the more points you'll rack up. It's not just about hitting those beats (although it's that too); it's also about kicking butts.And of course there are global leaderboards, friend leaderboards, personal best, etc. The game comes with a bunch of songs bundled in, and you can use your own. You also gain points for racing tracks, and those points let you unlock new cars and paint jobs. The new cars and paint jobs are merely cosmetic, but it gives you something to work toward if you need that kind of motivation.The only downside to the game is that once you put 4 or 5 hours into it, race all of your favorite rock tracks, then you've pretty much seen the whole tour. You can still go back and score attack, but you're basically racing time trial on tracks that---while very fun---are largely similar, so it starts to get a little samey after a while.Rating the game on the scale below, I give it a hearty 6:7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.			"

Early Access Review
								Drive Any Track is a point to point racer that generates tracks based of your own music collection. While it sits in the same genre as games like Audiosurf, adding the cars with amazing drift handling really allows DAT to hold it's own. Not just a decent music generated game but one of the better arcade racers I've played in some time. Highly addictive and upon first play I was mesmerized by my screen for hours. The King is dead, long live the King.

Gameplay is simple, select a song, choose your car and burn rubber. Tracks are all given a star rating which dictate their difficulty and harder levels generally contained more obstacles and tighter turns.  Provided the song includes an id3 tag your score also gets uploaded to both local and global leaderboards. Tried a wide range of genres from classical through to chiptune and overall music generation was not only quick but produced some wonderful results.  Faster music had more jumps and loops while slower music seemed much more drift based.While there is still plenty to add in future (real-time lighting, skyboxes etc), Graphically speaking it already looks quite tron-like and beautiful. Currently in-game options were slim to none but given the minimalistic nature of the game I would hazard a guess it should run very well on a wide range of systems. Didn't skip a beat scaling up to 4k+ on a single 970. Something that did seem to be missing was a bunch of default music tracks which was a little unfortunate as I'm sure it would help with the competitive side of the game.Most of the features I would like to see included in future are already planned. Such as further control of stunts, improved tracking of stats and additional game modes, cars and environments. With that said DAT contains 12 standard cars (+2 secret), decent selection of liveries and enough change of environment and colour schemes that it stays fresh. The games few downsides like sometimes being stuck on your roof following a dodgy jump, or hurtling round a corner into a badly placed wall are easily outweighed by all the upsides.Overall if you're a fan of music based games or arcade racers such as Ridge Racer, RUSH, Burnout, Daytona or Outrun. DAT is well worth your weekly allowance and has got my stamp of approval. Cheers folks, now back to racing. :]			"

Early Access Review
								So far I'm pretty addicted to this game. My love for music might be an influence. Being able to race to the music on your own PC is really fun and games that do this always grab my attention. DAT is infact a great Early Access title and I've already begun racking up hours played. Even though its an EA title, it has plenty of content to enjoy right now. Unlock cars by leveling up or collecting tokens and buying them. You can also change the paint scheme on any of them with a few tokens as well. The gameplay's difficulty depends on the song you play. If you play something really slow and soft, you're gonna have an easy track but switch it over to something more upbeat and fast and you'll find a real challenge. On the track you'll find 2 types of pickups. The boxy one fills up your boost and the coin looking ones are for spending in the garage on cars and paintjobs. The purpose of the game is to stay up with the first line of synchonization. I believe there are 4 total and if you fall behind, you will be resynced. If you have friends that own the game you can race against their ghosts if you want and try to get better times on the songs they have played but I'm pretty sure you have to own the song yourself. The store lists the game with multiplayer as well. Unfortunately I have yet to get to try this since I'm playing before release, I will update this review with info on multiplayer once I get to try it.There are also leaderboards but the song you play must have an ID3 tag on it if you wish for the game to keep your score and place it on the leaderboards. (An ID3 tag is a little scrap of data added to the beginning or end of the MP3 file which stores information about the audio recording including the title, artist, album, copyright date, and musical genre.) I'm assuming this is how they keep track of the leaderboard scores. If you have music without a tag you can always get something like MP3Info, a great utility that adds ID3 tags and customizing to files. All in all I would say this game has great potential and recommend it to anyone who loves driving games and music.

Early Access Review
								This is one of those games that you will spend way too much time on.""1.2 hrs on record"" WHAT I JUST BOUGHT IT LIKE FIVE SECONDS AGO...I thought.What can I say? Riff Racer is based on the Audiosurf premise, except it's a real racing game.You also become a celebrity for being the first to play a song. So that's cool and all.It's also worth noting that it's practically impossible to play without a controller. I used an Xbox 360 Chrome Series controller, and it worked great. I would imagine that the game is much easier to play with an Xbox ONE controller, or maybe just a controller that *hasn't* had Diet Coke spilled all over it.Buy this game if you like music and racing games. Or, if you like racing games and you liked Audiosurf.Update: Why did you feel the need to change the menu system? The old static background and the audio track were so simplistic, which just felt right for this game.Also, seriously, you changed all of the car skins, and now I don't own a single one.To be fair, I bought it during early access, and I should have seen that coming. Still, though. Kinda annoying. "

												The game has a great concept, and it is indeed fun to drive around the twisted tracks, but this fun wears out too fast because of several reasons:1. Too Easy - Even when playing tracks than in other music-based games generated challenging levels, here barely any was present.2. Doesn't reflect music - Many times the music feels like background music, rather than the essence of the track.3. Little content - I was hoping for unlocks that increased intensity or added new gameplay mechanics, but all there is to it is grab blocks, drift around tight turns and don't miss the jumps.In the other side, the visuals are quite nice.

Do you like music?Yeah, me too!But, if you're like me, you hate just listening to music. You know, when you really just want to chill with your favorite songs, but not study, work, or read while you do it.You just want to chill. .....but, you feel like you're wasting time if you're just sitting there, doing nothing while you listen.This is where Riff Racer comes in.-----------------Now you can chill and enjoy your music, but without that feeling of idleness.Whether you're: ---Wandering a long, winding ambient tune, ---Navigating a bending, twisting jazz piece, or Traversing a plunging, rolling dubstep jam,It's relaxing, it's fun, and you'll find yourself hooked on it. -----------------I'll admit, Riff Racer is nothing special if you look at it purely as a driving/racing game, because that's not what it is.It's a tool that lets you experience music in a whole new perspective.Seeing the beat.....Feeling the flow.....That is what makes this game great.

												Just picked this game up on steam for a bit of a muck around. I have never been so impressed with a game under 20 dollars. Loads up a track based on a song you put into it in about 10 seconds, and that track (if you choose the right songs) is almost always perfectly reflective of the song. Great to see what other people are racing to in the charts menu as well! You guys have done an awesome job with this game!			"

Riff RacerDeveloper: FOAM EntertainmentPublisher: FOAM EntertainmentIntroduction==========It's not often that I take interest in a game that even remotely resembles a racing game. However, Riff Racer is one of the extremely rare exceptions. Using your own music (or the included bundle of 25 songs) to generate racetracks, Riff Racer has you racing the music itself to earn points and coins. Your experience depends entirely on YOU and what music you load up into the game.Gameplay==========Riff Racer creates racetracks based on the songs in your music library. When you boot up the game you can direct the game to any folder on your PC with music in it and have it generate a special track specific to that song. All the different verses, choruses, drops, and more are styled to the music you load and become checkpoints.  Even the car you drive shares some characteristics of the music. The point of the game is to stay in time with the music and score as many points as you can. Staying in sync offers a 4x modifier, while being ahead offers a 10x modifier. If you fall behind, either by not using boosts or hitting obstacles, your modifier drops until you can catch back up with the music. Each track you load has a 1 to 5 star rating. The more stars, the more obstacles you'll face on the track. As you race on each track, you'll run into barriers, jumps, and pits that may impede you. There's also these small white cubes that fill up your boost meter. Collect 10 of these to get a boost at the press of a button. There's also coins to collect that are used to buy different cars and paint jobs for them. The points you earn go towards increasing your Driver Level. All this does, as far as I know, is show how much you've played the game. I've not seen or found any benefit to having a higher Driver Level.Graphics==========This game is pretty psychadelic. Sounds and colors everywhere, just blaring and blinking in time with the music. Mostly various shades of red and yellow, but it honestly looks pretty awesome. The backgrounds look pretty cool, as well as the buildings and structures you'll ride past. A small detail I noticed that's probably really obvious is that your modifier and your boost meter are shown on the back of your car. As your modifier goes up, your car will crackle with energy.Sound and Music==========The music depends on you. Play using your favorite songs for maximum enjoyment! I like video game music, so the vast majority of the songs I played are from some of my favorite video games. The gameplay demo videos below feature a Mega Man X remix and a track from Ys VI.Performance==========Riff Racer ran nigh perfectly on my custom rig. No FPS drops, played at 60+ FPS at nearly all times (dropping ever so slightly during Super Sync and Boosting), and no stuttering. I played mostly with my controller, but it's easy enough to play with a keyboard if you don't have a controller. You just have to steer and hit the boost key...simple enough right?Final Thoughts==========This is an awesome racer, even moreso if you play with your favorite tracks! Pretty much anyone can enjoy Riff Racer. You can tailor the game to your liking with different songs and car customization. If you get the chance to buy this game, I urge you to pick it up...especially if it's on sale.Gameplay Demo==========

												This is a fun, inventive, and interesting way to enjoy your music. If you like music and you like gaming, buy this.However, I want to address some concerns that negative reviews bring up:1) To those who say the game is too easy, I must insist you post higher scores than me on the same songs. This is why a leaderboard system exists. I will happily send you an mp3 gift of any song of your choosing, and then we can decide together if the game is too easy for you.2) I disagree that the specific song doesn't affect the track or gameplay significantly. The music isn't merely ""background."" In my experience, a song's crescendos, breakdowns, drops, and even minor variations result in loops, jumps, curves, and other set pieces. I can't imagine how one could miss this connection, but everyone is entitled their experience. Maybe my music is just more fun to drive.3) It's true that there isn't a ton of ""unlockable"" content. How could there be? This game is limited only by your music library. Yes, you can unlock new cars that only differ in appearance, and that's all there is to it. Would you really want the devs to artificially limit the manuverability of your car at the outset just to give you a false sense of progression?One of the most popular rhythm games of all time, Dance Dance Revolution, contained unlocks. What did they give you? New songs, new characters. This game gives you all of the songs in the world as tracks, but you can purchase a handful of cosmetic upgrades with the coins you collect from racing. It's not intended to be a deep experience nor should it be.4) If you don't have a gamepad, don't buy a racing game  on PC and expect keyboard buttons to have the same degree of control as an analog stick. That's the entire point of analog sticks.Honestly, I don't know what some people were expecting when they bought this. It's a racing game that builds racing tracks from your music.

Early Access Review
								Very good music driven game, fun and addictive. I'm a big fan of music games, this would be my 2nd top music game, Beat Hazard being my first and Audio Surf my 3rd.+Pros           Very satisfying fast and fluid gameplay.            Lots of replayability via leaderboards and unlocks.            Has the best soundtrack ever! -Cons            I think the price is too high but subject to change my opinion due to being earley access.             Very slow development.			"

												A simple, yet fun and addictive game.  I definitely recommend Riff Racer if you like to relax and have some fun while listening to your favorite music. What really appeals to me is that you can use music from your own library and it generates a different track for each song. As you progress, you can unlock several cars and paintjobs.  Leaderboards are created for each song once someone has used them for the first time, and even though you don't have live multiplayer, you can race against a ghost car of top scoring racers, or your own high score.  One thing I would like to see is more variety to the colors and effects of the tracks. It does change depending on the type of music you use, but there isn't much variety, and sometimes the blur when you boost can be hard on the eyes.Also, while the tracks are generated based on the song used, it doesn't really feel like it for the most part. Occasionally, the track does seem to match the music quite well. But most of the time, at least with the music I have used, it just feels like you are racing with your song as background music.Even though I see some room for improvement, this game gets a big ""thumbs up"" from me, and I can see myself putting many hours into just relaxing and playing along to my favorite music.

												Edit: Disclosure: After some time making this review, I have worked on the game in a minor way.I don't think it affects this review but disclosing it to avoid confusion.This game is the glorified personification of what happened in my brain when I was 18 years old and drove my -87 Ford Fiesta in a forest road with thight bends with Dragonforce - Through the fire and flames at full volume. The pedigree of the game shows clearly, the roots of Wipeout are there in a very good way both in graphics and gameplay (Cannot say for other games mentioned as inspiration as I have not played those). Even though the game is still in alpha/beta/early, it's got replayability for years already. It does have few missing features, most obvious ones are the inadequate Options, incomplete gamepad support and some very minor graphical issue/feature that makes it difficult to see barriers when going very fast. To my knowledge, older gamepads don't work but apparently devs are working on it.			"

Early Access Review
								The concept of this game is pretty fun. It's rare to see a music game where you're quite literally competing against the music. This game's got a lot of potential, and I'm already enjoying it more than games like Audiosurf. However, since it's Early Access (and it's only been out for one day) it's pretty rough around the edges. Sometimes the game will generate a huge jump right before a sharp turn, or create a barrier around a corner that you could never hope to see in time. Things like these can ruin your score, and it's the game's fault rather than your lack of skill. I've also clipped straight through the track more than once, and sometimes when you come out of a drift your car has a tendency to overcorrect itself and careen into a wall (tough cookies if this happens right before an ill-timed jump). I know it's an early access game, and I know there's no such thing as a bug free game, but these problems are the things they really need to iron out first.When the game works, I can't stress how much fun it is. It's certainly in a playable state, and it can only get better from here. I say go ahead and pick it up now before the price increases over time as the game gets fleshed out.			"

  Feature Details Score  Gameplay A great choice if you specifically want to drive, drift and jump in actual cars to your music. 3/5  Car Handling It still feels floaty, like there's input lag. By default the car accelerates itself, but I don't think switching to manual would help. There is input lag. The drifting is excellent. 2/5 Graphics They are just about acceptable. Very basic models and skins. It's not distractingly bad when playing though. 2/5 Settings Very poor. You still have to listen to bad main menu music in a constant loop. Very basic settings. 1/5 Music Sync It's pretty great. Each track feels distinct and fun, with only a few exceptions. 4/5 Progression One of the few music games with a progression system. Earn coins to buy cars and skins, with bonuses for beating player ghosts or being the first to play a track. 5/5 Online Connectivity You can race with the ghost of a player, who will have their actual car and skin. Leaderboard system is okay. The new charts system looks bad. 3/5Songs tested:Feed Me - Death by RobotRJD2 - GhostwriterPentakill - LightbringerBo Burnham - SadToby Fox - Spear of JusticeDoctor P - Flying Spaghetti Monster			"

												Riff Racer, previously called Drive Any Track, is basically Audiosurf without the match-3 puzzles. You load up a song from your hard drive, and the game generates a unique track for you to drive through, letting you compete for high scores with anyone else who's played the same track. The controls and presentation are simply sublime. Racing feels like F-Zero with its high speeds and crazy jumps; you really have to pay attention to the shape of the upcoming track if you don't want to wipe out. The smooth animation and futuristic visual style is wickedly awesome as well.Your score is mostly based on the stunts you perform; you get points for the length of each jump, double points for performing a mid-air roll, points for drifting around corners, and points for collecting crates. You lose points for hitting barriers, falling off the track, or flipping the car over. Additionally, if you start falling behind the song, your multiplier will diminish, and if you boost ahead of the song, you’ll get awarded with a whopping 10x multiplier. You can’t stay ahead of the song forever, so you’ll have to use your boosts strategically, not unlike star power in Guitar Hero games. Also interesting is that drifting won’t award points unless you’re actually driving around a corner – no fish-tailing exploits allowed.Although there's only a half-dozen game elements such as jump pads, boost pads, and collectables, the game succeeds in making every track feel like a unique experience – if you’re competing for a high score, you'll find that each track has its own distinct personality traits that you'll have to learn intimately. The track generator also takes some reasonable precautions to make sure you can see obstacles coming -- for instance, it zooms out the camera on loop-de-loops if there are barriers on the track, and it doesn't place barriers right after the peak of a hill. It demonstrates some impressive attention to detail, and makes casual play surprisingly relaxing and cathartic. There are exceptions, of course; you're bound to run into some surprising jumps and tricky turns, but half the fun of these kinds of games is memorizing your favorite tracks so that you can outscore the competition with the help of foresight. There's no difficulty toggle. However, some songs will be harder than others, denoted with a difficulty rating from one to five stars. If you want to find the most difficult songs, you'll have to hunt for them.The coolest feature of the game is being able to race against ghosts of other players. Oddly, the game doesn’t actually involve much “racing”; the only thing that matters is score, not your position on the track. Also weird is how you can’t race against any ghost you want, but only a predetermined list of 1-4 people who have beaten your high score (unless you hold the world record on a game, in which case you’ll be able to race against your own ghost and the ghost of the 2nd place holder).I give Riff Racer 8.8 / 10. This tops Beat Hazard as my favorite ""media player"" game to date. My only gripes have to do with some elements of the GUI; I wish the song selector were better, I wish you’d have more options of ghosts to race against. I wish you could see your boost meter and the ghost's score on the HUD without having to look at the cars themselves. It also wouldn’t hurt to see a few more game elements added to races. But overall, it fantastically does what these types of games are supposed to do: make you feel like you’re really getting into your favorite music. The final achievement is quite grindy, but I actually don’t mind, since I can see myself playing this game for a very long time. Well done. I'm not a big fan of Early Access myself, but you can mark this down as an Early Access success story.			"

But now i just want to tell you one thing: This game made me actually feel music again, i listened to music again like i did when i was about 10, sitting in my room with nothing but a pair of headphones and cassette tape player. Probably because i actually had to focus on the music.Soon after the first few songs i got into a trance like state just watching and listening.This got way more than a simple and fun racing game for me!Thanks for reading.

												Let's face it, you're probably only thinking of buying this so you can live out your Initial D fantasies. If you are, you won't be disappointed. This game sure does deliver. Probably one of the most enjoyable ride your music type games I've ever played.Lots of fun on pretty much any high BPM song you can stick in it, can get a bit boring on lower BPM ones though. My Bloody Valentine songs end up disappointingly tamed in this, but eurobeat songs end up being really fun with lots of dorifto corners.The drifting is a fun mechanic, it reminds me of the drifting in Burnout Paradise. If you liked the drifting in that, you'll like it in here. The handling on the car can feel a bit floaty at first but once you get used to it you'll forget it was ever even floaty. A single minor complaint is that some of the obstacles you encounter on tracks can be a bit hard to spot sometimes, resulting in some frustration. But this is relatively rare, and if you're the type of person to care about score you're going to learn the song route in a couple of tries anyway so it's not exactly a big deal.In conclusion, it's really good. Lots of replay value and the drifting is very fun.			"

								Whether it's cruising to ambient stuff, launching yourself off ramps when it gets intense or just drifting all over. This game has it all. Only problem is that it can't seem to figure out what genre my song is. Played Mozart's Rondo alla Turca and the game gave me an achievement for playing a Hip-Hop/Urban song.Aside from that though, I like it.			"

Early Access Review
								As a Fan of Beat Hazard (Another Music Based Game) I saw this game and had to give it a try, I have almost 3 hours of gameplay into DAT, theses are my thoughts...   Gameplay  The Gameplay consists of you racing on custom tracks, hitting jumps, drifting around corners and avoiding barriers that slow you down while you try to stay in sync with your song, fall behind can result in you getting out of sync and losing the chance of getting a 100% synchronization on the song you are playing. There are currently 3 things I noticed you collect as you race, that is a 10 tokens (the currency), boxes that fill your boost and give you additional points to your total point score and a separate boosters icon that gives you a boost as soon as you touch it, keep in mind that this booster icon doesn't take away the progress of you filling your boost from you collecting the boxes, it is its own separate boost. This makes me think of the midnight club la's slipstreaming, you can build up the slipstreaming and use it, that way you don't use a nitrous bar, but you still get a boost. The Performance Optimization  is solid, constant 60 fps through gameplay with i5 3570k and gtx 760, The Recommended Requirements are pretty low, and I am impressed by that. A Intel Core 2 Duo and a Geforce 8000 series are pretty old components to run a game like this. But this makes this game playable for more people, so that is a good thing.  Song difficulty Rating System  needs some work I think, for example I played a song by the uk power metal/speed metal band ""Dragonforce"" and these guys make a bunch of songs with intense guitars solos, and their tempo of their songs are just fast and the game only rated this Dragonforce Song a 1 star out of 5 star and then I played the Nickelback song ""When We Stand Together"" and apparently that song is rated 5/5, so I don't know how it's rating system works, it must work in a way that I don't understand or it's just not very accurate in this Alpha build of DAT . There are other songs that I played that I felt didn't match what I would rate the song in difficulty based on the tempo of the song, etc. but as example of a song that I thought it did well in rating is ""Beneath The Tides"" by Ravenface, this song has a pretty fast tempo to it also, and the game rated it a 4/5 and I thought that was fitting and the Track Generation for this song was solid, lots of jumps, dips, and long corners to drift around (I got a 38 beat drift on the one part of the track and I freaked out haha) I found it a very fun song to race on, While on the Subject of Track Generation, let's talk about that next.  Track Generation  it's kind of decent for it being in alpha currently, it can do what I think is a good job generating to match a certain part of a song, but then in some songs, I will be questioning ""why did you generate (this part) of the track?"" but it is in alpha, so I am not expecting this to be perfect, but I feel it still does good for the most part, but might be because I just like hitting the jumps and drifting and the driving style of this game in general... Speaking of jumps and drifting and just the overall handling of the cars... let's talk about handling.  Handling of Cars  The handling of the cars are excellent in my opinion, the drifting is nice and you can really control your drifting which I really like. The Inferno Car is currently my favorite Car.     Ranking System   there is a ranking system in this game, it's seems to be pretty basic from what I noticed so far, you just get points from doing songs, and thus your points add up to level you up , the current reward that I noticed so far is some of the tokens in the game to buy paint jobs for your cars, which there are 2 paint jobs for each of the 7 cars of 15 or so cars total that I have unlocked so far.To Summarize+Fun+ Solid Gameplay=Decent Track Generation+Excellent FPS (solid 60 fps) / Low System Requirements- Song Difficulty Rating system needs a little work for some songs/genres+ Excellent Car Handling/Drifting= Ranking System is Basic, but Solid for this gameOverall 8.5/10			"

								Bought this on a weekly sale, worth the cost I would say. It's a nice, relaxing game that is described best by its own title, you can pick songs from your music library and just, drive on them.My only real quarrel with the game right now is that at times, the system the game uses to determine the speed and difficulty of tracks is a little shaky. A relatively slow, acoustic-driven Porcupine Tree song (Pure Narcotic) was almost as hectic to drive on as a fast-paced Protest the Hero song (Tongue-Splitter), for example. When this gets fixed it's bound to be a lot more exciting - the illusion of speed on a ballad is kind of dumb and immersion-breaking, but maybe I'm just being overly pretentious.			"

												I refunded the game because of a couple of reasons.1. It destroyed the audio quality of my existing FLAC or 320 kbps MP3 library when being played through the game somehow, I have an studio level sound-card for production (EDM Prod and Mastering/Sound enginering and Audio Technica M50s and I could tell right away that there was some major bit-crushing to my audio, deal breaker for me.2. While the tracks are generated based of you're music its hit or miss on how much the track actually reflects the elements of the song you choose, many times the track does not reflect the tempo, tried DNB, Dubstep, Rock, Rap, millage may vary throughout you're choices.3. Graphic options are very limited.4. Unlike Audio Surf 1 the tracks in this game have many sharp turns which sounds great except there are constantly roadblocks around corners that you have no way of knowing are there until you turn said sharp corner and it's too late thus interrupting flow and ""sync"" to the game, this is poor design imo.TL;DR Great idea, Poor implementation.

								I'm a huge ♥♥♥♥ing sucker for music generated games meaning games that make levels based on the mp3 files you choose from your computer.I played Audiosurf, Audiosurf 2, Beat Hazard, Symphony and Crypt of the Necrodancer. Drive Any Track is definitely one of the best music generated games in my opinion. If you played Audiosurf -- I'm guessing most people who look at this page have played that -- just imagine that but you control your vehicle like a car of a racing game (including drifting, jumping, stunting, crashing) and instead of collecting right colored blocks this is just about driving perfectly through the course. The faster you go, the more points you get.You can play against the ghosts of other players, which is really good. And the overall gameplay makes for some really intense or relaxing gaming, dependent on what music you're in the mood for.The song analyzing is very solid. Sure it's not perfect, but what games song analyzer is? But since DAT has more stuff and obstacles that match up to the music it feels more satisfying than Audiosurf ever did. And all of this is just the early access version. There is a lot to add or improve here but as it is it's already an extremely fun game. And the creators of the game seem very well organized and take this stuff serious, so I'm very confident they will pull through what they promise (which for example is live multiplayer until DATs full release sometime in october). I just hope more people will play this awesome game so I have more ghosts to race against and more highscores to beat!			"

												Must be the music I like, since even the slow music sometimes throws me off the track with ramp after ramp after ramp.  That being said ...This is a great game.  It's quite enjoyable to run the tracks trying to get a decent score while listening to music you enjoy.Most of my music is two stars, with a few three stars, and I've had a few pop up as four stars.  I've yet to see a five star song from my music ...  Maybe I should be careful what I ask for, as four star songs are pretty wild!The way you get points is by doing stunts.  You keep ahead of the first bar for maximum points.  Just driving doesn't get you anything, although you can use periods where you need to just drive to collect coins (for buying different cars and skins) and boost pack thingies (that you can use to activate your own boost whenever you want ... provided you've collected enough of them).You always take about the same amount of time to make it through the track, so to get points you do stunts.  You run over ramps, getting as much air time as possible.  To get more points, you hit the ramps so the car spins ... but this comes with a number of issues that really justifies the extra score.  For instance, if you hit the ramp wrong, it's possible to land on your roof, or be flung from the map altogether!  So be very very very careful jumping, especially if you plan on doing the high scoring spins!You also get points by drifting.  I suppose this can be abused, but whenever I've used drifting unnecessarily, I've always bounced off the walls.  Great way to fall behind, thus losing points!When you use the boost, it helps you get caught up, or you can use it just before a series of jumps to get ahead of the bar, increasing your point yield.  I'm the sort who tries to get more bang for my buck, so I always try to optimize when I use it.  But I rarely play the same track twice in a row, so it's always something of a gamble for me.If you play the same track over a few times to get the highest score you can, you won't have to wait for it to rebuild the track.  But if you go to another track, then come back to the first one, you'll have to wait for it to be rebuilt.  There's a ""tip"" that says that ""you only have to wait the first time you play the track,"" but this is not entirely true.  It is only true if you play the track repeatedly, a few times in a row.Also, there are barriers on the road.  If bouncing off the walls, landing upside down after a trick jump, or flying clean off the road, aren't enough reasons to set you back, they stuck barriers on the road that will slow you down quite a bit.  Since you need to keep ahead of the first line to optimize your scoring, this can be quite a problem!You also lose points for every barrier you hit, so it's a good idea to avoid them for more than one reason.It can play m4a files, but not aac files.  Not a terribly large issue, just something to be aware of.  I do not know what other files it can play, as my library seems to be a mix of m4a and aac files.On difficulty:1 star - Very casual.  I think I've seen only one or two of these songs.  Maybe the Beehtoven one I played was one?  I don't recall.2 star - Casual.  This is where most of my music lands.  It actually has quite a diverse range of difficulty in this range.3 star - Normal.  You really have to start using all the tools it gives you to keep up here.  It can sometimes be pretty wild.4 star - Hard.  It's beginning to get wild here.  I've had about half a dozen of my tracks come up like this.  It leaves me crying with laughter at every surprise twist and turn it gives me, and it's hard to make normal jumps ... let alone the high point yield twisters, here!5 star - Insanity?  I've yet to see a song this hard, but I'm pretty sure most people would be falling off the track quite a bit here.  The maps may even be nearly unplayable!I generally listen to Indie music.  I look at the top tracks, and I don't see anything I actually have in my library on them, so I guess I can not race against the ""most popular"" track leaders.  In point of fact, it's pretty rare for me to play a track anyone else has played, so maybe I have it a bit easier than most people who play the game getting coins.			"

								It's not a sophisticated racer, and the gameplay has less to do, moment-to-moment, with the music than in a game like Audiosurf, but it's a very satisfying fusion of the two concepts. The racing feels nice! And it's fun to do it on tracks generated by your music!			"

												Recklessly driving at full speed to the tunes that makes your heart sing whilst being in sync with your surroundings. What isn’t fun about that?I try every procedurally generated music game I can get my hands on and although this may not hands down be the best one I have played, It’s most definitely not the worst. Music is one of those things that everybody likes as it is. These kinds of games make your chest race and gets your blood flowing. You can use whatever music speaks to you that you have downloaded to your PC to customize your game to your liking.I love that about this genre. Although I have only taken a half hour spin on this as of right now, I can already tell by how I felt playing a few of my favourite more racier songs that this is a fun game. I certainly plan on spending some more time on this.Each song is a separate level and can you even fight for a place on the scoreboard for that particular song. You can see where you rank amongst your friends and you even have the option before the race starts, to race against the ghost of either the big #1 for that song or a player that the game recommends for you to try and beat. Although the game is marked as a multi-player game, as far as I can tell that is as close as you get to multi-player.I initially tried playing with keyboard and mouse and did horribly, so swiftly switched to controller. I would definitely recommend you use a controller for this as it’s much easier to control, so much easier to get engrossed into.Looking at the trailer, I can admit that first off I thought it looked easy and I didn’t really see what the car mechanic could bring to the game. As this game is essentially Audiosurf with a car. But I have to admit that after playing it that it definitely isn’t as easy as it looks and that it’s actually fun having that thrill of driving (even if it is in a game) and having more control over what path you take. If you have the same or similar doubts, do what I did and just think that maybe it’s one of those games that is more fun to play than to watch. The graphics add to the atmosphere of the game immensely. For the most part, it’s dark and contrasted with bright colours. It gives it a night-life/ Tron kind of feeling which makes it to be quite a fun and surreal arcade-like game. All around I like this game. I think it’s definitely worth trying.TL;DR : It’s fun, the graphics are nice, it’s exciting and it’s generally a worth while game. If you like driving games and/or music driven games then this is definitely one for the collection.			"

								Drive Any Track (DAT) is a fabulous game but only if you have lots of different types of music on your computer. So if you have things that you got legally (your progress is not recognized if you have an illegal copy) then this game will be very fun. Although, there are 10ish pre-installed tracks.The game finds the tempo of your music from an online service and creates a track with varying difficulty. Tempos from 100 bpm to 200 bpm are the standard. if its less than 100 then it would be counted as 0 being 100. So if you have  a song with a bpm of 50 then it'll be seen as 150 bpm. It is the same with 200+. If your music is 275 then it'll be seen as 175.Every track has its own leaderboard you can use to compete with yourself or with other people who have the same copy of the song you have. If you select to compete with the person in the next slot, the global leader, or one of your friends then there would be a ghost you 'race' against.The actual racing part of this game is weird. The goal is not to be at the finish first but to have the most points at the end. The best way to get points is race the apex, jump from the highest point you can, drift as much as possible, and stay in the 4x or the 10x point area.There are multiple cars you can race with but they all have the same stats except for the hit boxes.

												To put this review into some context, I would not by any means dare to call my self a driving game vetrean or say that I play driving games regualrly. Nonetheless I have mixed feelings about this pretty looking, arcade style music based driving game.First, what the game does well.I will say that the art style and visual aestetic is very pleasing to look at. The use of bright vivid colours against a dark road gives me flashbacks of similar tron-inspired games. The UI isn't so distracting that it ever affected my performance but an option to toggle them on or off would have been appreciated(So far the options only seem to allow for changes in resolution, volume and mapping keys)The Musical Enviroment Gaming Algorithm( or MEGA) is perhaps the games main selling point here. The game allows you to race on tracks that are designed around music chosen. You can select either music from the game or from your own music files you may have on your computer. Whenever you choose a song, a track is genreated based on the high/low pitches in music, use of cymbals or high-hats or where the bass might drop. While the game is able to generate these levels fairly well, for the most part I would experince the loud cresendo of a song while racing down a mostly empty stretch of road before the next ramo would appear several beats too late. That being said, the satisfaction of landing a jump off a ramp in time with a song beat is something that just feels undenaibly good.What the Game doesn't do so well...Remember when I said I had little experince with driving games earlier, with that in mind I personally distaste how the cars handle. Bearing in mind I'm playing on keyboard and mouse, the cars always seem to turn either too much or to little. I might try to turn around a bend but try and avoid on oncoming  barrier only to overcorrect the turn and smash into the wall. And drifting...Maybe it's just because I can't drift for ♥♥♥♥ but any attempt made only ever seems to result in collision with a wall whether I inteded to or not.Also, you know how peveryone who played Mario Kart pretty much hated playing Rainbow Road, well the same flaws can be seen here. At any given ramp, should it be approached at too steep an angle because you overcorrected, you will fall off the ramp entirely and slowly spawn back onto the track. While I wouldn't mind on any other racing game, the use of twisting roads and ramps meaning it occurs more often than I would like.With all that being said, I would say that while this game is probably not for me, I do think this is worth the discounted £8.24 price I paid to race against any of my music(None of which the game needs to liecence). The use of MEGA is something I appreaciate but I wish it was used in a more traditional Rthymn game rather than a less predictable arcade style racing game.Hopefully I may findone in the future.The game is good on the eyes and ears but feels too off for me.  If you enjoy arcade style racing games, you'll probably like this more than I will. Hope you enjoy.			"

 My Honest Review: Drive Any Track - 15/07/08
IntroI've always been fascinated by games that take audio/music and create unique tracks based on the highs and lows of songs. Audiosurf and its sequel have been long-time favorites for me. However, there was always something missing. There isn't a large amount of control you can give as you glide across a track to your favorite music.That's where Drive Any Track comes in. It improves upon that concept by giving you much more control over what you do on that track. You see that sharp turn over there? Yeeeeaaaaah... you can friggin' drift around that like a pro racer. What about that jump? Evil Knievel that as you sing along to the song. You have more control over how you literally drive the song.GameplayThe gameplay is a mixture of avoiding obstacles, collecting boxes for points/boost, collecting tokens for in-game customization, jumping off ramps (and landing them) all while staying in sync with the song you are playing. If you hit a barricade? You're going to lose some speed and possibly lose sync. Fail a jump? You might as well restart if you want that 100% bonus.As you finish songs to completion, you are given a place on the leaderboard for that song. If you were the first one to play that song, you are credited with being the track creator. Additionally, you are given XP for completing the song, which levels you up (which unlocks cars). The tokens you gathered throughout the songs can be used to buy paint-jobs for the cars you own.The game is essentially simple, which is to be expected of Early Access. Hopefully the developer adds some more game modes and spices up track generation.  Graphics/Sounds/Controls The game has simple graphics that allow the game to be played on a majority of low-end computers. The game is more focused on using simple, abstract and vibrant colors and lights to give the game more of an arcade-y feel that allows the game to portray different genres. I have not run into any performance issues as of yet.Sounds are entirely based on the quality of the audio file you are using. I recommend using the highest quality file to ensure the best listening pleasure.I have not used anything other than a keyboard for this game, so my experience in controllers or gamepads is non-existent. I can say that the games controls are simple and easy to learn. Playing on the keyboard is very useable as well. No need for controllers. Replayability The game's replayability is entirely dependant on the size of your music library. However, there are some problems where some songs will be given the wrong difficulty. Also, while every song has a unique track, it may get monotonous. The lack of different modes leave things to be desired. Overall The game is really good, it has massive potential. We just need some more modes to spice things up and increase replayability.+Very Enjoyable+Replayability based on music library+Simple graphics that fit the game+Addicting+Has a lot of potential+Leaderboard+Levels/Progress is recorded+Not many glitches/bugs+Steam Cloud+Developer IS ALIVE!/ Not that much customization (may change)/ Level cap prevents progress past 20 (may change)/ Track algorithm sometimes label songs incorrectly and give incorrect difficulties-Lack of variety in obstacles and jumps-Graphic options consist of only changing resolution-I suck at making reviews			"

								As always, I love games that lets you use your own music do the honors of designing the way its played, based on the type of music. There are some bits and pieces that could be useful in making this game better:-The track preview should show ALL the barricades as well as just the ramps. It can help other players expect the unexpected to aid them in getting HUGE scores.-Once you finish a track, you may notice your car falls through the track over and over again. Quite a funny bug. xDI may update this if I find more bugs (or seen them get fixed) in the future.(Want a 5-star difficulty track? Try Madeon - Finale. First 5-star I have ever found. O_O)			"

								So, after a few tracks, heres a little First Look review of DATOn first glance you might say that this game seems a lot like audiosurf, just with an actual car instead of a polygonal glider.And Mono Mode only.Well, let me tell you - its not. While audiosurf is pretty much always straight ahead on 3 lanes, this right here is an actual racing game.Now, steering-wise the game is as simple as it gets. Left and right steer, Brake and gas arent needed, that does the game for you, CTRL is a handbrake for drifting and Space activates a Boost. Thats it.Your goal is to run a racetrack made from one of your songs and rack up as high of a score as you can. To do that you have to ""stay in Sync"" as the game tells you.Before you runs a visible line, thats where the track is right now on the race track. YOu can stay in a measure of 4 bars behind it to be in Synch and get the optimal amount of points for your tricks. if you fall more than 4 bars behind, you lose a multiplicator until you are at least 7 bars behind, where the game will set you back on track (with a respawn phase where you dont get any points. same for when you fly off the track)If you manage to overtake the Synch line, you enter a Supersynched mode where you amass more points but your speed and boost is slightly dampened, so you cant stay up there forever.Now, to get said points you just have to drive (a few points each measure of 4 beats), Jump (either by ramps on the track or by gaps in the track itself) Roll (same as jump - slightly tilted ramps or after Corkscrew Boosts) and Drift (by Using CTRL). After finishing a track you get some Boni depending on how good your driving was.Now what do I think? As someone who is pretty much terrible at racing games, I must say it is fun, plays pretty simple and even on Songs rated 4 Stars (out of 5) I managed to stay ""in Sync"" 60% of the time. Control is responsive, riding your tracks and experiencing your music completely different (again) feels nice and the Ghosting Modes (Race the world leader, the best ranked friend or a recommended random driver for a track) are fun too. Also, the mechanic of ""discovering"" tracks, by being the first player worldwide who has ever played that song gives the game a nice way of saying ""Good job that you listen to different music!"" However, Songs have to be IDE3 taggedto be accepted as discovered.As much as I like the game, It does have some flaws - sometimes the levels are built pretty counterproductive - like you get a boost into a long jump onto a sharp turn or you corkscrew a good 20 meters left to the track, sometimes when you resync you getdropped into a hole or a wall and lose more time and progress and its not really appearent weather or not you are drifting or if a drift has ended or has been aborted somehow. But since this game is early Acces as of now, it has room upwards.Not that it isnt far up alreadyIf you like racing games and you love music, this right here is a good buy.EDIT: Oh yeah - another little beef I have with this game - it does not save after a track, so when the game unexpectedly crashed I found myself short of the spoils of the previous 6 or 7 races.

												It blows my mind just how well this game builds it's tracks to YOUR tracks. I've run through tracks ranging from Starbomb ( a video game comedy bad with several musical styles ), to Lindsey Stirling ( ""dubstep violin"" ), to metal, to 8 HOURS WORTH of anime opening theme songs. (Don't you judge me! >.<) Every single track is built in such a way that it flows, bounces, and drops to the music, yet at the same time I haven't found an obstacle or jump that I can't avoid with a little fine tuning in future replays. Every blockade, even the ones that seem like bullsh*t the first time you hit them, can usually be seen in the distance while you are coming up to them. The game does occasionally spawn ""trick ramps"" in my experience that you have to avoid, or you will ramp into nothingness because they are placed too early in the road. >.>Fair warning though there are a few physics bugs here and there. There have been multiple tracks where I've managed to gain enough speed (on the default mode of auto acceleration and brakes) with a player activated boost to slam right through a ramp and lose ALL of my speed, ruining that current run. Only once, I've even been able to smash through the road itself and fall off the level, in which case it just respawns you a beat behind as usual. These are things that I have successfully avoided in future replays of the affected track by changing boost timings. TL;DR It's f*ckin awesome. Better than Audiosurf, and the most fun I've had with my own music since Beat Hazard. I come back every single time I get new music to see just what it'll generate for me next. BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!			"

												Ive got it extremely cheap during the seasonal sale, but I'm going to make a refund. I have to say, I enjoy music\rhythm games, Audiosurf is one of my favourite games ever. The RR idea is all great, but the game is so messed up in many ways. It pretends to be a rhythm\music casual racer, but it's neither of them. Those drifts and stunts have very little to do with the music patterns. Those jumps and obstacles might have worked, but they rarely fit the beats, and the controls are mediocre. I think Megarace 1 had been better at car physics and responsiveness. I've played with my XB360 gamepad, and I had to google for the layout, as the menu only shows one for the keyboard. They're not exactly the same(to put it mildly)... And no, you can't remap. As an extra annoyance - by default it installs with the language pack basing on your current region, ignoring the steam language preference. The only way to change it is to look for the 'fix' and jump through some extra hoops.			"

												I like this game. It took me a few hours to really decide whether I do, but I like it.If you come in expecting the racing game equivalent of Beat Hazard.... really, this is not much of a racing game. You never race against other cars, it's all... kind of like a ""time trial"" but with points. By default, you don't even accelerate or brake! If you accept it as ""just imagine if Audiosurf was a car drifting game"", then it's fun.You just steer, boost, and drift (and drift and drift), on these insanely long rollercoaster tracks. Using ramps to jump and roll, avoiding obstacles. Drifting and jumping score points. It's addictive, almost hypnotic.Most of all, it's a new way to enjoy your MP3 collection, and to me, that's worth a lot. :)I do wish this game could connect to the streaming sites, e.g. Spotify, Google Music, Amazon Prime Music, or whatever. There are so many tracks I own but aren't actually downloaded.BTW - I got this at 75% off in a sale and have no regrets. At the full price, however, I may have written this review grumbling about the game needing more features, diversity in track layouts, etc.			"

												Well what can I say? The game is fantastic, I couldn't stop playing it for the first hour I had it. This is easily one of the best music driven games I have ever played. Think of Audiosurf, but on lots of drugs.Pros:Looks nice.Game is very fun, especially on faster songs. My personal favourite being The Rise of Pre-teen Homosexuals by Helblinde. A video of that song being played can be found here:

Runs well. It is controller compatible, which was a must as my old IBM Model M wasn't up to the job to play this well.Cons:The map generation can be a bit wierd sometimes, a couple of songs I had a problem where I would go off a ramp at full speed but fail to land on the other side as the track fell short.The colours do get a bit stale, from what I have seen it is only purple and red, it would be nice if the colours of the track were customisable or had more variety. If there is a way to change it please correct me.Overall the game is great, buy it if you like music driven games.			"

								This game is awesome. I love being able to race to my own music, its awesome. Only downside that needs to be changed, is a tutorial level. Something that explains many of the games components. My best guess is that each bar is one beat behind, because the bars vary in time based on songs. It also mentions that each genre has it's own cars, yet you can play any car in any genre, which makes no sense.			"

												Riff Racer is my new favourite music game - and I'm a huuuge fan of Audiosurf (first one, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ second one). And while in Audiosurf I prefer pushing myself over the edge with concentration and reflexes (hello Ironmode Ninja Mono), with Riff Racer I can just not test my reflexes, but also really enjoy the ride. Weither it's technical death metal, synthwave or hardcore underground hip-hop - Riff Racer shines with all the music you can throw in it. It's just that sometimes difficulty and trickness of race tracks are unpredictable - you expect a real storm and only get a calm and boring track, but sometimes it goes vice versa. But it doesn't really matter, because racing in Riff Racer is really fun and you can enjoy your favourite music in a completely new way. The only addition I would really like to see is an implementation of some records system like Audiosurf has, where you can view the leaderboards, notofications when you've been dethroned, friends scores etc.			"

												Please note that I've purchased this game in a bundle at https://www.bundlestars.com/en/, in the ""Killer Bundle 8"" for  $5.00.If you love music, you'll love this simple indie game.It brings old arcade racing games back, but you can now play your own music with it.I have no complaints about this game. Sure, it may not be the best looking game, but having some of my favorite music in a video game is amazing.Pros - • Supports controller.• Every level changes per song.• Difficulty varies depending on song.• You get to change what song to race to (obvious).• You can compete with leaderboards, even if the game doesn't have the song in their bundle.• Achievements.• Steam cards.• Cosmetics you can work to unlock.Cons - • Can't use music from Soundcloud, Spotify, or YouTube. It has to be on your drive.• Sometimes the controls are weird. I hit walls more than I should.• Is originally $10.This game is simple, and fun.I would definitely recommend if on sale, or if you just want to race to your music.Just for a little more information, here are some songs I've played through my playthrough.The game also does offer it's own music, but I liked to play my music.• Porter Robinson - Lionhearted (feat. Urban Cone)• Porter Robinson - Sad Machine• Fetty Wap - Trap Queen (Kasbo Remix)• EDEN - Hey Ya• Flux Pavilion & Mathew Koma - Emotional (Virtual Riot Remix)• Gazzo - Say (feat.

												I haven't really digged deep into this game, but I think I can give a few useful directions to whoever is looking into it:As a game, Audiosurf is better. Much better. However, its match three mechanics are also a big distraction from the music (to me, anyway), and you mostly go with the rhythm. Riff Racer seems to be at its best when you're using it as a virtual habitat to your music. The biggest problem is that it somewhat limits the kind of music it goes well with. The level do follow the music (contrary to what most people seem to be saying), but not in a beat per beat basis, on my experience. They mostly follow the flow of the music. If you listen to 3minute songs, exclusively, with the standard verse-chorus progression, you won't have as much fun. With longer songs, however, with multiple parts, some faster, some slower, etc., the game creates various different sections of the levels that can be really fun! Most striking is the amount of drifting and ramps you'll find.I prefer this to Audiosurf (at least so far), because the drifting is quite a lot of fun! Audiosurf is simply going left/right. Since I'm not interested in the score maximizing match three in it, I stuck with the monochrome mode, which isn't all that fun. With Riff Racer, controlling the drifting and dodging obstacles is a blast, at times! Now, about its limitation: the game is full of neon, bright colors, futuristic city with looping tracks. I don't really think it fits the blues, or classical music. You may disagree, but that this is mind.Where it shines, though, is with some electronic (retrowave, specifically, as I don't really listen to or know a lot of electronic music artists) music. Perturbator and Dynatron are gateway artists to it. And with this type of music, the game is really, really fun! The driving isn't too distracting, so you can both enjoy the music and have an environment that fits.Honestly, I'd like to see something like this, but with many more different environments, tailored for the different music genres. Maybe I'll try Driving Truck Simulator for some blues/hard rock. This isn't really a review, but a rather confused collection of thoughts. Regardless, hope it's useful!			"

								Do you love music? Do you like rhythm games like Guitar Hero? Audiosurf?Then man you would love this game. Able to turn any song saved on your computer(sadly it can't pull from something like Youtube or Pandora or Last.fm or any internet radio, you must have the file) into a track that you can race, you can experience your music in a new way. Whereas Audiosurf limits you to three lanes that you have to shift between, this game allows you full of control of a car of your choosing, able to drift, jump, roll and drive loops.PROS:-Excellent functionality creating new tracks for songs.-Ability to 'tag' a song by being the first to upload it- your name is attached to the song as it's 'creator'.-Car designs are interesting and likely one for everyone-Active leaderboards(for popular/well known songs, anyway, though more users will bring more activity)-Easy to navigate menus-Pretty good visual design. Each main 'theme'(Rock, Dance, 'Urban', among others) is uniqueCONS:-Leaderboards are currently dominated by people who shove their nose in every possible corner and drift anything available. It needs a serious adjustment to the score system for attempting to take first place to be fun again.-Some songs(I've noticed it particularly badly with some Rock/Metal songs) end up being fairly boring. The algorithm doesn't seem able to read songs without much variance in intensity very well.Overall a very fun game, I picked it up on sale and for the 5$ I paid -extremely- worth it. I'm still playing it and likely will as long as I remember that I have it, it's a ton of fun to load up your favorite songs and drive the tracks that the game creates for you, and people will be attempting to one-up each other on the popular songs until the servers no longer exist, whenever that might be.Definitely worth it if you love music and driving.

								I'm new to Steam and couldn't figure out why my new F710 Logitech controller worked for some games but not this one. I was worried it was due to this game being early access. However, I've figured out my controller and got it to work for this game. And now I love this game! I've been looking for something like this and it is way better than Audiosurf (I tried Audiosurf's demo). I love that I can use my own music, how the game changes to the music and its tempo, love the visuals, and the controls seem very responsive. So far my favorite game to play. I was a big fan of driving/racing games for years and this is perfect for zoning out and having fun.			"

								Haven't been that big of a fan of these song surfer type of games but this pretty much hit the spot. I'd say that the only downside right now that bothered myself in the game is the lack of options for controls but the game is early access and I would be surprised if they add these options as they continue to develop and improve it. I find the game surpisingly pleasant visually.Oh and the drift handling is just phenomenal.			"

												I've only played this for three hours (as of when I wrote this review), and it's already addicting. I love the fact that a new track generates depending on the music that is played. The course faithfully keeps up with the rhythm, if you are quick enough.When you discover a track that has an artist name (there is something else, but I forgot), it will be AUTOMATICALLY uploaded. This is a problem, what if I don't want to upload? I ended up accidentally uploading a sound effect. I hope there will be an option to manually upload things in the future.The courses themselves are actually not too shabby. I like how the courses arrange themselves, the developers programmed this in such a way where I want to keep coming back with frustrating dubstep sounds, just to see how hard it will be. Just TRY doing ""My Hope Will Never Die"", it will be a looooong time to master that course.The controls aren't bad, either. I use a controller, and it works smoothly. There is automatic controls and manual controls, all they do is control whether YOU want to control acelleration, or if the game will automatically go full throttle for you.There are other cars...I think you unlock them by playing specific genres of music, but I'm not too sure. And besides, they're just different cars. no enhancements, or anything.There is a pause button...good.Score: 8/10 the game met every expectation from me, but it wasn't good enough for a perfect score. The game was perfect technically, but the game in general is just an 8. Now is an 8 bad? NO.			"

												Seems like a good concept but the tracks it generates very rarely seem to reflect the music you drop into it.  Its idea of difficulty is to throw unavoidable obstacles in your way.  The super fast snaky tracks are fine, but barriers that only show up when you are literally about to hit them are just bad game design.Ultimately if you want to play a game whilst listening to your music you'd be better off playing something else and playing some music in the background.

Two driving modes, one with pedals for gas and brakes and another that is on rails like Fable: The Journey. First person mode enabled to feel the G Forces! A psychedelic rollercoaster.

												JANUARY 2017 UPDATED OPINION... (original review below this one)After coming back to this game after my initial purchase, I can say -some- of what I wrote in my original review might have sounded harsh. Most of the negatives still stand, but I feel this game is more of a ""hmm, it's ok"" than a downright ""no"". I have to say that ""listening to your favorite music while driving some random track"" is probably how I feel about it. Having a score to beat for one of my favourite bands (SCANDAL) has finally allowed me to appreciate this game more - even if the other guy has totally obliterated any chance I have of getting the best score.I still feel this game would be better if music packs were available to purchase - there is a lot of indie stuff out there, and I'm sure paid DLC would go a good way to making this game ""bigger"". Again, what I originally said in my original review still stands for the most part.END OF NEW OPINION. OLD REVIEW BELOW.Tl;DR - Stay away if you're expecting either a good racing game or good music game - this is neither!Got sucked in to buying this game, expecting more of a rhythm based game, than a ""randomly"" generated track to play from the song I selected. Unfortunately, it's neither a good racing game, nor is it a good music game: you are literally just racing with music in the background, and for most of the songs you try, the track will be fairly unexciting.Pros:• Select any mp3 song from your computer to generate a track• Trippy race-tracks• The cars all handle differentlyCons:• Very small selection of songs to choose from in-game - no songs I've heard of. This begs the question - did I just pay for a song to race-track generator? If so, I am disappointed.• Lacks any sort of story, and no proper levelling system, so it doesn't keep you wanting to play more; the only reason to keep playing more is to unlock more cars and paintjobs.• You're playing a race-track which has no real ""rhythm"" aspect to the game - it's all about doing drifts, keeping speed up, and not hitting walls or obstacles. Take away the music, and you'll realise you're just playing a lack-lustre race - the music only dictates the generation and ""speed"" of the level, not anything else.• The average song you will throw at the game will usually generate a rather boring track, I've found some of the weirder songs to generate better tracks. For example, I tried ""Cherry Bomb"" from Silent Siren, which created a challenging track, but then used a song from F-777 - Chinese Dance Machine, which created a rather tame, boring track. There doesn't seem to be a clear method to how a good race track gets generated.• No real feeling of accomplishment, as it's not like you can directly challenge others to beat your score unless they also have the same song (requires friends who also have this game), and you can't challenge a persons song directly either, you have to link your song first, there is no way to search for songs already played by others.The main thing that has gotten me to keep playing is the experimenting of throwing different songs at this to see how complex I can make the race track, and because I'm a bit of an acheivement hunter, I'll be ""grinding"" to get those cars and acheivements as well.Verdict: A drag to play, grinding for acheivements, no sense of competition/accomplishment. Like I mentioned, it's basically a race track generator without the real fun of a good racing game. Basically boils down to a zen-game in a way because of it. Not recommended unless the devs pull finger and integrate some sort of challenges that people can strive for, to give them reason to keep playing.			"

								Update 4/4/16 Reflecting on some of the changes made to the game I still really enjoy it, the option for manual acceleration si more than welcome and gives you a greater feel of control, thumbs up there.Also I see tweaks made which make the tracks and obstacles seem much more fitting with the music track.

As a music based game,this is a breathe of fresh air, I do like Audio surf a lot, but where as it can become total chaos on that game, DAT is a less stress inducing way of enjoying a game being generated by your own music. That`s not to say it wont set you a challenge though, because it will depending on the music you use.Something that does get me a bit though is that it does not really seem in synch with your music, yes it does generate unique tracks, but there does not seem to be much to indicate the track your racing is like racing your music. For example, while you maybe in synch with the track marker, pickups that you collect don`t seem to have a rythmic pattern following the music your racing to, I really think this should be looked at and tweaked. They really should be more inline with the beat, or lead sound of the music, and maybe more of them.I do agree about some walls too, they can at times appear in obscure places, like right on a bend, or hill top so you don`t get chance to react, so again needs tweaking.I really do enjoy when it gets to the part of the track with loads of drifting, and in most cases it feels right, it feels that it belongs in that certain part of your music.On a final niggle, sometimes track generation difficulty can be confusing, I have tried a drum n bass track and it was given an easy difficulty rating, and was really easy to drive, but then I tried a soft rock track and it cranked up to 4 star difficulty. Rather baffling.I do recommend this game though, I have lost hours on it, and will more as well, and I hope that over time the engine will be fine tuned to iron out some of these niggles, along with even more excitement and variety of scenes.

												This may be my favorite game. I've played it for 382 hours & I'm still not even close to getting bored of it. Driving on tracks generated by your favorite music while trying to get better scores than everyone else by doing aerial rolls & drifts & getting items is amazingly fun.The aesthetic of a track depends on the genre. The game figures out the genre of a track by checking the band name on music hosting sites/programs. The game tells you an estimated difficulty rating for any track & there's a thread on the forum where people have listed tons of 5-star tracks for really hardcore players.You can easily find really easy tracks or really hard ones so the game's good for casual players & hardcore ones. If you wanna see more gameplay footage, you can check out my Youtube channel or the videos I've uploaded on Steam or you can watch any of the countless videos other people have uploaded to Youtube & Steam.Cons: Don't play Fell in Love with a Girl by The White Stripes.

												I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews regarding the music being only ""background music"" which is simply false. You can play any song you want and the difficulty is judged by the amount of bass, hats, snares, treb, etc. Simply put; if your song is bumping louder than Godzilla's roar then you'll have a 5 star song. If you're playing a song like ""Gywnn Lord of Cinder Theme"" (like I did) then you'll have a song that's around 2 stars. Disregard metal and rock songs because most of the songs are too heavy to really detect properly, you'll still be able to play them, just not as you wanted. Double basses don't register too well. ""Deadly Sinners - 3 Inches of Blood"" would be a no-no. If you really want to counter my claims, let me know. I can post a video of me playing two different songs showing how drastic the change is.tl;dr:The game is amazing and if you enjoy sitting back and playing your kick-♥♥♥ songs, get this game.			"

												Wish I could give it a neutral rating... since it's still got a lot of potential and it's so cheap.As of right now, (2/19/17) it just feels really hollow. Graphics (at least on the ten or so tracks that I generated) are mostly monochrome. Just big abstract towers of flashing purple or red. They're kind of static and they don't seem to react to the music the way graphics in AudioSurf 2 do.Also, the tracks themselves seem a little tame. I was expecting bigger jumps, more corkscrews, explosions, etc. Sadly, even the hardest songs seem to produce the same bumpy straights and hard turns with an occasional loop and a handful of ramps. They get the job done, but they're not much of a show.Overall, I think this game needs to embrace the ""racing"" aspect a little more. More action, more variety, maybe something to race against... because right now it just kind of feels like an uglier version of AudioSurf 2 without mod support. Hell, if you leave the ""Auto-Accelerate"" option on in the settings, you'd almost forget it's a different game.For now, I'm going to refund (for those reasons and also because it lacks WAV support... and I don't wanna convert 300 files to FLAC just for this game)... but I'm still holding out hope that this can be great in the future and I'll keep my eye on it.

												By no means a terrible game, but with several weaknesses and flaws, especially in comparison with Audiosurf.First of all: There isn't much do to, besides trying not to crash and grabing collectables. You maximze your highscores, via drifts and jumps.Secondly the game offers you a level system and to purchase a selection of cars - with no effect at all. Cars differ minimalistic in (hitbox)size and that's about it. In Audiosurf you get pretty much a new game mode with each ""vehicle"", so that is vastly superior.But my biggest gripe: I don't feel it. With Audiosurf the track really comes alive. Riff Racer manages to connect me with a song maybe in 1 out of 10 runs. I simply expect much better in that regard.So if you already own Audiosurf and still want more, go and buy Riff Racer on a sale. If you don't have Audiosurf yet, don't even consider getting Riff Racer first.6/10			"

								This game is a lot of fun.  The drifting system is my favorite part. There are a few things you might want to change though, it's very easy to keep generating ""new songs"" for 100 coins. A lot of people get all of their money related achievements this way. You can simply make an mp3 file, duplicate it 100 times, and change the name of every file. No, I didn't do this, but it would be very easy to.I also think the game is kind of confusing when it comes to choosing original songs. Whether or not most players are using pirated music, it would make a lot more sense to just go by the IDE song name and artist. I've raced top 40 songs straight downloaded from Itunes, and was supposedly the first person to race that certain song. I think this is why you see so much participation in the bundled music. Which isn't bad, but let's be honest...There is a lot of great things to say about this game. I don't just use it for music, It's a good way to get through lectures as well. Which is a great way to learn, get points, and satisfy your ADHD. MM.Pros: - Drifting system feels flowy and fun- First game in the genre that doesen't require tapping your foot or finger 200mph- Concept is killer. - The achivements were fun to get.- Paint jobs are decent.- Last.fm genre API works great. Cons:- Lack of upgrading in garage- Community and game feels thinned out from unecessary song recogniztion (imo)- Not possible to connect to Last.fm (I think?)- Game feels a little bit too easy.- ""Destruction"" achievement and the walls behind jumps dont add up.Overall Rating - 7.5/10 - I would recommend this game to anyone and enjoy it thoroughly, despite its flaws and ""early access"" feel.

Which isn't bad, but let's be honest...There is a lot of great things to say about this game. I don't just use it for music, It's a good way to get through lectures as well. Which is a great way to learn, get points, and satisfy your ADHD. MM.Pros: - Drifting system feels flowy and fun- First game in the genre that doesen't require tapping your foot or finger 200mph- Concept is killer. - The achivements were fun to get.- Paint jobs are decent.- Last.fm genre API works great. Cons:- Lack of upgrading in garage- Community and game feels thinned out from unecessary song recogniztion (imo)- Not possible to connect to Last.fm (I think?)- Game feels a little bit too easy.- ""Destruction"" achievement and the walls behind jumps dont add up.Overall Rating - 7.5/10 - I would recommend this game to anyone and enjoy it thoroughly, despite its flaws and ""early access"" feel.

												I absoloutely adore this game.Its exactly what it says on the tin, Wipeout meets Audiosurf.But its a satisfying marriage that sometimes has moments that even best its lovely parents.PROS- Tight controls and physics, even in midair. If you fall to your doom it feels like your fault (usually :p).- Simple score system that has lots of aspects to it. When to boost? When to jump and when to go off those flips? When to start drifting for the longest drift? Little things can go a long way when going for highscores.- Unlockables. Its a little thing, but I always love unlockables. Gives you more reason to play beyond mechanical reasons (which the game does wonderfully mind you)- Nice, (generally) cohesive graphics that can run on any ol toaster like mine :)- You can sort of snake with practice. Givin' me the GX goosebumps ooh.- Ghosts are very well done and racing them gives a good competetive feel.CONS- Gui is servicable but text and buttons are too large. Text doesn't scroll when selecting new tracks so if a song has a long album/artist combination you can't read the track name :<- Surprisingly even with unlockables, customization is minimal. Theres no graphics options, Audiosurf 1 alone had selectable ""intensity"" colours and custom skyboxes. I would prefer if I could choose the track type for a song as proper genre data isn't always available so you get stuck on ""Dance"" a lot.- There are some rare issues with track generation. For instance, ""The Hamster Alliance - Falling Through The Air"" has a jump that you can rarely make without boosting. This is a reoccuring issues it seems from the bug report page. It makes tracks that would otherwise be low difficulty have a semi-frustrating aspect to them, cause you have to count jumps and remember which ones are death traps.- There isn't proper leaderboards or statistics. You have to load a song to see the leaderboard. I know for a fact my highest score is about 210k but the game doesn't list that anywhere that I've seen. Also, doesn't have the cool aspect of Audiosurf where you had to try and keep your thrones. I loved that, was a good way to bring you back into the game.TL;DR, super fun singleplayer race/music game, with a degree more customization and a gui overhaul it will really shine.			"

												Think of it more as a music than a racing game. This game offers a great way to rediscover your music collection. The tracks created from your metal songs will be vastly different from the ones created from your ballads. The latter will be chill and relaxing while the former will test your skill and reaction. In the default mode you won't have to worry about gas/brakes, the game will take care of that for you. However, you can turn this off, if you prefer to manage it yourself. The skill is mostly in collecting boost-items, avoiding obstacles, timing your boosts and most importantly, drifting the curves efficiently. The car models (bought for in-game currency) have identical driving characteristics except for the hit box.I adore this game, I had so much fun under my headphones listening to my favourite songs and discovering the tracks they would ""create"". It makes you appreciate your music in a new way, as you pay 100% attention to it as well as creating a visual representation.			"

												A great game to to just kick back to while listening to your favourite tracks. If you're someone like me who tends to just get lost into their music, this is a great alternative to be actually ""participating"" with it instead of just doing nothing while going through a playlist. Although if you're into bass heavy tracks with high beats per minute, you may notice that at times it seems as if the track is properly designed for it, since you'll be listening to heavy kicks but with not as much action on screen. Aside from that, it goes great with other tunes and at times it does feel as if the track is part of the song, getting quick and intense right as the music is picking up its pace.It's worth full price, but if you get it on sale for around $3 like I did, go for it. If you're a fan of audiosurf or any other melody type game and drifting, this is the perfect combination.			"

												Hey!  You've got my music in your video game...no worries...it makes for a delicious treat.I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.  The achievements are doable, and there is a sense of reward actually ""playing"" your music and not just listening to it while you play.  There are ample cars and a decent variety of tracks.  I would like to see more development along the lines of track options, performances/stunts that you can do, or options/enhancements for your cars.  I would also love to see true multiplayer options or ability to challenge other players directly.  However, as it is it has enough enjoyment to last...partly because it is a fun way to listen to your music and enjoy a racing game.BTW, I created a group for the game to possibly serve as a community focus for challenges, suggestions of songs or song resources apart from the general discussion forum.  :-)Riff Racer Group "

												This game.. oh boy. Such a simple concept. Pick any of the music on your own PC and go. But it generates the tracks for you based on the songs  composition. Be it the rifts of a sweet guitar lick, the change of  tempo or pitch can lead to some sweet synchronization for the track, be it a loop or a hella big jump.But the best part of all this really is the fact that its your OWN music. Your favourite music. A great way to just sit down, put on some tunes. I used to just sit and let youtube do its thing and stare mindlessly at the screen while track played one after the other.But at least with Riff Racer, I can engage the music, and have a blast while jaming out.Also, extra points for a game that works best with metal and fast guitar/drums instead of high tempo techno-esc music all the time.Highly recomended.

								Drive Any track is a replacer for Audiosurf and gives you the feeling of need for speed, just on a single road to YOUR own playlist or mixes. Your playing with different cars, which you can modify. It gives a more fun experience than audiosurf with a car, drifting, crazy jumps and similiar content from Distance, where the maps are created by the track your playing. Even so the game supports song length from mixes, which i tried. Overall controls and car control is good. Surely it's a similiar idea, but the experience was different..

								I have a soft spot for music games, especially those that used your library of music. A friend of mine knew that and lead me to this game. I have to say, I'm suprised that it's this good, considering that I like to try and dodge anything early access. So, on with the game.The game is well designed, the visuals are interesting as well as flashy, without being overwelming. The driving in this game works well, but seems a tad uninteresting, due to it seeming a bit like audiosurf without it copying it. The cars you can choose are all varied and come with extra skins, so you can find something that suits you.My only real gripes with the game are a lack of choosable difficulty levels, which is bad because sometimes due to choices in music, especially when the mixing of certin songs can be iffy at times. There are also times on the songs where you can't really dodge the walls coming your way, due to jumps that make you land on them, and due to the camera not letting you see downward a little more when jumping.It's worth buying though, and I'm glad I grabbed it when i did.

								It's early days for DAT but what I've played so far has a lot of promise.The biggest issue now is track parsing is still being tweaked - that means when you choose a track it will often be considered 'new'/there are no high-scores available.  Upside is it's easy to get the 'create new tracks' achievements but it does reduce the competitiveness of it right now.Otherwise it looks and plays well - there's a mix of skill and memorisation required to get really good scores but I think some tweaking of the scoring system to allow skill to balance-out memorisation would be nice (e.g. a big drifter should be able to match the player who knows every wall/box?)I've already had more fun than I ever had with Audiosurf - DAT seems more promising - so I'm looking forward to what's coming next!!

												Fun, exciting, infuriating(Because my OCD kicks in whenever I dont get 100% sync) and otherwise a good game. Its name is Riff Racer which might imply that its best in combination with Rock/Guitar play, but in reality it works well with most genres I've tried so far. I have had the most fun with EDM and D'n'B, when the BPM gets high stuff gets crazy, and managing to land those jumps and slide through corners makes for a really fulfilling and rewarding feeling. I'd wish the colour-scheme was mixed-up a bit more, it uses different colours based on what type of track you are playing (Orchestral-green, Rock-red, and so on) so if you are a big fan of rock you will find yourself looking at red and blue colours 90% of the time.

								Disappointed with the algorithm's results in generating tracks. I tried a variety of songs from Kavinsky, La Roux, Miracle of Sound, Iron Maiden, Johnny Cash, and Tom Waits. What I got bore little resemblance to what I was listening to. The country got the most intense tracks surprisingly. It won't be replacing audiosurf for me without a lot of work, but I will keep my eye on it. Fun premise, let down by the execution.It maintained playable frames on my meager laptop and my xbone pad worked perfectly without any setup.			"

												Riff Racer is all I could've wanted out of the play-your-own-track subset of the music game genre. Here are a couple of things that the game pulls off really well:You can get plenty of playtime out of it if you have a somewhat sizeable music library sitting in your hard drive. Even if I hadn't picked the game up when it wasn't on sale, I would say it is still very much worth it if you don't want to wait simply for the sheer amount of time you can just spend playing track after track. Useful for people like me who have a good thousand albums sitting around that I haven't gone through, it gives me a bit of motivation to do so, especially considering that the game incentivizes play with in-game currency that you attain from just playing your tracks, used to unlock new cars and paint jobs.The game isn't particularly mechanically dense, but this really works in the game's favor. It's all score based rather than having you drive a closed circuit racetrack. What this essentailly entails is auto-acceleration being on by default and a big focus on manipulating your boost and doing tricks all the while driving clean to attain the best score multipliers, rather than trying to go as fast as you can as per any orthodox racing game. After all, you finish your ""track"" as soon as the song ends. There aren't that many tricks, but there is a skill involved in it, gathering boost boxes scattered on the track, knowing when to drift, to roll your car instead of just jumping normally, for example.The logic for ""track"" creation is very slick. I've only had a few songs where a blockade obstacle was placed unfairly, like at the start of a loop where I couldn't see it, but for the most part, it's great and really does pick out set-piece moments in your songs. The difficulty also varies from song to song, though sometimes the hardest songs are the ones you wouldn't expect. I've had drone music play at the highest difficulty and some high-tempo noise rock play on the easiest.The game is simple in its appearance and polygonal car models, but the colorful neon-laden tracks are easy on the eyes and easy to just get lost into a trance to when I try to pull off drift after drift. It's a great visualizer, which is a good thing to have for a game like this. It's never boring to look at, especially since the colors of the tracks vary depending on what genre of music you're playing.Here are a couple of things that the game could improve on in the future (as it is getting updates here and there).The leaderboard and social aspects of the game are just serviceable. You have a player profile page, but there isn't much to see on it. You can see what car you use most, what track you play the most, and that's about it in terms of useful information. Trying to see what tracks a friend has played, for instance, will only yield their most-played track. Along with this, despite using Last.fm as a basis for determining track genres, as far as I know, you don't have the ability to scrobble your tracks. This one's just a minor nitpick of mine, but still, both of these potential features are things Audiosurf had in spades over Riff Racer, and I'd really like to see it worked on.The only game mode you have here is the score-based one. There's no other way to play it, but what the game has to offer is still a lot of fun.Japanese unicode doesn't work and it just comes out as a bunch of question marks :(((Though flawed in some respects (which are just nitpicks on my part), Riff Racer is still, all-in-all, a really solid game. If I could describe it, I'd call it chill. The sort of chill where you just invite someone over and watch shows or movies in the dark while sipping something. Riff Racer's real chill to hang with. It's definitely worth checking out if you're into this type of game.			"

												Coming from Audiosurf, I thought this game would be the same exact thing with the only difference being it's with cars.This is mostly true, but there are differencesThis game requires a little more concentration and planning than Audiosurf does. Occasionally the path might get narrower and you have to be extra cautious and not hit the wall. There's ramps, which if executed poorly will throw you off the stage. They even let you change your car, and the colors too! Plus, the backgrounds change depending on which genre of music you're doing.As with Audiosurf I can boot up any song from my computer, wheter its an iTunes file or something somebody sent me on a thumbdrive. Everything works well, I havn't spotted any bugs or glitches or anything going wrongOne complaint I have, and this is particular to me and those like me. I'm a fan of prog rock, which is a genre that contains many songs which last for several minutes, say 15-20, with exceptions. For whatever reason this game can't run songs that are longer than 12mins (Longest song I've been able to do lasted about ten and a half minutes). So theres a good chunk of my music that I can't use because the game can't comprehend something of that size. Audiosurf can do that no problem, unless you get bored 15mins in and want to quit, of course.UPDATE: Game has multiplayer mode. Have yet to try it, and thus cannot comment on it. Sorry  :(Beyond those things, this is an excellent game, worth giving a try if you like music, cars, video games, and steam achievements			"

												Riff Racer is an addictive racing game that oozes the feeling of arcades of yore. The racks all look very samey BUT the layout of them is based on the song. The game has a handful tracks built in, but the real meat is when you start importing your own sick beats from your music library and race the night away!Verdict: It's fun, fast, sleek and addictive as all holy hell.

												This game uses bumping music, bright effects, and music generated tracks to create an awesome experience that will keep you coming back for more. The cars that you use to race on the rhythm road are also nicely made with boost gauges attached right to the back, which is a cool way to keep your boost info available.

												It's basically Guitarr Hero but for racing. Except you get can play whatever music you want. And it doesn't sound awful if you screw up.It does have a lot of bright, flashing lights though, so a seziure warning would be apropriate, and an option to change the main menus music and side-scroll in your music catalog (some of us have files with very long names on them) would be appreciated.That said it's a highly addictive little game, and you'll feel pretty awesome even when you're screwing up, cause at least you're screwing up to your own personal soundtrack.

Here In My Car, I'm Outdritin' 'Em All!Riff Racer = Audiosurf + Forever Drive + UNEXPLAINABLE HOMICIDAL RAGEIf you've played both Audiosurf and Forever Drive, I've pretty much just explained the game to you and if you like those two things just shut up and spend your money.For those unititated, this game is about generating a sort of race track/obstacle course based on your music, and playing through it in order to acheive a high score.  The primary appeal is seeing what kind of ride experience you get based on the song you pick.  Sometimes a track will fit SO perfectly to a song that you'll swear it was handmade and not randomly generated.  Other times you'll have a hard time discerning how your race and the song match up at all, but still find it enjoyable.In the case of Riff Racer, it places emphasis on the racing action and feels very much like a simplistic stunt racing game with pleasant, neon visuals.  The hook here is the fact that when you select a song that no one else out there has yet played, you generate a unique track that is FOREVER YOURS.  So anyone else out there choosing that song will race the track that YOU generated.  It adds a bit of a layer of discovery to the game, as well as interesting emergent competition.See...  This is where I have you tell you I just spent over an hour on a track based on ONE song.  ONE SONG.  Replaying it over and over.  Why...?Well, here I was picking songs that I both liked and thought were just eclectic enough to not have been played.  ...BUT I KEPT RUNNING INTO THIS ONE JAGOFF THAT HAD ALREADY LAID CLAIM TO THEM.  ONE GUY WHO JUST HAPPENED TO LIKE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SONGS THAT I LIKE AND WAS TRYING TO STEAL THEM FROM ME HOW DARE YOU SIR?!!?!Naturally, there was only one thing to do...Crush this pretender, cast down his claim to those musical lands, and claim the No. 1 Headband.It seriously sparks some sort of weird obsessive competition when you run into these scenarios.  It's kinda like when two scenesters that each think they are (bandname)'s biggest fan clash, and then the fur really flies!It's strange because otherwise this is one of those games that is chill as it gets.  Cruise through your music (Or even your podcasts!) and enjoy the visuals and cool Tron-like vehicles OR experience keyboard-smashing rage as you get freaky possessive about your special snowflake music!Start your engines if you... Loved the Audiosurf games.  Pretty much a must have for your collections. Like games that are trippy like woah! Have a bizarre need to defend your favorite songs as if they were your waifu.Put it in park if you... Are more so into DDR-style games.  This game is about mastering the drift, not the beats. Need couch co-op and the other plethora of features found in Audiosurf.  This game is currently pretty slim in that regard. Don't really listen to music that much.  Sure this is a stunt racing game, but a lot of the fun is seeing what kind of race track your favorite songs might make.The Bottom LineRiff Racer does what it does very well and with an even coat of polish.  I've dumped about five hours into it mostly in one sitting without even realizing it.  Not many games can claim to have that hold on a person.  It definitely carries that ""one more turn"" effect, only it's ""just one more song"".That said, there is definitely room for improvement.  The track visuals really need expanding, as even the different color schemes end up feeling alike to one another.  More game modes, local co-op, more items, powerups, and track terrain would cement this game as a classic.As it stands, it's definitely worth your money as is...

I don't know about you, but that makes me wanna try different songs in my library to see if I'm the first one!There isn't anything I would add or change about the game. I may suggest maybe car stats to make them different. You know like one is better at drifting, one is better at handling, each car has a different weight, light, medium and heavy, which affects how it flys in the air, you know? I would also like to see the price lowered from $15 to $9.99. The game is great but I do think it needs to be a little lower, even though I bought it on sale.			"

								As someone who loves music and wanted something new, Drive Any Track is a fresh, innovative experience. While it isn't complete by any means, I'm having fun driving and jamming out to my favorite songs. Only con I have so far is that there isn't file support for .WAV files, and i have a lot of those for some reason. I don't want to convert the files, but I understand that this is early access.My rating- 8.5/10			"

								What Audiosurf should have been.14 hour in update:Ok so this game is pretty good.  The drifting needs a little tweaking as it will randomly lose drift depending on your arrow key movement in the opposite direction.  However, it may also stay drifting despite the opposite press and throw you into the wall.  The difficult also needs a bit of a tweak as the game loves to throw multiple hard left hard right curves in a row and you will meet the wall without extremely fast reflexes.You'll get thrown into the wall either way.  However, the drifting also feels very tight and requires you to trust the car.  Once you get the hang of it, you can easily drift, hit the boost, and gain that x10 multipler and subsequent massive points with little effort.  Really looking forward to the full release and will definitely play more of this game.			"

								  This game is awesome. The idea of racing on tracks based on music on your computer is something new and unique. The algorithm that Drive Any Track (DAT) uses to generate the tracks has potential. It can be hit-and-miss sometimes, though. But, when it works it's awesome. I believe that the algorithm DAT uses is called MEGA. Like I said, it has potential. It needs to be refined a little, but, it works pretty well. Although, MEGA seems to work better with certain generes of music (or certain songs). Tracks based on rock can be iffy, but, some songs work better than others.  I'd recommend this game to people that like racing games and music. Even though songs over ten minutes can't be turned into tracks, it's still worth a try. Plus, it works with the format that iTunes uses for music, so, any iTunes music you have should work (as long as it fits the forementioned ten minute time limit).

I've already almost spent four hours playing this game straight. It's like Audiosurf mixed with Trackmania, that is to say it is a music game that preloads any song in your library and bases a racetrack off the song you plug in using specific algorithms. Some of the ways they incorporate drops for example, in the form of a long jump, or utilizing loop de loops as a target point in the song are spot on. Other times, it leaves a lot to be desired. There were songs that I feel had a lot going on, such as several hardcore songs which featured lots of heavy bass, which were only rated a one star. Other pop songs were rated a five. Just found it weird in the rating system and how the algorithm takes certain songs is all.However, is this game addicting and fun? Hell yeah it is.

Visuals are great.When you play a song that no one has played, the game awards you for the cataloging the song with coins and your name being there as the author of the race track.Ghosts of previous racers to race with work pretty well to keep you competitive.The value is low thanks to it having been in a bundleThere are trading cardsGreat free bundled tracks.Overall8/10(Games start off from a 5/10 and increase/decrease in points with pros and cons)			"

												This is a score-based ghost racing game. You're not competing for the best time, but rather who can navigate the track in a manner that scores the most points (largely by drifting, collecting boosts, and hitting jumps right). The game has a meter that travels along the road and the car auto accelerates to keep up with it.The track generation feature works surprisingly well with most songs I've tried, and provides an added level of exhilaration to the climaxes of the music, even for more classical/orchestral songs. The game does not feature real-time multiplayer, but I don't see that as a downside, as it would be rather clunky without making a huge shift in game play. The biggest con to this game is the clunky slow menu and the fact that there's no way for strangers to race against the songs you upload unless they happen to have the same niche taste in music.

												So I haven't been playing this for very long, but I've already taking a liking to it. From my own experience, it takes a little while to get a good grip on the handling of your vehicles, but that makes mastering it worth it (I find a controller is best for racing games like these). It can get pretty addictive rather quickly; especially if you're a fan of games where your music collection shapes the levels.All in all... I think I've found a good way to waste time for several more hours.			"

												Riff Racer is a must-buy for everyone who likes rhythm based music games.The tracks that are composed aren't as irratic as Audiosurf's. Controls for the car work well. Visuals are great.When you play a song that no one has played, the game awards you for the cataloging the song with coins and your name being there as the author of the race track.Ghosts of previous racers to race with work pretty well to keep you competitive.The value is low thanks to it having been in a bundleThere are trading cardsGreat free bundled tracks.Overall8/10(Games start off from a 5/10 and increase/decrease in points with pros and cons)			"

												Since my main pc game is TF2, the controls took a little time to get used to. The genre categorizer is very good, although one dubstep song in particular[soundcloud.com] registered as a rock/metal song (probably cause all the bass) (I did like the special lighting for that song though). Drifting was a little hard to master at first, but it's very useful in some parts. The leaderboard/chart system isn't the most comprehensive in my opinion. I think the people who say this game is too easy missed the difficulty rating system. There are some tracks that you have to be next-level gamer demon to not destroy yourself in. On some tracks I've found there are very tight turns that can easily make or break a run, drifting or not. I noticed someone else said there's a 30 fps cap, but I've found this to be completely untrue (at least when you play on lowest resolution fullscreen). Overall a very good first release.			"

												Ok, so ill start off by saying i love this game it's great for anyone who is into rhythm games, but there are still a few problems with it.1. Still a bit buggy - By this I mean there were several times where i was 100% in sync for the majority of the song, only to have it be messed up by my car randomly turning 180 degrees into the opposite direction after landing from a jump making me go several bars behind.2. No WMA format support - this might just be me being picky, but i would love it if i could play a lot of my music without having to run it through a format cinverter to get it to MP3.3. At times it can be a bit too easy.4.Not really a complaint but I would like more cars.All in all I still really like it and i bet most of my the things im complaining about can or will be fixed in future updates.7.5/10 "

												Being a person who loves music, this game is great. Despite what others say the tracks do keep up with the songs I have tried (a few dubstep songs, a few alternative songs), while still being challenging. My only complaint? No live multiplayer! Whats with that?! Otherwise a great game you should really add to your library.			"

								If you like Audiosurf, you will love this game. It was a frustrating start but after I practiced with the controls a bit, I do a bit better now. There are some great things and some not so great things so I will try to list them all.Great things: -Plenty of cars and paints for the cars.-Visually stunning.-Simple yet challenging. -Track variation is pretty good, although I have found a few songs where most of the song is just drifting back and forth which is quite boring. For the most part though, the tracks are pretty good.-Shiny! Not so great things:-If you have a downloaded song through YouTube or some other source, there is no leader board for that song.-Sometimes downloaded songs will play as a different songs-Barricades are placed in bad spots from time to time. Sometimes they are impossible to avoid unless you have the track memorized.-Visuals can become distracting if your eyes are sensitive to bright colors, flashes, and other such effects.-Controls are wonky. They just do not feel consistent. Sometimes they respond slow. Sometimes they are too twitchy (Example: pulling out of a drift will slam you into a wall) -Crate and token hitboxes are not consistent either. Sometimes you can drive right next to them and pick them up, other times they won't get picked up.-Lack of control customization and not being able to use mouse/gamepad. You cannot change controls. The controls consist of <- -> [spacebar] and CTRL. There was little tutorial too. I was unsure that I could drift until about my 20th race and then i got a tip saying CTRL was to drift.Overall, considering this is Early access, It is in pretty good shape. There are a few minor things that need to be changed/tweaked/added. But overall, it was worth the money. I would suggest this game to any music lover.			"

								Though I have only played a short time, as of this writing, I can already see the fun and enjoyment in this game. Overall for a early access release it is very polished and runs very smoothly. Looking forward to many hours racing around with my music in the background.

												It's pretty.EDIT: Rarely, the track generation would generate a ramp so far up that when your car lands, it can fall through the track. Once I also got flung off the track just by lightly touching the wall. The physics are questionable, and there are no graphics options aside from changing the resolution and switching between windowed and fullscreen mode.			"

												A wonderful game that can stand up to other music based games very well, as this game has more haptic gameplay elements than the others. Immediately the comparison is made to audiosurf, and I personally prefer this, as your ability to control the direction and speed of the vehicle as well as being able to be slowed down or drift creates a great feeling of weight and control, thus making it feel more immersive in comparison.Driving using your own music is something people have wanted in many driving and open world games, and this helps fit that desire. Most general music file formats seem to be supported, and the leaderboard support complete with ghosts to race against makes this game feel well thought out.The only issue I can state at time of release is that when racing against ghosts, it's not always clear how they gain points, which can be irritating as improving your skills and tactics is difficult when you have no idea how you lost.Outside of that minor complaint, I can highly recommend this game.It runs very well and looks great, but to note it is stylized and from an indie studio, I am more basing the intended graphics compared to what was seen, and there doesnt appear to be many errors or poor quality visuals.This is a must buy if you are a fan of custom music based games.

												Note: I received this game from a giveawayHonestly the most fun I've had with any racing game in a good while! I especially like that you can upload any song you want instead of having to just play whatever songs come with the game (although being able to play songs that you don't have on your comp would be cool too but it's fine as is)My only qualm is that with all the flashing that happens when you hit speed boosts it makes it hard for me to see the barriers/be able to tell them apart from ramps so an option to be able to turn it off would be neatBut other than that it's a lot of fun so far and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys racing games			"

												Not sure what to say about this. I always felt that Audiosurf pretty much ruled the ride your music scene and I think it does still, but this game right here has filled a different space... I never saw a reason why anyone else would make a game similar to what Audiosurf is, but Riff Racer is quite an experience! I don't get the same feelings as Audiosurf, I truly felt I was playing along with my music on that game, not this one but the tracks this game creates randomly for each song don't feel too out of touch with what is playing and the stunts are nice. Sometimes I feel the game gives certain songs the wrong difficulty rating, I'm not sure how it decides which one is 5 star and which is 1 star. I recommend this game based on that if you enjoyed Audiosurf, you might enjoy this one, it fills a different spot in the music-riding genre and does something Audiosurf doesn't which lets you collect coins to buy more cars! A nice feature indeed.			"

												This is another 'play to your own music' game that revolves around drifting your car through corners, jumping off ramps, and avoiding obstacles. You'll be aiming for the highest score, rather than the fastest time. The drift physics are fun, though maneuvering around walls and over jumps is a little tricky.A song's difficulty is mainly based on its BPM (as opposed to frequencies or volume like you'd see in Beat Hazard and Audiosurf), which results in some cool pulsating backgrounds. But, before you get ready to unleash your speedcore collection on this game, keep in mind that the speed recognition caps at about 200 BPM, and anything over that usually gets wrapped back to 1 star difficulty. The tracks are somewhat dynamic, and loosely follow the intensity of the song as it goes.As for customization, you can unlock cars and different paint jobs, though every car drives in the same way as each other. There are leaderboards, too, and you can drift along with the replay of another driver if there is one. The game also has a nice system of notifying you in the game with its 'news' section when somebody beats your score, and you can go directly to the song from there to reclaim it.Honestly, I'm surprised a game with this premise could be made to begin with. For $10, I'd say the game is worth it. If you want a silly procedurally generated music game where you can drift a car around, this one is good.a			"

												To be honest, the tracks didn't sync great to the music. In essence, you're racing near identical tracks while listening to songs you like. If you want to listen to songs you like while racing in a sci-fi environment, go and get Distance. Honestly, that game syncs the surroundings with your music and the tracks are 1000x better, as well as having a level editor, and a workshop with a ton of tracks available.			"

												Well guys, that game is... Oh Lord so smooth. At first I was a bit sceptic, thinking the races (so... the songs) would really look the same. Then I bought it, jumped into it, and BOY THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. Some songs/races (I don't even know which one to chose) are incredible, mainly ones with a good BPM and pace. You really enjoy your music while playing. But, If I had to say something ""bad"" about this, it's the impossibility to rework some levels to make them fit even more with the music (i.e for rock songs, when it's the solo). That aside, this game is so damn awesome !			"

												Much better than any of the Audio Surf games, and a lot more innovative than other games in the music/driving genre.As others have pointed out, the main goal is to keep up with -- or ahead of -- the beat. That's only the half of it, though. You augment your score by pulling off tricks, jumps and by drifting, thus the game rewards you for taking risks and embellishing your run instead of just rocketing straight through the track.There's also continuity in terms of collecting points, upgrading to newer (and better-handling) cars, etc. The cars are pretty sweet, with enough variety in the designs to offer something to everyone. There are muscle cars, classically styled cars, and sleek, angular vehicles that look like they've emerged through a time portal from 1985.This is a great pick-up, especially on sale.			"

You augment your score by pulling off tricks, jumps and by drifting, thus the game rewards you for taking risks and embellishing your run instead of just rocketing straight through the track.There's also continuity in terms of collecting points, upgrading to newer (and better-handling) cars, etc. The cars are pretty sweet, with enough variety in the designs to offer something to everyone. There are muscle cars, classically styled cars, and sleek, angular vehicles that look like they've emerged through a time portal from 1985.This is a great pick-up, especially on sale.			"

												What interested me most about this game was drifting in sync to my music, which sounded like a match made in Heaven. There is a zen-like quality to drifting and chaining back to back corners that would seem to pair itself incredibly well to music based or 'rhythm' gaming. It took only a few minutes to realize that I would not be enjoying this game much at all. Unfortunately the 'drifting' is horrendous. I wasn't expecting too much, something akin to what is in a basic cart racing game. What ruins it is the complete lack of counter-steering. For those not familiar with counter-steering, it is the practice of turning your wheels opposite to the direction you turned to initiate the drift in order to maintain the cars balance to remain drifting instead of simply spinning out. It is the single most crucial aspect of drifting and Riff Racer misses it entirely. So what does this mean in terms of gameplay? It means that being able to guide your car and maintain a drift while sideways is effectively removed. You initiate the drift with a button press and then rely on the angle of your entry point along with your speed to remain drifting while continuing to spam the drift button. If you try to counter steer and maintain your drift the car immediately gains traction and sends you out of the drift and into the wall. It's a mind-boggling design decision that ruined the experience for me almost before it began.			"

								I really enjoy this game. Music has always been a strong passion of mine, I have always taken intrest in music games like Guitar Hero but once I found out about this game I was very excited and I bought it right away (I got it on sale for 6 bucks). I dont do too many reviews so my opinion shouldnt rock yours and influnce you to buy this game.PROS:-Track making system-Cool cyberpunk feel-Awesome looking cars-Very easy to pick up (as long as you have music)-Can make music without ID's into tracks (thats for all of you guys who download all your music off of youtube to mp3)-All genres make different tracks so its fun to expirment with that.-3 sexy easter egg cars that are awesome to try and unlock-Perfected and polished smooth leaderboard ghost racing systemCONS:-Graphics are cartoony and all the friends I have suggested this awesome game to have been turned down by that-Its in early acess and therefore it still lacks a ton of content-Track making system, the reason I put this one in both pros and cons is because some things (like volume, drops, etc) can screw up the tracks because it cant tell the difference between 1 or 2 beats every now and then so your dubstep drop or rap outro might be a little iffy (ignore it the devs are doing an amazing job at attempting to fix it)-No updates for the past while (last one was August 11th, 2015) as im writing thisMy verdict: 7/10This game is awesome and you should totally pick it up when you get the chance as you will have a tremendous amount of fun playing this. It is currently 16.99 CAD (which is not worth the game) so wait till it goes on sale.I hope this review helped you and ill see you out there on the tracks.If you want some gameplay here you go, I did this for a friend on my channel:

												I like the concept here, but I feel the implementation lacks a little too much for me to give a recommendation.What's good?The idea of racing against the music's cursor. The race track length is equivalent to the song length, and you need to maintain a certain velocity to stay on cue with the song's ""now playing"" position. It's simple and novel.The music, for the most part. is enjoyable and fits the game well.The ability to use your own music for tracks.Multiple cars to use (and unlock).When you get going really fast and lights on the track pulse to the music. That's when you really feel the flow and is the game's real sweet spot in my opinion.What's not so good?As far as I can tell, the game has just one track style (road texture, skyline, roadside decor, etc.) that it uses over and over again. Every song I picked, even ones auto-generated from my music looked nearly identical. It seems you get a palette swap at best, and even then, a vast majority of the palettes I saw varied from red to pink. To boot, it's very monochromatic (more on that later).The car designs overall are fairly simplistic. They do fit the theme, but it's not like more detail on the cars would clash with the game's visual design.The controls leave me hankering for more precision steering. Given that the game can be played with one hand, it'd be nice to have a button you could press to enter into a fine-precision-steering mode where you didn't steer so acutely. The nature of the race courses rarely call for that, and when they do, it's very tricky to not end up over-correcting.The game's procedural generation of courses is rather bland. As noted before, the style is already repetitively used. Beyond that, there's actually little to do within a course. You collect turbo boost points (which when you've collected enough, you can juice your turbo). You also collect coins to unlock cars in your garage. Outside of those you have blockades, speed boosts, and ramps. The course itself twists, turns, and has gaps for you to jump over. But it all seems like it's a bit sparsely laid out for the sake of avoiding bad combinations that could result from the procedural generation of race courses.I expected to have more of the gameplay and course design attached to some aspect of the music (like ramps right before bass drops or something akin), but there doesn't really seem to be anything like that except for the aforementioned aspect of having pulsing lights to the beat when you're going super fast. I know a feature like this wouldn't be easy, but it would really help create unique and memorable experiences on the race track.Another ramification of the lacking variations in track features and colors is that when you're going turbo speed, the game blurs the camera. Now the game often puts blockades and ramps side-by-side. So with blurred vision, high speeds, and coming about a ramp-blockade combo from blind turns/twists/hills, I found myself often hitting the blockade instead of the ramp in that situation. It's not an insurmountable challenge, but it's an example of where the game's lacking of design and variation creates difficulty where there should be none. Why aren't blockades just given a different color to clearly separate them from ramps?On a few occasions, I ran into poorly generated courses such as ramps right into curves. For a game that's hinging on its procedural generation to create replayability, it really could use a bit of tweaking/polish.I like the game, but there are a few obstacles in the way of me enjoying it for any considerable duration. It feels like it's within reach of being a great title for zoning out to with the right music selections. If racing and/or rhythm games are in your wheelhouse and you are curious what a combination of the two genres would be like, then this is worth a pickup. But in its current state, I wouldn't generally recommend this game to people.			"

												If you like music runner games, as well as racing games, well then hot damn do I have a game for you!The game seems to be a blend of the arcade-y, drifting-based handling of Ridge Racer, and the intense color pallette/vibing feel of Audiosurf, from what I can tell after about 2 hours of play.On the positive side of the game, it so far has accurately synced up with any song i've thrown at it's engine; the music-generated maps change color and theme depending on the genre of music/intensity of the current moment in the song, with the choices in theme being appropriate thus far; there are many options in the way of what your car looks like, with unlockable rides that you can further customize after purchasing, all using in-game coins earned through playing the game. Kinda sad that has to be a positive side of a game nowadays, huh? Anyways, the actual ""racing"" itself is done against the pace of the song by way of pace bars you need to try to keep up with to stay synced with the song; the drifting and speed of the game feel incredibly satisfying, with speed boosts placed at areas where the song picks up, or usually, when it goes into a chorus. Also there are spin jumps, which are pretty awesome...when you land them.Now for the negative sides, starting with what I last mentioned. Because the game has spin jumps, it has a sort of physics engine which the car operates on while midair, and while the game encourages you to do spin jumps to score more points, the car can very easily flip and leave you wiping out, resetting your position between the second and third bars. This could just be a case of ""i'm bad at the game,"" but it's rather irritating to lose your 100% sync rate because of something you have little control over; following up on that note, the game has barriers on the track that slow your car, which nine times out of ten, are completely avoidable. But sometimes you get that one time of the ten, where you can't see the barrier coming up because the track is going through a loop, and the song is ridiculously fast, so you get little to no time to react and lose a ton of speed. Again, could just be me being bad, but also again, it's not satisfying to get jipped out of your score because of that; the big complaint i've seen the most, no WMA support. Kinda lame, but it doesn't bother me personally too much, as most of my library is in mp3 format anyways, but I imagine that's a very large glaring issue for many people. Also, channeling my inner TotalBiscuit, the graphics options menu is limited to resolution, and fullscreen on/off, so if you can't run the game as is, you're kind of SOL. Sorry, yo.Overall, i've enjoyed the time i've put into the game, and I would recommend it to people who are fans of games such as Audiosurf, and Ridge Racer.			"

												This is really hard to put a thumbs down because theres no neutral option while the game isnt too bad I find it lacking.This game feels kinda like a phone game even though as far as I know its not and im not trying to say it is I just mean it feels shallow and looks and feels like a good phone game. The drifting is arcade like but when you play it it kinda geels like a phone game and the jumps and barriers just scream phone game and thats where it really fell apart for me. I know audio surf would feel about the same but it dosnt really feel like youre playing a track bassed on your music, I can see the beats kinda show up on the ground and a few other things but its too undwellming for any of that to matter it and losses the point of the game at that point.You can most likely refund the game in under 2 hours of play time but by then you would know how the game feels and if you would actually enjoy it.

												I dunno, it's just not really drawing me in. It feels like there's a great game hiding somewhere in this game, but wherever it is, it's likely far far down in the color-shifting landscape below the track.It has merit as an interactive music game, but I'd kinda rather just boot up Audiosurf or Beat Hazard if I'm going for that.The jumping mechanic... It's neat, but it feels really heavy. Like, it feels like the entire track is slamming down when you land. Also, it's really unsatisfying that even though you drive the same speed as the beat normally, if you boost ahead it can just catch up to you instantly. Makes me feel like I'm going nowhere.I'd call it not my type, but with the corollary that it is a decent game, and I don't want to shy other people away. Other people should check it out by all means. The only warning I'll give is that if you're going fast, the game will 100% conspire via color-shifting and blurring to make you unable to see obstacles until you hit them. Watch out for that.			"

												This game is one of the best Music type games I have ever played. This game runs really good it has 60 fps lock. WARNING:this game can get addictive. I bought it on sale for a joke thinking its some kind of a audiosurf parody but it isint really it has difrent type of gameplay. Tracks you play thay are not random Gen at first you make a track(by playing youre song if you want) and then later you can improve youre skill on that song by replaying it. Then you make a track other people can race on it too. Thay can compete with youre ghost of if you want you can compete with there ghost. This game not a lot of cars but few i mean like 6 cars (i think its 6+ but not 10) but im hopping in the furture there will be more cars to drive and costomize. Now costomize is jsut changing colors of the car but its fine cuz about 80% of the time you will focus in the gameplay and track of youre favorite song. Definatly buy this game and suppoert these devs. for there work that have put in and im hoping to see more in furture. Oh forgot there are right now 3 types of track looks. and why have youre readed this all go buy the game.........                       WHY ARE YOU STILL READING............

												The fact that you can race to the beat of any chosen song you have in your library (Music Folder) and race others ghosts whom have race to those same songs is awesome. Or be the first to race the songs even great.Keyboard handling is good, Gameplay: my reaction during one race at one time was ""......SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTT .... HOLY@#$% that's Awesome!!!!"" quite literally. Graphics: Well, that goes without saying since each map is tailored to whatever song you have in your playlist, too bad if you are playing theme music to ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Excitingly Frustrating while attempting to steer correctly to ""Bohemiam Rhapsody"" and Jibbing at the same time. Worth the money - Yes.You can play long or short, or depends one what songs you play.Only Con, I do think more themes, more environments, obstactles could be added but still.Game 9/10			"

												This game is one of the best Music type games I have ever played. This game runs really good it has 60 fps lock. WARNING:this game can get addictive. I bought it on sale for a joke thinking its some kind of a audiosurf parody but it isint really it has difrent type of gameplay. Tracks you play thay are not random Gen at first you make a track(by playing youre song if you want) and then later you can improve youre skill on that song by replaying it. Then you make a track other people can race on it too. Thay can compete with youre ghost of if you want you can compete with there ghost. This game not a lot of cars but few i mean like 6 cars (i think its 6+ but not 10) but im hopping in the furture there will be more cars to drive and costomize. Now costomize is jsut changing colors of the car but its fine cuz about 80% of the time you will focus in the gameplay and track of youre favorite song. Definatly buy this game and suppoert these devs. for there work that have put in and im hoping to see more in furture. Oh forgot there are right now 3 types of track looks. and why have youre readed this all go buy the game.........                       WHY ARE YOU STILL READING............      BUY THE GAME GODDAMMIT......................                         srsly stop reading and go buy the game!!!!!! really you still here -_-go buy thx for reading but buy the game now its good dont worryffs just go and buy it!!!!!!! =)			"

 Riff Racer  is a car driving game which take your own music tracks, in your Library on PC and transform them into racetracks .Each racetracks is randomly created by the song you load.You have customization in the car as well, you can buy new cars and car styles with the coins you gain by racing before.The graphics are simple but colourful and beautifull wich attracts the eye.The gameplay is quite simple, you use the arrow keys, the space bar and  shift.Its a good game for casual players or music enthusiasts cause you can play a game with your soundtrack, and that ladies and gentlemen... is awsome :D			"

												Audiosurf meets Ridge Racer/F-Zero (depending on your music.) It controls a little floaty but I'm used to that kind of thing. My only complaint is there's no info for controllers in the controller menu (but if you've played a racer, the controls are obvious.)8/10 (Great game) I can't wait to see what these guys add as the months go by.Accessibility review: VERY large fonts, pretty good contrast (the pace bar will be a big help to colorblind players) and keyboard controls are rebindable. Unfortunately, there are no rebindings for X360 controllers as yet but, all in all, it's pretty accessible for most. Even deaf people can have fun with it if they know what to look for in music selection. Colorblind people should watch some videos to see if they'll be able to handle it.7/10 (Very accessible) Large fonts, rebindable keyboard, non-rebindable controller, and minor colorblind issues.

								It's shiny and very well-polished for an early access title, but it just doesn't feel like a rythm game. Pickups and elements on the track may be in sync with the music, but the actual control inputs required to drive the course aren't. Overall the driving seems too simplistic and there isn't enough to do in the game. Precision-timed and challenging inputs are staples of rythm games, but this has neither - it's more like a basic arcade driving game where the boost pickups happen to go to the beat of your music.

												This game has a lot of potential and it could've been really fun, but it just isn't.The controls are extremely difficult to get use to, it's almost impossible to drift for more than 1 second, the game doesn't really feel like it's effected by your music when your playing, and the game completely butchers any sound that has bass to it. For example, if you were to play a dubstep song (since they have a lot of bass) or perhaps a trap song, it will sound like a distorted mess. The game just can't handle any bass for some reason. A lot of the odd curves and twists will just send you into a wall or will end with a ramp without giving you enough reaction time ultimately leading to you flying off of the track and into the abyss. The vehicle customization is very frustrating. At first from the trailer, I thought you immediately started the game being able to using everything you want right off the bat. Nope. You have to buy all the cars AND each individual ""paintjob"" for it, since there is no real customization like I was expecting. Earning money is also annoying. Everytime you start a new song you haven't played before, it will award you with 100 credits(?). Typically you earn between 100-150 in one song. The problem is cars will cost somewhere between 1,000-10,000. The cars (at least in my opinion) don't have a very great default paintjob, so you will try to get another one. Instead of them being free, the paintjobs on the very starter car are between 1,000-7,500 (if my memory is correct). The biggest problem I have with this ""buy to unlock"" system is that it makes playing the game feel more like a greedy race where every time you miss money, you can't help but to think ""♥♥♥♥!"" while you slam into a wall 3 seconds later. Not to mention about half of the money pickups you get don't even register. It just feels like an eternity to finally get enough money to buy something. The whole ""relax and play"" concept is just out the window for this game, which was a thing that made games like Audiosurf fun and kept you playing and wanting to try different songs.I really want to like this game but there's just too many problems right now. I'm probably going to refund this game, but I won't mind buying this game again if these problems are fixed.			"

												It is not building the tracks around the music. You can not feel any influence of the music other than the background music. Further, there are so many bad design choices. Blurring and reddening the screen and obscuring hazards makes the game impossible to play properly. Further, the fact that you cant adjust your drift when drifting ruins the one thing that felt ok with this game.Go back to audiosurf if you want music based trcks. This one is just a bad racer with selectable background music.			"

												The aesthetic is pretty well realized -- but then, so was Audiosurf's. The track generation is even less discernibly linked to the music you're playing it to. There's only one mode of play available, but I could forgive that and just have fun with racing the ghosts if the controls weren't a steaming heap of buttery garbage. Simply shifting left or right on a straight stretch of track SHOULDN'T be an effort of such gargantuan proportions, but it is. You're stuck with either finessing yourself in such small increments that you'll be unable to avoid what you're trying to half the time, or oversteering and INSTANTLY spinning out and smashing your dumb nose directly into the track boundary.Of course, the controls are the only real element of challenge the game has next to the procedural generation semiregularly producing horrible camera angles or impossible segments of track.I got it for about a dollar and was unimpressed. I almost like it, but it's too bare-bones and rough around the edges to recommend.			"

								It's not a bad music game, load up your music and drive a track that syncs to your music, Only problem is the developers have yet to add WMA support. More than a few people have asked for WMA file support among others but the developers have yet to address this. So, this means if you have a large library of files that aren't supported you are stuck with either not playing or using a converter. Which is silly. Other than that, the game is fairly regularily updated and they are adding new stuff all the time. But until they add more file type support, i'm not going to recommend this game for now. However it's still worth a score of 7/10 from me.			"

								I know I didn't play long now (0.8 hours), but please read through it.I played Dragonforce - Through Fire and Flames -> really good track.After that I tried another Dragonforce Song from the same album and almost the same speed: Revolution Deathsquad.This track was god damn awful... The algorithm that ""scans"" the songs to make the track doesn't seem to work on every Rock or Metal song. Don't know why but it seems Through Fire and Flames was precrafted, cause they knew it would be played.Some other Rock Songs like Black Ice from AC/DC were the same, far too slow in drive speed. Songs that go good with this game are Dance or Techno Tracks, like Anamanaguchi - Endless Fantasy or from the same album Prom Night.Don't really know right now how I feel about this. Probably will write another review or edit this one.			"

								It was a neat idea and I got it on sale for $6.  The driving in it was fairly boring to me.  If there was drifting I couldn't tell.  It felt extremely arcadey(and this coming from someone that enjoys NFS).  I was having a bug where keys I was pressing would get stuck and I would have to alt tab out of the game then back in to fix it, it may have been because I was playing in full screen.  It's possible it could have been from the mouse going to sleep since I use a wireless mouse.  I want to recommend it but I can't.  It's not that it was bad, I have definately played worse but it just never made it to good for me, it was just meh.			"

												Personally, I like Riff Racer more than AudioSurf because of a few things that is better than latter. Pros Free to choose any music of your choice (just like AudioSurf)The beat is more in sync with your music and movement (of course, you can go entirely offbeat)Different atmosphere depending on your music genre Cons The frame rate is not consistent as it goes to the 30 fps territory, especially the loading screen (30 fps animation? Really?)Internet connection is MANDATORY in order to process your musicThe processed musics are temporarily kept and gone once a certain quota has reach (We NEED a way to store the processed music)Overall, I DO recommend this game if you want a casual experience while enjoying your own music library. Now, if you excuses me, I've got some drifting to do...............D E J A  V U "

												This game is great as well as versatile. And definitely a must for electronic music lovers as I find that genre just goes hand in hand with the visuals, artstyle and general design of the game. But in the end no matter what genres of music you love most, you will find great songs that play and blend phenomenally with the games design. To be honest I feel this blows games like Audisurf out of the water and shows a glimpse of the future of these ""Interact with your own music"" types of games. Like the next step from this would be racing on a track of your own music using VR and having a first person view of the inside of the car while driving on the track. Lastly I'd recommend being open to using all types of different music while playing because sometimes the least likely of songs come to life in this little game.			"

												The game is called Riff Racer - Race Your Music! That's what you do. Hopefully you have a lot of mp3s on your computer. If so, pick any song you want and race along to it. It's not a rhythm game as in it doesn't require you to hit buttons or do things to the beat. Instead, you hit boosts and avoid obstacles to stay ahead of a line during the entirety of the song. Drifting, boosting, etc. gets you a higher score during your run.Watch a video of it and if it looks interesting, you'll probably enjoy it. There are a lot of cars and paint jobs to unlock. If you have friends that own the game, you can compete to try to outscore each other. If not, there are global leaderboards. Being the semi-hipster that I am, a lot of my music hasn't been played by anyone else, but there's plenty of it that has as well.I enjoy the game quite a bit. Would recommend.			"

												As a fan of weird racing games, I got to recommend Riff Racer to everybody. The competition is healthy, visuals are nice and the handling of the car feels just right. Probably the best music game out there.If you are like me and listen to music while playing racing games, this one is deffinetely for you. The race isnt about getting to the finish first, but making your way through the course as stylish as possible. Plus there are other people racing the same song, so you can always come back and see how you are standing against competition.			"

												Riff Racer is a game were you can pick a song from your computer and play it (which I'm pretty sure you already knew).This game kind of reminds me of AudioSurf but the graphics are improved and that you're driving a car instead of a spaceship. I played the game back in 2015 (when it was called Drive Any Track) and I couldn't be bothered to review it until now. Overall, awesome game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes games that are based around music.10/10			"

												Riff Racer is a music based game with the feature to drive on any musical track you put into it. The core of the game is to rack up a large score by pulling off tricks on the tracks generated by your choice of music. Overall it’s fun to both listen and drive on the racetrack, with the game being a unique mix between driving and music games.Any song can be used with Riff Racer to create a specific course to drive on. The gameplay is almost like Audiosurf with the looping, twisty design and the score based objectives. As you drive around the track, jumps, drifts, and boosts can be utilized to increase your score further. Along the track are white boxes to collect, which charges a boost that can be used at any time. At the end of the song, scores are uploaded to a leaderboard to promote competition between players on who can get the highest score for that particular song. The car based gameplay is quite unique, using some arcade driving controls similar to other racing titles. The music does sync up to the track in subtle ways. Fast and slow parts of the song are reflected by how frantic the part of the track is, and complex parts get more obstacles to avoid. Some key points in the current song get synced to obstacles on the track. Each of the certain track features from the song analysis is more loosely timed to the music, and results may vary depending on the songs used. Nevertheless, the driving gameplay offers a fun and relaxed experience to drive to your songs in a way that is timed fairly closely to the music. In addition, the competitive aspect of seeing who can get the highest score on a song is also there for those wanting to show off their skill in playing the game.In an effort to showcase your music as the star of the game, the overall presentation is done in a minimal, yet bright and colorful style. The UI of the game goes for clean white text that’s easy to read on the menus or on the track. The track design is quite flashy and retro in a way, with colors pulsing to the beat and changing based on the action in the song. Riff Racer does more than just analyze songs for their content. The game can also categorize what genre the song is and give the track an appropriate design. This genre detection is purely aesthetic, changing up the design of the track and scenery to better suit the mood. Sound effects are kept to a minimum to keep the music at the forefront of the action, but also to give feedback on the various events happening on the track. Overall it’s a clean and minimal design that’s easy on the eyes, and gets visually more intense in time to the music.As a game that takes cues from other similar music based games and racing games, Riff Racer puts a fun way to drive along to the music. The music synchronization to the track might be looser, but the driving gameplay is great and leaderboards are available to focus on getting high scores. For music and driving fans, Riff Racer brings an excellent experience combining both genres into one game.			"

												Riff Racer is a arcade feeling racing game which is based around a gimmick and that being you use put audio tracks through a track generator and race through what results from that.  Along with that you have to keep up with the songs and the further along you are the from the sync higher multiplier you gain.  That's the basic game play premise.  And I have to say this; it's fun!  It has some problems though.  The tracks usually dont go with the beat of the music well (That's just to be expected)  But it can recognize genre (Not sure if its meta data or not) and mood/tempo well enough to match.   Others have reported audio playback issues but I personally haven't noticed any.  And everything looks really good from the color schemes for the song types to how smooth the tracks look.  And while the game is easy overall some of it is hard and overall it's a good time waster if you just want to listen to some music and play games.

												I got this in Killer Bundle 8 on Bundle Stars and this was one of the games that I was most intrigued about. And this is by far one of the best games i've played out of the bundle.Sure, this idea isn't completly original (cough cough, audiosurf) but this is still a pretty good game. Each song you choose will generate a track and there hasn't been one that has repeated twice. For the same song yes but for others never. It's sort of like what No Man's Sky was going for. But unlike No Man's Sky, it does it right. Another thing I liked about this game is that the track and backdrop will highlight in different colours for the tempo and feel of the music. So if it's all jazzy and upbeat it will mix colours like purple and orange. And if it's fast and intense, it will mix colours like red and orange. It's a very clever system and I can't wait to test out more songs with it.In the end, I think Riff Racer is awesome. It's almost like Rocket League. It's been done before but this time it's done better. So yes, I think Riff Racer is defiently worth getting. And if you can, get it in the Killer Bundle because the sale right now for it is crazy.

												In my opinion, what Audiosurf SHOULD have been.The environment still gets a little repetitive and samey, but the track shape actually MATTERS - you get to go flying during a drop, cruise smoothly during a quiet part, and ramp up to a loop during a buildup.It's not exactly a game you want to play for its smooth gameplay (though the controlling and physics are perfectly fine) - it's more or less another way to experience your music, moreso than just listening to it.Only cons for me right now are the unchanged environment (not a big problem) and a lack of support for chiptune music whatsoever. Any chiptune music you put in will be mostly flat and easy - not sure if they can fix this, but if they can it'd be great.			"

												I’ve only played Guitar Hero once, but I really love driving games, so combining my better skill in driving than guitar buttons and coordination, this game is RIGHT in my ball park! All you have to do is stay up to speed and judge when to turn and when you REALLY need to use a speed boost, and that's IT. But the music is 100% accurate when playing, and they don’t kid you: you can play pretty much EVERYTHING including songs you WROTE if you're a musician irl and recorded any. And if you're like me and hate way too busy colors/graphics, the color choices and the amount at a time is PERFECT if you value your vision and don't want to get a massive headache. xD			"

												It's OK. You won't see as much correspondence between your music and the track as you would in Audiosurf, but on the other hand the racing mechanic is more fun than Audiosurf's gimmick. I would say it's a good choice if you enjoy playing games while you listen to music, but don't expect to be able to discern each beat or have parts of the song match up to the track in a systematic way. It's more geared towards rerepsenting the general feel of the song, as opposed to matching specific parts to specific obstables or turns.I would reccomend it if you enjoy these kinds of games. If you are looking for a game that plays off your music and has a neat mechanic, buy it. If you're just bored and looking for something do to, there are cheaper alternatives that may hold your interest more.			"

												This is the perfect music game, at least for me.There are many great music games out there such as Melody's Escape and Audiosurf (both great) that capture the spirit of the music you're listening to. However, at least in my opinion, none of them have come close to Riff Racer.This game has brilliant atmosphere, stunning visuals (epileptics be warned) and simple yet fun gameplay. All of these combined create a music listening experience I wouldn't trade for anything.Granted this game has its flaws such as controls that take a little while to get used to and having to be online to play (unless you play mp3s without ID tags) but there is just something so magical about being high in the sky and driving on a beautiful track to a great song that makes Riff Racer my new primary music player.It also knows how to make the track perfect to suit the best moments of your song. I will never forget playing Adventure Of A Lifetime by Coldplay. It was perfect and nearly brought a tear to my eye.If that's how you want your favourite music represented, this is a game that can't be missed.			"

												This game is a hidden gem among all the other custom music based games. It's really fun to play these randomly generated tracks for each song you have and seeing the variations of difficulty. However the game has its own way of figuring out the difficutly and it's not based on the melody of the song so it may feel completely random to people. pros+a lot of cars and skins for each car+tracks are really fun to play+score system+you'll get your money's worth out of playing this game+drifting+very nice stats system+tracks are beautifulcons-very grindy to unlock skins/cars-tricks are limited to spirals and big jumps, no midair movement for other tricks-this is nitpicky but can't get rid of the main theme song in the menu-no splitscreenOverall, there aren't that many cons that I can think of about this game. Only thing that I didn't like was that you do not have free movement in the air to correct yourself or to even chain stunts which would have been amazing if implemented. Despite that, it's a really fun game that you'll find yourself coming back to everytime you find a new song to add to your ever growing playlist.  "

												Wish I could vote indecisive. For the moment, it's pretty solid gameplay wise, though drifting seems to end/begin somewhat randomly. (Edit, Later I learned that holding down the button to drift doesn't effect your speed somehow, and it causes drifts to be much more reliable)My only other real riff (Ba-dum-tss) is that there is no difficulty setting, rather you depend on the seemingly questionable generator to decide on a song's difficulty rating, which even then can result in a 1 star song that's relatively difficult, or a 5 star song that doesn't seem as bad. By far the hardest song I found was Nervous_testpilot's remix of Deus Ex's Unatco. Which was only considered 4 stars for some reason. (Another edit, I have found more songs that are harder, but simultaniously I stand by my statement, songs can be vary in difficulty wildly independant of their star rating.)Overall, a pretty solid game for the reduced price I got it at, And I'm sure it'll get better over time.

The ability to race any track you have on you computer is awesome and ads infinite playability in my opinion. Considering the game custom makes each track based on the music you select. This feature gives this game soul, literally. I will be playing this often to relax and have fun at the same time.			"

												If you are into the genre of music games this is a fun  game that does a great and fast job at turning your music listening into a fast paced racing game.  Can race ghosts of other players including the top score, unlock new cars and customize their looks, colors.    Not as crazy as symphony gets but its a fun relaxing game when you just feel like blasting music.   The background sound effects arent over the top and almost blend in with any music you are listetning to.			"

												A great game that can be enjoyed by anyone. I play this for a bit whenever I have friends over to lounge around during a lazy afternoon.You basically select a song (including one of your own) and a linear track is generated. Your objective is to just drive and collect points by doing stunts, drifting, etc and avoiding obstacles or falling off the track.Great game, very addictive, great replayability and pulling off a perfect drift is very satisfying.

												This game totally rockz! i always want to use my music while playing in games. but  you might miss a dialogue or something because of the   music. But this game is all about Music.Some may say that its like Audiosurf. but its not.you actually drive a freaking  car over here xD and you will want to have skills to drive .you are not just pressing a right and left arrow only. Love it !  The only thing i was kind of disappointed with, is that there is no multiplayer. Only ghosts..Also. if you have a controller, use it! i think its way better with it.			"

												Riff Racer is sucking time spent playing other games away.Anyway, on to the actual review. Riff Racer, as you probably know, is a sort-of music powered racing game.The Controls are annoying if you use the keyboard but are quite enjoyable if you use a xbox controller.For me, it runs quitely and doesn't have input lag, which a lot of racing games seem to fail at.The ability to turn the different sounds up or down (Music and Everything else are two different catagories.) is very nice to have too... again most racing games have 1 set sound level adjuster. It has decent graphics and colors that don't kill people by being so unbeleivably neon that it's painful. (It has nice colors.)Racing against a ghost is really nice, and reminds me of Sonic and SEGA Allstars racing's ghost mode. It would be awesome if there was a flat out 2-16 Car race mode though. There could be more cars, custom paint jobs, and maybe even different vehicle types.I think it is well worth the money, as I have played it way too much already, for only having it for like 1 and a half weeks.A few songs I played:Metalingus by Alter BridgeAlmost all of the 2 My Chemical Romance Albums: Danger Days and The Black ParadeA few Silversun Pickups songsMy Demons By StarsetA few Hank Karr songsI'm so sorry by Imagine DragonsElectric Love by BORNSAnd a load of others.Do what Shia Labouef would want.... ""Just Do It"" and get the game, because unless you hate music and racing, this game can be extraordinarily fun. P.S. Don't rage at songs like My Demons by Starset because they have unbeleivably tight turns that ARE possible... Nobody likes a party pooper.I rate this game 9/10. But anyways, stay crispy.            (Sorry for the references nobody gets...)			"

												I kinda feel like I was ♥♥♥♥♥.. but in a good way. I bought the game because it said it was multi player and I had a friend that was also going to buy it so we could play but after both of us sitting there for 20 minutes stoned trying to figure out how to make Multi player work, we came to realize it was false advertising and there was no online or offline multi player. Their concept of multi player is racing your friends ghosts, which is pretty weak. With that being said this game is ♥♥♥♥ing Amazing. Smoke a joint, pound a beer, or go balls out and drop a couple tabs of acid and ride the Riff. It's like Audio Surf and 90's retro racer had a baby. Now its more of a racer then it is audio surf in the sense your not dodging blocks while picking up others that are all placed to the beat, Riff Racer's enviroment is effected by the beat, Big jumps/ drops in the track are usually timed with bass drops or heavy bass. The visuals are also effected by the tempo of the song. Overal the game is well done, graphics are great for the vibe of the game, the controls with a controler are fluent and flowing, making drifting fun and engaging, and a level system and multiple vihicles and paint upgrades adds a want to play more. best way to out it, over the past 3 days while working 8 hours each day, walking the dog and hour each day and playing beer league 2 of those days 2 hours each i have managed to put on 8 hours of play time and when im not playing it, it has my skin itching. 10/10			"

												This game is an Audiosurf style game. This feels different because it is harder to control as you can hit walls, fall off the track, this will place the car out of sync and make less points to be had.As for the music syncing to the tracks, it does but some will better, like in Audiosurf, some will be very easy and some will be hard, but I like house music and that syncs very well with.I do recommend this.

												Grab this damn thing already!By far my new favourite music game on Steam. Beats Audiosurf by a mile by having fun race tracks be generated from your music as well as creating wonderful matching visuals (for example, a light happy song may produce less flashy visuals at daytime whilest a more heavier song will be a nighttime with lots of flashing). My main problem with it comes in the fact that the car you start with feels like you're driving on butter because you spin out of control way too easily and i've found myself being thrown off of the track multiple times despite not even doing anything to cause such a thing. Almost like the car is made outta tinfoil or something. Oh, and there's no OGG ID3 support yet but ehh that's such a minor issue that I really don't care because its way too fun to play this.			"

												In my opinion, what Audiosurf SHOULD have been.The environment still gets a little repetitive and samey, but the track shape actually MATTERS - you get to go flying during a drop, cruise smoothly during a quiet part, and ramp up to a loop during a buildup.It's not exactly a game you want to play for its smooth gameplay (though the controlling and physics are perfectly fine) - it's more or less another way to experience your music, moreso than just listening to it.Only cons for me right now are the unchanged environment (not a big problem) and a lack of support for chiptune music whatsoever. Any chiptune music you put in will be mostly flat and easy - not sure if they can fix this, but if they can it'd be great.			"

												I’ve only played Guitar Hero once, but I really love driving games, so combining my better skill in driving than guitar buttons and coordination, this game is RIGHT in my ball park! All you have to do is stay up to speed and judge when to turn and when you REALLY need to use a speed boost, and that's IT. But the music is 100% accurate when playing, and they don’t kid you: you can play pretty much EVERYTHING including songs you WROTE if you're a musician irl and recorded any. And if you're like me and hate way too busy colors/graphics, the color choices and the amount at a time is PERFECT if you value your vision and don't want to get a massive headache. xD			"

												This is the perfect music game, at least for me.There are many great music games out there such as Melody's Escape and Audiosurf (both great) that capture the spirit of the music you're listening to. However, at least in my opinion, none of them have come close to Riff Racer.This game has brilliant atmosphere, stunning visuals (epileptics be warned) and simple yet fun gameplay. All of these combined create a music listening experience I wouldn't trade for anything.Granted this game has its flaws such as controls that take a little while to get used to and having to be online to play (unless you play mp3s without ID tags) but there is just something so magical about being high in the sky and driving on a beautiful track to a great song that makes Riff Racer my new primary music player.It also knows how to make the track perfect to suit the best moments of your song. I will never forget playing Adventure Of A Lifetime by Coldplay. It was perfect and nearly brought a tear to my eye.If that's how you want your favourite music represented, this is a game that can't be missed.			"

 Warning: This game contains flashing lights, Online DRM required for non-bundled songs and framerate cap at 60 FPS lock.Other than that it’s very hard for me to find flaws in Riff Racer, it’s a simple concept bundled with a simple game but it all works together rather well. In case it isn’t obvious this is a racing game that turns any track from your music library into a racing track and places you into a ranking board with other people that have played the same song to measure your driving skills.The way the game calculates this score is kind of ingenious, whenever you’re starting a race a set of 4 lines flash very fast, these lines are actually the multiplier for your score and the least amount of mistakes (i.e. crashing against barriers, failing jumps and not drifting properly) that you get on a track, the most likely you’re going to be 100% “in sync” with the track and get a bigger bonus for doing so at the end. The racing itself feels pretty similar to Hotwheels: Turbo Racing, with the added feature of drifting and with free style tricks on jumps being removed and replaced with tricks based on your ability to line your car properly with ramps. Each car has its own set of stats, however these stats are not defined in the car selection screen and must be learned through playing with each and every single one of them, for instance some cars have better recovery time, some better handling and some have a boost that lasts longer, however these stats are absent when picking a car in the car selection screen.The game offer replay value in the form of unlockables, each car is actually sort of expensive and each car has its own set of skins that go with it that can go up to 25,000 in-game currency with each track giving you as between 200-500 in-game currency if you’re good. The game has absolutely no micro-transactions attached to it so unlocking everything can and will take a while.The one other problem that I do find with this game however is the fact that it can be pretty trial and error at times, due to the random nature of obstacles and jumps you will find yourself doing the same song over and over again until you get it right. But overall I think it’s worth the experience, to me it’s one of the best game to have come out of early access and one of the best games of the year in general, however it does require some amount of patience as the driving can take a while to get used to.

												This game is fun, but mostly when you want to play it with modern (rock or electronic) music. It doesn't read classical music very well so it generates pretty boring and bland levels that don't fit the track well.This feels more like a racing game than Audiosurf, but Riff Racer's music interpretation is way behind. If you like racing games and can get this in a sale, I'd recommend it. Otherwise, get Audiosurf 2, which also has a quality Linux client.			"

												This game is a hidden gem among all the other custom music based games. It's really fun to play these randomly generated tracks for each song you have and seeing the variations of difficulty. However the game has its own way of figuring out the difficutly and it's not based on the melody of the song so it may feel completely random to people. pros+a lot of cars and skins for each car+tracks are really fun to play+score system+you'll get your money's worth out of playing this game+drifting+very nice stats system+tracks are beautifulcons-very grindy to unlock skins/cars-tricks are limited to spirals and big jumps, no midair movement for other tricks-this is nitpicky but can't get rid of the main theme song in the menu-no splitscreenOverall, there aren't that many cons that I can think of about this game. Only thing that I didn't like was that you do not have free movement in the air to correct yourself or to even chain stunts which would have been amazing if implemented. Despite that, it's a really fun game that you'll find yourself coming back to everytime you find a new song to add to your ever growing playlist.  "

												This is one of those casual games you pick up, sit on a couch with a controller, drink and just try random songs to see how you do. It's compatible with 360 controller natively but lacks to tell you or allow you to alter control scheme. Also works with a dual shock 4 using input mapper. This game is VERY sensitive to the mastering quality of a song and will be dramatically different from what i have seen and has a rather odd algortihm as to how it calculates difficulty. From what i see it relys on tempo and bass the most when creating a track. Overall this is a great I personally prefer this over audiosurf as even though its on a linear path it does not feel as confining.Fantastic game but still could use some polish and some scaling to garage unlocks. They were far cheaper in early access.			"

												I was amazed at how much time I could put into this game sometimes. I may not boast the most impressive play times but from the vast amount of time I've had playing this game I can tell that it is an underrated gem in the sea of games based around levels created on your music. The three slots on the road aren't simply used in most similar fashion to that of endless runners that can be found on a mobile app store, but utilize actual steering. All of the different cars each have their own minor differences including handling and drift which mixes up the gameplay. One of the only problems I have is the rating system for songs, whereas instead of picking a difficulty one is predetermined. This can make driving certain songs much more intense but at times can steer people away from other songs. heh steer. Make sure to have all your music files ready.			"

												The best way to do this review is to describe some of the tracks I tried, ranging from edgy mid 2000s alternative to old people music, as my tastes in music is pretty varied:""Flesh And Bone"" by The Killers. This worked very well, it was the first track i tried actually (I don't know why). most obsticles were correctly placed and acted well. Introduced me well. what else can I say?""Joker And The Theif"" by Wolfmother. This was brilliant, the song itself reminds me of one of the Need For Speeds' (can't remember which one). Tons of loop-de-loops in the chorus and pre-chorus, which was just perfect. The game's song detection skills really shine on this one.“Zero” by The Smashing Pumpkins. Bloody hell this one was good. It was P E R F E C T. The song detecting algorithms really shined here. Every pick up, every jump, every loop felt like a response from the song, and it just partnered itself with the song so well. If you’ve got Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness, try this out asap.The Bob Ross Theme Tune. I couldn't connect to the Internet to find out everyone else's happy little scores, and to post mine so that was sad. Fair enough it was a YouTube rip instead of from the album but that still made me a sad one. Oh the track was good though.""Encounter"" from the Metal Gear Solid 1 soundtrack. One of the reviews said that game soundtracks work well so I tried it out. This one was pretty good, it works pretty well, although it was a bit vauge at times.""Sultans Of Swing"" by Dire Straits. I thought this one was a bit off. I felt it was a bit out of time on most of the song. To be fair it is a pretty busy song with a lot of background noise, but this isn't even the most ""soundy"" songs from Dire Straits, and I played much heavier songs on this and they worked better. Shame too, it's a good song.So yeah the song detection stuff is right about 85% of the time. You'll find that it will have little things that follow a certain instrument with the things you crash into on the track and the things you pick up and that. It'll make you smile a bit.The game runs at a pretty much locked 60 frames on my laptop, which is very nice, while looking amazing too. Some 2D sprites need more animation but other than that it's visually appealing. What isn't that good is the controls, which reminds me of GTA IV running at 15 fps. Not good considering this is a game about driving.			"
