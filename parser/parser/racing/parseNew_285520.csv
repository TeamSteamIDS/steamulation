												A decent vehicular combat game, but with a truck instead of a plain car. That in itself makes it worth a recommendation for me. The graphics are nothing to write home about but the gameplay is solid, and it's always fun driving around blowing up other cars.The AI starts out braindead but as you progress, it begins to give more and more of a challenge.

												The first impression of this game is that graphics do look rather dated, but I have never been one to get hung up on graphics. You are driving a truck that can switch between a race mode with jet engines on the back and a battle mode where it is bristling with weapons and spikes how can this not be awesome? However it somehow manages to  be mediocre. As you progress through the game you unlock new weapons and upgrades for you truck. The developers have tried very hard to add a variety in the missions but they basically all come down to racing or destroying stuff. The story is okay, it strings the races together but it is nothing spectacular. This game will provide a few hours of anarchic fun but it is not one you are going to keep coming back to.			"

												By today standards this game is dated, and so I was hoping it may still be fun. But the truth is there is very little to have fun with. The game is dated, no one plays online, the arcade singleplayer action is too easy. In just a few minutes I went through 1/3 of the races, all in first place or top speed through. Wish I could say something about this game was fun as racing with semi trucks is a really fun idea, espicially since I'm a truck driver. But sadly there is nothing I can say that is good. Even the music wasnt great for its time, and when someone was talking they talked unbearably slow or generic. 1 out of 5 stars.			"

												It's a small Carmageddon-Styled game about racing your truck from start to finish including guns, guns, guns, explosions and nitro. However the game is not good but it's not bad too. It has that pretty good TruckMageddon style but it gets quite boring after a while, after the campaign you can't do anything, only repeat the missions, the graphics are kinda outdated and the voice dubbing/cover is not the best.This game was originally made by Russians and its basic language was Russian which leads to some strange voice acting and voice not maching characters moves.Overall for the price of 0,99 Euros on Steam Winter Sale it's totally worth it. A small game for couple of hours. "

												ALthough I've only started playing this game, it's already full of promise.I had to wonder when I first bought the game, ""How much fun can it really be racing a truck?""I hadn't accounted for the rocket jets, chainguns, fierce competition or challenging opponents.Definitely do not regret buying this game, and look forward to completing it.

												Transforming trucks + exploding cars when they make contact with semi trucks or your truck (even if nudged) = epic.I played the demo like a moefoe. I love this game. It NEEDS a free roam mod or mode. someone please make one			"

												Would be nice if they fixed the game and not abandon it. Pretty fun and I can only imagine how fun multiplayer was...Can you please update this game and fix the multiplayer thanks. Yes single player is just as fun but multiplayer would be so much better.			"

												There are elements of fun here, but inconsistent framerate and less-than-perfect controls keep it from being everything it could be. Any events that don't require precision are decently entertaining, but unfortunately those are too few and far between. I'll just go back to dreaming about Burnout Revenge getting a PC release.Update: After changing the .exe to launch in Windows XP compatibility mode, performance is improved slightly. Still not great, and not enough to change my mind about not recommending it, but it does make the game more playable, if anyone is experiencing the same problems I am with choppy framerate.			"

												This game has a really good concept but the enemies even on the hardest difficulty were still extremley easy to beat. For anyone who has played Twisted Metal (The ones on PS1) and remembers Darkside, this is pretty much that. So for Twisted Metal fans I will recommend this game but overall I just won't recommend it for how easy it is.			"

												An old classic shootem up type game for the old fashion type gamer that like games in the win vista versions wouldnt have it any other way in a classic game like this.  I give the game a 8 out of 10 review just becasue its an old fashion game in todays gamer social hub it would not be the best choice for a hard core gamer at all.			"

												I LOVE this game. I started playing it and was hooked. The graphics aren't 1080p / HD, but thatâ€™s not what I wanted, or what my computer could handle. The missions are fun, can get a little repetitive, but I had to beat all of them (except one) on the gold difficulty. I couldn't wait to upgrade my truck and rampage through the next level. So much fun. Definitely recommend. "

												Sledgehammer (aka Gear Grinder) is one of those weird games that can only come out of Russia...  in a parallel future, where trucks can transform from jet-engined superracer into an armored and heavily armed beast, and police are packed with gatling guns and more and enforce laws with lethal force, you have been executed for slaughtering innocents with your truck, but you woke up mysteriously next to a shiny new transforming truck... and was told to get through some training so you can undergo some missions for this mysterious benefactor... Basically you drive around like some weird vigilante who needs to cause maximum destruction. You have front bumper spikes, side spinning saws (later), front firing weapons (primary and secondary), and rear mine dispensers. Your truck can also be upgraded with better armor, transmission, engine, and so on. The fighting is about what you'd expect in such a game... You are in 3rd person but very low, so your truck will obstruct your view ahead. Fortunately you can pretty much run through almost anything in your way, or your shoot your way through. There are missions that are pure racing (where you use racing mode, complete with afterburning engines) pure combat (survive arena for X seconds), or run-n-gun (fight enemies as you try to make it through checkpoints). The more you kill the more time on the clock you get, but the the more damage you suffer. There are a few oddball missions such as ""pilot a RC bomb drone"" or ""max speed into a cafe"". The problem is the first level's ""end mission"". Instead of a boss fight, you're basically put into a gauntlet that's basically 3 missions together. First is a checkpoint race where you need to pass through little tokens to get extra time. When you reach a mall you crash through to land and found the way's blocked, and you need to kill X police cars to get out. Then it's a long run-n-gun to the final endpoint... where I've tried about 10 times, with max upgrades, and I keep running out of time (the only way to gain time is kill the cops, and they sometimes aren't fast enough so you can't kill them (or I'm taking too many go-fast upgrades?!)  So I can't even get onto ""level 2"" (i.e. next city). Voiceover is atrocious, storyline is outrageous, sound is... mediocre. Graphics are tolerable. This is a weird game. If you like your idea of wanton destruction, give it a try. But not quite my cup of tea.			"
