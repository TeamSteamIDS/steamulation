												In case your confused Flatout Ultimate Carnage is Flatout 2 with a few extras. Basically Flatout 2 with a DLC in it would be the best way to describe it. In truth it was a re-release of Flatout 2, not exactly sure why.I hate racing games. So for me to like a racing game it must be pretty damn fun. The game includes a garage where you can purchase and upgrade many vehicles. Your car takes visible damage and so do the AI cars. You can wreck your car out of the race and you can also take out AI opponents by causing enough damage to them.Some of the best feeling cars in a simulation. It doesnt feel ""arcadey"" yet cars become very managable at high speeds. There is even a crash durby mode.WARNING - Don't even think about Flatout 3. A totally different company did Flatout 3 and unless you want to see an example of the worst race game ever don't bother. Flatout 2/Flatout 2 Ultimate Carnage is the best in the series.SERIOUSLY - No idea if the forum is still up for Flatout 3 but at some point I was wondering if they were going to shut it down because of so many complaints. Have you ever bought a game programming book with an example race game in it? Flatout 3 was worse than that.			"

												Awesome remake of FlatOut 2 with the better graphics and working on-line matches!But ""Games For Windows Live"" is HELL:1. The game won't start at all (without any error message) if you haven't installed the ""support/XLiveRedist01.02.0241.00.msi"" file from the game's directory on your hard disk (the setup wizard tries to install it automatically, but fails to locate the file and just skips it)2. The game won't let you play if you haven't created an account at http://live.com/3. The game won't let you play (will show a weird message) if you haven't tied your live.com account to an account at http://account.xbox.com/ "

												A timeless classic! There is nothing more to say. No other arcade racing game has such awesome feel and handling, at least no other racing game that i know of (and i know  a lot). Especially in multiplayer mode this game is addictive.In order to play FOUC you need to install Microsoft GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. You should be able to install WINDOWS LIVE by doubleclicking the exe [LiveUpdateLauncher] located in the game directory. The game directory is usually [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Flatout Ultimate Carnage]BTW: We are still playing it online via ""Games for Windows Live"". The Microsoft announcement from June 2014 that ""GFWL"" will be closed at 1st July was false. Microsoft told us that ""GFWL"" will not close anytime soon.			"

												I've played the retail of this game, the not retail, the steam release on another account and a few times on this account.. So.. What is Flatout UC and what makes it tick? Basically, an upgraded Flatout 2 with some chievs and stuff. But saying that isn't helping much so lets just do a list of pros and cons. Cons first. Cons:- uses GFWL- that glitch with rubbish on the road that normally should just bump from the car but that one critical time impales your car thru the middle and makes it vault into the air when you could have got that new lap record or won a hard race.- online races are either stomps or annoying- not the best graphics, but good enough- you might not like all the modes of the game. personally i think stunts are fun in between some normal races with friends. Not a fan of the derby mode, timerun or unbalanced online games.- way too much nitro as defaultPros:- you can overshoot the bowling lane to spell ""BO...NG""- the commentator in stunts when he gets all excited - seeing a ragdoll AI driver overtaking your car briefly as you hear the car had crashed behind you- half a lap behind when only 2 laps remain? NOT a problem. You might still win.- getting that flatout (doubletap throttle and hold) turn in the curve going exactly as you wanted - playing close races with friends and then continuing racing online together against the world- old but still going strong. same applies to game.- more fun than many other racing games out there. the pioneer of derbylike racing games.- no cliché storyline, just start racing and have fun. - do you prefer to race on gravel, at racetracks or to demolish a shopping mall with your car? Look no further.- match options are ok and exist. typically put 100% upgrades, no bonus and half or less nitro + only half damage and it's pretty cool. If you like arcadeish, not too serious derbyracing with some amount of destructive environment with a flair of stunts, sterotypical AI characters, non-copyrightinfringing carbrands and something slightly more than flatout 2 i'm not sure why you're reading this after watching the trailer, just put it in the cart already you scrub.8/10			"

												Ignore negative reviews, They're mainly about GFWL, Which can be removed with a very simple little patch.Onto the game - It's classic flatout with TONES of mini games, but with prettier graphics and smoother gameplay.If you've ever played or enjoy the flatout series, this has to be the best of the later games.Until Wreckfest is finished or in a state where I deem it worthy of a purchase I recommend everybody to play this one for now!You'll not be disappointed.

Review of Flatout: Ultimate CarnageUltimate Carnage is a remake of Flatout 2 so if you're wondering which one to get, get this one - it offers everything Flatout 2 offers and more. There isn't much to say about this title - it's simply an amazing game.Cons:- You need a Windows Live account for the multiplayer.Pros:- Stunning visuals.- Responsive and enjoyable gameplay.- Appropriate music.- Offroad tracks and tons of destructibles (Including your opponents).- Career mode, multiplayer as well as a pretty fun ""Stunts"" mode.Conclusion:Flatout: Ultimate Carnage is a must for any fan of the offorad racing game genre. It's what an offroad racing game should be - I would go as far as saying that it's better than some of the more recent racing titles.			"

												+ Lots of game modes including a (sort of)campaign, custom play, online, party mode and carnage where you can do stuff like high jump, football, pure destruction racing/derbies and more+ Physics and graphics are excellent(nothing fancy but it plays very well)+ Catchy music that can get boring after a while but you can just disable it and play your own+ Adrenaline!+ Many different leaderboards to compare your best times and scores with the world+ Many cars including different colours+ Many tracks+ Servers still online+ Barely any bugs at all(I've noticed maybe one or two in total)- GFWL...!- Upgrades in the campaign are terrible- Unfair AI further in the 'campaign' - even when fully upgrading most cars they(AI) WILL be faster than you(this is most noticeable on tracks without many turns)- Game can get boring after a while after you've completed all the solo things- Not many playing online(usually one or two people/groups at any time, when I checked)Nothing else I can think of at the moment but even before I bought this game for a second time from Steam I had put at least 100 hours into it, even though I've always had many other games I could've been playing instead(which i didn't because this game is great!)8/10			"

												The game itself is fantastic - best racing game I ever played. The focus on destruction is hilarious and fun. Some of the music is great too, especially if you like hard rock / metal.However, when you first start the game, it won't work work. No error message, it just won't start. It deserves a thumbs down for that alone. To fix it, you have to install Windows Live Marketplace (WLM) a.k.a. Games For Windows Live (GFWL) first. If you sign up for an account you'll be disappointed, because GFWL insists it needs to download an ""update"", but then says ""Can't download the update. Make sure that you are connected to the internet"", offers a broken ""support"" link, and forces you to sign out of GFWL. This problem is caused by Microsoft, but the game developers have refused to fix it for YEARS even though they keep trying to sell it!Since you're signed out, you can't play multiplayer and more importantly, YOUR SINGLE PLAYER PROGRESS IS NOT SAVED on exit; you'll be left with nothing unlocked so you can only play the initial maps. I've experienced the same thing on two PCs, one running Win7 and the other running Win10, and before that I was completely unable to make this game run on another Win7 PC.Edit: Edit: other reviews say Ultimate Carnage is the same as Flatout 2, but sadly it's not. The gameplay and maps ARE almost the same, with only minor improvements, but the graphics of FOUC are hugely improved over FO2, the user interface of FOUC is much more polished, and the soundtrack is new. I hate that I had to switch to FO2, though FO2 is certainly still fun.A couple more things: (1) even broken I still would buy it when it is heavily discounted, as the initial maps are fun and there is a party mode (turn-based multiplayer stunts) which doesn't have any upgrades to lose on exit (but might be too challenging for actual parties). (2) The mouse cursor is broken in GFWL; use the keyboard to navigate it (Tab, Enter, Esc and arrow keys) (3) Microsoft somehow offers two versions of the GFWL installer (gfwlivesetup.exe) in different places and I tried both of them on Windows 10. One of them is 70 MB and is self-contained; the game is incompatible with this copy and WILL NOT START. The other is 628 KB and downloads the rest of itself. This copy worked for me on both Win7 and Win10 (Sorry for not offering a link, as I lost track of where I got it from). After installing it, don't worry about logging into the marketplace, it is not necessary.			"

												*****EDIT: This game was tested on win 8 and win 10, with no issues at all.*****Ahh, good ol Flatout. Where do i start? This game is insanely fun for the guys who grew up destroying ♥♥♥♥ as a little kid, thats for sure. Me being one of them, i was introduced to this series years ago thanks to a free demo on the Playstation Portable, and i fell in love with the game immediately. This is basically flatout 2 with updated graphics and much better features. I know i only have a few hours in but ive been playing this series for years, so i dont want any of the crybaby ""you only have a few hours"" guys. Anyway. For the people who dont want to read on, here are the ""down to earth"" pros and cons of this game: Pros:- Fast, intense gameplay- Online play- Graphics- Physics Cons: - Games For Windows live (you may want to read further about this)- Few online players- AI is very hard to beat in some races- Car always feels like youre going to lose controlOk so, as you can tell there are good parts and bad parts to this game. The physics are realistic as an arcade racer can be, and they may just be the best racing physics ive felt before. Cars have weight to them, you cant hit that tight corner at 100mph, stuff like that. That being said, your car always feels like its just going to ♥♥♥♥ itself up and fly off the road. Realistic, yes. But still a little hard to drive unless you have an xbox controller to make fine adjustments while turning (i dont think gaming wheels are supported in this game). The one and only BIG issue with this game is the useless software called games for windows live. This game WILL NOT start unless it is installed. Many negative reviews are talking about this, and i will tell you how i fixed it. When you download this game, it has everything you need to run it. The GFWL is in the downloaded files, its just not installed. You need to go into your steam apps folder and go to this games folder, then run the ""xliveredist"" app in the support folder. That will install GFWL. Next you need to start your game up and either sign in using an existing xbox live account (needed to play online) or make a local account that will not be able to go online. Its insanely stupid, i know. Its not as hard as people make it out to be, however. Even after you do all of that, there arent very many people that go online anymore (side note, add me if youre down to play online).  The AI is hard to beat in most races and it will almost always keep you on the edge of your seat while racing, because every single AI racer has a chance to get first place and you arent ""guarenteed"" a win like most racing games, you actually have to earn it. The game states that it doesnt support integrated video cards, which isnt true as i can run it on my laptop with that. It runs like straight ♥♥♥♥ though unless i am on my desktop, as this game is somewhat graphically intensive. Anyway, this game is my favorite racing game and i will reccomend this game to anyone and everyone. Try it, it is great.			"

												Probably the most under-rated racing game ever. My favourite game. Since Flatout 1 & 2 on PS2 (also available on PC), and no FOUC on PC! Do no purchase FO3: Chaos & Destruction as this is not made from the same company. But yeah, this game has countless hours of fun, online and offline! Unfortunately will be going offline in a few months due to GFWL disappearing! But still, single player is always fun. Definately retained it's value for a reason.			"

												This game used to be awesome when Windows Live was still around and stored all of your progress. Now that it's gone, every time you play you have to start all over. Steam has to be aware of this, yet they still sell the game, knowing that you will never unlock all of the best cars which take weeks of playing to aquire. I already have the CD of this game that cost me 5 bucks, but quit storing my progress when Windows Live shut down. Now I have the 20 dollar Steam version that does the same thing. Selling this game with no fix is BAD BUSINESS.			"

												First things first; I can't review Flatout 3 because I only played it for 3 minutes, and I've already uninstalled the game, and it's not worth re-installing just to play it enough to be able to review it. So I'll leave my review on that here to say that it's the worst driving game to ever exist.But, FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is extremely fun! I remember a few years back, I was in year 10 at high school, and FlatOut 2 had done the rounds on people's USB sticks. So a lot of us were playing LAN (is that still a thing?) battles of FlatOut 2 demolition derbies, and I absolutely loved it.If you've played that game and loved it, you'll love this... mainly because it's basically the exact same game, bar a few changes such as better graphics. AI players are the same, FlatOut mode is the same from what I remember. It's just updated a bit. Oh well, still a great game. Buy it! And don't buy FlatOut 3! Even ignore the ultimate FlatOut bundle. It's worth paying that little bit extra to say that you never owned that piece of garbage.Oh, and also, I've had no loading issues or any crap with this game, even on Windows 10. Ignore what the negative reviews say.			"

												Pretty addictive gameplay. Cars feel like they have real weight, to the point that my fingers hurt from steering after an intense session. I went from this to Burnout for a minute and it felt like going from driving hyper-fast tanks to toy cars. Here's my complaints:-The color pallette is straight out of Quake. Wish it was a little less muddy. -The music is awful. I wish there was an option to change it out. If you like radio hard rock you'll like this. I do not. -It's sometimes difficult to tell what piece of debris is going to turn into a major wreck vs act like flying scraps of paper. Nearly everything in this game is destructible and debris stays around, which is fun but sometimes the physics are unpredictable.-Games for Windows Live. If the service is dead, why does it still sign me out of my Xbox when I play this game?Other than those complaints, I really enjoy this game. I only tend to like arcade-y racers, like Burnout and Project Gotham. This fits nicely in there. I bought 15 games or so recently and this has gotten the most play.  "

												To me, this is one of the best racing/crashing games there are. I can say with confidence this game is a lot better than Burnout. Although burnout paradise might seem like the best crash and do work games out there, Flatout Ultimate Carnage does give it a solid challenge. I like the unique approach that was taken towards the circuits. It is a little slow going at first as the cars do not have that much power, but over time when certain upgrades kick in and money starts flowing, so do the hits. I find the challenge to get to first place is fun. If your like me though and like smashing cars instead of racing, you still get your fair share of credits towards savings for a new car or improvements to a current one. At first (as I've said) when you play the crashing is slow, but upon purchasing your second car (venom for me) you'll get into some fun crash dynamics. If you go fast enough and hit a stationary object hard enough, your character will come flying out of the car. Yes, you lose time and maybe your place in the race, but you get turbo the more time you are air born! Unlike burnout, this game strives on continuous hits. In burnout, you hit a car once and you are able to send it flying. With Flatout, you're going to need a better reason to send someone on their way. Hits are decent when racing throughout on straightaways, but coming up on a turn serves the best opportunity to deal a lot of damage. Nitro is available and refills every successful hit or jump that is performed. Nitro adds that sweet satisfaction when coming into contact with another car. The animation and feeling they have created when coming into a collision especially when holding the nitro button down, was done absolutely right. One player racing modes do not feel like a grind and the thought of boredom doesn't dare prod it's head.... until you complete the 3 racing classes and the last ""open"" class is available. By then, unless you are a hardcore fan, you may stop playing with such a dedication. A great addition to the game was the mini-games section which includes derby's, launch your guy out of your car into bowling pins, launching your guy into a soccer net... you know the regular stuff you see in the news paper saying that video games take it too far. The mini-games add a great depth to the game, and offer an alternative to racing. Absolutely nailed it here. The AI is also a dangerous threat at any time. I thought I was crazy, but some of these buggers will go off course then come flying back in off a jump. They all feel different and they all feel like they want to race. They do of course, want to hit you, but it doesn't seem one sided to the point where the player is becoming frustrated due to being targeted all the time. The graphics are appropriate for a racing game, neither over the top or too cartoon-y. The fact that they made it possible to destroy the starting gate is amazing. There is a lot of breakable and explode-able objects found throughout each map. This alone makes it stand out from a lot of other racing games. Sounds are good overall while crash sounds are seem to be on the spot while engine sounds are satisfactory (and vary). Music seems to be really heavy into the pop rock.FOR FUTURE FLATOUT GAMES : The only way they could have made this game better is adding local co-op into the mix. There is a two player mode in the mini-games section, but no one likes passing over a controller to play. Having multiplayer online should be mentioned as it ran smooth for me when needed.RATING : rock-SOLID 8.0/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :The AI sometimes for fun likes to hitch a ride on someone else's carThe map designs are quite unique and have a lot of hidden paths within themI'm really not joking when I mean the AI like to get creativeI just turned slightly and next thing I knew, I was getting smashed If you hit something hard enough, your character goes flying from your windshieldAt the start of every race, a flying camera takes you around the track to familiarize yourselfWhat I like about the game the most is that the environment can be broken and manipulated Alternate route part 1 Alternate route part 2. I've seen AI's try and successfully take this route while others biffed itVideo :  Flatout : Ultimate Carnage Highlights Review "

												GFWL, I repeat, this game has GFWL, do not buy it! Get Flatout 2 or something else instead. The developer has no visible plans to remove it, so it will be even less playable than it is now. Also bugs.			"

												I'll recommend this game to those who love arcade-style racing with a twist of destruction. Not only you get just pure racing, you also get these mini games which are enjoyable to play. The vehicles look very decent, even if they look like a utterly mess. The soundtrack is very outstanding, it keeps you movitated in annihilating your competitiors from the road or anything that stands on your way. My rating will be a 9/10			"

												THis is my favourite out of the Flatout games.  Its a lot of fun if you dont take it to seriously. I find it works better with an Xbox controller than a steering wheel (G27). I highly recommend this one. IN fact buy all 4 as one package.			"

												It's a good game but you have to wrestle with the gatekeeper of GFWL before you can get at it. Really disappointing.Edit: Initial review was 2013. Here in 2015 the game is NON-FUNCTIONAL. The GFWL servers aren't responding so the game can't authenticate anymore. What a joke.			"

												Flatout UC is still one of my top 3 racing games I have ever played <Kudos to Brad for recommending this btw>.So why do I find it sooo much fun?Game has been designed with collisions in mind and if you time your nudges or just flatout rams correctly it can give you an advantage to help you win - cool.Love the physics - cars just feel right in how they handle,slide,how you can nitro out of corners to save them etc.Cars have damage models and can be destroyed - sweet.No noticeable rubber banding AI. A real pet peeve of mine is when a racing game constantly puts the AI on your tail regardless if you are smashing the race or playing like a dweeb.Track design - just sublime. Sensation of speed - great. Cars are good , great throaty engine sounds.Graphics - still look nice today (2017 running Geforce 1080 GTX in 1080p).Cool rock music tracks that fit the style of the game perfectly.Game modes Race,Derby (think destruction derby :) ,Time trial and also a whole lotta mini games that are also enjoyable (some are hard!)What a shame that you need GFWL to play this (I use GFWL but I don't have multiplayer activated so I'm not sure if multiplayer works through GFWL or not)This is just what gaming is about to me Fun,challenge,replayability etc.Played using a PS4 controller with  DS4 windows 100% functionality like a 360 controller.Make sure in DS4 you have ""Use Dinput only"" selected AND you have in Big picture ""Use ps4 controller selected.Wala!

												This is a very fun arcade racing/derby game with great controls (with 360 gamepad anyway), graphics, sound, and music. It runs great on my fairly crappy PC, too. There's a very large variety of races/classes/vehicles.It seems to work just fine even with the Windows Live Marketplace shutdown, I've had no problems and can even play online. You still get the XBOX (games for windows live, but it hooks into your xbox gamerscore) achievements, too.			"

												Really an amazing game.  One of the best (if not the best) of the Flatout games.  It has all the best things of 1 and 2 put together with better graphics, more maps, more modes, and a whole second story mode revolving around destruction.  No doubt a great game for any gamer.  10/10 would recommend to everyone.  (BEWARE FLATOUT 3 IS REALLY REALLY BAD)			"

												FlatOut 2 was a great followup to the original FlatOut. It didn't take itself seriously and had nice graphics and style to boot. In 2007 BugBear decided to tweak it, repackage it and call it Ultimate Carnage. It's basically the same game but with some added modes and upgraded visuals. There's better textures, water, debris effects and reflections on the cars themselves. On the audio side the soundtrack has been replaced with lesser known tracks but they're mostly good although it gets repetitive after a while.This is kind of a tough game to judge. It's fun, entertaining and has a lot to like but if you've played FlatOut 2 before then you'll feel more than a little sense of Déjà vu. It has the same cars, same tracks, same game engine and even the same physic glitches. It's pretty much FlatOut 2 with some new paint and chrome which is more than a little disappointing. Fans of the series would eventually get a FlatOut 3 from a different studio but the less said about that the better. "

												Games For Windows Live is still active despite the service being no longer available.  Although you can log in with an offline profile, you will be unable to save your progress.  This renders the game effectively broken, unless you enjoy the thought of playing the same track over and over with the same three cars.Until the game is patched and GFWL is removed I can not recommend this game.Definately one to avoid.
