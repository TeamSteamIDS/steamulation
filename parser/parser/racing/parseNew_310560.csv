Early Access Review
								Since the recent physics update i felt the need to re-write my review.This is quite literally the best racing game ever conceived. I already held it in extremely high regard pre-0.8 and had taken plenty of time to master the game - And then boom. A complete overhaul of the aero, tyre and suspension models. Why? Because the community said the handling didn't feel quite right.They decided to then cram some equipment into a van and drive all the way to Barcelona from the UK to get some more feedback from the real world RX drivers, to help pinpoint where improvements could be made.If this doesn't show some real dedication to the early access model and prove that they're actively striving to make this the best rally game ever made, i really don't know what could change your mind.DiRT Rally v0.8 has managed to become my favourite all time game - Taking the throne from my childhood SNES classics and there's still more to come! I honestly can't find words to say how good the feeling of finding a perfect game and having a reliable stream of updates that just improve it further, really is.This deserves a perfect 10/10 and i'm sure by version 1.0 it will be damn close.

												+ No more Ken Block/X-Games/Gymkhana bull****.+ Early access done the right way.+ Lots of respect to rally history.+ Hard, unforgiving, enraging. Rally as rally must be.+ Gravel handling is a thrill.+ Much better force feedback if compared to previous Codemasters' titles.+ Great, varied car roster. Each car REALLY has its own behavior.+ Awesome feeling of reward, since learning is slow and gradual. You'll definitely learn the fundamentals of rallying.+ Truly 3-dimensional stages, faithful to the real ones.+ It's a ""sim"" and really asks for a wheel, but works great with an analog controller.– Stages get repetitive after some time (150-200 hours), since they are so few. Rally eventually turns into hotlapping.– Tarmac handling still doesn't feel totally right.– Issues with downforce. Cars are light and spend too much time on air. This is a serious problem that must be addressed in their next rally game.– The faster you go, more noticeable are the physics limitations. Especially at Finland, which sometimes seems to be another planet.– Damage system is OK but could be much better.Some serious cons, but still overwhelmed by the pros. The most fun racing game of the last decade. Addictive as crack.			"

This is my Early Access review after putting some considerable hours into the game, playing various game modes while keeping a close eye on the community, the devs and updates.I would like to point out unequivocally to any existing DiRT fans: this is NOT DiRT 4, or anything close to what most everyone would consider a ""DiRT"" game/title. To be honest I'm not even sure why CM used the ""DiRT"" prefix at all, because there is literally no baring to that name except they are both rally games.There is no ""loudness"" or ""bro yeah"" in this game. No convoluted menu's that take 30 minutes to decipher. You are not forced to sit through tedious sound-bites of some jumped up prick telling you how to drive... I'm getting carried away. The point is this in not DiRT, this is something else!Many people have been calling for CodeMasters to go back to the glory days of rally games (MCrae) for years, and it seems they have not only listened at last, but delivered also. It's a sim, it's tough, and by gawd does it scare you to death!I should probably give some Pro's 'n' Con's at this point:PROS: It's a Rally Sim! Make a wrong move and your family will be placing flowers against a remote tree for years to come. As it should be, it is tough! Rally driving is the most demanding style of driving in the world, this is too. Plenty of cars, each with individual sounds, handling and tuning. They all feel different. The SOUND. No game has EVER come close to this. The sound in this game is mind blowing! From the individual engine sounds (you MUST hear them) to the gravel hitting your bodywork, to the perfect shifting, to the bad shifting... EVERYTHING. Menu's are sleek, to the point and very fast.CONS: Still favors wheels a LOT more over gamepads at present, although you can still compete with one (a gamepad) if determined. This has been addressed. Gamepads are now much more configurable! There is a long standing problem with nVidia MOBILE graphics cards in that you cannot go Fullscreen. Fixed. There is a bug that if you do not have a certain amount of GB free space (2-4GB) on your system drive, the game will fail to launch. TBH though everyone should have that at least!Even as Early Access this is still one of, if not the best racing game i've ever played and I have stated many times that ""racing games are too easy, therefore i dislike them"". With this game I have been well and truely slapped around the face!.If you like sims I recommend, if you like rally racing I recommend, if you like a genuine challenge I recommend.If you like easy wins, easy AI, easy life and easy achievements - you lookin' at the wrong game.This is for the determined, for the persistent, for the fighter, for those that ""quitting"" is a cuss word.To those people i rate it: Highly RecommendedEDIT (Dec 2015): With many additions in terms of tracks and vehicles, FFB improvements, gamepad improvements, UI improvements and much more, I stand by my initial conclusion - this is one of, if not the best rally game ever made.

												It's the DiRT game we've all been waiting forLet's get the most important detail out of the way immediately.THIS GAME HAS GROUP BYES. IT HAS THE AUDI QUATTRO.NO THERE IS NO GYMKHANA AND KEN BLOCK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDThat alone is reason enough to buy it.But there's more. Stages are much longer, 4-10 minutes.Car tuning is much more in depth. Varied weather of just about every condition. Difficult tracks. Great sounding cars. Great graphics. The only thing that could be improved is the damage modeling, which is very forgiving even on the hardest difficulty in certain situations. I've never rolled the car and not been able to drive off.This is one early access game you should buy in to right away. We've been starving for a proper rally game for years. This is the best there has been since RBR.UPDATE 3/5/2016The game is out, and it's fantastic. This is quite simply as good as rally games get.			"

												Early Access done right like a driver getting through the sharpest turn by doing a scandinavian flick. Codemasters were good drivers, listening to the co-pilots who gave feedback during development.Apart from that, the most authentic rally game since Colin McRae Rally and Richard Burns Rally. It can please both casuals driving 60's cars in Monte Carlo with assists enabled, and hardcore drivers going through Pikes Peak at high speed from start to finish.What other reviewers say is damn right. Best and most challenging rally game in years, realistic driving (even though physics might not be the best), great immersion, technically beautiful in almost every way and many classic and modern cars to drive. Career mode is simple, yet effective which encourages you to drive each car and upgrade them overtime, then there's player-versus-player Rallycross and online leaderboard rally and hillclimb to prove your worth.I won't recommend playing online (unless you join leagues) other than to earn credits though. It's full of hotlappers with 1000+ hrs of playtime who know every inch of all stages.Totally recommended, if you don't cut.			"

Encouragement EditionSo far I've put 31 hours into DiRT Rally, which is nothing really, since it took me roughly 30 hours to be able to drive confidently. Now that it's out of Early Access and despite glowing reviews from that period, I want to offer words of encouragement to those who have no experience with rally simulation games. My experience with rally sims is literally that, 31 hours. For a long time I thought my big brother was kinda crazy with his Richard Burn Rally, GT Legends and what have you. I stayed away from his racing sims, cos I knew I wouldn't be able to compete with his stage times. So instead we got competitive in games like NFS: High Stakes (the Snowy Ridge stage in particular) and the old Colin McRae Rally games, which had enough arcade handling for me to be able to compete with him. Naturally he played with assists off, where available. I on the other hand wouldn't even know how to begin to setup my car, let alone understand how turning off certain assists would translate into the handling of the car. And I pretty much still don't. For someone my age, I've driven very little in real life, but my mechanically inclined big brother knew exactly what he was doing back then. So most of the time he was kicking my♥♥♥♥♥ both in and out of the games. I keed, I keed.My immediate conclusion after the first few hours with DiRT Rally was that I had no clue how to drive. A drunk elephant skating on ice would have more finesse. While I didn't rage-quit as often as I was expecting to, at the start I was playing only in third person view, thinking that my experience with the NFS, GTA or Colin McRae Rally games would help me here. It didn't. What I soon realized was that an outside view of my driving made me too aware of the track, which is probably just me, but that coupled with racing sim handling spelled disaster for me. So either by brazen choice or through cunning design, I chose the cockpit view to complete an entire stage, which I had never done in any racing game before. Sure, I've toggled it on and off here and there, but I had never stuck with it until now. This had an interesting effect on my driving, cos I was assessing the track and my line of driving more by feel than by actually seeing the track from above. I mean besides listening to your co-driver, which is important if you want to win. All that said, I think it's a good idea to put some 30 hours into it before you drift off to other games, cos being an FPS guy mostly and after taking long breaks from it, I was essentially starting afresh every time I returned. Even if your skills are still there, the stage conditions from Wales to Greece will bring you back to earth in no time.Recently I graduated to Clubman, which means you'll do 6 stages per race and have 2 opportunities to repair your car. While my initial reaction was ""oh no, I want to do more races with 4 stages before I move on,"" which I assume you still can in custom races, but once you've qualified there's no reason to go back. You've earned your place here. It doesn't matter if you finished 3rd, 2nd or first, or think you got lucky. While there's always an element of luck in any game, DiRT Rally will never meet you halfway, it will never hold your hand and even though a beginner like myself will have assists on for the foreseeable future, the game will teach you what you need in order to progress. Practice will take you where you want to go.DiRT Rally is an elegant product, the menus are simple and the soundtrack is smooth, as you get ready for the next stage/race or manage your team. I imagine the Early Access feedback had a lot to do with making it as enjoyable as possible, both on and off the track. This being my first racing game with achievements, the 170 achievements it now has is an additional motivator to get better at it. I'm really glad they included them and that they keep adding them with updates. If I were to offer feedback of my own, I hope to see an Estonian flag among the spectators someday. I also want to congratulate Codemasters in getting it right and returning to their roots. I've missed you immensely.			"

								Right now this game is raw rallying, I truly hope that Paul Coleman and the brilliant team at Codemasters has an ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" attitude towards developing this superb masterpiece further.There aren't many games that ooze this kind of passion. The attention to detail is breathtaking, from the modelling of each and every car to the super realistic real world tracks and the mesmerizing sounds of each unique engine rumble and crackling backfire. So much has been achieved by this team already and I look forward to seeing how they keep on improving as the months fly by. If you love rallying this is a must and a steal at £25. I would happily pay twice that much for a game of this magnitude and content.When you spend 4-5 hour sessions everyday just using an almost fully upgraded Peugeot 205 T16 Evo 2 with no assists and locked to dashcam on a Welsh stage like Bidno Moorland reverse, crashing over and over trying to push the limit and better your fastest stage time, you cant help but spend 59 precious seconds thumb downing all 59 negative reviews.Congratulations Codies, you have made so many of us so happy, your passion for this game really shines through keep up the good work.

								When Colin McRae Rally was released at the end of the previous century, that was some kind of revolution: For the first time, there was a simulation that really felt like driving a car! Now, some 17 years later, there is another rally simulation. And it feels like driving a car. For real! They say they made a physical simulation of individual car components. In combination forming the experience of driving rally cars from the 1960s to today's WRC. And what can I say - an overwhelming success! I mean, I'm sitting here with my keyboard, right? I don't even own a frigging steering wheel. But I do own a car. And I sure know what driving that feels like. And I know that this game feels like that more than anything else I've ever seen on a video screen. Recommended without the slightest hesitation to anybody interested in simulation games and racing simulations in particular. Don't miss out! "

												You like vroom cars? That's great. You like realistic cars flying over bad roads that will punish you for your mistakes...but won't kill you for them like an actual car would? DiRT Rally is a solid sim, with its only real problem being a limited track selection.Two things first. This game requires a DirectX 11-capable GPU, and there is an achievement for having played the game in Early Access. I don't know if it'll prevent 100% completion, but it is a thing.Apart from that, this is 100% recommended for rally fans, and anybody who isn't afraid of a challenge. DiRT Rally is the fundamental opposite of DiRT Showdown, and it shows. Excellent physics (Codemasters' most realistic to date), truly awesome sound, breath-taking graphics, oodles of cars and a great variety of locations already. Between the career, multiplayer (with leagues!), fully customizable modes, achievements, and aforementioned car/track variety, there is a lot of value here.Rally is predicated less on being the best right from the start and more around improving yourself as you go, gradually pushing yourself forward. Which is good, because this game really does simulate rally, and it is unforgiving. New players, trust me when I say you will screw up and it will probably be frustrating - because I sure feel it! And that's okay, because improving yourself in this game is truly rewarding, and driving itself is more often than not its own reward. Hell, veteran drivers aren't always perfect either. This game is quite possibly the most elegant combination of game and simulator I've ever seen.The community will probably tell you to turn off all the driving aids from the start, but they're there for a reason. One must learn to walk before they can run, so I would suggest incrementally turning them off whenever you feel comfortable enough to. Or...not. How you use this game's remarkably wide-ranging realism/aid preferences are up to you.If there's any criticism to be had of this game, it's that playing with a keyboard leaves you at so much of a disadvantage you need a controller or wheel to really get the most out of your vehicle, and you will need to push your vehicle that far eventually. That's not really a problem if you're a simulationist with a wheel or even a spare conroller, though. The real main problem is that there's also only six locations in total for rally, one for hillclimb and three for rallycross - if you play this game enough they'll eventually become familiar, which isn't entirely a good thing for rally racing.The career progression is also rather impersonal: you mainly interact with the championships via sterile menus. I would have liked to see my car in the service area so I can look at its damage in detail. Showcases for the cars, complete with short videos and historical information for people deciding which car to buy, would also have been neat.Don't get me wrong, it's still good and functional and all, but ideally there'd be something more like what's described in this special-interest review[www.worldrallyblog.com] I found.I'll leave you with a few basic pointers:* Real world rally knowledge carries over to this game, if you know any. If you don't, you should probably keep reading.* Slower is often faster! It's better to downshift to drift around a corner than slam on the brakes to avoid crashing your car.* On that note, rally is as much about finesse as it is about having a lead foot - in other words attempting to maintain a level of control. Learn to use momentum to your advantage around corners.* Throttle control is important, but it's much more important with RWD cars. If you step on it all the time, you're going to spin out all the time.* You're going to need a certain level of concentration to absorb your co-driver's course notes and keep the car on the road. The course notes are what let rally drivers really push themselves forward with confidence.* The helmet camera, for what it's worth, helps me drive better sometimes. Either way, it's awesome.* If all else fails, you should probably slow down.* If that fails, blame the mechanic.			"

Early Access Review
								So out of what seems like out of no where a ""Realistic"" rally game appears from the same Codemasters that couldn't really satisfy my Rally needs since Colin McRae Era, dubious I was to say the least..How very WRONG I was, for the fans of the old Colin McRae games this is the simulation you were waiting for (you know they are taking realism seriously when they even give you the option to manually control your launch and even penalise you if you muck it up) so back are the repair times service area management mechanics, back are the narrow tracks, back are the stages that last longer than 2 minutes and for goodness sake back are the realistic physics!.. Seriously playing this with no HUD, all assists off, and just your co-driver instructions for guidance (who you actually need to listen to now where I felt you could ignore in Dirt 3 with its tracks wider than they are long) It just feels so right and so immersive I'd love to try it with Rift.Even driving the starting Mini I feel there's so much room for improvement in my own game to cut down on my times which is going to take so much much hours of practice to perfect. It's not often I have felt out of depth with realism (even after playing Assetto Corsa, Race series, GT5 etc).. and I LOVE it! I ain't even mad I finished 4th after completing my first rally, I was a minute off pace overall (2 track recoveries, an early start penalty and several restarts due to me missing the co-driver's instructions causing me to brake heavy, lock up the wheels and head straight into a tree or three).. Had this have been Dirt 3 I would have restarted until I nailed the perfect run as the stages were so short you didn't really need commit yourself to each run but I felt like I drove as best I could to my current ability, there's not milliseconds between the race positions but usually 10's of seconds and could even be a minute which I like very much and find a refreshing take and really shows the skill involved in consistent driving over many long stages, every crash or scrape can become crucial as the stages progress as you may not have time to fix the damage between stages hindering your cars performance in the long run. It's definitely difficult to finish first but I don't feel cheated as I could see myself where I was losing time this only inspires me to play more and get better, challenge IS what I'm looking for in my sims.There's already a decent selection of cars spanning all era's and some tracks that feel right at home for rally nerds. I can't wait to see what the future brings for this sim, any sim enthusiasts that are on the fence I beg you to at least try this game for a very reasonable price and support this it may give you a reason to let RBR have a rest for a while.Some improvements I would like to see is more debris, loose gravel, mud, anything to make the track surface not look so perfectly smooth, and the spectators are very low poly models, but can't fault the majority of visuals.Mod support to keep this game fresh after the DLC cycles have expired (track generator/community tracks would be suffice also)Although basic Multiplayer in the form of Online Leaderboards/Leagues are already implemented I do hope Real Time Multiplayer is planned even if it's just in the same form as CM with simultaneous/staggered timed runs against friends.Final Note - This does not play like your ""usual"" early access game, the actual gameplay is as polished you would expect from a full release candidate I have experienced a few hard lockups on the menu and the BGM can get repititve quick, but overall had it not been for the lack of additional content which is yet to come (cars, tracks,modes) you wouldn't even consider this early access compared to a lot of other steam titles on gameplay alone.HardwareLogitech F510 Controller (no configuring necessary), will try out the old G27 when it gets closer to release (other reviews have stated FFB isn't yet upto standard).GTX 980 - Game runs silky smooth 100+ fps on Ultra, good optimization and good to be on the forefront of development rather than getting a lazy port.TL:DR Not for the faint hearted, as a sim.. This delivered what I was hoping for!			"

												No Ken Block, no drift events, no annoying announcers, just one hard a$$ rally racing sim.  The best off-road racing game available.  Tracks are beautiful and challenging with many different road surfaces.  The cars all feel unique and are INSANELY modifiable.  I'm talking like spring damper, and sway bar adjusting.  Gear ratios, brake bias.  Everything.  This game makes me want to get a high end racing wheel.Edit:  This game made me go out and get a high end racing wheel, and OMG totally worth it.			"

								This game is unforgiving, harsh, and deadly, however its incredibly addictive. Every failure and crash makes you want to race again,and again. To me its like like a racing game on difficulty insane which makes me want to master it even more. I feel I have to mentally prepare myself in between courses because I just cant keep up with the speeding and cornering aspects in locations such as finland which have fast and easy bends but one wrong move, and too much power on the throttle could send your car up a tree or through the undergrowth. This is the racing game Ive been looking for, for a long time. Think Dark souls but on four wheels.			"

9.5/10""OMFG, Colin McRae Rally is finally back!""First Impression OMFG is this real?! Yes it is!!! It's awesome to finally be able to play a true rally game after all these years. The controls are definitely far away from the arcade-ish one of Dirt 1,2,3. The length of the tracks is great - and not as short as the ones in the old DIRTs. And the tracks have a whole lot more than just ""4"" different curve types - as you might remember it from WRC 4. Dirt Rally is definitely the best rally racing game out there, and after a fast EarlyAccess phase it's already finished!Pros:+ great grameplay+ great controls/handling+ great car physcis+ very good graphics+ great sound+ great rally-tracks+ great co-pilot+ great difficulty+ no ""rewinds""+ best time on tracks ""friend-highscore""+ devs kept their word!+ driving wheel & controller supportCons:- none- ""Wish"": I'd love to see more countries/tracksDIRT Rally is simply the best rally sim out there. Or in other words: ""Colin McRae Rally is finally back!"". Every rally fan can definitely grab this one. "

								WOW!  I never thought i'd see the day that Codies produced any driving game with such authenticity, let alone a spiritual successor to RBR.  I'm amazed and somewhat shocked how good Dirt Rally is.Took a while to get the settings dialed in to my liking and it still needs work on the FFB (base lateral and centering forces) .   Also the damage model could do with a bit of refinement, but otherwise very, very good indeed.Please Codies, don't be tempted to dumb this down or add a whole load of peripheral fluff before release.  Keep it pure and focussed on the essence of the sport.  Continue in the same vein and you'll make a lot of serious racers very happy.If Ken Block appears even once and calls me 'dude' I'm gonna hurt someone.			"

The tracks look amazing and the little things like having a tire blowout when you clip the edge of the track or needing to hold the e brake before a start are nice touches.Pros and cons so far:+ Great sim Rally handling+ graphics + sound effects + detailed track design+ Tweaking and repairing cars- No Rallycross yet- No online yetI recommend as a early access product			"

								This is what us sim racing rally fans have been waiting for ages! The DiRT series has made a full 180 hairpin turn from the stylized arcade mayhem, straigh for the crown of rally sims, a genre that has had no interesting releases for quite some time. It's hard, it's scary, it's messy, it's rally.DiRT Rally is not perfect though. It could have a deeper career mode, there could be a more varied multiplayer experience, the cars could (or should) take more damage on hard impacts, the pacenotes could have better pacing and the replay system is just plain bad at the moment. That being said, the weird panic induced zenlike mode I get in to every single time at the beginning of a stage, when the countdown reaches zero, is something beyond words. Shaving off the seconds from your time at the edge of control while navigating the icy narrow mountain roads or dodging trees and rocks in a dark forrest is a real treat. The sim is still on early access though, and I can't wait for the improvements we're going to see in the future. Early access or not, there's still a lot of good to be said here. The graphics, sounds, handling, car selection, stages and the mood in general are all top notch.Can you tell that I'm excited? Because I am. And I can't stop racing. If you are a sim racer craving for a rally experience, this might be something worth checking out right now.I just hope that Codemasters Racing Studio respects the sim racing community enough and doesn't mock up the final product, turning it in to another DiRT 3 due to public pressure.TL;DR - I love it!

How many times did I restart stages and tried again and again...and again...no other game managed it before to keep me pushing forward like DiRT Rally did...a masterpiece in my opinion...I sure can't keep up with the top players but I'm playing this game because it's just pure joy to race in DiRT Rally!Let me quote the EVO mag here which fits perfectly my opinion of the game in general:""Dirt Rally is difficult, immersive, beautiful, challenging, entertaining, frustrating, shocking and a whole lot of fun if you’re prepared to put the time into mastering it. Since that perfectly describes real rallying too, we feel safe in describing Dirt Rally as the best rallying videogame yet.""nothing else to say than.....thank you Codemasters for this wonderful game...I wish I'd have more time to practice and play it <3			"

And suddenly DiRT rally popped out. I think this next sentence describes my feelings about the game well. ""I bought my 9000kr pc just so I could play this game."" And I have not regretted a moment since. While the game still has some minor flaws like a bare bones career mode and missing a few cars I would like. The whole pacage is so good that the flaws become almost irrelevant. I reccomend everybody with an interst in racing games to give this a try. And DiRT Rally is my game of the year.			"

Early Access Review
								DiRT Rally is a rally racing simulation game from the well known Codemasters which is currently available through Steam Early Access. In DiRT Rally you get behind the wheel of some of the best rally cars from the past few decades ranging from the 1960 Mini Cooper to the Ford Fiesta all on tight tracks winding in and out of mountains, going through ice patches and taking you around precarious hairpins. You may be put off by the name DiRT when talking about a sim but Rally is not like the previous DiRT games, Codemasters have removed arcade features such as flashback and have made it a far more serious game, helping it to become what is already a fantastic racing sim.Before I get into the main part of my review I just want to point out that I have no previous experience with Rally games and I played DiRT Rally with a 360 controller, not a wheel.+Fantastic graphics, even when you're not playing on Ultra it still looks great+Great driving physics, I'm no expert on the physics behind rally racing but they feel pretty realistic to me+DiRT Rally really captures the pressure of rally racing as you constantly have to battle with your car so it doesn't go off the edge of a cliff, or maybe it's just because I suck at racing games+Already 36 different stages across 3 locations to try out (with more to be added)+Weather conditions and time of days can be customised completely when creating a custom event+14 high quality cars across 6 classes which are currently available (with more to be added)+Good damage models+All of the cars have different liveries for you to choose from and use+Excellent co-driver who is very helpful once you actually understand what he's saying+Very challenging+You can hire engineers to work for you who will upgrade your car and work on it between stages+In-depth tuning system though it's only for people who really know what they're doing+You can create custom events where all cars are available as well as compete in the championship mode+Simplistic menu and UI+Multiple camera angles from both in and outside the car+Great soundeffects-No form of tutorial whatsoever, not even any text descriptions. As someone who has no experience with rally this made getting into the game incredibly difficult as I had no idea what my co-driver was saying-Nothing major but the windshield wipers are automatic and can be rather distracting when they suddenly turn on even when your windshield isn't wet-Seeing as I don't have a wheel I haven't experienced this myself but from what I understand from other reviewers the force feedback in the game isn't good at allVerdict:9DiRT Rally is already a fantastic, challenging racing sim with fantastic graphics, great physics, a fair few cars and stages and great soundeffects.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.

Early Access Review
								Nostalgia is a funny old thing. It preserves the good memories of games past, whilst erasing the bad. It makes you forget all the little things you hated about a game, and convinces you the thing you loved was perfect. What has this got to do with DiRT Rally, I hear you ask. Well, its about expectation, and the ghost of the original Colin McRae Rally. I spent many, many hours hooked up to my PlayStation playing that game. I perfected every line, honed every set up. If I close my eyes now, I can still conjure up images of New Zealand's stages. Colin McRae Rally is indelibly marked upon my brain, and ever since then I searched for a rally game with the same feeling.I've enjoyed the Dirt games over the years, but I think its fair to say the game had drifted a fair way from it's roots. Yes, they were fun, but they never really recaptured that sense of tearing through a stage, whilst being one mistake away from total disaster. Easier handling and a flashback button removed the sense of jeopardy, and with it came the removal of that epic sense of beating the terrain. The endless effort to make the game more accesible watered down the sense of excitement. No longer were you flying by the seat of your pants. Going off-line, and hitting a tree was a mistake you could fix. In short, it no longer felt like that rally game I first played all those years ago.DiRT Rally does away with the safety blanket. And whilst that may render the game less accesible to a wider audience, it does mean that the feeling is back. Every time-gain will have to be earned. Every mistake will cost you dear. Success behind the wheel will require skill, and a knowledge of how a car behaves on the various different surfaces. Listening to the pace notes is essential, as is knowing when to push, and when to not. Forget about what came before, and put on your big-boy trousers, 'cause Dirt Rally takes no prisoners.I could praise this game for many reasons, but I'll leave it at this; from the very first moment I played DiRT Rally, I felt like the series was back where it belonged. I felt like I was sitting in my bedroom again, playing the game I loved so long ago.Finally, Colin McRae Rally has a worthy successor. F*** yeah!			"

If COdemasters releases all their games the way this Rally has been released with feedback AND implementation i will empty my wallet for them. They are doing Beta/Aplha testing the right way.Brilliant game and the best Rally title to date, in fact a masterpiece .  Well DOne Codemasters!			"

												DiRT Rally is not for the faint of heart. Previous enjoyment of the series is not indicative to how much satisfaction you'll find here. Closer to a simulation than an arcade experience and precise in nature, it could be a tough sell for some DiRT fans. If you enjoy Rally driving, then all you need is patience and unwavering concentration. Difficult tracks, cars that are hard to master and an emphasis on endurance are all part of the reason why DiRT Rally is a great entry in the franchise. Drivers will be pushed to their limits both physically and mentally. It includes a decent number of Rally tracks in different settings that require many hours to master. Same can be said for the vehicles, which handle superbly. Unfortunately the supporting content is fairly shallow, with the Hillclimb and Rallycross modes struggling to justify their inclusion. There is no online rally competition either, with Rallycross being a poor and flawed substitute. Pay no mind though, because as the name implies this game lives and breathes Rally driving. It builds immense satisfaction as you make corners with precision and promotes consistency as you finish events without a scratch. DiRT Rally is hard work, and there is nothing wrong with that.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

								Just like every codies game I decided to pick this one up with my Xbox360 controller, and i am pleasantly surprised at how difficult it is. Where previous titles were pretty much arcade, this is a whole lot more towards sim. It really takes some getting used to. Braking in the middle of a turn is a real no-go, just like how it would be in real life. Because braking in turns is a no-go you really have to be a whole lot more cautious going into turns, making the whole game a whole lot more difficult and more fun. you can't magically turn back time anymore, so when you've flipped your car you really flipped it, there is no turning back.This challenge makes the game much more real, the challenges of rallying are very much present, take caution going in and out of turns and listen good to your co-driver.The game runs exceptionally well(just like every other codies game). I'm not sure if this game runs on the new version of the Ego-engine.The two stages I have played were around 4mins long, which is okay. The stages feel much tighter, and there is a real danger in going slightly off track as rocks, dips and bumps are very much present. Based on my two runs stage design seems to be a whole lot better than previous DiRT games(and maybe even the original).Overall, I'd say it is a very worthy successor of the original DiRT, maybe even better. As it's early access I'm certain a whole lot more will be coming up(for example Hillclimb is present as ""coming soon""), so watch this title.Based on my half-hour of gameplay I'd say it's definitely worth it's money(it's priced lower than a full triple-A release)			"

								There’s nothing like flying down a dirt road sliding around corners and missing edges by inches. Its seat of the pants driving in the extreme.Rally-sport is one of the last untamed racing types in existence. To me its baffling why the sport is not more popular. Im looking forward to attending my first local one next spring. A number of years ago after dirt showdown came out I was so disappointed by the offering I did a google search for rumors about the next dirt game when I came across a extensive survey(8 pages long) for what I wanted in the next dirt game. The nature of the questions were thorough and specific as far as authenticity and most of all realistic simulation vs arcade racing. After taking the survey I was super existed told fellow racing friends about it. But years went by and nothing... 9months ago codies said they were removing the dreaded GFWL from dirt 3 and making it a steamworks game. Time went by and I thought its fate was the same as the survey I took. Then in time for my birthday for this year we got Dirt 3 Complete. Then I was blown away because not long after dirt 3 came this gem.Much longer tracks that have way more bends and curves with a track width barely wide enough to get the car past. If you play this like dirt3 you will not get far. There is no green line assist showing you where to go. Instead you have cards that pop up before you telling you the about the corner ahead and an audio prompt from your co-driver. I play with no HUD on and listen to my co-drivers calls. It takes along time to learn the stages but its super rewarding when you do.If you are looking for a casual but fun experience I highly recommend dirt3. If you don’t have a Dx input device like a wheel or game pad I would recommend you hold off buying this as I imagine it would be quite frustrating.If you have played dirt 3 or  other rally games and you want a challenge I whole hardheartedly recommend this title. Even though its early access , it comes out in mostly complete slices. The communication with the community has been excellent going as far as doing a little hour long twitch show to show off the new content and Q&A. They have listened to the community and delivered changes  that were within their ability. If your a wheel user like me you will appreciate that was one of their first big fixes was to rip out the cheesy 270 deg wheel setting and give us proper 900 deg. Track Ir support from previous titles is still present and the drivers view positions are really good even if you cant adjust it.  they set the bar when it comes to communication and feedback for early acess.I see reviews saying the graphics are bad looking dull and muddy, frankly these people don’t know what they are talking about. A lot of modern games use filters and fx to make things look super high fidelity and detailed. You wold never see the world this way when bombing down a dirt road at 45mph. And when the weather effects kick in its quite realistic. I’m able to run this on ultra with my R9280x the only time I get sub 60fps is if I run screen cap and steam streaming simultaneously.If you are a wheel using motor sport enthusiast I highly recommend this.

Driving is challenging but not disturbing at all. DIRT Rally would be the best choice to feel the rally spirit! Number of cars are enough and there are heart-warming cars in game. Maybe number of rallies would be more but there are great number of detailed stages in all six rallies and there are extras; hillclimb and rallycross.			"

												When i was a small boy i saw a WRC race on the TV, and after that i was hooked. The way these professional rally drivers took corners effortlessly, flew over jumps as if they actually had wings and how the miraculously came out of ever spectacular tumble un-harmed. So being the naive little boy i was i went out and bought DiRT 1, and it was the best game i ever owned, and soon after that DiRT 2 came along and blew me away with its imersive campaign mode and vast amount of cars. When i grew older and entered my teens I was looking for a more challenging game than DiRT 1 or 2; as i have mastered them completely. I remember the day i bought Dirt 3, another adventure in a box just waiting for my teenage hands to learn the mystery of GYMKHANA. So you could imagine my excitement stumbling upon a page witin the DiRT Reddit annoucing the new game ""DiRT Rally"". I had the amazing chance to help the DiRT community to create the new version of my favorite game , a real dream come true. Long story short DiRT Rally won't be just a game to me, it's an experience which i helped to create. I had high expectations for this game, and all those expectations were met, and more 10/10			"

								Incredible rally sim. This goes back to the days of the original DiRT, with hardcore, white-knuckle rally action, but with absolutely stunning visuals and attention to detail. The physics in this game are unreal; track surface is an actual, breathing thing; damage is amazingly accurate with every piece of the vehicle taking both external and internal damage (and requires repairs in-between event stages); and things you wouldn't even think of are all taken into consideration (for example: the engine putting out less BHP because of the thinner atmosphere in the high-altitude Pike's Peak as you Hill Climb it in real-time.. O.o ).If you're looking for a no-nonsense, hardcore racing sim, nothing beats this game. Worth every damn Early Access penny.			"

												DiRT Rally, despite its minor flaws, is so finely tuned that I cannot recommend it enough. There is a fairly steep learning curve, especially if you will be using a controller of your choosing. But trust me, it is worth it. I use a PS4 controller and it is absolutely satisfying when I pull off Scandinavian flicks. If you happen to be Deaf (such as myself) you can select the option to have icons, inidicating what your co-driver is telling you, show up during a rally race. You might have to do a bit of research to figure out what the numbers and arrows mean, but for the most part it is common sense. Plus there is a tutorial video on it--but overall still a bit tough to get used to. Last but not least, this game is visually pleasing and has neat detailing within the environments by how the road reacts to the vehicle and vice versa. It is worth every hard earned penny whether it is on sale or not.Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it already.			"

												Dirt Rally is by far my favourite racing game. I need to make it clear that I'm not a car guy, and certainly not generally a 'sim' person. Rally is probably the most hardcore sim I've played. What's nice (and I know a lot of racing games do this) is that you're in control of how difficult you'd like the experience to be to some extent. Locking your perspective to first-person only, disabling assists like ABS brakes and UI hints will certainly make the game harder, and in turn earns you a reward multiplier. I wasn't expecting to enjoy making it as realistic as I could, but it's incredibly fun.For the most part you're racing against yourself. It's Rally; It's your time that's on the line. No matter how many times I've played the same track, I need to listen to the calls for what lies ahead. Sometimes I find myself daydreaming and just bombing down the track, inevitably soaring off a cliff or straight into a tree because I got too deep in thought. But I know it's my own fault. It wasn't a bad AI opponent or bad controls, everything that happens is because of how in tune I am with the car on a moment to moment basis.The reason I've put so many hours into this game is the daily, weekly and monthly challenges. When I know I can only put 20 minutes or so into a game for an evening, I launch Rally and do the two daily challenges. A few extra moments? Do a few tracks in the weekly or monthly challenges. You're given feedback at the end of each track as to how you've ranked against everyone else competing in the same event. It's one of the few games where you can noticeably and immediately see improvements in your own performance which is remarkably satisfying. It can also be frustrating to be pushing yourself during an event to beat other player's times, only to cut a corner when expressly told ""DON'T CUT"" and find yourself slammed into a rock wall. This risk/reward nature is what makes Rally so exciting.This game can be really tough at the beginning, especially when compared to more arcade-focused racing games. Once you get a grasp on the physics and a good sense of a car's weight, there is no better feeling than nailing a hard curve or corner that has given you trouble in the past. As I said, I'm definitely not a car guy, and yet I find myself tweaking my saved vehicle set ups, trying to conquer turns and shave seconds off my times on tracks I've played hundreds of times. That's not something I was personally expecting from a racing game, and it's why I will continue to play Dirt Rally for the foreseeable future. "

												The stages of my personal evolution as a virtual rally driver: ""The 'Dark Souls' of racing sims? Laughable! I'm a good driver in real life - at least far better than those other 95% of morons moving their cars on the streets - and I already have some hours in other racing sims. So can't be that tough, eh?"" Bought DiRT Rally, plugged in my wheel, created a custom event in Wales, ""Uh, Group B cars. Nice!"", picked the Lancia Delta S4, 5-4-3-2-1 ... full throttle ... went off the track in the 1st corner... ""For real??? Ok, bad luck. Next try!"" On my 5th try I eventually managed the 1st corner but flew off into the forest due to a bump right before the 2nd corner. Unlocked the ""Mondays Be Like..."" achievement. ""Ok, haha, a 480 - 650hp car on gravel may indeed be a little bit overambitious to begin with."" Selected a 2010' 300hp Ford Fiesta, same stage in Wales. Flew off in the first corner again... About half an hour and several attempts later: ""The game is still early access. I'm sure there are some bugs left in the physics engine..."" Google didn't bring up a single hit. Stumbled upon this vid while googling for known bugs. Got severely depressed. Didn't touch DiRT Rally for a month. Accidentally found some basic tutorials. First recommendation: Start with a 1960 car! ""Drive a >50 year old 100hp Mini Cooper? Me? Yeah... Sure!"" Went on reading the tutorials anyhow. ""Weight transfer... Left foot breaking ... Effectively reducing speed by using the side walls of the tyres ... Scandinavian flick ..."" ""Wow! I had no idea..."" Started the career with the 1960' Mini Cooper... Finished my very first stage with 3 crashes, 1 flat tyre and more than 3 mins behind.  About 80h in the game now I'm back to the Group B and 2010' cars. If I have a really good day and if I manage to stay focused (processing the visual input from the road directly ahead of me and working the pedals & wheel to keep control over that beast of a car while simultaneously listening to my co-driver and mentally preparing for the 2 upcoming corners based on his pacenotes) and with a little bit of luck I may be able to finish a masters event without restart, but then somewhere around 4th to 8th place. With some restarts I may be able to win an event. Being able to finish an event among the top 3 without restarts? Still a long way to go... ;-) Finally, have I become a better driver in real life? No, I don't think so. But I gained an aweful lot more respect for professional racing drivers and especially rally drivers. Watching motorsports with completely different eyes now. Well, and sometimes I discover myself coursing a bit less about those other 95% of real world drivers... ;-)11/10 for a game which can be so frustrating yet rewarding at the same time. Words can't tell the feeling of a clean stage win after hours of practice. If you enjoy racing sims and if you think you are a good driver, this game may attack your ego from time to time, but it keeps you practicing, learning and improving. At the end of the day it is so much fun!			"

												If you're still on the fence about making this purchase jump off and pull that purchase trigger. Please, try your best not to hold the recent Grid releases against the Codie's. To me it seems they learned an invaluable lesson from those two racers, and they're most definitely back on the correct course to listening to their player base. The early access, albeit long, was instrumental in making this game what we've come to expect from Codemasters.  I highly doubt you will be dissapointed in purchasing this gem! While a wheel will definitely make the experience more enjoyable, because the use of a clutch and the ability to hold specific gears does make a difference in Rally Racing. This is still a game, and sure you can setup manual gear usage with a controller but it actually takes away from your time, in my opinion. However, I've played with a wheel and controller. I found the game to still be highly enjoyable regardless of either method, yet I do not recommend using the keyboard, hehe. While it's not a full on simulation type experience this isn't a keyboard friendly game unless you could care less about trying to beat your friend's times and, or attempts to beat your previous best times.While not the best review (I'll leave that to the pro's) I hope this gives someone assistance as to whether or not this game is worth your hard earned dollars. I generally wait for a 50% plus off sale of many AAA games nowadays, but this is certainly not one of them!Addendum: I should have written this 'review' after playing the release version, instead of going by the early access game, because the release version 1.0 is definitely a different beast. Anyhow, my thoughts have not changed overall. Yet, there are significant changes that I won't get into  as ""TL:DR"" as is... but I definitely take back the controller thoughts concerning the gearbox. The 'quick clutch' feature is most impressive for controller users under an automatic gearbox! 'Nuff said, hehe.			"

								At long last, Rally has returned. No more Ken Block and his Benihana! Challenging, narrow and unforgiving tracks is what awaits you here, just what you'd expect from a Rally game. Though this does seem to take it one step farther in upping the difficulty, the terrain jerks the weel and you can feel the weight and power of the cars.+ Realistic handling.+ Proper car setup (dampening, suspension, break bias etc)+ The Co-Driver sounds better than he ever has, alot less like a robot. He even sounds like he's riding a car on rough and bumpy terrain.+ The overall audio is stellar, from engine sounds to stones hitting your car as you go barreling down gravel roads.+ Cockpit view with adjustable FoV- The graphics, while serviceable do look really dull, what is it with devs and their love of washed out colorless nature?This is without a doubt the most polished early access game I've ever seen, I left out the obvious lack of content cause y'know, early access. And I'm sure the minor stuff will be cleaned up soon enough.While it may not have mass appeal like its predecessors, its target audience will be more than pleased.This is pure Rally joy, it's what you've been waiting for if you have even a remote interest in the sport. And it's about time to.			"

Every game in the DiRT series got just that little bit more childishly arcade, hip, Ken Block, etc, than the previous title.DiRT Rally changed that. DiRT Rally is an actual rally game where you do actual rallying. This is a game where hipsters have been banned and Ken Block is relegated to doing donuts in Asda carpark like the chav he is. This is a real game for real men (and women, boys & girls), this is rallye.			"

But not even all the kilometers I ever ""driven"" on the computer were enough for what expected me here.People aren't kidding when they compare this game to the Dark Souls franchise. It's totally merciless: Screw up the timing for a single corner and BAM!, there goes your time and two or three positions on the standings. For plebs like me who doesn't find themselves in the posession of a computer steering wheel and play on gamepad controllers (X360 gamepad here), nailing a stage is comparable to brain surgery. On the other side, finish a stage perfectly and you'll feel like Tommi Mäkinen himself.This game made me respect rally drivers even more than before.			"

												While playing Dirt Rally you can truly feel the hate and anger Codemasters harbors for all those people who begged and pleaded for a realistic rally game. They decided to make a rally game so perfect, that nobody would ask for one like it again. Because, the reality is, you probably can't drive a rally car. That's where Dirt Rally really shines. It accuratly simulates you crashing into boulders, trees, falling off mountains, and dieing in other totally expected ways. The game is hard, because driving overpowered rally cars over and through gravel mountain roads is hard. And so you'll sink 12 hours into a single track with a single car hoping that at some point you'll reach the finish line. Any dreams of one day becoming a real rally driver are totally crushed along the way as well, just like your rally car that has hit more trees than it has safely passed. 10/10, would spend 4 hours trying to figure out how to get around a single bend again.

												WHAT TO EXPECT:If you've played Dirt 3 and are thinking about getting this game, there are a few things you ought to know. While Dirt Rally contains the same basic gameplay and aesthetic, there are a number of key differences in the experience of both games. Foremostly, compared to its predecessor, Dirt Rally is BRUTALLY DIFFICULT. To put it in perspective, imagine how Dirt 3 plays on the hardest/most realistic difficulty. Now add two notches of difficulty above that, and that's EASY mode on Dirt Rally. You can't affect the physics at all, only the intelligence and skill of the AI drivers. I can play Dirt 3 on the hardest difficulty, grab the car with the most horsepower, set it up 100% super trackstar mode regardless of the stage, blast some eurobeat and completely ignore the calls and STILL get first place on every event. When I first started playing Rally, I absolutely got annihilated. You will, upon playing the game for the first time, completely ♥♥♥♥ing suck and will be forced to ""git gud"" in order to achieve anything on the podium. You will also, naturally, be very tempted to punch a hole through your monitor after you ♥♥♥♥ up the last turn on a 15km track that you spent 10 minutes completing and be disqualified because you clipped a tree too hard and smashed up one of your wheels. That might sound very unpleasant, but know that the challenge, supplemented by the very addicting gameplay, will have you practice and practice until you finally ""git gud"" and slab a run with perfect accuracy. The gratification for actually scaling the immense vertical skill curve will make you feel like a genuine badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.This game is for those who are looking for a challenge ONLY. If you played Dirt 3 and thought it didn't sufficiently gratify your masochistic tendencies, this is what you want.PROS:-Super addicting gameplay-All the rally cars you know and love now with more character-Much more detailed and sophisticated career mode-Way, way WAY more tuning options-Physics are more betterer-Much more variety in the stages-Handbrake isn't magic drift button anymore-Sound is hugely improved but isn't as good as sound mods for dirt3-Calls are significantly more detailed-Graphics are very good-Extremely extensive controller settings to make driving tailored to the way you want-Hands-down the best rally racing sim out thereCONS:-Optimization is♥♥♥♥♥♥(I have an MSI Lightning 980Ti and despite being able to max out BF1 at solid 60fps I can barely get that on ""Low"" settings on this game which honestly looks even worse than dirt3 on medium settings). ♥♥♥♥ing HORRIBLE and totally inexcusable for a game that costs this much!-The ""upgrades"" on the cars are not upgrades. If you buy a car that says it has 240 horsepower, that's AFTER you drive it around for a few hours and ""unlock"" the ""upgrades"" that bring it up to that level. It has POTENTIALLY that much HP, but you won't get it until you grind the game. Also behind the stupid ""upgrade"" gate are the advanced suspension settings, so prepare to have your times such balls until you have the ability to actually tune what you want. For a game that demands that you not only drive well but are adept at tuning your car, it's a huge disservice.-Only one navigator voice and he's a limey ♥♥♥♥ who you can barely understand if you don't inhale fish and chips on a daily basis. You cannot adjust the volume of his voice so he will get drowned out by cars that are mid-engine.-Difficult to drive how you'd like without a hugely expensive steering wheel setup, literally impossible without a controller, so don't even try.-Can't choose what stages/events you do in career mode, totally roll-of-the-dice, and some stages are MUCH more difficult and perilous. Prepare to get annihilated on the Greek stages.-If you want to do rallycross events, the only RWD rallycross cars are 350,000 credits while the only affordable ones are FWD. FWD cars are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing garbage on anything other than snow or ice (and I suppose that's accurate in real life as well). Grinding enough to get 350,000 credits will take probably 7-10 hours. ♥♥♥♥!!!SUMMARY:This game is great. It's just not worth what they're charging. It's both rough around the edges and has quite a few... QUESTIONABLE design decisions that will make you hate yourself for liking this game so much. I wouldn't pay more than $30 for this game, and that's only if you're like me and have nothing that resembles a life and will be proud of yourself for mastering the insane difficulty of this game... or I guess, if you really like rally racing or whatever.

								So I'm gonna list the things that left a really good impression in my mind:- Tracks so narrow, I couldn't make a U-Turn in Monte Carlo, after sliding my Abarth. Seriously tho, it's so much better to actually be able to enjoy a realistic looking rally track, instead of the half a mile wide stages in Dirt 3. It's a welcoming feature that I greatly enjoy and really helps with the sense of speed. The tracks are also far more densely populated with vegetation - the ones in Wales especially and some of the higher parts in Greece. I actually felt as if I was racing through a forest and It definetly helps with the immersion.The track surface is also far more varied in terms of texture and it feels way more bumby than previous Dirts. Cars no longer soak up potholes and uneven surfaces as if they weigh 20kgs. Really good job there. - The cars themselves were always really well modeled in Codemasters games and this one is no exception, sounds are epic and violent, damage model is good, accumulating dirt on the car etc. No surprise here. - Co-driver is finally helpful, insted of just riding shotgun and chillin' (although, the abscence of a mini map forces you to listen to the guy, no complaint here, I've always wanted to learn how to read pace notes) - The abscence of a minimap, definetly makes rallying more intense and with the help of Mr. Co-Driver, I'm now always trying to read the stage a turn or two in advance. Helpful tips such as ''logs on the left'', help a lot.Overall, there is tons of potential in this new Dirt. I am geniuenly happy with my purchase, but bear in mind that I've always been a Codies racing game fan. With that said, compared to Dirt 3, I definitely think that this game is heading in the right direction. While at this point, the content is limited to 3 unique settings with multiple stages, and just rally cars from different eras, I expect greatness from Codemasters. P.S. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't wait for the Hillclimb mode to come out! PIKES PEAK CODIES - I NEED IT!!!			"

												The ice sections really try my patience... I've never yelled so much at my computer =)I've got 600+ hours on Dirt3, but will probably never play it again now that this game is out.  This game is much harder to learn and control, but in a good way.  Much more realistic in both appearance and feel than dirt 3.  This game feels like a true rally/RX experience.Be aware before purchasing this game that it is much more down the simulation line than dirt 3.  If you're not up for a challenge learning to maneuver a vehicle on the edge of control, this might not be the game for you.  I would imagine it might be hard to play on the keyboard, though I haven't tried.  Works great with a gamepad or wheel.* Awesome physics.  Makes you feel like you're actually driving a rally car.  * Much improved graphics.  The dusty stages I start to think I can't breath well and need a mask...* Better rally stages.  Not only is everything more realistic, from the scenery to the bumps, dips, rocks, potholes, etc. but they're also longer than the dirt 3 rally stages, which is great.* Overall just feels much more like a rally sim and less like NFS on dirt.  I loved dirt 3, but it was much more ""arcade"" style than this.You may find yourself on the verge of rage-quitting on the icy section of monte carlo like me, only to find yourself unable to do so until you finally finish a clean run.... No other game has given me such a mix of frustration and addiction at the same time.Really the only thing I haven't been impressed with this game is the limited PvP community.  While there's a number of dedicated fans on at any given time, it's not the type of game you can hop on at any hour of the night and find online sessions available.  Still single player offers a lot of enjoyment for those times.			"

								Initial  review:It's only in early access at the moment, but  this  has to be the  best and most realistic rally game I've ever played.  It's got the Dirt basics with respect to menus etc, but what's different about this game is you get a support team Who repair  your  vehicles. They also learn  to improve  your car through experience.  There's only  a few   rally tracks at the moment (Greece, Wales and Switzerland), but  more to come.  The game is also quite cheap for a AAA  racing game.  The sounds of the vehicle travelling over the roads and tracks, the crashes, the  sound of  gears changing and the engine revving etc, all are pretty convincing.  I'm hoping   they will add this to the Track IR (with 6 degrees of Freedom) and the Novint Falcon peripherals soon as the  ability to look around with the track IR  without using   any keys plus  the  force feedback you'd get with the Falcon would add another dimension to this game.I've never driven a rally car, but  this  makes me  feel like I am.  Oh yeah!  I forgot to mention, the more you crash, the more beat up your vehicle looks.     :)Check the short  intro video HERE "

I totally recommend it as a motorsport experience.			"

												This is the most physically, visually, and audibly stunning rally game out there. And it's only in Early Access!The physics are great (nothing like DiRT 1, 2, or 3), and when racing through the incredibly detailed stages you feel like you're really there :)The best way to describe the physics is 'sim'. Not arcady like the older DiRT games. Optimization is fantastic, I have been able to keep a mostly solid 60FPS at 1080p on my reasonably old GTX 770 and i5 4670, with the Ultra preset and 4x AA (considering it recommends a GTX 780, this was a great surprise for me). Using Nvidia's adaptive V-Sync I rarely notice the fps drops (worst I've had was 50 fps). You could easily run it 100% solid 60fps if you tweaked the settings a bit, but I couldn't be bothered. Content-wise, there is a good amount of cars and tracks, and every single track is beautifully modeled. As it's early access, there will be more content on it's way and not to mention the possibility of DLC once the game is finished. Works great with my G25, and you can tweak all the FFB settings (like how much feedback you want from the tires, etc). Graphically it's beautiful, not much else I can say about that.If you like rally games and sims, this game is for you. If you're looking at getting an arcade game like DiRT 3, then nope you probably won't enjoy it, as it is HARD.Oh, and when your co-driver says ""Don't Cut"", really, don't cut.			"

Early Access Review
								After playing Dirt 3 again for a bit, I decided it probably was worth a punt on this, despite vowing never to do 'Early Access' again, and despite not being especially good at games generally. Because the +ve reviews which convinced me it was brilliant and worth a try also seemed to universally say this is HARD.And they were right. On both counts. And after a while playing and crashing many, many cars, I actually see both as plus points.Put it like this; this game is not only going to see me shortly ditch my new shiney XBox Elite controller and get my G25 wheel out of retirement, but is also is making me seriously consider splashing out an additional ~£300 for another monitor and GFX card for a 3-monitor display. Yes; it really is that good.If you've liked rally games before and have a decent spec PC, you'd frankly be daft not to get this. Yes; it's quite challenging, and if you're a mediocre player/rallyer like me, you can probably expect not to win anything for quite a long time. But actually, the overal curve seems to be pretty fair. Even if you don't actually win, outright losing is also pretty hard, provided you can at least keep moving vaguely along the track.The majority of tracks I've seen so far are just beautifully done. By far the most interesting in any rally game I've ever tried. And the co-driver navigation is simply brilliant. Sometimes so much information, and so fast that you are still trying to interpret instructions pertaining to 3 turns ago.In short; get it. And a decent wheel. And (at least) 3 monitors. And a new sound system. And a pneumatic seat. And an even better PC (or blade array). And a spare garage to put it all in. And a ticket booth outside to charge people to have a go on it. It'll pay for itself in only about 50 years. (Because you'll be on it yourself most of the time.)			"

												Definitely the best rally game out there. Tons of content here starting from campaign mode where you can take part in championships in one of the three disciplines (rally, rallycross or hillclimb) and then there are online events with daily, weekly and monthly challenges where your time gets ranked with all the other players that took part in them.Gameplay- Tons of cars, all with different handling which can make the game completely different when you switch between them- Great variety of maps, each one requires different approach in terms of handling the car well- You can do in depth car setup customization which can make a huge difference how your car handles at different surfaces leading to better end results- Forget about dirt 3 and all of the previous arcade games, this ones takes time and skill to master- Learning to manual shift gears, customize car setup and lots of practice is what it takes to winGraphics- Amazing graphics, haven't seen a better looking racing game so far- Driving in cockpit camera with some bad weather can take your breath away- Car damage is very much present, it also can feel a little bit unreal at some times- All in all, great looking game with stable FPSI would describe the game as a dark souls of rallying. It takes time and effort to master but the reward is greatly satisfying! "

								The best codemasters published game in 10 years. Enjoying very much so far. Only the default sets are way too understeering, gear ratio is poor and needed to drop steering saturation with g27 to half. To get better feel of grip, tire sounds should be higher and any additions to tire behaviour would be nice. Currently feels that the grip is same for each tire even driving half car on ice and and half on deep snow. Only when tire burst the balanse gets less symmetrical. But excelent  start in early access. Richard Burns Rally is finally getting a proper competitior.			"

Early Access Review
TL;DRHard, but fair, and gives you some breathing room even if you make mistakes. (As I often did)A simcade player's view on Dirt:RallyDisclaimer: This is a review written by nowhere-near-a-pro racer who does it purely for fun and intended for those who are similarly-minded. If any portion of the following causes you to want to type “git gud” in the comments, you're not the intended audience. There are plenty reviews detailing every simulation aspect elsewhere on this page.That said, to my noobrethrenThis is the best type of simulator. Yes the current press releases and this very page boasts mostly about the reworked physics, the painstaking recreation of sufaces and handling, but the biggest thing for me is different, and that is that Dirt: Rally, seeking simulation glory, does not forget to be a fun game. I play games for relaxation and entertainment, and this game provides. It punishes mistakes, yes, but it doesn't do so unfairly, and unlike many other sims a small slip won't ruin your entire day. I was disappointed at first with the exclusion of Codies' famous flashback system, as it could give some breathing room to the tightest situations in other games, but the game without it is not as punishing as I thought it would be. If you get flung far off the track, you can reset with a time penalty. If you get seriously damaged, you can restart the stage — they are mostly not that long despite what it might have looked like with the ""realism"" goal. You lose some of the bonus for restarting, but that has been the case for flashbacks in previous games, so it's clear where it's coming from. The handling system is not easy to master, but largely intuitive, and I've seen some improvements even by the second stage. Word of advice: Don't aim for first place at first. It is intentionally set to be a goal that's hard to achieve. Opponents are nicely spaced out, and in most cases even losing very very badly won't get you a last place.			"

I was a huge fan of Dirt 3 but I was dissapointed in the small stages in Dirt 3... but guess what... LONG and SHORT stages as well as Pikes Peak's famous hillclimb tournaments... The classes range from 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, kit cars, 1990s 2000's and modern as well as the infamous WRX v EVOs... Numerous countries such as Germany, Finland, Sweden, Greece, Wales and more... Numerous tournaments including online tournaments, you can create your own tournaments and put them online, leaderboards, daily, weekly and monthly challenges to earn more ingame $$$ (which you use to purchase cars, otherwise you must rent them), NO PAY TO WIN WHATSOEVER... completely in-game currency from completing tournaments.... Realistic driving simulation and damage... be prepared, you can puncture your tyres in which it costs you +1:30 on your finish time, you can damage your radiator, you can even stack so hard that you forfeit the race and if your vehicle is beyond repair, costs you the WHOLE championship XD... Co-driver is fantastic... you can even speed up or slow down his instructions to your liking... The replays are nothing short of spectacular... even has some awesome drone camera angles from the air... the camera/view features 2x 3rd person, bonnet, inside windscreen, an awesome cockpit view and my all time favourite, that bumper view where you see no part of the vehicle whatsoever (I use this when in serious mode, as I drive the best in this view which I'm spewing coz I love seeing the car... Even when you create your own tournament, you can restrict the view to cockpit only!This game is also open to steam workshop where you can upload your vehicle setups for whichever car, for other people to download... which comes in handy if you're anything like me and not interested into the nitty gritty of the art of mechanics and aerodynamics... I JUST WANNA RACE!!!!I have my game set to high with shadows and other non-essential extras set to medium and it looks absolutely gorgeous with excellent frames running off a GTX 680M (laptop)... the sound is brilliant really immersive... don't even think about TEAMSPEAK while playing this, even with ALL the audio set to it's lowest, you still won't hear your friends over the roaring and screaming of your engine... I cannot fault this game at all... and I'm being completely honest this game really impressed me, CODEMASTERS really put every ounce of love they had into this game, I feel sorry for their spouses...HOWEVER if I were to really try and look for a fault in this game, I'd say that there are idiots who cheat their way to the top of the leaderboards as I discovered that someone with only 24 hours experience defeated a person with 450 hours experience using the same car by almost a whole minute... and we all know in racing, 1 second is a lot of time! upon inspecting this guys profile, I noticed he has a current ban for cheating (surprise surprise) so I just reported him anyway...Another thing I thought of... it doesn't have an Australian Rally, remember in Colin McRae those awesome as Aussie tracks with the train lines through the bush... well no Aussie tracks :'( Last but not least.... this game has held it's price tag, it goes on special quite often but not enough for people who aren't willing to give this game a go...My verdict....10/10 it really is a modern gem, and one that comes out completed and without the over priced abuse of marketing technique for dlcThis game in my opinion is actually worth $60USDit has really impressed me, and i'm not evcen a car freak or one of those gamers with ONLY racing games... This is the ONLY racing game that I can spend more than an hour playing!THANKYOU CODEMASTERS.... THANKYOU :')			"

												Easily the best rally game I have ever played. DiRT Rally brings back the best aspects of old Colin McRae Rally games and combines it with great visuals even better than in older DiRT titles.Beware though, the game is hard. I'm trying to play it on a gamepad without any assists enabled and it's truly challenging - taming a RWD Group B car on ice is nearly impossible!My biggest issue with the game? Multiplayer is Rallycross exclusive - so you can't compete with other drivers on rally nor hillclimb stages. Shame, because DiRT3 did it perfectly :(			"

												Let me discribe the 4 stages of rally mania.Stage 1.Driving home after work. 200. Past the supermarket. 50, square left.Don't cut.Into parking to stop.Stage 2.At the supermarket.Straight untill dairy.Right 3 at the cheeses.Into left 3 towards dry foods.Hairpin right. Don't cut.Past the bacons.200 to stop.Stage 3.Cooking dinner.Right 5 around cat, caution.Hairpin - right where my girlfriend left it.To fridge and left 3 bags of groceries in the car.Proceed to tear basilic leaves, don't cut.This is becoming quite punny, to stop.Stage 4.No ... enough, stop, lets cut to the chase. *drives off cliff*Don't cut.Does my girlfriend think I'm crazy?Has this game impacted my life?Is this my final cry for help before I'm consumed by the dark deep fear of cutting?Perhaps.All I know for now is ... don't cut, or bad things will happen.___Seriously though, the game features narrow stages. Going off road just a little means getting the nose stuck in the snow, hitting a rock, trees, or simply making some exhuberant flips and rolls because the ground isn't flat anymore. The maps are really nicely made with a lot of detail, and are very fun to drive. Big improvement over DiRT 3 are the menus: clean, with non-intrusive background music, and plenty of options. Overall a great rally experience.This game is not easy, but you wouldn't like it if it was.			"

												What can I say? Well, DiRT Rally is the ultimate Rally game, offering a realistic simulation of the real sport. Compared to the older games in the series, this feels truly incredible to drive in as the physics have improved massively. The game comes with a lot of cars and liveries, very detailed tracks and challenging AI.It's well worth picking up the DiRT Bundle in a sale, however this game alone is well worth the full price!

												So, DiRT Rally then.Codemasters, I see you finally did a proper rally game, without that silly Gymkhana stuff that previous DiRT 3 was all about. Kudos. I am not saying that Gymkhana is crap, but knowing the fact that previous games were all about Colin McRae + rally, the last DiRT 3 basically ditched him. Sad. Instead, Ken Block took over unofficially. The situation with DiRT Rally is a little bit different.Firstly, at the time of writing this review, this game focuses mainly on rallying. There are couple of additions: rallycross and Pikes Peak hillclimb. Sadly, only rallycross is supported to play online with other fellow drivers. Multiplayer could mean that it's rallycross that will be mainly played.Secondly, nobody is the leader. This time Codemasters played it safe: not naming the ""unofficial"" leader.Sweet graphics, but I still was expecting a little more than a revamped setup from DiRT 3.Speaking of driving, I am satisfied by physics, they are OK. Since I am using a Logitech Driving Force GT, I enjoy this game quite alot. It's quite hard to get the proper settings for your steering wheel. And that is the only thing that I dislike about this game.9/10.Codemasters - I really hope that in near future this game will outgrow the WRC series by Milestone (or whatever company that made it). It's you, Codemasters, that were always the kings of rally gaming. Make us proud. And you already did.			"

Update 3/2017: Got back on to see if anything has changed for the better, the answer is no. Finally time to uninstall.As someone who got this game almost day 1 of Early Alpha, I keep coming back to try and update my review. I loved this game in its early stages but its now a full release and it's just not that good. It definitely has the best fanboys though, as all the objective and critical reviews and buried deep underneath piles of ""this game is so hard I rolled on the first corner so obviously its super realistic"" nonsense. And I'm sure many will dismiss this as me being bad at the game (despite being on the top 5% of leaderboards) or that I just don't get it (despite having played this entire series since McRae 2.0 all the way through to DiRT3, and various simracers like Assetto), but here is an actual critical review instead of making jokes about cars rolling over.The BadJust on content alone, my decision would be ""No"". The price you pay for what you get is pretty terrible. All things considered, there's really not that much more content than there was in alpha (at the time of review). There's only 5 rally locations and there's only like 3/4 long tracks in each location, which then get broken down into smaller segments to create an illusion that theres more content then there actually is. There's also a lack of cars. The diversity(60s, Group B, Group A, etc) is pretty good, but the choices within these groups is terrible. Most only have 2 or 3 cars to choose from. The new Seb Rally EVO and WRC games put Dirt Rally to absolute shame in this regard. On paper you might look and say ""but there's also Hillclimb and Rallycross"", and I'll reply with those are so underdeveloped it's even less than an afterthought. The content/price is just not there. Now onto the meat of the game. First off lets get this out of the way, not having rewinds is a stupid idea. There is no discussion about this. The fanboys will try to tell you til they are bleeding out of their mouths that this makes the game ""more realistic"" but guess what, you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Not having rewinds is literally a waste of life as the game screws you over with its terrible tire puncture model(more on that later) or with its terrible track edges which defy any and all physics and send 1000kg cars flying 2-stories into the air upon the slightest contact, which I assume is to prevent exessive cutting, but screws over people who just got off track a bit. The track edges have been a well documented issue which was mostly ""fixed"" in the later Sweden and Finland stages, but still exist in all the other tracks. But that's a liveable annoyance compared to the balloon, I mean tire, model. Which again, wouldn't be that bad if you could just rewind instead of a) restarting completely or b) taking a 1:30 penalty for something that in some cases isn't even your fault (and that's the part that really upsets me). Smashing into something with the side of your car will lead to a puncture 100% of the time regardless of how slow the impact was, which can usually be understandable. Where the BS comes in is in situation where damage to the front of the car results in a rear puncture or vice versa. I've rolled the car onto its roof before and I kid you not, as I did so my co-driver called out a puncture. Its this kind of unrelated damage leading to a puncture that will drive you mad. But STILL, that's nowhere near as bad as the Finland Phenomenon where you get punctures for no reason. You can stay on the track 100% of the time and still get punctures out of nowhere. And again this wouldn't be that big of an issue if I could just rewind the BS punctures back, but you can't. Not having rewind is NOT a feature. It just wastes so much of your actual life.And yet ANOTHER bad feature that could be ignored if they simply added rewind: the pacenotes are terrible. Not everywhere but in enough places on enough stages to throw you off. This game makes terrible use of the ""plus"" and ""minus"" modifiers and considers some turns to be ""straight"" enough not to even warrant a ""6"" whereas on other stages turns much straighter will be marked as a ""6"", leading to confusion on how bad the turn actually is. There is no way to change this. Likewise the timings are inconsistent. Some stages you'll be going along wondering why a turn was called so early or furious that one was called way too late. And theres no way to change it (you can set calls to early/normal/late but that applies to ALL of them, not just the ones you want to change). This is another case where a simple rewind (see the theme here?), now knowing that the turn is tighter/wider or earlier/later, would basically turn this into a non-issue. The only thing that a rewind couldn't solve is the UI. Terrible design. Takes 11 button presses to do things that should only take 2. Still a waste of real life, but a minimal complaint compared to everything else. FFB seems to be a pretty subjective topic, but I personally find it not great and inconsistent. Maybe if you want to spend 5hrs digging around in settings you can make something good, but I believe it should work decently out of the box, which it doesn't (at least with default setttings on the G27). Again, subjective and there is a lot of customization available, but this might be the worst default FFB out of all the games I've played.The career mode is a joke, to the point where I've had this game since alpha launch and it took me this long to remember it exists. Its just premade events (like the custom single events you can play) strung along one after the other to make up a ""season"". You can hire different engineers which are better at fixing certain parts as if it actually makes a difference (spoiler alert: it doesn't) and you can unlock skills for them which don't affect repair time or skill or anything actually useful, just how fast you unlock ""upgrades"" for your car. The upgrades are another joke, each car has 3 and I dont even know what they are because that's how generic the upgrade system is. They also don't make any noticible difference after being added onto your car. Zero/minimal effort was put into this. The GoodI don't need to go into this too much since the good reviews are the only ones getting upvoted. But as other people say, graphics are good, probably the best of all rally game out there. I've had very few stutter and pop-in issues with an Nvidia card on max graphics, very rare but they exist. Sound is also probably the best you'll get from the current selection of rally games. For the most part its an immersive experience all around. Pretty good and fairly dense crowds, although definitely should be more dense in some parts (going off of real life footage) and its a shame they don't try to get out of your way. Even if you're trying to turn your car around at <5mph after a spin or something, the crowd won't move and its instant +15sec penalty upon contact. But great in-game and replay camera angles really add to the immersion. The in-car camera also has a bunch of customization movement-wise (up/down, forward/back, etc). The co-driver is a bit quiet and there is no audio slider to change this, but he does speak clearly at least. I'll give it credit for taking a franchise which completely lost its way and attempting to get it back on track. Because that's really why this game exists. Its basically a giant beta for Dirt Rally 2, which is how the devs have been treating it if you follow their diaries the youtube channel. I'm glad this game exists and the racing community is better because it does, but this is far from the ultimate rally game. It is however, a promising step forward and for the future of this franchise. Online leagues are the only thing that keep me coming back, if it wasn't for the bragging rights of beating other people I'd really have no interest left unless some new content or drastic changes were added.

								(Wishes/suggestions for the devs at the bottom of this review)+ That oldschool rally feeling+ graphics (especially the backdrops)+ Cars from the 70's right up to the modern era.- Campaign needs a lot of work. As of this date, it's simply a bunch of randomly generated and repeated championships.7/10. (10/10 of campaign gets fleshed out properly.)Would crash again!-- Wishes and suggestions --Put the player in a real rally racers shoes. We want to experience the interaction with team management, sponsers, sms, emails, fan-chat, videos, news! Get some voice actors. I loved how ealier games did a whole trailer interior design, with TV's screens and such, that was awesome, and made me come back for more.Don't just throw random racemaps in the players face. Make it like it is in real life, in the correct order, with the right tournament names.Really, the hard part is over, you got the game mechanics working. Now you just gotta make us, the players, feel at home in your game (how hard can it be? ;)			"

												Dirt Rally ditches the gimmicks and focuses on a hard core rally experience.  The difficulty can be daunting at times, as the courses that stretch the genuinely beautiful scenery can be really hairy to navigate.  I'm playing with a G27 wheel and it makes for a fantatic experience that forces me to put in what I get out.  If I didn't listen to my navigator when he said ""Right 1"" and I go in too hot, I pay the price.  Car damage really does impact your pace and a surprising number of repair variables are present from suspension to radiators to gear box.  The car handling feels right and the phyiscs are spot on.  It looks great and here's the most important part: when you stay focused and put a solid run in on a course, there is a genuine sense of reward.   My biggest gripe is the menu system.  I haven't looked at enough reviews to see if others largely agree, so maybe its just me, but I don't like the layout or how I choose championships, multiplayer or otherwise.  Additionally, multiplayer seems to be relegated to just rally cross, which isn't my cup of tea.  I miss multiplayer traditional rally time attacks.  Again, maybe they are in there, but I can't find it! Strange.  That said, Dirt Rally is the real deal rally experience.  Highly Recommended.			"

Actually, once I yelled that ""♥♥♥♥ you finns, I beat you in Finland!"" at the end of a stage. :-D Yes, the game is hard but satisfying after every well-executed turn or stage.I'm in my thirties, I played tons of circuit and rally racing games and simulations. All I can say, Dirt Rally is the top of it. No, really! And now I don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ I've spent more than 500 hours in a touring car, GT or in a formula simulation.			"

												You can pretend to be Petter Solberg oversteering in a Welsh forest. You can pretend to be Petter Solberg oversteering on a snowy Swedish road. You can oversteer in the air in Finland (whilst pretending to be Petter Solberg). You can oversteer off of a cliff in Greece (Petter Solberg is better than this). You can pretend to be Petter Solberg oversteering on Ice in Monte Carlo. And you try to be disciplined like Petter Solberg and not oversteer (too much) on the tarmac of Germany.Basically, you spend your entire rally career going very sideways with your mouth open (like Petter Solberg). Unlike Petter Solberg you will often ignore the co-driver's urgent call of ""Don't cut."" When you ignore this you stop being Petter Solberg and restart the stage from the bottom of the ravine or whilst inside a tree (sometimes both at once).Alternatively give Rally Cross a go and pretend to be Petter Solberg winning the World Rally Cross Championship by oversteering around 3 official circuits.Overall this is a great Petter Solberg simulator. 10/10			"

												Hands down the best rally sim game on steam. Dirt Rally is aimed at the hardcore rally fans and has a steep learning curve to truly master the game, however also offers difficulty levels challenging enough for new players and veterans of the game. You need a racing wheel or controller if you want to play the game at a serious level. The game offers a lot of replayability and is great value for money in my opinion.The game is visually stunning and offers a wide variety of game modes. You can play through a career mode, race in online multiplayer or set up leagues and compete against your friends best times. There are 6 different rally locations with 12 stages on each, as well as various Pikes Peaks routes and rally cross events. There's plenty of cars to choose from and the game isn't related to previous ""dirt"" games other than in the name, so you can pick and choose what cars and stages you want to race without being forced into any unwanted races.

												Pros:- The physics feel fun and realistic- Tracks are tricky and narrow, not perfect set pieces- Audio is excellent and extremely detailed- Customizable and tweakable (e.g. HUD, driver assists, controller responsiveness/sensitivity etc)- Steam CloudCons:- Grass has a semi-noticeable, weird grid-like effect which is apparent on some tracks (only on AMD cards I think)- Rare graphical glitch where the stage is engulfed in black- Online mode lacking- No ghosts or easy way to look up all your laptimes that I've found- When doing time trials, you have to wait like 10 seconds to restart again which adds upPeople often say there are not enough tracks, which is true for the online mode, but only partially true for the rally portion. While there aren't many rally tracks (I think like 10-12), they are very lengthy and even at 150 hours I don't know all the ins and outs of all the tracks (though I do remember most turns). Going back to Dirt 3 and noticing the absurdly short rally tracks is kinda laughable. In fact, everything about the older Dirt games feels way too simple - from the audio to the physics. The old dirt games feel like you're driving a toy on some sort of flat and perfect course.In summary this is one of the few racing games worth playing right now. The pros heavily outweigh the cons. It's especially great if you appreciate realistic feeling, yet still fun racing games. I haven't played a racing game this much since the older Need for Speed games (which I stopped playing when Criterion Games removed manual transmission and casualized the Hot Pursuit series).			"

								I've never been more terrified of a racing game. Thrilling, scary stuff. Your butt may turtle. The Dark Souls of racing games comparison is surprisingly apt. Starts off punishing, but grows rewarding with every failure. Not the prettiest of pretties, but drops you into the world and hopes you survive. Still early, but tldr; would recklessly endanger my rally co-driver again.			"

												I just freakin' love it! The successor to Richard Burns Rally! The first and the most important of all: it's a SIM, not an arcade game. Don't be disappointed if you crash in your first corner, just keep trying, it's HARD at first try. But that feeling, when you achieve some results - absolutely brilliant, incredible and rewarding! Everything is perfect about this game, and nope, I'm not biased. It's that great! And it will get even better! Don't ignore the game just because it's Early Access (in this case, Codies use this Steam feature to their advantages, really!). It's the rally simulation we (rally fans / sim players) all waited for a long time. The tracks are completely stunning, built with so much detail, creativity and attention - the whole environment is alive while you are rushing towards the finish line, either on gravel, tarmac, ice or snow. You have a really intensive and real connection to the surface, that's why I recommend playing it with a better wheel which has Force Feedback. The cars sound great, like nowhere else in a rally simulator. The Steam Workshop support is a nice addition, as you can get some controller settings and great car setups for specific tracks from other players, if you want to improve your stage times. The v1.10 update added some great tutorials for beginners, for those who aren't familiar with rally racing or even racing in general. I find those videos a great addition to the package. The tracks are in Wales, Greece, Monaco, Germany, Finland, Sweden, USA (Hillclimb), Norway (Rallycross), England (Rallycross), Sweden (Rallycross), and they are all real-world tracks (if you don't believe me, check out my guide at the bottom of my review)!The only thing I can say as a negative is that it doesn't have a multiplayer mode for rally, with staggered starts, but I hope we can get it somehow, sometimes.The way they handle community feedback is absolutely brilliant. DiRT Rally's Early Access period was it's best period, and the best EA I've ever seen. During the progress we went through the simulator evolved and got better based on feedback. Kudos to Codemasters, they are going in a really, really great way. Colin McRae would be proud! :-)

Early Access Review
								It's the rally game we always wanted, and it's so dirty.  Driving at night in the rain is probably the most realism I have felt from a racing game.  There's also a career mode where you can upgrade your car.  It's perfect in my books.  Plus we don't have to wait to play it!  It feels like a finished product, perfectly optimized on the absolute highest settings it will go I'm getting like 70-100+ FPS easily without any issues with a really old processor.  Insanely well optimized.  Flaw?  Career mode needs a bit of a tweak.  You can't really redo races, and there's only one state of progression, no going back, you lose your cash you're out of luck.  Can't really make any mistakes at all during your entire progress through the game with the exception of resetting each time during a race to the start.  I was just trying it out and after my first little set of races I did horribly because I crashed my car basically, and got a DNF for that race.  So basically a horrible fail and I lost more money than I earned.  It was the first race so I just wanted to start over but you can't.  There's an option to reset your game which I did, and it resets everything including your games' stats.  Sort of sucks, considering if you were playing a career mode for a long time and you made a few mistakes down the road (fall off the track?) and don't have time to finish restarting, you would have to basically reset your entire game save including everything you've ever done.  Much different than Dirt 3 where you can basically redo those tour races over and over until you got perfect on each one.  You never had the risk of losing it all because you had a friend come over and had to exit the game and lose your whole career mode lol.  I left suggestions on the developer's feedback forum, I hope they can realize this oversight.  Anyways, having played the game for a few days, I no longer see this as a big drawback (not that it really was in the first place), but you just have to play this game differently.  You have to seriously do well on your championship races or don't even do them, but since you can endlessly restart you can keep redoing them until you get a not-horrible-run and then continue to the next race, you'll always come out at a profit and if you are really good and you can complete all of the races without restarting the game rewards you for that. My favorite part of the game are the online races.  Not interactively online but challenges that we get to do every day, week, and there is also a monthly event.  This basically ensures the game will always be somewhat fresh.  In the challenge, you can't reset the round, you have one shot to complete it and if you fall too far off the track you could end a 24-race monthly challenge in an instant and never be able to attempt it until the next month.  It's refreshingly difficult and you have to really pay attention, but you don't have to really sweat it because you can practise as much as you like arcade mode.  Pretty cool game. I'd like to see the vehicle upgrading enhanced a little bit.  You don't have direct control over it, you hire crew and the crew automatically does upgrades for you.  It's pretty weird but I guess they thought it was a good idea, I'd rather have to save up money and have to buy individual parts or at least have a level 1-5 on each part and buy upgrades for them.  Their system might work out okay, better than nothing, but the repair system in between races should be tweaked a bit.  If you have 85% wheel condition you can repair it up to 90% condition?  It should be more specific in which parts are getting fixed, and let you choose.  Maybe not super specific but for example your headlights, that's bundled in with 'body', you might want to put a lot of repairs into the body/headlights because your upcoming race is night time and it's pretty much impossible without lights and if you have 60% body condition and repair it to 70%, are your lights even going to be fixed?  If not, that was a waste of your repair time, but I'd much rather the game let me pick exactly what needs to be fixed.  You might have 1 wheel missing at the end of a race, it would be nice to just have that wheel and maybe your headlights fixed, seems pretty reasonable for a game this hardcore with it's permadeath 24 race rally runs, they should at least grant you a bit more control over it.  All in all, a helluva time, 10/10, so great that we get to play the game as they are developing it.			"

												DIRT Rally is like your girlfriend, someday you love her, someday you hate her.And sometimes, she’s against you and you have no clue why...I love how the game is a simulation, but not too excessive. They really found a good middle between fun and races that are very demanding.Quality content! Musics are great. Physics and driving make sense, every car is unique, and sounds are pleasurable! Each places and stages are very well optimized and very fun in their own way.CONS-Not much content, I would have loved more Hillclimb races and more customization on cars!!-Graphics could be perfectible(Playing on very high settings)OS : Microsoft Windows 10CPU : AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.0 GHzGPU : Asus Strix GTX970 4GBRAM : Kingston Hyper Fury X 16GB @ 1866Mhz "

												** EDIT (POST-LAUNCH): Well, this game is still stunning, and has had awesome content added to it throughout Early Access. I am blown away by how much love and passion has gone into making this game, and the dev team have been absolutely superb with their efforts and communications throughout. Not only did they keep us in the loop, but they involved the community to the point where we all had a hand in developing what is the best and the most immersive rally game, to date. **-------------------------------------------------Never has an early access game impressed me so much. The quality of this game early on is fantastic, and the content that this game has is just what I've been waiting for since Richard Burns Rally; my goodness! The visuals, the sound and the feel of this game is incredible. There are few things better than ripping through the Welsh forests in a lovely Mk2 Escort in Dirt Rally. Quality product. I'm very excited to get my hands on the final version. The stages feel alive, the cars feel like they have actual weight to them, and the handling is challenging yet all of the fun. Thank you, Codemasters. Thank you very much.			"

												A big thumbs up. The driving to me feels worthy to be called an RBR successor, and it's definitely that type of sim-realism that they've gone for with this game. The roads are narrow, the cliffs are steep, the cars are fast and when the co-driver says ""don't cut"", you'd better do as he says.Downsides include:* No content modding support at the time of writing (just after launch), nor do we know yet if they plan to make new content themselves* Cars are in ample supply, though some classics are omitted for licensing reasons I assume. No Toyota Corolla for example.* Locations are varied, but don't amount to a great deal of drivable road. Each event (6 now) contains 2 long stages, and these stages are in various configurations for a full rally, by cutting them in 2 and doing them again and then the reverse of all of those. I certainly enjoy the reverse stages as much as the forward, but driving the exact same stage twice in the same direction can get tedious if an event gives you A reverse, then A, then AB, then B, and then B reverse all in a row.* No rally school or playground to mess around in, though you can always just load up any stage on any event in any car in custom event mode.* The co-driver is very important, and you learn to trust him over time. But at the same time there are 1 or 2 turns per location where he calls a turn much wider than it is and you wish you could punch him in the face for it. It's not often so you eventually learn that a particular turn is coming and what it really is, but there's no pacenote editor right now to fix it properly.All in all, yes I've mentioned a bunch of negatives, but overall the postives vastly outweigh them. Even as a newcomer you'll learn the tricks quickly enough to progress through the cars and after 57 hours of driving the stages in various configurations I can't say I'm tired of driving them yet. Even if they deliver no additional content down the line through free or paid DLC, and even if they don't support modders doing it for them, the game is fully worth the price of admission for what it currently offers. And if you end up being 'done' with this game after 100 hours and want to go back to RBR mods, that was 100 hours very well spent.			"

												I had so much joy with DiRT 3, but there's more. Let's have a close look to DiRT Rally.DiRT Rally is a rally game with plenty of modes like plain rally, rallycross and hillclimb. In the career, you start up with the oldest rally cars you can imagine of and pick either generated championships that go harder and harder or your own created championships. Over time you earn money and can buy some better cars and hire trained engineers that keep your car alive and install handy upgrades.Graphics, sounds and physics are a impressive step and don't need overkill hardware. Recently, VR support was added which I find fancy. I haven't one of those VR-headsets yet, though.Be aware that DiRT Rally is pretty much deep and demanding, therefore I'd rather call it a simulator, a tough one. There's no map, just You, the Co-driver and the car. Not all the damage can be repaired at once and it even decreases the earnings if you decide to restart. There's only one try for the online time trials also. In the other hand, you can activate driving aids if you need to. It's important to find the most comfy steering method and the car's tuning for you. Keep a cool head and take breaks over time. Do you love cars and won't mind a bunch of dirt? Would you accept the challenge? Get it. "

								Short version:Bought the game.Started playing with keyboard.Broke my fingers.Bought a gamepad.Can't play properly anymore, cause my fingers don't move quite well as they used to.10/10, would break my fingers again.Long version:Buy the game, it's well worth it. It's a proper rally simulation in Dirt series, something you did not expect. Runs exceptionally well on High and Mid-Low end systems. Great sounds, especially 5 cylinder Audi's. Very hard to master, but I'd suggest to turn off almost all asists, and leave the ones you can't live without, in my case - ABS, level 2. You start your carrer with FWD Lancia or MINI. Pretty hard enough to control, top speed felt like already being the highest I could handle without kissing a tree. Finished second overall, bought an RWD BMW. Now I understood, that keyboard with RWD is just finger-bone-snapping experience, throttle control is absolute madness, sudden oversteer and everything else combined made my RWD journey very memorable, that's why I went straight to electronics shop. Still, nailed 3 stages with a pretty nice looking wreck. Gamepad is connected, I will end this now, cause I need to play some more.As I already stated earlier, buy it. Worth every Euro - Back to basics, the building stones of proper Colin McRae rally.			"

								I remember the day I saw DiRT2. Those fireworks, Hollywood style, the gymkhana. That day i felt like something died inside me. Then DiRT3 came, and wasn't much better, let's face it. And here I was, 5 hours ago still feeling something dead inside, wishing for a decent old school rally game...But I have to wish no more. Out of the blue this game came out and hands down, so far looks and feels awesome. Could be one of the best rally games ever without a doubt. No more fireworks, no more Hollywood bs. Only mud, dirt and nothing but rally.GraphicsGame looks fantastic. There's a few things that Codemasters should improve like the spectators. They kinda look ugly for a 2015 game. And there's a few visual bugs related to shadows but nothing too severe. Interiors are BEAUTIFUL, full of details and speaking about details, the game is full of them inside and outside the vehicles. The mud, the burning brakes at night...SoundAgain, fantastic job. Cars sound incredible, specially the group B. You can even hear the window rattle. Soundtrack is nice, nothing too fancy but does the job.GameplayNow, this is where the game proves that is not a DiRT4. Rally is closer to simulation than ever before. There's a few options to make the experience a lil close to arcade (ABS, TCS, stuff like that) but if you turn them all off the game feels pretty realistic. I can't say how close is to RBR but one thing is certain, this is completely different to DiRT or even CM.And they added a few features, like upgrades for the cars (Nothing too powerful to make that Mini the ultimate rally car) and staff management, where you choose the team, pay their salaries, fire them and ofc each one has different stats that affect for example, the amount of damage they can repair between stages.OverallI have to recommend this. It's been too long since we had an old school rally game. And so far looks promising, there's a few things they have to fix, content to add (Included hill climb. they have confirmed Pikes peak) and many cars to come before release. So far it includes 17 cars and 36 stages (You can set the hour, included night) so there's plenty to play around till the next update.It is kinda awkward to say this, but... Thank you Codemasters.And remember, ""Being fast is about skill, not raw speed"". Otherwise this happens...

Teal DeerDevelopers: Codemasters Racing StudioPublishers: CodemastersInitial release: Dec 2015Genre: Racing, Off-Road, Rally#Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationVersion 0.9This is the Rally game you've always wanted. Focused on pure point to point racing. No more Gymkhana. After getting used to the physics in this game, going back to older DiRT games feel like arcade folly. There are 3 basic modes Rally, Hill-climb and recently the added Rally X Cross (which is the only mode wherein other cars share the road with you.)Updates are frequent with new cars and tracks. Each track being a location with very specific road conditions and each rally being different sections of that track including the mirror versions of those different sections. Tarmac, snow/ice, loose gravel of varying sizes which all give a different feel when driving. Mud behaves differently than dry dirt as does the vehicle depending on your drivetrain. It'll make you want to buy a wheel if you didn't have one already. Lots of assists and bonus credits for turning them off. For easy entry into the series but still very difficult to master. There are no more flashbacks making racing much more intense. In its stead is a time penalty of resetting your car back onto the track. A nice trade off is you can avoid this penalty by getting back onto the track yourself before the timer deems you unable to get back. By far the most realistic entry into the series, I'd even extend that to all rally/off-road racing games; Graphically and more importantly the physics therein. Cars receive damage and even retain that damage through the races and must be repaired in between with possible time penalties for 'over repairing' beyond your given time to repair. You will build a team, crew chief and other members. That get better and more efficient the more they work with you. Make sure you keep their contract up as these people you hire will allow you to fix more things in between races and keep your vehicle in tip top shape even if you aren't the best driver in the world. This is quintessential if you're into off-road racing of any variety.Follow my curation for more "

Early Access Review
								After a few hours, I have to say I'm very impressed. Coming from simulators such as iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I would say DiRT Rally is in the same league. I have some experience with Richard Burns Rally which is touted as being the best driving simulation available, which I would absolutely agree with. It's hard for me to compare the two as I haven't played RBR in a while, however, I remember RBR just feeling right when I first tried it. DiRT Rally also gave me this feeling so they must be doing something right. Considering RBR was released 10 years ago, it's about time somebody challenged to be the king of driving simulation.The handling is raw and unforgiving. The sounds, especially in third person, are perfect. The graphics are good enough; which I don't mind as long as the handling feels good. Steering wheel support seems OK. using a G27, I set the degrees of rotation to 270 in logitech profiler and turned the wheel strength down to 80%, wheel weight to 40%. There doesn't seem to be any clutch support which is odd. I'm using elastic bands to convert my H-shifter into a sequential shifter. A handbrake is definitely a requirement now. In the next few days I'll be designing a 3d printable off/on handbrake which will use an Arduino Pro Micro as the USB device controller. Unfortunately I don't think a handbrake axis is supported.The pace notes let the game down at the moment. I'm forever shouting at my virtual co-driver when he calls a turn too late and I go flying off a cliff. To add to this, I don't like the graphical pacenotes overlay. It's very hard to distinguish what's coming up next at a glance if you didn't hear the co-driver say it (I know you wouldn't get this benefit IRL but it's poorly executed). I also think the pacenote graphics look childish and overly stylised which isn't in keeping with the clean and serious UI/attitude of the game.The in-game cameras are another slight let down. For the time being I'm forced to use the dash cam because the cockpit cam is too far back. I'd also like a bit more flexibility in the replays to watch on the TV style cams all the time. I understand why they've done it this way but it's a game, the devs have the ability to use any cameras they want.Another thing that annoys me is the vehicle recovery mechanic. Sometimes I'm not given a chance to recover the vehicle myself and I'm magically dumped back on the track with a time penalty. Something Richard Burns Rally did well was a quick animation showing spectators flipping the car back over for you. It just adds a bit of immersion rather than a magical lazy recovery to the middle of the track.I'm not too fond of the progression aspect of the championship. I'd prefer to test my skills as a driver rather than my patience. Having said that, the mini was pretty fun.All things considered I'd definitely recommend this game. With a bit more work and more content I can see it being really great. Thank you to codemasters for taking a step back and assessing the market. I've had enough of the assist ridden Monster Energy adverts you've been putting out over the past few years.			"

								DiRT goes back to its roots. There is no Gymkhana here. It is just pure rally racing, and it is not as forgiving as previous versions of DiRT. This is much more of a sim racing game than recent DiRT games, and moreso than the WRC games too.I have been playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller, and with no assists on it is challenging to stay on the course. You have to watch your speed as you approach turns, make sure you enter and exit the turns without drastic changes in throttle and steering, or else you will end up in a tree. At least you can reset your car onto the course if you do crash, but you will take a time penalty and your car may be damaged. I imagine the game would be even more fun with a wheel and pedals.The courses are narrow and stages are longer than in DiRT 3. Damage is in the game (cannot be turned off) and it will effect your car. I had a right front puncture in the middle of a stage and had to finish the stage with the car pulling to the right the whole time. That was nerve wracking but realistic. One time I went off so fast my car was totaled, forcing me to retire from the event.All the typical camera angles are here, from a follow view, bumper cam, hood cam, dashboard cam, and the traditional cockpit cam. There are a lot of graphical settings to adjust to your computer's abilities. Buttons can be remapped too, which may seem like a minor thing but some games (The Crew) have left this option out.There are some shortcomings to DiRT Rally as it stands right now. I cannot hear the pace notes and I'm not sure why. I tried various settings but they just do not play for me. Hopefully this will be tracked down and fixed soon because driving blind (there is no course minimap) is tricky. The selection of locations and cars is a bit sparse for now, but this is early access and more are coming. One other feature I would like to see is the ability to adjust sensitivity for the controller, to fit different tastes. I would like the option to turn it down slightly.Overall this is a good racing game for early access. There already is a lot of polish to the game and it has promise. This is not your typical DiRT game meant to be blasted through without practice. With patience it can be an enjoyable experience.			"

												This is perhaps the most engaging, immersive rally game - if you let it be. That means; all driver assistants off (maybe except allowing a weak setting of ABS if you play on a keyboard) and first person perspective only. The sound and visual effects of the game are pretty persuasive, and the handling of the cars seems very credible to me. Obviously I haven't driven actual rally cars on actual rally tracks, and therefore I won't pretend to be some sort of expert on the topic like many others will. I have however driven cars for 28 years, 10 of these off road racing on fields and I am a technically inclined driver. I live in Scandinavia, where we often deal with snow and ice in winters. On that background, I will say that the handling feels very ""expected"" - when I expect a car to slide, it will do so, and in the direction expected. It will also grip when expected, and many real world driving and rallying techniques are responded well to by the game design.The menu structure and the way you enter events, the events you may access and the cars feel a bit restricted. I'm a casual gamer, and I play often with other people, so to me, DiRT is a bit of a ""filler"", that I start when I feel like a bit of driving around. In that regard, it feels very grind-y, and I've yet to unlock several cars and classes. That's a bit bad, and although I never cheat in any game, it does sometimes makes me want to google for an unlock-all cheat.I also feel that the more powerful cars may be too much of a challenge on keyboard. I do have a steering wheel setup, I just never bother installing and uninstalling it. However, as far as keyboard controls go, the initial cars are pretty easy to control, but progressing towards e.g. an Audi Quattro or even more modern, powerful cars, and it suddenly feels like you'll have to drive significantly slower than what the car is actually capable of, to remain in control when using a binary input like a keyboard.All in all, the game is a credible, immersive and realistic rally simulator. If you imagine yourself as the kind of car gamer, who will disable all driver aids and stick to first person mode, you'll be rewarded with an actual challenge - getting there is easy, but getting there first is suitably hard (although I find it too easy to come in 2nd or 3rd). If you like driver assists on though, I really wouldn't recommend this game though - I think you'd have more fun in a game that is actually build to cater to that taste of car game, than tweaking this game to suit you.

												This game offers a pure rallying experience with almost no distraction. Although there is only one car on the track, you have to push to the edge of your skills to get a better result while maintaining control of your car.The game is frustrating at first, I crashed at every corner and destroyed my car during the first race. But, it has the magic power to keep me playing. I guess the power is hope. ""What if I didn't crash at that corner?"" The hope of getting better keeps players playing. As I keep driving, I crash less and get more and more confident. The game encourage players to switch off assists both by extra rewards and the possibly better stage time and this became the first driving game I dare play with all assists off. I switched off one assist every championship and now I feel confident controlling my car.10/10 I even rally in my dreams. "

												DiRT Rally is the rally sim that rally fans everywhere have been waiting for.If your attention strays for 1 second, you may find yourself going in for a frenchie with a tree at 80mph.Codemasters took the risk of taking on this in essence, side project based on user feedback a couple of years back. They decided to go down the early access route and I can tell you from a day 1 player, this has gone from strength to strength and by far the best early access game I have put my time into and also rally sim game. This area has been barren for a number of years since Richard Burns Rally came out and to imagine that people are still playing and modding that game showed there was still a desire for these games out there.If you are expecting a DiRT 3 sequel, be wary. This game is HARD. You have to actually practice proper rally techniques rather than the usual arcade brake, turn and accelerate. You do that in this game and either you will oversteer or understeer off the road. This game doesn't forgive. Even after my 110 hours in the game (possibly the most in any racing game to date) I still manage to crash either based on my split second ignoring my co driver or an error in speed.But that is the beauty of this game and that is why I have so many hours in it. It makes you want to improve. Don't expect to be topping leaderboards in the championship mode, hell even coming 5th when you start is a godsend. You have to upgrade your car and your driving skills. Slower is generally quicker I have discovered. Floor the throttle and you will find yourself in a smooth embrace with a tree.If you are into PVP, they have also signed a deal with the FIA World Rallycross Championhip which brings some well known tracks and a number of the current cars from the IRL championship including Petter Solberg's DS3 and the Fiesta. This is a great experience so long as you get some people who are willing to play fair but that is the same in all pvp.TLDR Section!Pros-- Great driving physics- Wide range of cars and tracks- Daily, weekly and monthly events for chances to earn extra cash competing against all other players on the leaderboard- Steep learning curve (this is if you love a challenge and improving, if not look down)Cons-- Steep learning curve, part 2 (this is not a game for the casual racer. It will take practice and time to get good and find the enjoyment in it- While there are a number of different tracks, you will find some of the longer tracks cut in half to count as some extra stages rather than every stage be the same. Personally doesn't bother me though.- Damage engine isn't very advanced I think due to a dated engine. I imagine if they knew how popular this would get they would have started from scratch.I throughly recommend this game and can't wait until the Oculus Rift consumer version releases so I can get fully 'into it'!

Early Access Review
								Summary: If you (like me) loved the rally events of the Dirt series, you will love this game. More challenging than it's predecessors, the learning curve is steep but rewarding. I've played the first two full events available, and I could NOT pause the game, itch my face, or check my phone. This is adrenaline pumping sim rally car driving in the best way. Wow. Having played Dirt 2, Dirt 3, and Showdown, each with a X360 controller, and Logitech G21 wheel/pedals, I've been loving the Dirt series for quite some time, in various ways. Dirt 2 was a dream. Yes, there were various events that I didn't like as much as others, but having completed the game various times, it is definitely enjoyable. Dirt 2 had long rally races unlike other racing games I had played prior. I grew up trail riding on dirt bikes while camping, and nothing had ever come close to creating this feeling of adventure and adrenaline. Since the release date, I've enjoyed Dirt 2 with all setups at my disposal, oddly my favorite of which was the X360 controller (a slight blend of sim and arcade), but getting the game to work with my Oculus DK2 and the G21 was incredible. Although I still haven't managed to get the DK2 to provide head tracking, so I suppose it's more like your head is bolted looked straight the whole time. Ah well. Dirt 3 had some more recognizable rally events (with relation to this game, heavily wooded tight tracks), yet an abundance of new and less enjoyable event types. With the graphical improvement of 3, it was hard to resist playing, but I, sadly, never completed the game given the various other event types. (I'm looking at you gymkhana!) This game was better suited for my G21, but ultimately the tracks just weren't... right with me. Perhaps it was the slightly heavier sim element, but with event types that were arcade feeling that put me off, I also missed the Dirt 2 desert trail feeling. Showdown, I played very slightly. Dirt Rally is a very humble new beginning for the Dirt Series (ditching the numbers, aside to Showdown) which focuses on my favorite aspect of the game. Although in it's current form it does not include my favorite vibe of track (desert trailblazer style), the aesthetic, customization options, sim options, X360 compatibility, and all around feeling of the game are present in the best way yet. The graphics are fantastic (running at 70FPS average on Ultra) and FEELS like trail-riding, although trapped in a car. I would ask Codemasters to include dirt bikes if possible, but they have the perfect formula for off road rally cars. Oh, and lastly, Codemasters, please add paved parts of maps. The feeling of getting off the vibration centric dirt roads of Dirt 2 onto pavement in a 350+HP car and hauling a** for a minute was incredible.			"

												Finally a RALLY game! No Ken Block, no Travis Pastrana, no gymkhana.Feels a lot like DiRT 1 which is a good thing.Point to Point rallying at it's finest. If you don't have respect for your surroundings you will DNF in the first 5 seconds of a race every time. It's a pretty hard game, like it should be! No one ever said driving 120 mph through the woods should be easy :)Lot's of cool cars that are actually used to rally in real life.The only con so far for me is the lack of Rally raid style races with the offroad trucks in a point to point race with others racing at the same time. I really enjoyed that style of race from DiRT 1.Overall a perfect rallying game.11/10  Colin McRae Would be proud			"

 General Dirt Rally is a brilliant rally game. Brilliant graphics and hope for features to come in the future. UI The UI is simple and clean. It looks very effective and can be easily navigated from one area to another. The help of quick selection makes the transition of moving from settings to game play instantaneously. No problems here. Graphics The graphics are very good, even when playing on a lower preset they are still top-notch. Game Play It’s no arcade, this feels like a simulator. You lose grip on gravel, your wheel feels loose on the ice! It’s the best Rally simulator game yet, and also has a licence for the World Rally Cross Championship, so not only are you sliding around in the mud on stages but are also wheel to wheel racing over jumps and joker sections!I highly recommend the game to anyone that has a love for rally, although be aware it’s not for the faint hearted. I would recommend this game  "

								Well well well, codemasters! I loathed the F1 series, I hated the way the DiRT series went and then this little diamond came along, unannounced out of the blue.Now my opinions;FFB is slightly better now (Still isn't the best and will need refinement).The graphics are very good. I'm able to run with it completely maxed at ultra for the settings it allows.No flashy, WHAM-BAM, 'merica menu's.Unforgiving career mode, make one mistake and you'll struggle to get podium.You have to listen for the co-driver and at the moment I'm keeping the visuals on too. (It's that bad!)The feeling of the driving isn't as bad as full on sim but it isn't as arcady as the others.G27 preset out the box.Plays like a real rally season, repairs cost time (if you are slower than first you can make time up without repairing), you don't get to repair after every stage and a restart costs you bonus cash from the final pay cheque.Really cannot fault this game, it won't be the ultimate sim that some would like, but car setup isn't just as simple as shocks and dampers either. Camber is there and i forget what else. You have to use a car more and more to get the advanced setup options tho.Peugeot 205GTi Evo 2, Lancia Delta S4, Escort Mk2, RS200, Audi Quattro and a Metro 6R4.

Get behind the wheel and you're in for the ride of your life...Update 3 - November 5th, 2015Despite skipping the previous 2 big updates, I would like to focus on the state of the game after the latest update - titled ""Modern Masters"" - instead of talking about the earlier ones. Not only does it introduce more rally cars - and even one new class of cars - but also a bunch of long-awaited features and an overhaul of the Group B (4WD) and Group A physics.So far I spent the majority of my playtime since the release of this update using the Peugeot 205 T16 Evo 2. Since I already had spent a fair bit of time with this car previously, the difference was very noticeable: The car is more nervous now, but also very nimble and has a lot less grip than before. These changes also serve to make it feel even more powerful because it has become harder to tame the beast. But when you do it's an absolute blast. The FFB, while feeling a little lighter compared to other cars, does convey everything you need to know about the state of the car and the road surface. Every car does feel different in DR, and the FFB combined with the v2 physics - as far as implemented - further improve upon this.Original reviewIt's hot, and the glaring light of the midday sun hurts my eyes. I depress the clutch and put the car into first gear. One more glance to my co-driver - he's absolutely focused on the task ahead. My right foot hits the gas pedal and the mid-mounted 4-cylinder turbo- and supercharged engine screams in reply. A cold shiver runs down my spine. ""A thrill ride through beautiful Greece, in a Lancia Delta S4 - a car that generates 400 bhp at less than 900 kilograms weight - what could possibly go wrong?""A lot, as it would later turn out. The ""GO!"" signal echoes through my head; I drop the clutch and the bullet I'm sitting in shoots forward, screaming, waving its rear and sending large amounts of gravel to the sides.The first bends dart towards me at unreal speed. After passing through the first of them without an incident, I fall into a trance; a blur of steering, shifting and listening to my co-driver, who spits out his pacenotes as precisely as a machine.Everything goes well for about 3 or 4 kilometers. Then it happens: I miscalculate the trajectory through a rather unremarkable turn. My mistake sends the car flying down a slope, all four wheels losing contact. It's nothing short of a miracle we don't hit one of the nearby trees. The question is this: Do we call for help and risk losing time or do we push ahead, hoping to get to higher ground again? I opt for the latter, and through what seems like another miracle make it back to the track without damaging the car or losing too much time.No more events in the next sector, but then tragedy happens. I lose control over the car for a brief moment, and my efforts to correct the mistake are in vain, thanks to the loose surface beneath the car. It slides forward and sideways, and I prepare for the worst. But all I feel is a slight bump. However, the hissing sound from the left means that at least one of the car's tires were damaged but I can't tell if it's the front or rear. ""Oh great, this is going to be fun"", I think to myself.I back up and accelerate again, then try to assess the damage. We can continue, sure enough, but for how long? The car, previously a nimble and fast race horse, starts to transform into something else. The reactions are getting slower and less precise, and I do not know how much longer the tire will hold.About 1.5 kilometers later I'm getting my answer: With a loud bang the tire, or what was left of it, disintegrates. The scraping noise from the back of the car doesn't exactly inspire confidence, and the first few meters confirm my worst fears. The race horse I once rode has turned into a murderous three-legged bull intent on killing me and my co-driver.Going full speed as I was before was out of the question now. We surely wouldn't make the top places, but hell if I let some blown tire end our rally prematurely! Carefully directing this out-of-control cruise missile through every bend on our way, I find it harder and harder to keep it on the road. Each steering input I make is answered by an opposing reaction, randomly changing our course to everywhere but the road ahead.Every little bump turns into a deathtrap, every corner into pure madness. What remains of the stage ahead of us becomes an odyssey, but then I finally see the pre-finish markers and my heart skips a beat in relief. It is only then I realize the gaping abyss to the right of the road. Relief turns to terror as I lose control of the car once more, but I quickly regain it before getting too close to the edge. I accelerate the car - still veering left and right - and shift into third and then fourth gear, before finally crossing the finishing line with a smile on my face.These were the scariest 8 minutes of my life, but also among the most fulfilling. As I look at the leaderboard I prepare to find myself way down... But I'm shocked to find myself close to the better entries, just barely missing an entry in the top tier of this event. Guess not everyone was as lucky as getting away with a blown tire.Preliminary ReviewIs this game worth getting?Yes.Here are the ""buts"": The game is still in Early Access; there is a decent amount of content, but many stages have overlapping sectors. On the other hand the locations differ greatly in terms of look and feel, especially when it comes to the actual surface. There are 5 different rally locations overall: Greece, Wales, Monte Carlo, Germany and Finland. At least one more location is to be released soon, so far only known as ""Winter Wonderland"".The core of any simulation that ultimately decides if it fails or prevails is the magic that happens between the tires and the road - the physics. Don't be fooled by looking at Codemaster's racing and rally games from the more recent years; make no mistake, THIS IS A SIMULATION. If you absolutely must compare it to Richard Burns Rally (and if you're into racing simulations, chances are you will), Dirt Rally feels *slightly* more 'forgiving' overall; however, to be quite honest I would partially blame this on some issues with RBR itself rather than only DR. No matter how you look at it, Dirt Rally is *not* an arcade game (but it does offer some driving aids on which I can't personally comment since I haven't used any of them).Ultimately, the one issue that is bothering me until now is the spread out content. This game is titled Dirty *Rally*. Having Hillclimb and Rallycross Events (even the official WRX license!) is (somewhat) nice to have, but there isn't that much diversity when it comes to content for these modes. There are basically two RX locations and one (and a half) hillclimb locations. The car selection for these modes is okay, though nothing to brag about IMHO (hillclimb, I'm looking at you!).The issue I have with this is that there currently isn't enough content for these modes to make them enjoyable for extended periods of time. And let's not forget that developing these things and putting them into the game actually takes development resources *away* from the core of the game - rally.So my hope is that we will see a long-time support from CM for Dirt Rally, adding more content to the game (preferably as free updates, IF possible) or officially supporting the modding scene. However, given the current state of things the later isn't very likely so my guess is we'll see some paid DLC sometime after the 1.0 release of the game.SummaryWe've been waiting for a new king of rally sims for too long, and Dirt Rally looks like it's going to be it. Definitely worth getting even in EA, as long as you don't mind a few (minor) issues and hoping for a little more content. It's good already and it's only going to get better!			"

												I'm not a racing or rally fan, but this game, this is something else. There is something amazing here. I picked up Dirt Rally on a whim and I can’t seem to stop playing it.This is a hard as nails pure racing game, through and through. No storyline about how you’re a young upstart who’s going to rise up and challenge the king of the road, no brother murdered by rival street gangs to avenge, none of that stuff. This is a game where it’s just you, your metallic hunk of an overpowered vehicle, your hapless co-driver, and the winding, indifferent road. Drive your heart out.Despite more than ten hours in the game, I still don't know how to take hairpins well. Basically I'm still using the brake, close my eyes, turn into the corner, and Jesus take the wheel method but I barely just managed to finish the 1960s championship in first place after hundreds of restarts, and it was as satisfying as a difficult section of Dark Souls. In fact managing to pull off any track perfectly feels like beating one of the bosses in Dark Souls, it's a similar ""push/pull"" feeling where you're working to get yourself to that state where you're 100% in control. In Dark Souls if you get too greedy and try to go all out and attack the boss with everything you’ve got, most likely you’re going to get smashed to death immediately. Similarly in Dirt Rally, if you drive recklessly in an attempt to get the best time, that's a perfect recipe for inadvertently flinging yourself off the side of a cliff at high speeds. In Dark Souls if you are too passive the boss’s attacks will eventually wear you and your estus down, and in Dirt Rally if you drive too slow you won't place well in the leaderboard, so there is a fine balance in risk vs reward. This game ticks many of the same feelings for me as Dark Souls, which was surprisingly enjoyable, somewhat like a pseudo masochistic desire to “git gud.”I'm not a fan of the additional rallycross mode (with you and a bunch of other racers on a circular track), but thankfully the focus is on pure rally, and there are many real life locations/ tracks to drive in, although to be honest I wished there were a few more. In an effort to ""git gud"", I've started watching rally races on YouTube as well as reading up on real life driving maneuvers/techniques to improve my game, and anytime a video game pushes me to learn more about a certain discipline IRL is a good thing in my book. I mean, I still can’t pull any of them off reliably, but baby steps, right? The physics in this game are extremely well modeled, RWD, FWB, and 4WD all feel different in how they operate, which lends interesting choices as to which car to purchase and compete with, at least in the earlier races. The many road surfaces feel great and visceral to drive on, and the vehicle handling plus the subtle vibration in the controller really sells the feeling that you are on a gravel road, or an ice sheet, or just plain, smooth asphalt. The game’s environments are beautiful as well, and immersive as hell when you using one of the cockpit modes. I don’t have a VR headset, but trust me that this would be the first game that I would try if I was to ever get one.I'm playing with a Xbox 360 controller using manual sequential (including manual clutch control) with some ABS assistance and it's perfectly playable. Call me casual, that’s fine, but the game really has hit a sweet spot between letting casual players like me have fun with a stiff challenge and being a true rally simulation for those with wheels and pedals, all without being too difficult to get into as to be alienating.If you’re somebody who is into rally racing or just racing in general, I’m certain you already own this game. If you’re somebody who likes challenging experiences, but has no idea what’s a Scandinavian Flick is or what a cluster♥♥♥♥ the Group B cars were, I would recommend Dirt Rally wholeheartedly to you based purely on how satisfying the game is when you put some time into it. And honestly, you’re looking at a learning curve of only 3-4 hours before things start making sense, so don’t be scared away by that term, “Learning Curve.”Just remember, DON’T CUT!			"

												I was getting concerned about the lack of good VR content, this game has officially restored my faith. I played quite a bit on the non VR version and the improvement in my driving after switching to VR is substantial. I can anticipate turns much better and have an overall better feel for the driving dynamics of the vehicle. Oh, and this isn't a crappy VR port, it feels tailor made for the goggles. Went back to Project Cars VR, huge fan of 2D version btw, for a comparison. Dirt puts it to shame. Graphics settings remain extensive and I have them maxed on an MSI 1070 with oculus debug tool set to 1.5. Like butter after the 2 most recent Nvidia driver updates. It's relatively intense mentally, not motion sickness mind you, and I usually need to take a break after an hour or so. This is a good thing and reminds me of the adrenaline drain after going to a real track, although not quite that dramatic.i5 6600k16GB G.Skill DDR4 @ 3000MSI Krait Z170 mobo MSI Gamer X 1070 OC'dSamsung ssd 850 evo 500GBSharks w/ Freakin' Laser Beams			"

								IT IS AWESOME!I really love Dirt Rally, especially now with the new FFB update, after a bit of tweaking it's a hell of a ride! Especially with the soft lock feature. Hairpins are very easy to handle now on all surfaces, excellent. Snow-tarmac track at night with Impreza=spectacular :) Very nice graphics, great sounds and now also great feeling of the rallying itself. I love RBR, I love Dirt series, but this is something else and very special. I'm really glad I joined to this great project. Even now for me it's almost perfect. And Pikes Peak (mixed surfase) is a nice challenge too. If you like rally, you cannot miss this. Runs nice, looks nice, drive nice, this is nice nice nice.... going back racing :)			"

								What can i say about this game that hasn't already been said.. in my opinion its the best Rally simulator to be made in the last 16yrs, i have been gaming 30yrs this year, yes thats right im that old. and in all that time i have never played a Rally simulator as good as this, yes i know Richard Burns Rally is hailed as king of Rally games in some peoples eyes.. but Dirt Rally keeps you coming back for more, it,s not easy by any means, but if you put the time in and get good at it, it gives you a feeling of accomplishment, now i have played most racing simulators in my time and i can say there,s not many that give you that feeling.. i will say onething i know it can be played with a pad or keyboard but you really need a wheel to get the most out of this game, it,s just that a wheel gives you so much more immersion...

												Okay so this is Codemasters' best ever racing game. And that's high praise from someone who has played EVERY one of their entries since 2007 (Colin McRae Dirt). In fact, it's not even close. Dirt Rally is the definitive rally experience, and I anticipate I will spend 100s of hours playing it. It is a true testament to what can be achieved with meaningful community engagement: the 6+ months this game spent in Early Access helped Codemasters to fine tune the game to appease die-hard fans, and it shows. In short, it excels in almost every area: Graphics (aesthetics and optimization), Audio (omg), Physics, Car Designs, Difficulty. My only gripe is that for $60, there is a distinct lack of content - plenty of cars and rally championships, but rallycross and hillclimb seem to be an afterthought. But a lack of varied content cannot take away from this outstanding game that the community has been demanding for years. And most importantly, no more Travis Pastrana telling you how 'rad' and 'far-out' your last race was.			"

												Now that this Rally SIM is out of Early Access I've deleted my old review and decided on a new review.  I've played over 300 hrs on this game which speaks volumns on how good this is. I've played this more than any other racing game. Why? Its so realistic. I actually feel I'm driving a real car.  The graphics and Physics are spot on. The Forcefeedback on a steering wheel is spot on.  All of the Rally stages are perfect offering a wide range of surfaces. PLus with Rally cross and the Hill climb race makes it a true all rounder. Something for everyone.  You never get bored as with the daily, weekly and monthly events it always gives you something to come back to each week. PLus with the PVP online gaming events which you play with fellow drivers on the Rally cross is spot on and offers a diferent aspect to this Rally Sim.  I've had this game from almost day one in the early access stage and have just seen this grow from strength to strength. Yes it had its ups and downs but with the Codies working very cloisely to the community we worked around all the niggles that occurred.  Is it worth buying? Yes sir it is one to have in your collection. It is hard to master and I recommend always to take your time and just aim to finish a stage.  This isnt your usual arcade racer where you are guaranteed to win every stage. This one makes you work for it.  I'm still only managing to reach 7th or 8th place in the masters league and I've played over 300 hrs.  But I keep coming back because of the challenges it presents me and for the realism. Theres nothing else out there like it in the modern age of rally sims.			"

								Truly awesome!I don't know a super amount about rally, but I have played some really great rally games in the past, namely Rally Trophy and Rally Championships. But this... Dirt Rally... Has topped them all.If you, like me, had the misfortune of playing Dirt 1/2/3, you probably won't be expecting much from Dirt Rally initially, but if you're looking for a proper rally simulation with outstanding sound quality and the real feel of flying down a dirt road with mud and water soaking your car as you pray you don't hit the tree up ahead, then you won't be dissapointed.It's got it all:- Excellent Graphics- The best sound effects i've ever heard in a rally game- Just absolutely gorgeously modelled tracks, from dried out greek dirt roads, the snowy hills of Sweden right down to the muddy Welsh moorlands.- Large selection of cars that you actually want to drive! None of that random dirt buggy stuff from the previous Dirt games. Ford RS200, Ford Sierra, Peugeot 306, Mini classic, Lancia Delta Integrale and tons more.- Oh! And no terrible cutscenes with a pro-active nobody telling you that this is your caravan and that great things await... Codemasters have managed to go back to the nitty gritty roots at the core of Rally. Dirty, dangerous and hair raisingly exciting, and pack it all into a single game with a pretty low pricetag.--I use a G27 wheel/h-shifter to drive with, it's well supported, the FFB is great with only a little left to be desired on tarmac imo, and it's really responsive--Do I recommend this game? Let's put it this way. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. YES!9/10 - Fantastic! THANK YOU FOR SAVING PC RALLY, CODEMASTERS! :D			"

								As a gravel driver I have been looking for a more sim based rallying game. Until now there has really only been one outdated (but good) game to play. Dirt Rally however is everything I wanted and more.LIKES: Great realism, the best sound in any racing game EVER!!, fantastic graphics, good tuning options, A REAL CHALLENGE of a game...not something you will master in 5 minutes ;)DISLIKES: None really, its a fantastic sim racer, with more and more features coming on board...see the timeline :)Some people may be expecting more of a DiRT3 (arcade) experience, this game is not like that, but a reality-based simulator. Be prepared to spend time driving the cars and understanding how the cars move, and what to adjust.Yes there is online content, in the form of daily/weekly/monthly race events where you compete against other drivers from around the world (but only on a time basis - there are no ghost cars just like real rallying!)I CANT WAIT FOR: RALLYCROSS!!!!!

												I come from a background of racing. I've raced everything from go karts to sprint cars, from dirt to asphalt. I've never driven a rally car and hope to one day do that, but the amount of feel you have in this game, is insane. The realism of your co pilot and their direction makes your mind wander into a real world painted by codemasters. I have had the most fun and the most challenges with this game. Getting frustrated is part of racing, always trying to improve is part of racing, and consistency is king. This game wraps all of those factors into a screen right in front of you and makes it feel REAL. I love this game, will continue to play this game. Will continue to get better. 10/10.			"

												DIRT Rally is racing game developed by Codemasters and released in 2015. It differs from usual Dirt or other racing series by Codemasters, which are acrades with some flavour in it. DIRT Rally is intense, precise and rewarding Rally game with big ""R"" in front of it.Pros:satisfying driving engine with perfect balance between simulation and arcade. It gives you that ""WoW I did it"" feeling when you nail the stagegreat feel of cars and stages. RWD, FWD and 4WD cars act like they suppose to dogood track design and picks of various locations (Greece, Finland, Germany, Monte Carlo (Monaco), Wales, Sweden)decent amount of activities: carrer, online play, custom racingdecent amount of rally classes and carsdecent controller and FFB settingsdifficulty of AI opponents are thoughtfully set to create nice entry for beginners and give challenge to veterans laternice looking graphics, decent car models and texturesnot so bad rally school, but one from Richards Burns Rally was implemented much betterSteam workshop intergrationAverage:Rallycross and hillclimb of Pikes Peak. Those two feel like were added just to have them. I'm not fan how those were implement and I'd like to see another country added to rally stages to increase limited number of tracks instead of those two. Why we can't have rallycross cars added as rally cars to F2 Kit Car class? online racing is great fun, but I'd like to see community split into leagues by skill or some sort of management from developerCons:limited number of tracks makes racing very repetetive fast. Within few hours you start getting a feeling that you already drove it and know that stage. It also creates other problem: in online racing you have to learn tracks by heart to get best scores. It should be more about learning car, not muscle memory by driving over and over again on same track. There is a hope in Dirt 4, that randomly generated stages will fix that problem.lighting engine could be improved. Models, texture and design are good, but that one part is clearly lackingit's not a sim: so damage model is very forgiving, night isn't fully dark, you cannot chose tiressome rally classes are lacking and could use more carsvery limited moddability. New cars, tracks and modes would improve game a lotSteam workshop item limit set to 100Some performance issues on few Germany stagesIn the end DIRT Rally is great rally game and we need more games like DIRT Rally. It has that ""feel"" of racing and guys responsible for it should have a beer.I highly recommend it to veterans and beginners of rally games. Game isn't hard and open and club difficulties are for everyone. If you end up crashing often in 95% you drive too fast and in 5% don't listen to co-driver. Famous rally quotes: ""Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."" and ""In like a lamb, out like a lion."" work here perfectly.			"

Posted: December 8, 2015
												This may be my first review of a game on steam.....ever?  That said, I feel it absolutely necessary to chime in on what may possibly be the most ENJOYABLE racing experience i've ever had.  Im 31 and have played just about every single racing game ever made and past favorites include somewhat niche titles such as Project Gotham(Previous favorite) to the hardcore more popular titles such as Forza and Gran turismo.In a very simple sense, this is like Project Gotham Rally. Initially simple but near limitness challenge and opportunity for improvement.  A somewhat perfect balance of sim and arcade.  Its just ENJOYABLE.  I enjoy ever single race with the exception of most of the RWD cars(Yes I suck with them).  Some may claim it was designed as a pure sim but many elements such as the damage, wonky airtime antics, post jump landings, etc dont seem 100% authentic but its pretty obvious the game wouldnt be very enjoyable if you clipped a stone on your second turn and ripped the back half of your car off spreading parts all over the road essentially killing your run.  The game is certainly brutal enough and you can total your vehicle forcing a restart but you really have to beat the cars into the ground for them to become totalled as opposed to real life where something as simple as a small jump can reek havic on the car.  Jumps just feel way too smooth and I wish the cars ""bucked"" a bit more as they landed depending on your trajectory but its all good, its keeps the momentum going and the experience fast and frantic without constant unpredictable wipeouts.  One final comment I want to make is something that stands out to me in nearly every race.  The game does a FANTASTIC job simulating speed.  Something I think every racing developer tries to nail but almost always doesnt.  If my memory serves me correct this was my main issue with Forza and just circuit racing games in general.  Maybe it just has something to do with driving on wide open roads as opposed the narrow, natural, paths you will be driving on in a rally game.  Even on some of the games larger straight aways, Germany and Finland are my favs, you just get an immense sense of speed as your car runs through each gear nearly topping out before having to slam on the breaks full force at the end to nail that acute turn.  But even this, which is normally cause for disaster in most other games, just works better.  You can be barelling down, see your impending turn and slam on the breaks and actually stop.  Its amazing, no more you didnt break at just the right freaking time so now your gonna fly off into the sand pit.  I honestly dont think I will ever go back to traditional racing after this.  DiRT Rally has spoiled me in all the right ways and I have zero desire to play or try any other racing game in the forseeable future.  In the end, the game just puts a big smile on my face!  Something I have been longing for in a racing game for a long, long time.  If you even like racing games, do yourself a favor and just buy it.  BUY IT NOW.			"

												Codemasters have finally delivered! A proper rally game, with great visuals and physics, but without any of that ""extreme"" show-off stuff that plagues the Dirt series for some time now. The car handling feels just right. You can easily play with keyboard or controller (which I prefer despite having a wheel), but wheel support and FFB is very good here. This has everything you might want in a rally game and if you like this kind of motorsport, this is a must have.There is only a few little things that could be better and that would make this game perfect in every way:- you cannot select your tires, they always are the right ones for the conditions- a rally school would be a very nice feature, especially that the game is quite challenging- the AI difficulty is a bit over the top - I may not be the fastest driver, but I consider myself pretty descent and I have not won a single stage or rally on any difficulty (rallycross is quite easy though)			"

[LINUX] Absolutely one of, if not the best, game ported to Linux on Steam.Pros: Very realistic, challenging, not an arcade racer, plays well with the Steam ControllerCons: Needs high end rig. On Arch Linux (using linux-steam-integration for native libs avail in AUR]), i7-6820HK/GTX-1070/64GB DDR4 1080p I've averaged 87fps on benchmark. Others have reported anywhere from 20fps+ depending on hardware, so definitely read the forums to see what others have experienced on specific hardware/distroUPDATE It's the game you'll reach for like coffee in the morning. : ) Easy to pick up for a quick 10 minutes.Tips/Feedback - Read the guide if your performance is lacking. After installing my last kernel upgrade (4.10.1), reinstalling my Nvidia drivers (378.13) for cuda issues..., and realizing that 8xMSAA, which is above and beyond the default ""Ultra"" -> drop it to 4xMSAA, Average is now 105-110. I'm sure it would be higher on the native laptop screen, but let's just say I'm a realist and would rather spend my time playing the game than reconfiguring my 4k setup again.TLDR 10/10, Start with Ultra @ 4xMSAA and read the how-to for further performance updates. They also include the recommended drivers.			"

								The best car racing game I've ever played. That game is not for everyone, really competitive and it's still getting better and better. Dirt Rally killed other racing games I used to play (NFS Shift 2, The Run, Rivals, Grid) that are too arcadish for me now because they lack real physics. Like some one said here, it's the Dark souls of racing, There is only one person to blame if you go outta the road, flip your car and get penalised: YOU!!!			"

								Fantastic game so far! It really does push you to the limits and puts you in the helmet of a really rally driver. You'll find yourself wincing when getting to close to the edge of a cliff, clenching your butt when going over a blind jump and lifting your head up into corners trying to see more of the track on a 2D screen... Some key good points:- The cars feel great which each class having their own identity- Locations have good diversity and plenty of routes- Great variety of cars to race around with- Very well polished even when in Early Access- Awesome simple UI- Incredible sound design- Large monthly DLC packs coming for free!There is still a few tweaks that can be made to the FFB but I'm sure they will be coming soon but even how it currently is it is a total blast to play and I don't think I have had a racing game that has giving this amount of immersion and edge-of-your-seat racing in a long while.

								A complex and extremely replayable racing game focused on traditional stage rallies and timed hillclimb events.DiRT Rally ditches the energy drinks, stadium trucks, drift events and general ""American dudebro"" motif of DiRT 2 & 3, and focuses completely and carefully on stage rallies, car maintenance and crew management.  Gone is the arcade feel of the previous games; DiRT Rally offers complex handling and modeling, making vehicle choice and pre-race setup a major consideration that will affect every aspect of an upcoming event.  Graphics and sound are extremely well-realized, making shakedowns and races a deeply absorbing experience.While DiRT Rally has only been released into Early Access for a few days, it's already remarkable well-developed and refined, offering intense racing experiences in a variety of challenging locations.  The game is slated to be in Early Access development for the next 6-7 months, and it will only increase in depth and quality during that time.  Highly recommended for all racing simulation enthusiasts and rally fans!			"

												Update 12-01-2017: Codemasters announced the PSVR version of Dirty Rally. We are still waiting for an official statement concerning Vive support and their seemingly very close business relationship to Oculus / Facebook. It's not that I don't want the game to run on the PSVR. Of course I want it. I am happy for all PSVR users. But let's be fair and bring it also to us VIVE gamers.A very good game, maybe the best Rally game since ages and the 3D vision support is impeccable. Unfortunately Codemaster did an exclusive deal with Oculus and ignores since months the Vive community that also want to play the game natively on their HMD.Coming a long way from consoles in the 90s I am so sick with exclusive deals and with platform wars, especially when it comes to such a blossom and innocent new technology like VR. Exclusive deals will kill VR!Therefore, I am giving this game a downvote, even that there is so much I love about the game. I am very much disappointed, since months I am writing here on the Forum for native Vive support. But until now, no Codemonster has the balls to tell us 1) that it is an exclusive deal and 2) if it will be time exclusive or not. Very disappointed. Man up Codemaster!Recommended for 2D.Recommended for 3D.Not recommended for the Vive.			"

								Thank you based Codies for a proper rally game. It feels like a modern Richard Burns RallyPros:-Proper rally ""simulation"", as in you have multiple stages with damage carrying over and the ability to repair damage with mechanics, provided you have enough time-No rewind function-Tracks are beautifully made with various dips, camber variations, crests and aren't 3 lanes wide anymore-Sound is great and are immersive-Graphics are clean with no unnecessary bloom and the like-Physics are definitely a step in the right direction and feel realistic and believable, you can feel the load turn the steering wheel heavy as you slide horizontally (though I've never driven a car through a gravel forest going 120km/h so I'm not too sure how realistic it feels)-Adjustable car setup with nice depth-Music is reminiscent of the classic Colin McRae Rally games -Pacenotes are organic sounding and natural, with pitch variations, blending rapid corners perfectly and detailed cautions-No frills, no BS, just RALLYING.Cons:-FFB needs definite work, feels much too muddy-Tracks are too short. Average being around 4 or 5 minutes long. Would be nice to have longer stages to mix things up-While car setup has a nice depth to it, they're still set by sliders. I'd like an advanced option to fine tune things with proper terms (angle/degrees, kN/m, mm, etc etc), though this is just nitpicking from me-Though there's a FOV option, it's pretty much useless-Can't hide steering wheel or arms in cockpit view-Mediocre performance, average only about 25-30fps on medium settings at 1600x900 with a 270x			"

												DIRT Rally is a game about discovery. About learning. About sweat. It's also about cars, and rallying, but it's more focused on yourself than any racing game I have ever played. Playing DIRT Rally drops you right inside the cockpit of a rally car, and demands of you to be as good as the real drivers in the real thing, because it's driving simulation is phenomenally close to the real thing. That's what makes it special. It's a non-stop race to learning the ropes, to learning to drive rally cars in different surfaces, to sweating on 10 minute specials where you need to shave 2 seconds, to discover what you are capable of when the odds are against you. It's the best off road racer of the last decade, and if you're even remotely interested in driving sims, cars, or rallying, you should buy it right now.			"

												As someone who has had no experience in rallying games before this, and coming from games such as burnout and need for speed, I can absolutely 100% say that this game is THE BEST racing game I have ever played. Even though it took me atleast about 3 hours of playing to just learn how not to crash, it was definitely worth it. There's something about getting those hairpins and those massive jumps just right that makes you feel like you've accomplised something. Not only that but it is unbelievably pretty. This game was definitely worth way more than what I payed for and I look forward for more content to be added to it. Kudos Codemasters. Kudos.CONS:- Game too pretty that I get distracted at times and crash.			"

								In one sentence: Rally game made right.In an analysis: This is the true successor to Colin MC'ray Dirt and any rally game before the DiRT series. It is rougthless, unforgiving, muddy, nerv-racking, rage inducing piece of awesomeness. You don't get any tutorial or some♥♥♥♥♥**le that narates your every step like DiRT 3, it throws you in the pool without any warning and you will fight for your life and BY GOD you will fail without tomorrow and I mean it. You will crash, by god you will crash so many times that you will curse the time you bought it, but that's what is the BEST part of this game because you will try to get better. It doesn't have a difficulty setting, the difficulty comes with experience, because every car behavies completely different from the other and every stage have different effect on your driving. Your best chance of success comes from hearing your co-driver and your reaction time. I read of people bashing this game cause of ""the physics of the game is trash !!1"" or ""the updatez don't fix this or that"". WRONG ! Every update makes the game even better than before, and every car that's get added, it's a new challenge and you want to use it on every challenge again and again. The background audience are crap, but who cares ?! Will you buy this game for the generic audience or for the breathless setting you are driving ? Filland fills like Filland and Greece fills like Greece, no stage is the same even in the same country or even when you drive the same stage backwards. The car deteriorates even if you drive like a pro, you know why ? Because that's what happens in real life too, aggressive driving deteriorates the car faster and puts you first while cautious driving deteriorates the car slower but you loose time and standing in the champioships, LIKE IN REAL LIFE ! A rock in the road can either send you corrining of the road or damage your tires and make you loose time. Every decision matters. The car sounds are spot on. Don't try it with keyboard, it's impossible, try at least with a controller but as soon as you get the cash invest on a steering wheel with force feedback and possibly with a gearbox because you will need to make the gear changes yourself, because the game has a bad habit of putting the wrong gears on the most critical times.I can go on for much longer, but the bottom line is this. If you like REAL rally games, then you own yourself this game. If you are new to rally games, then start with this game, before you even touch any other rally game.End of story.			"

												this is basically a pretty hardcore rally sim, it's not for the fainthearted and not for those who wants an easy to pickup racing game...rallying in this game is hard, prepare to restart a race a lot just to familiarize the stage as there is no arcade rewind mechanic...on the other hand, this game will award you with one of the most satisfiying driving feel in a game ever, driving really feel organic and brutal at the same time, something that games like pcars, assetto corsa, automobilista and the likes aren't capable to give you, because here it's you the driver, your car vs (mostly) the nature, not man made tarmac. That is what make the game feel so great, there are plenty of tarmac based racing games out there on any platform, but there is almost no pure rally game out there, especially not on this level of brilliance for the overall package.

												Before even trying to think to press the “buy button” you need to ask yourself some questions: 1- do you love Rally racing?2- do you like a challenge?3- (and the most important one) do you have a Racing Wheel?I got Dirt Rally a way back, tried to play it on my Xbox One Controller and I always fail miserably! I never bothered even to try with a keyboard, and I thought I wasted my money on a game I could not play, simply because it’s too damn hard!!Everything changed when I got myself a racing wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) a bit old wheel but still one of the best! so I fired Dirt Rally up and surprise! I was driving way better, hell, I even ended up 4th in the first round of the career! Dirt Rally feels so realistic, especially with a wheel, don’t bother to play with a controller or a keyboard, (well only if you are pretty good) the graphics are amazing, the sounds from the car engine, to the dirt, to the snow, to the rain, but don’t get distracted by the sound of the dirt under your wheels, you have to pay attention to your co-pilot, because he is your road map!oh and VR is amazing with that game! I have a Deepoon E2 (which works as Oculus DK2) and VR in Dirt Rally is very immersive! so if you like Rally racing, you love a challenge and you own a racing wheel, Dirt Rally is a must for you! "

It’s the ultimate test of a driver’s skill, and it’s the ultimate in high risk, high reward gameplay.			"

												Best rally racing game out there. A lot of cars, each with completely different handling, very challenging stages, neverending career mode with very hard difficulty, but also extremely satisfying when you finally manage to achieve that first place. It also contains only rally oriented modes (Rally, RallyCross, HillClimb). No more boring buggies, or dakar from previous Dirt games. Only downside is the amount of content, but it will still last you for tens or hundreds (my case) hours if you aim to completely master the game and achieve first places on all stages.			"

 About DiRT RallyDiRT Rally is the most authentic and thrilling rally game made, road-tested over 80 million miles by the DiRT community. It perfectly captures that white knuckle feeling of racing on the edge as you hurtle along dangerous roads at breakneck speed, knowing that one crash could irreparably harm your stage time. DiRT Rally also includes officially licensed World Rallycross content, allowing you to experience the breathless, high-speed thrills of some of the world’s fastest off-road cars as you trade paint with other drivers at some of the series’ best-loved circuits, in both singleplayer and high-intensity multiplayer races. ~ Release Date: 7 Dec, 2015GraphicsGame looks fantastic. There's a few things that Codemasters should improve like the spectators. They kinda look ugly for a 2015 game. And there's a few visual bugs related to shadows but nothing too severe. Interiors are BEAUTIFUL, full of details and speaking about details, the game is full of them inside and outside the vehicles. The mud, the burning brakes at night...SoundAgain, fantastic job. Cars sound incredible, specially the group B. You can even hear the window rattle. Soundtrack is nice, nothing too fancy but does the job.GameplayNow, this is where the game proves that is not a DiRT4. Rally is closer to simulation than ever before. There's a few options to make the experience a lil close to arcade (ABS, TCS, stuff like that) but if you turn them all off the game feels pretty realistic. I can't say how close is to RBR but one thing is certain, this is completely different to DiRT or even CM.And they added a few features, like upgrades for the cars (Nothing too powerful to make that Mini the ultimate rally car) and staff management, where you choose the team, pay their salaries, fire them and ofc each one has different stats that affect for example, the amount of damage they can repair between stages.All in All DiRT Rally is a nice Rally Game :-)10/10 From Me Sweep "

								So, You think you was doing good in Dirt 3 and you can just go straight in this game? Wrong. Why? Read below.Let me say few things first. i am 30 year playerwho love racing games. I played Dirt 3 and i was with Codemasters from my young days playing CMR 2.First i was thinking ""oh another rally game with arcadish feeling, let me give it a shot and i will refind it if i don't like it"".Oh boy i was wrong.First game welcomes you explaining this is early acess game and your feedback is needed, what they say is true. Game is in early acess but you have feeling it is complete product. I have ASUS laptop with 6Gb of ram and AMD HD 8670M with 1 Gb, game runs without problems on 1366x768 on high details and it looks beautiful, no hickups, no crashes, alt-tabing is easy and so far i did not see single problem with it. Sound is good and loud, co-driver is loud enough so you can understand him without problems, also you are getting corner notifications on middle of the screen that are clear and perfectly readable.Now for driving feeling.I am playing this game on keyboard, standard arrow keys. It is perfectly playable but you will need to break a lot of sweat to finish stage. I am planingnow to get racing wheel just because of this game but that will not be so soon because i need to collect money and explain my wife (tough part). But yes it is perfectly playable on keyboard but if you want more realism and drive it on your racing wheel i am sure you will not be dissapointed. Cars have different driving models and you can feel Codemasters give their best all cars feel diferently and i can say they have great sucsess.Now for actual driving.You have setup for cars before every stage, you can adjust bunch of settings such as brake bias, gears, suspensions. Spend some time there so you can setup vehicle for your taste because default settings are ok and if you know what you doing you can tweak them even more for extra seconds.Do not expect you will sit in car and go 200+ Km/h doing sick drifts and tricks. No. Game is not that easy.You will have to sweat your palms a lot to keep car on road and moitor every corner, calculate every jump and listen your co-driver all the time. Game is not forgiving errors and even if you do fell off stage you can recover vehicle which will result in 10+ second penalty or more depending how badly you crashed.Damage is done realisticly, tires will pop, suspension will go off, water will boil and engine will cut out, your body will be crushed like coke can if you hit a tree or spin.You can fix your car in between stages, you have limited time for every part so you will need to think good about fixing priorities. For example you will be able to fix engine and gearbox but not body and exhaust so think good what you need and balance it acordingly.I can proudly say i am glad i bought this game and i have no doubt i will have a lot of fun playing it. If you are searching for brilliant rally that is realistic search no more, you found it. Even if you are rookie this is great game to spend money and time on.i just want to say one big Thank you to Codemasters for this game and i am hoping they will continue adding content to it.I will see you all online, on dirt. :)Have fun, God bless.Boris Radijacija			"

There are no free lemons, you gotta learn things by yourself and the learning curve is very steep. You won't be winning much during your first hours, but when you start winning, it actually feels like you achieved something. Dirt Rally will offer great challenges to everyone, I guarantee it. If you ever feel that you are quite fast, hop online.			"

												First off, I am a long time PC racing simmer, going back to the early Papyrus days with Indianapolis 500. These days I race with an Obutto Ozone cockpit, G27 wheel and pedals, and a Fanatec Clubsport Shifter SQ.Let me just say that Dirt Rally is a superb game and racing sim in most respects. If you have interest in rally racing (both modern rally and vintage/historic rally,) it's a safe bet that you will more than get your money's worth out of the game. So now to break it down a bit more:Pros:-Wide variety of cars, broken down into very interesting categories such as 60's FWD, 80's RWD, Group B 4WD, and so on.-Each car behaves uniquely, even among cars in the same classification-SUPERB sound design; close your eyes while watching a replay and you'll swear you're watching a Youtube clip of a real rally stage.-Five beautifully modelled countries to race in, including Greece, Monaco, Wales, Germany, Finland, and Sweden.-Fully modelled Pikes Peak, including before full paving (partial dirt road) and after full paving (all asphalt)-Rally cross tracks, with online multiplayer-Realistic handling and force feedback effects (the physics and FFB are not hardcore sim quality like iRacing or Assetto Corsa, but certainly lean FAR more towards sim more than arcade)-Time of day and weather settings for all tracks, which provide gameplay variation and challengeCons:-Needs more rally stages, because you'll start to recognize sections quite quickly as play each stage more and more-The rally cross and Pikes Peak stuff is neat, but feels tacked on (a bit of the old Dirt games, in a way)-The interface is clunky; although it's been improved greatly since the first Early Access release, it's still not intuitive and will take some getting used to-As good as the sounds are (best in class by a long shot, really) there are a lot of minor issues, such as silent turbos in all of the turbocharged cars, at least on my 5.1 systemThis is an all around fantastic game, and I can't say enough good things about how the developers have listened to customer feedback from the beginning. I'm very hopeful that they will create some DLC with more countries or stages to rally in, and more vehicles to enjoy.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been on the look for a legit racing simulator for quite some time and i think this game is it.  - Physics replicate road and tire feel very well and It is actually quite hard and challenging, not for those looking for arcade/relaxing style easy drive.- Driving the courses/cars requires proper concentration or you'll end up being losing time, smashed up, mental inconsistence, or disqualified for severe vehicular injury. - Drive as if you would in real life, loss of friction, bumps, road camber, etc. requires careful throttle, brake control, etc.. Learning curve is very high especially if not use to rally and can be a little frustrating but I personally would not want it any other way for a game like this. - Excellent environment providing all of it's elements including ice, rain, snow, dawn, night time racing with functional headlights and more. - No need to really go into further details, it is as close to Rallying as you can get without actually being in a rally. Even the co-drivers voice has a sense of urgency under fast technicals and can hear some shakiness in voice on uneven/bumpy terrain. Maybe it's my imagination as once you put your concentration into the game it gets intense, but voice for slower parts of the course does seem more calmly put.game 10/10 for an early access with well executed content so far.I do think the game can get a little more real to induce more awareness and caution i.e.) sometimes you can smack rocks and trees and keep going. /shrugMy game runs extremely fluid with minimal fps drop and if it does it'll not affect my experience. I have game on ULTRA.i5 quad 3.5GTX 970 Nvidia8gb RAMThis game has me considering even putting out for a logitech g27.. game is that good of a driver imo. I've been playing with Xbox One controller thus far and tuning it to run properly is very hard as a controller cannot beat the pedal travel and the stick cannot replicate a steering wheel at the slightest. (Often times you end up full lock either direction on the control stick, or I just don't have the finesse to finely move the stick minute amounts to deliver low steering angle...) I have played shortly on a wheel set up and I think it does this game the much needed justice over the controller and especially the keyboard. If this game does come out for console, I'm sure they'll have the game calibrated to easily accomodate controllers.I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I've yet to try it, also hoping for more cars, environments, and tuning options of course. I've also not checked either steam or their main forums but I hear from other reviews before I bought the game that developers are very much looking to bring the best rallying simulation possible and I hope they keep it as real as possible for future as well. This shows with their constant updates from a outside looker point of view.*Caution: this game may not appeal to ricers as you cannot - Slam the cars- Stretch the tires- Run -20 camber with the said abovebut you can and will scrape; as a bonus, possibly brake an oil pan =PCouple of tips:- DO NOT CUT, there are solid obstacles or big gaps that it's possible to destroy your car completely or severely injuring it for the remainder of the race. - Look ahead, if you see some major openings to set yourself up for speed do it			"

												I tend not to purchase games when they're in early access as I've had some bad experiences. Dirt Rally is far from one of those bad experiences! I bought the game when it was in 0.5 and already was very pleased with the game. Since then they've added the RallyCross and 2 more full stages in Germany and now Finland. With every update comes a huge amount of content and bugfixes and it is simply put a tremendous game. The sound is one of my favourites in any racing game i've played, the handling model is right up there as well. All in all I can't recommend this game enough for fans of rally of indeed driving games in general!!			"

												I love how this game just popped out of nowhere when people were least expecting it. DiRT Rally is the most authentic rally racing game we've had in a while. It surely has more in common with the older Colin McRae games rather than the festival themed DiRT 2 or the gymkhana simulator DiRT 3.Everyone calls it the Dark Souls of racing games and rightfully so. The game can be unforgiving at times. Car handling feels quite realistic and stages are narrower this time around. You'll make mistakes, you'll crash and crash a lot. But that feeling when you finally nail a corner or beat a stage on your first try is just so damn satisfying.Graphics are splendid and so are the sounds, the weather effects look pretty good and everything feels very immersive. All in all, I really enjoyed this game and will be playing it for quite some time. If you're so much of a racing fan and still haven't played it yet, kill yourself. (just kidding)			"

Early Access Review
								(9/09/2015) - http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgchan/recommended/310560/Hello everyone,I will keep updating this review with new thoughts and incoming updates. First of all, I AM ALL TO THE PAIN SIM DRIVER! (I was so afraid to buy this game because of ARCADISH style of previous ones - FEAR NOT and buy now !) Few years of Richard Burns Rally (raw, rsrbr, rbr-world), iRacing, Live for Speed etc. I will write some more in free time - I have to rally some more now!THE GOOD:+ soft-lock is a great feauture~! (you don't have to set rotation of your wheel for each car, you put it on max and the game will do the rest, fixing it to a current driven car)+ Rally Cross mode is plenty of fun. The cars feel much better than the ones from rally mode, a bit too slippery though, it feels like driving on ice most of the time+ dashcam is way to go, forget the cockpit view if you strive for the maximum realism. It looks and feels amazing~! I just wish more cars would have shift-light and gear inf box located higher so we could see them in this view+ 306 Maxi + German special stages on tarmac are so much fun+ driving on a rim (without a tyre) is not fun :)+ with higher difficulty, the weather conditions get worse (night, snow, rain etc.) Unfortunately, only your visibility is affected... the handling stays the same...+ I can't get enough of how rain looks like... simply amazing+ WRC Ford Fiesta handles beautifully on Welsh stages!+ night + heavy rain = heaven!+ amazing lighting work; it looks so incredible when you are driving through shaded areas and the bright sun rays are falling into your cockpit+ if you hold the handbrake with RWD cars without clutch you can stall them, yea!+ your gears can pop out, if you have damaged gearbox!!!+ daily, weekly and monthly online events where you can't restart! YEA!!!+ sounds!+ graphics (about which, I really don't care - but it looks amazing)+ overall pleasure from rallying!+ I expected much worse+ water-splash is so sick!!!+ car repairs+ sense of speed+ it is already much better than RBR!!! Can you believe it!? No?! Me too! BUT IT IS - trust me!+ I can't stop rallying already and I am driving the slowest car~! + great animations of cockpit, you can see your feet working on gas, brake and clutch pedals+ logitech g27 @ 540* works like a charm!+ SS (special stages) look amazing!THE BAD:- NOT EVEN CLOSE TO RICHARD BURN'S RALLY! ARCADY AS F*CK... It is far far away from being a simulator... It is plenty of fun but I don't think it will even come close to RBR...- zero respect for the speed... you can drive 100km/h, hit a tree and still drive without any consequence... PATHETIC!- [PARTIALLY FIXED - all surfaces feel weird] during the rain, you can't tell the difference between wet and dry surface... ARCADE BS!- zero respect for Monte Carlo stages... too much grip... too easy... ARCADE BS!- you can barely slide the car unless you use a handbrake...- [FIXED - clutch override option added] there is no MANUAL SEQUENTIAL GEARBOX + MANUAL CLUTCH... which is real WRC car setup- the power of WRC MINI on tarmac is some kind of a bad joke...- you start rolling after a great crash and the game resets you on the road... stop with this arcade BS!- terrible ARCADE DAMAGE SYSTEM! You can literally bounce back from walls... - bring the deadly one from RBR!!! No mercy for arcade noobs ! - when you fell out of a road, it takes one button to recover... WTF!? It should be at least 30sec of penalty!THE UGLY:~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... still not fair]=[all cars except for WRC have now delay when using sequential gearbox, very good idea] people driving with full manual setups and zero assists ( h-pattern + manual clutch = it is so much HARDER ) should not be thrown into bag with other drivers using different easier setups.~ the cars slow down way too fast when you are not accelerating!~ not enough stages in my opinion. Even though the location are very nice, they get boring rather quickly...~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... still feels slugish]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] FFB feels like I am driving every car without a power steering, I constantly have to fight with my wheel... after 13h+ of rallying it is so bloody annoying!~ [FIXED]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] definitely needs more details in handling (although some icy parts of the road were amazing and they have sent me straight into a wall)~ how can you not let us change different tyres for different surfaces!? It is rally FFS!~ [FIXED]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] FFB needs to be much more detailed, it feels very sluggish at the moment - still nice though~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... the gears still pop out randomly]=[they pop out now only when gearbox is damaged or when you have not pressed clutch all the way down during a gear change] gears from my H-pattern pop out from time to time; not sure if bug or simulator thingy* After more than 63 hrs on record of rallying in Dirt Rally, I have found myself missing the real professional sim... and started racing in iRacing again, even though I do not like track racing. This game is really good, and plenty of fun, but it is as close of being a simulator as Counter-Strike is... It will never be a sim, everyone with a little piece of working brain, can see where this is heading... Do I still have a hope for it to become one? No, not anymore. This is nothing more but a good arcade rally game. If they will keep advertising this as a sim, I will change my review drastically, they do not deserve this word SIMULATOR, describing this title!** After 67 hrs on record, I am too irritated with stiff handling and almost none existent weight balance to continue... As I said before, it is only an arcade game and they have no idea about simulations... I want to punch them in the face for talking about simulating a drop in power, on high elevated special stages, when they let you hit a wall at the maximum speed without any consequence... This is not the biggest problem though, you are not taking pleasure from hitting walls, right? Rally is all about the skilfull handling of the car, the way you do it, you balance the weight of the car. Unfortunately, you can't feel it, in this game at all. The physics feel off, cars are too stiff, unresponsive, underpowered and god knows what else... Even the sound of the cars became dull and boring after a while... Those are rally cars god damn it! Let them sound like monsters!Now, I can clearly say that RBR is still no. 1, such a shame...EDIT: After coming back from a month or so break, game feels amazing again. The RallyCross is fun and the cars actually feel like the WRC should have... It is a great game... I am just angry because I know it can be the best rally simulator ever created, I just hate the idea that they are trying to please both; arcade turds and sim freaks like myself... Unfortunately because of this, the games falls somewhere in between... Too hard for total arcade noobs, and too arcady for a real simulator... What a shame...More incoming soon!Thanks for reading--tgchan.com "

								The mechanics in this game feel excellent, it runs smoothly, and it feels like an accurate simulation of actual driving.I play full manual with H-shifter & clutch on a Logitech G27 wheel (which the game picked up and configured the settings for perfectly) and the force feedback and wheel return is pretty much perfect. They seem to be adding new content fairly regularly, all of which so far has been of a very high quality.It's early access so there's a couple of small bugs here and there as of writing this review which I'm sure will get fixed, but nothing major. Alt tabbing the game means it switches to windowed mode which is annoying, and starting without launch control sometimes results in a jumped start even though I'm in neutral with the handbrake on. Otherwise I haven't noticed any other bugs and it hasn't crashed once.This is the best realistic driving game around right now, and one of the only games I would recommend buying in early access. They are doing early access right.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this on prerelease with a little concern given how hit or miss codemasters can be (Dirt Showdown anyone?) and didn't want a racing game aimed at the console crowd where a gamepad plays better than a wheel after all the assists are added. This game amazes with great physics, beautiful graphics, and a challenging set of race stages. It might be too sim-like and complicated for children with the extensive car set-ups and difficult runs, but the cars drive so realistically with a wheel (g27 here) it is incredibly immersive and provides a compelling racing experience. The cons are that it is still pre-release at this time and while the online challenges provide a sort of multiplayer, it still doesn't have true multiplayer races which I will be disappointed if they don't add eventually. And I'll be annoyed if this is all you get and the additional promised content will be DLC that you have to purchase after the ""official"" release of the game. Nevertheless, for the prerelease cost it is an awesome game that is worth buying if you like driving games with realistic physics and great graphics. My feeling is that the work Codemasters put into the physics paid off and they have a winner in this genre.			"

												This game is punishing, and I adore it. Nothing like any of the previous DiRT titles where you can just mash down the gas and steer for dear life although fun not realistic.  I found out very quick that you have to finely tune your vehicle and finesse it through every track, alot of skill to build in this game. At the time of this review I'm only sitting at around 15hrs or so but from what I can see there are a lot of tracks to race on and vehicles to unlock or should I say purchase.  Again it's nothing like any of the previous DiRT titles, it's an actual simulation now instead of an arcade game.  It's punishing, I'll say it again..IT'S PUNISHING. Now you get a crew chief and get to hire and upgrade mechanics, in between stages you can repair your car.  The graphics are beautiful and the sound is great.  To be honest I was shocked when I first started playing, I couldn't do anything or keep my car on the road because I was so used to how the old DiRT titles played.  I stepped back took a deep breath and began to start respecting the game for what it had evolved into, an effing simulation.  Once I learned I had to tweak my car settings for every single track and gave the game respect I started picking it up and learning to drive again.  In the old DiRT series you really didn't have to make serious adjustments for most tracks anyways, in this game you really need to...or you will fail.  Also I read some other reviews about people playing with a M&K..not going to happen...you need a controller by default.  This game actually makes me want to go out and invest into a wheel and pedals, I have never ever considered that until now.  I'm about to take my nerd level up a notch. I played DiRT 2 the most even after DiRT 3 was released since I was so ashamed of DiRT 3 and all of the Gymkhana whatever stuff they forced into a series of races.  Now that we are back to DiRT lets keep it here please, this game has redeemed the series and for that I am truly grateful.  The game just feels and looks and sounds so good, and there are a lot more customizable options now to your cars, I don't want to spoil it but you have to ""unlock"" the good customization options. You are going to need them, the more you drive a car the more your team becomes familiar and the more unlocks for your customization abilities for that particular car you are granted.  The nice thing is all of the liveries are already unlocked giving you a little bit of flavor right off the bat, but the new customization replaces you being able to unlock paint jobs. The game feels balanced, the physics are very punishing and realistic and you will grow to respect the track and your car very quickly.  I have not found a track I dislike yet, they are modeled so well and the physics of each track are so amazing and..whats the word...brutal.  One other thing about the DiRT series I always loved was the replays, and they are just as amazing now as they always were.  There is no more rewind your mistakes, now its ""reset"" your car with a time penalty unless you can drive out of your mistake quicker than resetting your car.  You can resart the race but you will lose a specific amount of credits that are given to you each race as a reward for not using the restart feature. Eventually using the restart enough times in one race will render you with zero bonus credits but they will not affect your original credits you will earn for finishing the race.  Very well done on Codemasters part, they are very balanced on punishing you as a driver without robbing you. ;) They did a good job with this game this time around folks, you can plunge into career mode ""like me"" or go test drive any car on any track on custom championship.  In career mode they don't necessarily throttle you to go a certain way, it's basically up to you and how you spend your hard earned credits towards vehicles in order to access certain tracks and races.  Codemasters deserve a nice little pat on the back, job well done. If you were or are a rally or DiRT fan and want to kick it up a notch or two buy this game, you won't regret it.  It's punishing and beautiful and lots and lots of replay value.			"

												I bought an old Microsoft Sidewinder Force 2 USB directional force feedback joystick used on eBay after playing Dirt 3 and loving the game, but feeling like the controls were way too similar to old console games from the 90s back before analog sticks came around.Back in the late 90s, I started a computer store and I used to sell the Logitech brand of directional force feedback wheels and sticks.  Logitech had the best hardware ever brought to the consumer market when it came to the sticks and the cables and the motors.  It made a decent racing/flying game an absolutely riviting experience.  To give an idea of why directional force feedback matters, try getting into a go-kart at a local kart racing place.  Just rent a kart and go around the track.  That wheel will fight you around every turn, and it makes the driver/road connection a real wrestling match.  This is also what it is like racing a full sized vehicle off road, on gravel, or on dirt.  When you push a vehicle to the limits of traction and beyond, that wheel becomes quite a bear to content with but it also gives you feedback about what the vehicle is doing that is less obvious otherwise.So feedback like this makes a racing experience more real.  Cool.  In addition, the tiny little sticks that most consoles use (like the 360 controller) don't have the fine degree of control that something like racing needs.  The tiny sticks are great when it comes to analog direction, but not so great when it comes to distance between center and fully pressed in a given direction.  This isn't important for all games, but the shortcoming becomes obvious in situations like racing.I play games sitting on the couch, with a projector screen in my living room connected to my PC.  This means a wheel and pedals would be quite cumbersome, because I have no desk to clamp such a monster to.  My experience with wheels is that they are often less precise than a large joystick, and certainly less precise than an actual hydraulic/cable driven steering wheel from a car or kart.All this is why I bought this joystick.  I bought such an old one because they don't make large, directional force feedback analog sticks like this anymore as near as I can tell, the market trends just aren't pushing them.  This old stick requires no drivers in Windows 7 x64, so it really is plug and play.  The old Logitech stick I used to own/sell is technically superior, but it isn't compatible with newer flavors of Windows so it isn't an option anymore.As to the experience, I actually bought Dirt Rally after having some difficulty setting it up with Dirt 3, seeing that Dirt Rally just came out, and reading an interview that says they added analog stick support to the default controller profiles set up for Dirt Rally.  I did get joystick support and directional feedback working with Dirt 3, but it just feels wrong, and it needs to be tuned in some manner because it will literlally throw me off the road even when I have the force dialed back to a mere 10% in the game.  The force reduction doesn't seem to work and the motors are strong enough to literally muscle you off the road, if the game/stick aren't tuned or tunable to work well together.I did have to go in and set the stick and the throttle (built into the stick) as needed so Dirt Rally knew what to do with it but once I did, the motors in the stick snapped to life and the stick was suddenly ready to go (it sits in a relaxed state with the stick lounging to the side until a game talks to it).I jumped into the first track, with the first car.  WOW!  Not only did it bring back memories of playing on my old analog stick and driving racing games like Need for Speed or Star Wars Pod Racing, even better, it reminded me of getting behind the wheel of an actual vehicle and carefully driving around mountain roads as I get a feel for how far I can safely push the vehicle.  I wasn't fast.  I wasn't a speed demon.  It felt like driving a real vehicle.  It wasn't relaxing, it was edge of your seat stuff!  I nearly felt like I had left my house, and had an adventure as I get a feel for gravel roads, as the feedback goes from pushing against you gently, to pushing harder, to going slack when you slingshot past a spot and know if your angle of entry wasn't good you are in trouble because the steering went slack due to a sudden and temporary complete lack of traction.This game isn't flashy.It isn't about eye candy.Tracks take longer, like real driving does.This is the game that gets you into racing.This is the game that gets you into racing games.This game is the reason you get better controllers.Kudos, and thanks for getting me back into racing, and giving me a reason to get into force feedback that is more than mere rumbles!

								I got a problem since I got this DiRT Rally...  I can't stop playing! hahahahI never drive a rally sim before, just regular race sims...  but I saw a lot of RBR and others, I want to get some to try, but except for RBR the reviews are not so good.Then this game came on steam, I saw some postive reviews, and decided to get it, and I don't regret!It's amazing, very funny, challenging, addictive!The technics to drive a rally car are some different. I'm liking to practice and get a bit better now since my first stages, but I still have  a lot to learn. It's very cool!One positive aspect is it seems Codemasters are listen the public, the foruns are crowded and the devs are open to feedbacks. The game is in early access now, but already playable, and we hope its getting even better over the time.If you like race sims, and want to race rally way, give it a try, good chances you'll like it.

If you like rallying, driving or a challenge, buy DiRT Rally.If you've ever wondered how rally drivers control their cars in the amazing way in which they do, well DiRT Rally will give you some idea.Other track based racing sims I have are very good, but for me DiRT Rally provides the best overall driving experience.  The cars feel alive!    Spend a bit of time getting it to feel right for you and do a little research about ffb settings and mods.Don't expect to jump in a car and to be quick immediately.  This is a sim.  It will take time to learn and master it, but you will have fun while you are doing so.  With over 280 hours in DiRT Rally I am still learning, and still getting quicker!Finally DRIVE SLOWER TO GO FASTER  You will have heard this before.  It sounds silly, but its true.  Don't drive on the limit and on the edge of crashing at every bend and you will be amazed at your stage times.  The WRC drivers talk about ""getting into a rhythm.""  When you get into that rhythm you will understand what they mean.			"

								It's good, feels updated, give you goosebumps... What more could you want if you like rally? (the compleated game no doubt) My only problem with this game is its still plagued with Codemaster things mainly with the car modeling, brakes that glow red hot for only a second, damage from Dirt Showdown days. Not very new or fresh.edit: The tracks need much more work, the roads are pointy and blotchy. Not very natural, but this is early work. I'm starting to think Dirt Rally isn't new, the car modeling annoys me far too much. Please give the cars some soul, some mass, better visual physics, nerd stuff like traction blobs and brake temp. It currently feels fake :/edit2:The water effects is fantastic, tracks are coming on well yet the skybox is a little ugly. Lost my left back tier on a new finnish stage, sparks constantly. Another rant about car realisum wouldnt help this review but with Project Cars 2 looking as if it may introduce rally CM needs to pick up the pace if they want to keep the crown of best PC rally game.Still, the game gets my heart pounding. Darting around corners then shooting off into intense speeds over rough roads, if you do that well for most of the stage! gotta love it!			"

This game is exactly what true Rally fans have been wanting for about 10 years, the stages are perfectly recreated the cars handle as they should, this is a Rally sim not a wrc style arcade racing game.Don't be put off by previous Dirt titles this is the real rallying deal.

I still do. Fail, that is. Yet I keep playing - and improving. Dirt Rally is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding car game I have ever played (and the list that started with Sega Rally 2 has grown quite long). It is fast-paced and unforgiving.In the career mode you have the added complexity of managing your crew, which adds both an interesting tactical flavour as well as a sorely needed input _other_ than your driving skills. This pleases some and annoys some. But the feature is solid.You get a ton of great tracks, a heap of great cars, and hours of good fun. What more do you want?			"

								Me, as a amateur co-driver and rally enthusiast find this game no doubt the next gen rally simulator. Of course its still WIP and raw, but i see great potential. It's really hard to go fast, and when you go, mistakes are easy to come, but i enjoy the feeling when you push 101% in the woods of UK for 10 stages in a row, just to win rally by matter of seconds. Of course there are some flaws, like when hiting a snow bank in Monte Carlo rally, then it feels like hiting concrete fall. There are also some pacenotes call out and corner speed mistakes, but hey, even in real life co-drivers use to make these mistakes. You guys from Dirt Rally development crew, keep up the good work and set the next benchmark for driving simulators!			"

												Best Rally game in years and in my opinion best Dirt game since the first one. Traction feels perfect, graphics are amazing, real time weather is awesome, the simulation of actual Rally racing compaired to Dirt 2/3 is much more accurate, and its actually difficult to win a championship instead of just handing it to you. I will be sure to put much more time into the game here soon with the inclusion of RallyX and HillClimb. Glad to see CodeMasters go back to their racing roots and show that they can still make amazing games. If you are on the fence about buying the game, just get it. Its a 10/10 Rally racing game all day long.			"

								Well I'm gonna have to relearn how to rally because D3 and DR are two totally different monkeys. Dirt 3 was about a collection of cars you had all the access in the world to, and increasing driver level unlocked new cars. DR took the classic route of ""if you want it, you gotta earn it!"" buy unlocking them with in game currency earned from races. But this game is so far beyond just that simple principal of drive>earn>buy. You have to hire a pit crew who maintain and tune your ride, pay for repairs, keep the crew happy, it gives an authentic feel of running a rally team outside of ""this is my car, there are many like it..."". And winning makes more money yes, but winning takes REAL work! The cars in this game handle nothing like they did in D3, I've driven my poopy personal IRL car down a dirt road and I have to be just as careful in this game as driving IRL. Crashes ruin your runs, and you get no rewind system. The ONLY assist in this game is your co-pilot, and you have to focus on the road, and what he's feeding you and misinterpreting what he says or not even listening can lead to your car getting wrecked. And the damage system in this game is brutal! I lost a tire mid-race and had to either chug on without it, or stop, and add a few minutes to my stage time replacing it. YES. YOU REPAIR YOUR CAR MID STAGE. And this eats time, which affects your position, which affects your earnings. This game will teach you a whole new respect for the rally world, and that's not a bad thing.If Collin McRae were still here, he would own a hundred copies of this game and he would be so proud of the legacy he left the gaming world.

 Welcome to the Dark Rally Souls  If you played the rally games of the 90´s you´ll recognise the spirit of that one, if not, basically it is: harsh, severe and a didactic experience about an simulation rally game. Seems that codemaster has found the way back to the future and made the best game about simulation. There are a lot of cars and tiers so the game has a good duration, now I´ve played 7 hours and just passed to the second ""tier"". The difficulty curve it is well escalted and you´ll pass across the different categories learning the differences between them.  Graphics : are simply the bests in this kind of games. Control : better if you have a gamepad and even better a pc steering wheel, never keyboard. Gameplay : is about maximum concentration, penalizing fool errors but awarding the regularity.  Good multiplayer , apart from the trolls. I do not reccomend if: you give up at the first sign of struggle or you don´t really like this kind of games.			"

												I was never a big fan of racing games. Back in the day I loved Burnout 3 but it wasn't until Burnout Paradise when I really started loving racing games. After that, it took me years to get back into racing games. GRID 2 and Dirt 3 made me love the genre but both of those are really arcade. Not long after beating Dirt 3 I bought Dirt Rally.Most racing games trick you into thinking that you: 1) Can drive a car in the game really really well and 2) you're actually doing well in it. Dirt Rally does neither of those things. You can immediately tell when you're doing well and when you're not. The feeling of road is insane and will surprise people who aren't used to simulators (and even those who play games like Gran Turismo that are closer to simulation than most racing/rally games out there).In short, the game feels really good. I get instant feedback from doing well. It's so different from most other games I've played. Going back to other racing or rally games might be hard after Dirt Rally.The only real criticism I have is about the variety of tracks. Six events with 12 different stages per event is great and will take you quite a while to master but they totally could have released more events as a DLC and I would have bought that. I still recommend this game very much and I can say it's the best game I found during 2016.			"

								YES. Buy it. Not only do i recommend this Game but also i suggest buying a decent steering wheel.I just made my own raceseat and fittet it with a G27 Wheel and it's amazing. Racing for 3 hours and i am physically exhausted.If you love Rally / Rally-Games AND you can race a car without constant full throttle you will get your moneys worth here.This means, as this game (at least imo) counts as a simulation, you have to treat it like one. If you get off the track hard, you fail the stage, or at least get a recovery penalty so big, you consider the run failed just aswell.You will restart your races a lot in the beginning and i even suggest this so you can learn the game/cars. Later on, when you did, you shouldn't need to restart. Just accept the outcome.I really recomend a steering wheel of some sort or at least a controller with feathering triggers (like the xbox pad). PS: Ditches love cars. Give that ditch a car.			"

												After nearly 100 hours in, I figured it was time to throw my two cents into the bucket for DiRT Rally.  The good:-Driving in DiRT Rally does what no other DiRT game has been able to accomplish:  make you feel like you're about to have a MASSIVE accident.  The stages are all real, and some quick searches on the internet will show you that the tree you just crashed into does actually exist, and the rock that sent you for a wild cartwheel has probably claimed a few egos as well.  While DiRT 3 had some of the best multiplayer modes to come out of the series, DiRT Rally fills the gap that has always existed:  Rally.  Not since the days of Richard Burns Rally has a game been able to make me think ""I'm about to destroy this car"" yet find a way to make me keep my foot down.  -The visuals for this game are part of what gives you the feeling of excitement.  To me, graphics mean nothing in terms of how good a game is, but small things placed along rally stages such as little bushes, rocks, ditches, and even the high-density forests really do produce an exhilarating feeling as you roar through the stages.The bad:-The first, and probably the most jarring, thing that people notice is the lack of content.  Yes, there are (as of now) six different Rallies: Wales, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Monte Carlo, and Greece, however each rally is only two long stages of 15km+, with other stages consisting of half-runs through those stages.  One long stage is run in two directions, then each half is run in either direction, producing 6 stages for each long stage, thus 12 stages possible for each Rally. Fantastic, at first, and even goes so far as being challenging you to go faster as you learn the stages.  However, after a while the stages just become repetitive, and it's no longer new challenges.  You're either fast through the stage or you aren't, and the game begins to lose its luster.  The same goes for the other two modes:  Rallycross and Hillclimb.  So far, only three Rallycross tracks exist, with multiple layouts for each, while Hillclimb only has Pikes Peak, and that can be split into minor sections to add some substance to a rather thin environment. -There are a lot of cars, especially for a Rally game.  However, eagle-eyed players will be quick to note that specific cars will always outrun other cars, regardless of the situation.  For instance, the DiRT Rally forums are quick to point out that the Ford Fiesta is nearly impossible to beat on the Lydden Hill RX, the Peugeot is the king of Sweden's RX, and Norway's is a toss between the two.  As a result, RX multiplayer matches are full of Fords and Peugeots, with the other cars getting little love.  It also seems that there's no interest in addressing the issue.-Small bugs run rampant, and can ruin the game for some.  One major bug is the ""exhaust"" bug, which can turn a broken, worn-out wreck into a rocket ship.  Another, a little-known mod that may be correcting the variable surface built into the game, providing optimal conditions to those who use it, while others may be left with a worn-out and slick stage.  Currently, there is a popular topic on the forums about whether or not to completely wipe and reset the leaderboards because of it.-More issues, such as dodgy pace notes, fragile tires, shortcuts in the RX tracks, and a possible AI time bug exist, yet don't seem to be getting addressed.Conclusion:If you're a major rally nerd like I am, you'll love the feel this game provides.  Eventually though, everyone will inevitably grow weary of running the same stages over and over through Career mode.  Luckily there are Daily, Weekly, and Monthly modes to compete against the world, and see how you stack up against the human opponents.  A fantastic feature, but without pacing yourself, you could be left with nothing to do for a good portion of the week.  Despite that, I still love the game and play it almost every day, but I always wind up feeling disappointed and wishing there was that little extra something to keep me hooked.			"

												Edit: FULL RELEASE (short 'n' sweet review).Utterly brilliant package, can't fault it really. My below EA impressions summarise the feel and flow of the game well enough so I don't want to repeat myself.Really impressed with the sheer amount of content for the price too, lots of different cars and locations on offer. Codies back at their absolute best!10/10, cracking game. Best virtual driving experience I've had in years.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Disclaimer... I would hardly call myself an expert but I've been driving things fast since I could reach a steering wheel. Mostly karts, with the odd single-seater and tin-top hoon.+Handling: This thing is hard to master, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. The handbrake is my new best friend. I've genuinely not had this much fun with virtual driving in a long time, it's just so involving and physical. It's easy to get going at a somewhat competent pace, but to effectively carry speed you need to go full Finland. Pretty much the closest I've personally felt a game has come to a true driving 'experience' anyway.+Presentation: Slick as ♥♥♥♥, functional, tidy. Does what you want it to fast, and it's very easy to navigate. I love the Colin McRae 2.0-style car outlines, and the doodle pace note icons. It feels like a true-to-heart, wonderfully British rally experience. Awesome stuff.+Stages: Perfect in length, and there's already enough variety in there to keep me busy for a while. They're just long and different enough to keep me on my toes, but not so much that I can't pick it up and start zoning out from pace notes after a few attempts. I hate being overly attentive to them anyway.+Cars: I was surprised by the decent selection we have to kick off with considering the price, good stuff. Seems like a no-messing attempt to get the best rally vehicles possible so that's fine by me. I like how it's split into decades too, nice sense of progression (not just with age but speed!).+Sound/Graphics: I've seen a lot of praise for the former but honestly, both of these seem a minor at best improvement over the stellar Dirt 3. Not a bad thing, I've just not been blown away visually as yet. It's nice and clean though, does what it needs to do. I like the co-driver voice, sounds like a top bloke.ISSUES SO FAR:- FFB can feel a little muted at times.- DFGT wheel seems to not be recognised every now and again, and the resultant pause messes with the steering lock / overall FFB feel. Restarting sorts it.- All audio drops out if I try to play with the 60's Lancia. No idea why.OVERALL:Whether you're an old-school Codies fan or mildly interested in the rally genre, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. Seriously, expecially for the price, it's ♥♥♥♥ing good.			"

												In one word: 'Dirt!'10/10 Best Rally simulation ever built! Would rip wheels from Mini Cooper with 12km of stage left again!!!This game truly represents a back to basics hardcore experience that places you in the front seat and incontrol of a rally team; where you take this team is entirely left to you from car purchases, to upgrades, the engineers performing this upgrades, graphs galore and other slight car attenuations to match the race car to your needs!This game brings racing simulation for the off road motorsports fan into a new generation, its doesn't require small crowd shiny things such as short tracks, big name narration or more recent additions such as gymkhana and drift... Why? Because all you need is some DiRT (And Ice, Snow, mirror deep Mud to name a few) to Rally on, at the edge of your seat for a white knuckle expereince attempting to hold your car onto the track... so what if 3 of its 4 tires are down and flat, with only 1 tire still up... it doesn't matter as it's just bounced off with your wheel down the embankment! (Who knew you could rip the wheels of a Mini Cooper) The game challenges you to rethink the tactics we've grown used to and that is done so simply its beautiful and it will leave you hanging for more after some short stage recovery. The stages are incredibly intense!This game changes what you know, what we know about Rally games and challenges you to push past its clasp of simulation as it removes the best DiRT Rally games into arcade bins as it creates new standards.Great physics, awesome sound effects, wicked cockpit simulations it's as real as you get and the best bit... No micro transactions... once you buy this game its yours, all of its content and its ongoing updates by the developers that listen to their community! Codemaster you've outdone yourself!!!Drive safe!			"

												5 reasons why you should get DiRT Rally, now!5. You would feel like a rally driver. Suggest to turn up your air conditioning when driving in snow in order to have the maximum effect.4. It is realistic and beautiful. I turn off all the assist and auto-gearbox, just like in F1. Except, this is more fun than F1 games. Also getting rewarded in-game for playing it the hard way. Restart is discouraged. Basically just move forward after a big mistake, like real racing.3. It is mind boggling that the same company that made that crappy F1 game (OK not all iterations are crappy) is the one that made this brilliant racing game. Perhaps what people say about geniuses are true. It is a matter of hits and misses.2. I play with PS3 controller (in PC and it's great). I don't race well. It can be hard. But I get to enjoy the journey and experience. Woohoo!1. I am more grateful to what I have in life, more thankful having those who are around me. After seeing a few near-death experience here and there (man, those cliffs), I see life differently.What about cons and suggestions? Here are two.A) I need a female co-pilot. I mean, if I am to hear a voice yelling to my head all the time, I would prefer a female voice.B) Why is there no Singapore flag :( Fortunately I was born in Hong Kong. At least that is representated in the game.			"

												Wow. Just Wow.What a fantastic game. I have been so bored with recent racing games. They feel so vanilla.This game feels like my old Peugeot 205 GTi or my recent Peugeot 405 T16. Brutal if driven wrong, beyond rewarding if driven right. There are so many moments, where just like in a real car, you flinch for the brake and pray the car turns in, but it just understeers like a dog into a tree and ruins your entire race, just like the real thing would. So nice to feel like you're really driving a car :) Have to say though, the top spec cars absolutely require a wheel and pedals. You just can't drive them with a digital accelerator! Damn right as well. Most cars are just fine, and even brilliant fun with a keyboard :)Have now added an HTC Vive + Revive + G29 Wheel. I can't recommend this game in VR more highly. It is just perfect. So so good. Runs like a _dream_ on an R9 Fury X w/ 1.4 super sampling, albiet with custom quality settings.Anyways. Bravo! Top notch game, worth every damn cent.EDIT: There are 1 annoying aspects to the game (currently)2. The tiny ripple of gravel on the edge of the road (Wales you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!) will flip your car like a playing card. It has been improved, but sometimes it feels a bit too rigid.			"

								After you try DiRT Rally you will probably never want to go back to any previous DiRT game, Codemasters have done an incredible job so far bringing realism and thrill to Rally racing and with the addition of the FIA World RX to the mix its a must have game for anyone that enjoys watching the real RX championship.The game is still being updated as part of Early Access, and it still has some issues and missing basic PC features such as mouse menu support, but overall for an Early Access game it is very well polished.If you are looking for a great Rally and Rallycross game you won't find a better one on the market then DiRT Rally.

												Hands down one of the best driving games I have ever had the pleasure of owning. Would I recommend this to you? If you're looking for a challenging driving experience, I would say go for it.The game speaks for itself in a lot of ways. It doesn't hold your hand. The only way you're going to get a podium finish in this game is if you fight for it. But the satisfaction of finally getting there is part of what makes this game so great.I've never focused more in a video game than I have in DiRT Rally. Whether it's in the lush countryside of Germany or the steep rocky trails of Greece, they all have one thing in common; the courses are beautiful. The level of detail in this game is astonishingly well done. The courses presented are true to life and do an excellent job of capturing the scenery. I've found myself slowing down a few times just to admire the view. Whether that view is of the landscape or the car I'm driving, it's always a treat.This game has a lot more to offer than just good visuals. With 39 cars available, ranging from the 60s to modern, there is something here for everyone (personally I can't get enough of the 95' Impreza). While all the cars aren't terribly different from one another, at least not in the same category, they each have their own little personality that can make you love them or hate them.Alongside the career mode that you can progress through, there are also daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboard challenges. These really help the longevity of the game since it's literally infinite challenges. You can also just create your own tournaments or do quick runs on a chosen course(s). If there's one thing I can say that disappointed me with DiRT Rally, it's the number of courses. After you spend many hours with the game, you start to learn locations by heart. Suddenly your co-driver becomes more of a nuisance than a valuable guide. It loses a little of its luster after that. I understand that recreating iconic courses like this is very expensive and time consuming, but it's a little disappointing nonetheless. This is one of the games I hope they release DLC for. I would gladly fork out some cash for some more content of this quality. tl;drOne of the best rally experiences ever created. Get it if you're a rally fan and are up for a challenge. "

Brief summaryOf all current rally games, DiRT Rally is one truly great game for those looking for an exhilerating, intense and fun experience; therefore, it really is one of my favourite on-the-edge-of-the-seat driving games. There are a lot of cars and various real-life stages with the challenging bumps and road width, and the co-driver is generally excellent in guiding through stages. Cars generally feel and sound fantastic on gravel and snow. The only downside for me is the unrealistic tyre model and  abrupt dynamic behaviour on asphalt. On the whole, I would wholeheartedly recommend DiRT Rally to anyone to enjoys the exciting world of motorsports. 8.5/10._________Cars and tracksThere are plenty of iconic rally cars from several classes, such as modern WRC machines, classic ‘70s, contemporary R4 cars to vehicles from the Group B era. In total, thirty-nine cars are available, and it is very noticeable that each have a specific handling. Thirty of these cars are available to drive in point-to-point rally stages. One particularly good aspect is that most of the cars sound very realistic in engine noise, and that they really seem to have a raw roar/irregularity to them as heard in their real-life counterparts. There is an upgrading system in the career mode; cars start out underpowered and overweight, and only after driving them several hundreds of kilometers, they will have the correct figures. Consequently, drivers that do not belong to the top 5% or so will have a hard time to win rally stages until they drive further.In terms of tracks, currently there are six countries: Greece, Monaco, Finland, Sweden, Wales and Germany. Each country features two unique long stages, which are around the 10 km mark, or between the high six and low eight minutes of driving time, depending on driving skill. Smaller stages are just segments from all the main stages. Furthermore, the stages are also offered to be driven in backward direction for more variation. The best thing, however, is that these tracks are modeled after parts of real rally stages. Stages can be very bumpy and upsetting cars, and at times are very treacherously narrow. When the co-driver calls a ‘caution’, it is imperative to drive slower and more accurately in order to avoid crashes. In my opinion, this aspect really makes the game fantastic to play. The only downside is that stages tend to be somewhat repetitive since one rally can consists of short stages which appear again as longer stages. Additionally, players who play this game many, many hours will find that at one point the stages have become familiar and that a co-driver is not necessary anymore, which personally takes a slight bit of fun out of the game. From that point of view, it can be argued that more track variety is needed, but I feel that the game offers plenty of tracks for at least several tens of hours of fun. Next to normal rallying, there are three rallycross circuits and a few special rallycross cars with up to 600 horsepower. Additionally, there is the Pikes Peak hillclimb, which is being offered in a fully-paved layout and a part gravel, part asphalt layout. Currently, there are a few historical hillclimb cars, such as the Audi Quattro S1 and the Peugeots 405 and 205 T16. Overall, content-wise there is much to offer, in my opinion. Game modesThere is a career mode, in which rally stages are offered sequentially per country. While changing between countries, it is possible to switch cars. Online multiplayer is offered only in rallycross mode, sadly. For point-to-point rally stages, the only multiplayer component is comparing stage times with friends or the rest of the world. Furthermore, it is possible to setup specific leagues with set rules and regulations, and there are periodic events organized by the developers that offer nice moneraty rewards. Co-driverOne of the best features in the game; the notes are clear and when set to ‘very early’, most of the time are very reliable in facilitating driving fast down a road that is not entirely familiar to the driver in advance. In high speed corners, the co-driver also talks faster and in a more severe tone, while he is calmer when driving slower. There are only a few slight mistakes in corner severity numbers being called, but overall the accuracy is very high. I find it a joy to drive without the HUD and being able to fully depend on the co-driver in this game. Driving dynamicsAnother important aspect that has made the game so much fun for me is the handling. In basic terms of dynamics, the cars feel realistic; modern WRC machines are very neutral, have very short braking distances and carry enormous amounts of speed through corners with high control, whilst older rear-wheel drive cars (especially from Group B) are very twitchy and unforgiving under power, depending on the exact car model. While playing, it is not uncommon to spin under power, and avoiding such a spin is hugely satisfactory. All other cars sit in between these two extremes; generally, the older the car, the lower the overall stability of the cars during acceleration, braking and coasting. What I also like, is that any driving over the limit will result in brushing the walls or trees, often resulting in car damage or at the very least a loss of time. It makes the game challenging, but also very rewarding at the same time. Personally, I find the handling of DiRT Rally on gravel (Wales, Greece, Finland) the most realistic: braking distances are longer now compared to the previous early-access handling and feel spot-on. Furthermore, cars do not loose too much momentum when sliding sideways through corners, but instead it is simulated that the wheels dig into the gravel surface and generate more lateral grip. The quantity of weight transfer (or actually wheel load transfer) on this surface feels the most accurate to me, because it is possible to make the car ‘dance’ between corners while being sideways. The same applies to pure snow and ice (Sweden and parts of Monaco); there is a fluidity in the cars handling that requires a certain precision in throttle, braking and steering inputs. However, the cars may be too forgiving when exaggerating inputs, which brings me to the remaining surface: asphalt (Germany and parts of Monaco). This is where the game is at its weakest; there seems to be no realistic relation whatsoever between grip and slip angle (the difference between the angle of the front wheels and the general direction the car is travelling in). The problem is that there is a lot of grip when expected, but that grip loss happens very abruptly and untrue to rubber tyres on asphalt.  At higher speeds above 100 km/h or so, it is not too bad, since cars do grip and generally understeer under power when going too fast through a corner. However, at these speeds there is too little sideways slip, so driving sideways and having to correct with the steering in third gear or higher like in onboards videos on Youtube is sadly not possible. The lower speeds is where the handling simulations lacks the most: this is where the cars do oversteer, but the rate of angular acceleration is far too great to be believable. Unfortunately, this phenomenon also means that the best stage times are achieved with a lower steering angle settings since slides can be corrected quicker and unfrotunately, without a loss of stability. In real life, the fastest way would be balancing between too much and too little steering input, and for that reason, I personally always set my steering wheel at 900° of steering and therefore always lose some speed, even though the recommended by Codemasters is 540°, and the fastest people even use 270° or less. Despite this crazy car behaviour and optional 'physics cheat', the driving is still sufficiently enjoyable on tarmac. Still not great compared to gravel handling, but acceptible.			"

								Driving in real life is easier than in this game. Jokes apart, this game, even though it's in early access is extremely polished and well designed. I have never played any other game in the Dirt series and only after playing the game did I find out that it is in Early Access. Yes, there is a steep learning curve but if you practice for some time then you get the hang of it and it is extremely fun to play. The graphics are fabulous and well optimized for low-end computers too. The sound design and music is simple yet effective.Dirt Rally is very well made and a more finished product than most AAA games made by big studios.10/10 - ♥♥♥♥ EA and Ubisoft.			"

								I like this new Dirt Rally game from Codemasters.It is not an easy game. You need to focus and it has a learning curve. Flatout drivers should avoid this game. Not a Toy.The constantly changing road conditions and grip levels keep you on your toes. A good setup is key.Graphics are awesome, physics are ""realistic"" as far as i can judge and this is the first really good rally drive since RBR.Pacenotes need some improvements in some cases. But for an early access game it is already awesome to drive.I have a real handbrake in my rig and that works great as well with Dirt Rally.  I can recommend this. Especially if you like a challenge and rallying.			"

								This game might be early access (actually it is and I really hope for more content and improvements) but it's already on his way to be a masterpiece. Definitely the MOST IMMERSIVE driving game I've ever tried.Everything makes the immersion to such a high level: the rattling sound of dirt and small rocks hitting the bottom of the car, the copilot's voice getting more excited and fast paced in the most daunting part of the tracks, the water droplets hitting your windshield, the attention to details such as road signs, animals, houses, the reflection of the sun/moon in puddles, but even more it's the FEELING of the car.This game truly makes you feel the car on each and every surface: different behaviour for different sources, different cars, different tuning and even based on different weather conditions.You want to feel  something that will make your heart race? Try a stage at night with rain in a powerful beast like the Delta Integrale... you'll find yourself holding your breath and twisting and turning your body at every turn!Fully recommended!			"

												This and Toybox Turbos are both examples of what Codemasters can do when they rein in the budgets and give their titles focus. Both titles benefit, and we finally get to see another fully realistic rally game as a result. The controls have no weird kinks, there's no overlong segues between menus, it's just pick how long you wanna race for, pick the car you wanna race in and a loading screen later you're on a track.You might be scared into thinking that a fully realistic rally game would demand a several-thousand-dollar Fanatec setup, but I've been playing this game on a cheap Ikea desk with a Logitech gamepad for half a year and I can get top-100 times using just that. It takes practise, sure, but no more than on that complex sim setup.This game is now out of Early Access, and there's two main gameplay modes: Time trials on special stages, as in classic rally tradition; and Rally Cross, that being a six-car race on a short track with a mix of on-road and off-road sections. There's no tutorial, this game relies entirely on its progression mechanics as a way to teach you. You get just enough money to buy a slow 1960s car and you get pitted against other equally slow 1960s cars. The game also makes it explicit that you have no chance to win your first few championships by having you earn upgrades every time you use your car, its way of saying that it's okay to take it slow and just learn how to handle the machine you're in. Those first stages become oddly relaxing, and an exercise in just learning the track and the car.There's other similarly relaxing mechanics in place. You start with a mechanics team who can't properly mend your car after a stage, and you won't be able to pay for one for some time. You're forced to make the decision between driving fast and suffering on a later stage, or driving slow and- oh hold on, I got a better time. That's the beauty of it, the game teaches you to drive slow without ♥♥♥♥ing up, and thereby saving you tens of seconds. Contrast this with Dirt 2 and Dirt 3. You'd start with cars that go too fast, handle terribly, your only clue for how to drive is a literal rainbow road and instead of a proper tutorial or forcing you to learn your car, those games just had a mulligan button. As soon as you learned how that first car drove, every car after would be a cakewalk. Dirt Rally shows that you can have proper teaching tools AND be fun AND be a completely realistic simulation at the same time, and it's very much to Codemasters' credit for achieving that.There's some excellent asymmetric multiplayer going on. The last few Codemasters games did have online leaderboards but this game takes that aspect and really runs with it. You can create your own league where your friends can join in and post times on specific events, any time of day they want. It's a great way to keep a group of friends competing with each other.I do have one complaint: Dirt Rally could do with some optimization. Some stages play at a stable 120+ FPS, others might dip below 30 on the exact same settings, including weather. Setting weather to High (not Low, which is slower) and trees to Very Low helps. It's odd.This game has some great voice acting. It's only one actor, he only plays one role, and he's your copilot. There's genuine nervousness in the way he reads his notes, at times he skips a beat and you just know going through all this he's pumped up on adrenaline. It's the perfect way to fill in the silence left by the menu music, and lends a lot to the game's serious racing atmosphere. Though the fact that he makes wrong calls is a bit unnerving. Not sure if that's a bug.I heartily recommend this game.			"

You get around 50 cars,almost 100 stages with different conditions(all terrain-weather combinations available) plus daily-weekly-monthly multyplayer challenges and more.

												Difficult seems to be translating to ""real"" for most players here. I grew up in a small northern town and ice races were a big thing. Can't remember my cars ever feeling weightless and more or less uncontrollable as they are in this game. Same for gravel as well. I just think it has been overdone a bit. Also the ditches seem to be wayyyy overdone. Here and there, yeah sure. But they exist at almost every foot of the few tracks that are in the game. Has potential but defintiley needs some iron-ing out before i could recommend this game.			"

								Excellent racing sim to add to your collection. Three main venues in the early release and they just added Pikes Peak old and new and they are working on adding Germany next. Very good physics, graphics, stages, sound and online daily, weekly and monthly challenges. Oh, they are not easy,...one run on the daily challenge,...that's it :( The other events have car repair,...so don't go all crazy or you won't have a car at the end :) Check out my Pikes Peak climb on Youtube or here on Steam.

								I've been looking for a rally simulation game for a while.  I've played Richard Burns Rally, but it's pretty outdated now.  Dirt Rally is awesome.  Tons of control on setting up the car.  Very different performance characteristics between FWD, RWD and 4WD cars.  The courses are all based on real locations and are very well done.  There are some bugs here and there, but I've just been really enjoying it.  The courses are the biggest thing to me.  I've been following WRC for the past couple years and been to the Pikes Peak HC so it was very important to me that a simulation game match real life and I have to say it's excellent.  I can even identify the spots on Pikes Peak where I've spectated.  Really cool.Love the game.			"

								Not much to say that hasn't been said. It's the greatest rally game yet! Codemaster's really outdid themselves here and its awesome! Don't listen to the bad reviews that say its no fun with gamepad. I use a 360 and the controls are very manageable! Can still get top tier without too much trouble if i stay on the track! The daily, weekly, monthly challanges are what makes this game especially great among the flawless sounds, physics, and immersiveness! I really like the fact that codemastered didn't make the game too graphically demanding that people with lower graphics cards like mine can still run it with no trouble! I appreciate that!Things i would like to see: -leaderboard scores for each individual country.-racing each other's online ghosts on rally stages and championships like in colin mcrae rally 3 and i think 4. -of course more rally locations, stages.edit: would love an option to save my replays!It's a short list because the game is already spectacular in early access! If you like racing games this is a must buy!			"

								DiRT Rally is one of those simulator games where players can gain an appreciation of how freaking difficult it is to be a rally driver. Seriously, it must take some massive genitalia to be able to drive this fast.Some notes for you all;-RWD cars slip and slide like it's constantly raining, and that's just on the gravel/asphalt tracks.-You MUST throw the car into corners to get it to turn, but too much and it launches into the wall.-After attempts at what must have been 100 hairpin turns, I finally managed to pull off a scandinavian flick and I was f***ing proud of myself.-Playing with a controller (xbox/ps4) helps immensly, and if you have a racing wheel, it makes driving so much easier.-DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THE HILLCLIMB CARS AT ALL - I repeat, the hillclimb cars only start pulling at 5000-6000 RPM and scream up until their max RPM, where you are forced to change gears after only moving 10 metres. But hell they're fun.-Driving in Manual is way too much fun, don't even bother starting with automatic if you want a challenge.Hell, after writing all of this I want to go try a stage without crashing. Maybe.One heck of a game that will keep getting better as time goes on.			"

								This is nothing like Dirt 2, 3 or Showdown, you are walking into a very good, very challenging rally game. I have played this game now for 5 hours now, still havent won a race, placed 3rd in my first world champinmship, but am loving every second. The driving is challenging but rewarding, no mini-map, only your co-driver to guide you. And when your racing through Wales in a Stratos with no front lights, good luck, its all ears and alot of guess work, but you can do it.The only thing that i think needs work is the co-driver calls, there are some corners that are rated 1 but should really be a hard turn. But apart from that, if you like racing games, id suggest this because I havent seen a racing game in some time quite like this one, and its worth every penny.			"

								I have always liked a casual dabble with an arcade racer, even a bit of Forza occasionally.  But, midway through a love affair with Driveclub I came across Dirt Rally.   That was a few weeks back and I haven't played anything since.  It's incredible and I didn't even realise that I liked sim rally racing.It's definitely difficult but somehow that makes it more accessible, which is weird.  It's like the Dark Souls of racing games.  And it's a beauty to look at and runs extremely well on a pretty modest PC (1st gen i5 and 2Gb 7870 here).I have hundreds of hours gameplay left with this game, and even after I've seen everything in the game, I can imagine playing this for a long time just because it's so exciting.Lastly, I did have fun with a pad, but pretty soon I realised I needed a wheel so bought a secondhand Logitech DFGT for peanuts, and it's so much more satisfying and fun to play.  So, I'd recommend getting at least a budget FFB wheel and if you are on a budget I don't think the DFGT can be beat.			"

								Best rally game in a long, long while. Unlike previous games in the DiRT series, DR leans more towards proper simulation. There are no flashbacks, you can't repeat races indefinitely, you can't turn off car damage and time penalties for car recovery are very harsh. You can also tune your ride to your own preference, gain upgrades, and hire a team of mechanics to keep your car in good shape.As the title implies, this game is all about rallying, so say goodbye to Gymkhana and ""BRO SICK RACE BRO, YOU GOTTA POST THAT ON YOUTUBE"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The tracks are really good, they're well designed, the circuits are longer than before and the environments look impressive. Car physics are stellar, you can literally feel every bump on the road. And the audio is just superb, you can hear the gravel hitting your car, you can hear the brakes grinding when you push them too far etc. As far as i can tell, the game is also really well optimized. Quality work.DiRT Rally is in early access, but it's already rich in content, and it's going to grow at least twice in size before release. In my opinion, it already feels like the best rally game Codemasters ever made.			"

TL/DR REVIEW: Awesome!DIRT Rally very different from the previous installments of DIRT games. Instead of the usual arcade approach, this game gives players a believable, unforgiving rally simulation experience. This is a very welcome change of pace. With a wheel it's an absolute blast. My only two complaints/wishes are for there to be more stages and/or some kind of stage editor, and for the tarmac to be better simulated in the game. Dirt Rally has a lot of different environments, but unfortunately only a couple stages per location.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

												This is the most passive-aggressive game ever created.For years now, us video game rally fans have been begging Codemasters to drop the insufferably bad Xtreme Sports hoo-hah that had plagued their once loved rally franchise. We wanted a return to serious rally racing sims without the brotard, Mountain Dew-fueled poop of the previous DiRT games. You just KNEW Colin McRae was rolling around in his grave. So, the Codies, likely sick of hearing the complaining released the single most soul crushing, nut grinding rally game ever in DiRT Rally. It's a rally sim. There's nary a car-fu (or whatever stupid name that stunt event had in previous entries) and this game will eat your soul. It's everything we wanted and I couldn't be happier with it!!!At this early stage of play, I suck really, really hard at it. I have all of the assists on and, counting penalties, I finish each race stage in just under six weeks. My 17-month-old daughter could do at least as well. But when you do something right, you know it happened because you got good at something and were not just lucky. It's rare with modern games that a video game rewards learned skill. When you start doing things right in DiRT Rally, it's completely rewarding.			"

												DiRT Rally is an excellent add to DiRT series. The game has been developing fast in the early access, until now when it has come to an version 1.0. I personally hope they still develop the game, because it still feels early access. Multiplayer is still designed poorly. You can only play four players in one rallycross start, and the collection of rallycross cars is very minimum. If Codemasters dont add DLC for More rallycross cars and including FIA RX Touring car and Super1600, i will get very upset. The game still feels a little empty when there are so few cars towards car classes. Think about the big winged Audi S1... ITS NOT IN THE GAME ! DiRT Rally still has one of the best graphics and driveability. Still good game but needs DLC\Updates. I rate it 8\10 Was expecting a little more from codemasters			"

Every morning I wish I wouldn't have to go to work and could just play this all day. Finnally found a worthy use for my G27.

												Short version. Dirt Rally is an immersive and challenging racing game, but with questionable driving physics. Meaning it was fun to learn, but it finally got tiresome.I have a lot of hours in this game and I did enjoy it, so it seems unfair to give it a negative review. But I stopped playing it for two months and when I recently came back, I couldn't finish a stage! I now realize that this is a difficult arcade game; the challenge is addictive and is complemented by pleasant visuals, great sound design and fine racing tracks. But the driving model is unintuitive, with arguably inaccurate physics.Tarmac handling is bad. The rear wheels are very light and drifty, and braking is vague; wheel lock occurs very late. It was so bad for the Hillclimb cars that they had to patch it. But it remains terrible for the RX supercars. Gravel has more balanced grip, but it is too high! You can annihilate Vatanen's time in Pike's Peak.Grip in Sweden seems to come and go haphazardly... you can't drive aggressively!Finland has absurd jumps and is too wide. Vehicles feel very stiff; they bounce too much from small bumps. Cars lack rotational momentum. Combined with the high gravel grip, using the handbrake is too easy, and Scandinavian flicks are ineffective for most cars. Without the handbrake, there is a lot of understeer! Except for the RWDs, which have incredible lift-off oversteer (R5 and Manta excluded).Car dynamics look unnatural in replays; cars seems to be rotating around a central axis.Career mode is quite repetitive, and you need to spend game credits to participate in events.Car repair is odd; you can repair parts 1% at a time.The automatic reset when hitting spectators or going off track is jarring.Again, the game is good if you are looking for a challenging rally experience. But given that is it described as the ""most authentic rally game ever made"" I can't recommend it.			"

												An absolutely stunning experience with a racing wheel.This game leans more towards sim than it does arcade, the physics are far more realistic than previous DiRT games, although I can't say I'ev ever driven a real rally car. The point is it's harder, much harder, but this makes it so much more rewarding. Nailing slides and jumps really feels like an achievement. You will crash, a lot, and end up restarting stages time and time again, but in doing so you force yourself to improve.The graphics and sounds are great. My rig is an i7 4790k, 16 Gb RAM, GTX 970, and it runs on ultra with 80-120 frames. Graphics feel more realistic than most games due to the lack of saturation, and sounds really do add to the immersion.As for force feedback in the wheel, I'm having a great experience on my Thrustmaster T300RS. I do feel like a gearstick/handbrake would be ideal for this game however as pressing a button on the wheel is awkward.Online servers are currently down, but a quick trip to reddit tells me this is temporary and will most likely be fixed post-boxing day.Overall I'd say this is as, if not more enjoyable than F1 2016 (another excellent Codemasters title). It certainly beats any dirt game to date.8.5/10			"

								The game is a true simulator, the rally game that Codemasters should launch a long time ago.The gameplay is what you expect from a simulator, the graphics look amazing in and out of the car and it's amazing. And it's the Dark Souls of racing games and I'm in love.The only problem are a shortage of cars, expecially in the 80's RWD who misses the great Lancia O37 and also when you want to reverse sometimes doesn't work and it bugs the stering, but it's still an Early Access so these little problems will be fixed.I hope so, expecialy the number of cars.     It's -         2 - 1960's        3 - 1970's        2 - 1980's RWD        5 - Group B        3 - Group A        2 - 2010'sCars I think that could be added: Lancia O37, Renault 5 Turbo, Renault Alpine A110, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV, Volkswagen Polo R, 1990's Ford Focus RS, Toyota Corolla/Celica, etc...

								In my early access review I said that this game wasn't better than RBR. Now that this game has got brand new handling system and steering wheel support, I can happily say that Richard Burns Rally (published in 2004) has finally got another game to it's side in the legendary group of rally racing games. The handling is perfect for a steering wheel (I've got CSR Forza wheel), and the graphics and physics are awesome. This game is totally a simulation, not a crappy arcade game with cars going on rails like the older Dirt games. Although if you don't have a controller or a steering wheel, this game might be too hard for you. Just saying, the carreer mode is really hard.Another point I'd like to say, is that this game has free (YES, LITERALLY FREE) updates every month. I just hope they keep updating the game. If done so, this game will have a long lifespan.TL;DR: Awesome game, everything's good.Thank you codemasters for making this game.			"

												For now this is the best rally game since Richard Burns Rally. If everything goes well, it could be the best rally sim since RBR.A pure rally sim is what we need after so many years.//////////Edit 2015/5/27:For now, I have to change some of my previous thoughts about this game.I've played almost all CodeMaster racing games except some F1 series, they all feel the same. CodeMaster made all their racing games feel like you are driving on ice. I feel better the days before Dirt, the whole EGO engine times. Dirt, dirt2, dirt 3, dirt count down, grid, grid 2, grid autosport, fuel, F1 2011, F1 2012, F1 2014, every EGO titles I can remember, they all feel the same---driving like on ice.I think CodeMaster never hired some real driver to qualify the car physics, and almost every racing titles CM made are better controlled on joysticks/gamepads rather than on racing wheels. We invited many people who has deep real world driving experiences including some real racer to try out many CodeMaster racing titles both on gamepad and racing wheels. All of them can drive pretty good on racing wheels with racing sims like rFactor, iRacing, NFS13, Simbin titles, the new AC. But few of them feel good on any CodeMaster racing titles when driving with racing wheels. It just feels too fake on the car physics. CodeMaster racing games only perform good with controllers like gamepads.Till now, after many hours of test drive in Dirt Rally, I admit everything goes better except car physics.Is this one a Richard Burns Rally successor? Definitely not. Maybe some arcade racing fans would like this. But for a sim racer? Let's go back and play RBR.I may change the advisory after its official release to ""Not Recommended"". Just be prepared.Edit Sep 18th, 2016:I bought this game very early right after its early access release, you may not be able to see my review since the new Steam review system change. And now I have over hundreds of hours of playing time on it.I still recommend it to any race fans, rally fans, car fans. It's definitely one of the best rally games since Richard Burns Rally. It's a rally race game you can enjoy hours after hours with racing wheels or just a good mechanical keyboard.I think every little bit of things are good or even exellent in DiRT Rally. Despite some kids may not get fully understoodment of what a ""Race Sim"" should be, they may feel it being too hard to drive. But one knows he should follow traffic rules in real life driving, how could he not follow the same rules driving in a race sim? Or a semi-sim. Everything feels right of this title for now. EXCEPT ONE: the physics.I don't have much real world driving experience, I have some in Richard Burns Rally, which I played since my 9 grade class and played it almost 10 years. DiRT Rally lacks a proper physics as being a modern race sim comparing to the 14-year-old Richard Burns Rally. The later one does it better here. But this may not be a problem for a casual gamer who just want to kick the throttle and accelerate to hundreds of kilometers per hour speed and drift like there is no Newton Law at all. The most obvious feel is that the car is too light and whenever it hit something it just bump up into the air. You will feel that as long as you play.I think Codemasters is trying to find a balanced point where they can satisfy casual race gamers and semi-sim race gamers. If so, DiRT Rally has done a great job.			"

								In my early access review I said that this game wasn't better than RBR. Now that this game has got brand new handling system and steering wheel support, I can happily say that Richard Burns Rally (published in 2004) has finally got another game to it's side in the legendary group of rally racing games. The handling is perfect for a steering wheel (I've got CSR Forza wheel), and the graphics and physics are awesome. This game is totally a simulation, not a crappy arcade game with cars going on rails like the older Dirt games. Although if you don't have a controller or a steering wheel, this game might be too hard for you. Just saying, the carreer mode is really hard.Another point I'd like to say, is that this game has free (YES, LITERALLY FREE) updates every month. I just hope they keep updating the game. If done so, this game will have a long lifespan.TL;DR: Awesome game, everything's good.Thank you codemasters for making this game.			"

								It's not an addictive game, for sure... I got it 3 days ago and I only have 20 hrs of gameplay. I mean it definitely is not! The championship is so boring, so that I'm in the elite championship already. Again, it's not addictive. I ride my car in real life like a rally racer now, tryin clutch kicking every hairpin I find. I mean, I guess it's not due to Dirt Rally... The force feedback is better than the one I have in real life, oh well, I've found that out just right after I've played Dirt Rally, coincidence? The fact is that Dirt Rally, isn't a good game. DIRT ♥♥♥♥ING RALLY IS A MESMERIZING GAME! Once you play it you can't ever quit, ever! You crash, you bump, you fly, you feel so good! OOOH MY GOD! You can feel the POWER on your wheels, they run, they run as fast as they can, they never quit moving! gravel, snow, water, tarmac,♥♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere, JUST GO! Flick your car around that corner and full throttle! Holy hell, why am I writing this thing, I should be playing Dirt Rally!			"

												This feels more like a finished product than Early Access, while some tracks/cars still need to be added in the future. But wow, great driving, great physics. Some of the banks act a little erratic, my only complaint so far. Well, the more I play, the more I find hidden barriers and then segments of ditches that look like the same ditches you drive over without a problem, except these ditches send you flying. If you try to cut corners and narrow your line it's quite simply unpredicable whether you will fly out fine or end up in the trees. 7/10			"

												If you're a finisher and coming first is a given, do not buy this game. If you don't think you need to learn how to drive properly, do not buy this game. If you want to receive podium accolades for ""great"" driving, do not buy this game. If you're playing with a keyboard, do not buy this game. If you think sideways is the fastest way to exit a corner, do not buy this game. If you don't like to sweat profusely, after a 9 minute hill climb,  do not buy this game. If stopping to mend a flat tyre is too much trouble, do not buy this game. If learning why dampers are called dampers is too much trouble, do not buy this game. If 2/10ths is too small to bother with, do not buy this game. If a Skandanavian Flick means a cute Nordic blonde told you to go away, do not buy this game. If you want to drive rally, do. In a word. Pure.9.99/10Play it like a casual rally....

								To get started, this is a huge improvement over DiRT 3. The stages are longer, way more realisim, the graphics are improved and the menus (to me at least) look way better than the DiRT 3 ones. One thing i will say is that you should probably get a racing wheel pedals and a gear shifter, i feel like it would make it so much easier to control the car without some of the assists. Anyways, I dont have any major problems with the game except that it would randomly kick me out of fullscreen mode, I'm not sure why it does it, but its not game breaking as it pauses the game when it happens.I would rate this game 9.8/10Great game CodeMasters keep it up!! (but let us use our mice on the menus plz)EDIT: if you dont have a wheel with pedals, THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU A ♥♥♥♥ING ANEURYSM WITH HOW MUCH IT WILL♥♥♥♥♥♥YOU OFF WITH A KEYBOARD. like ♥♥♥♥ing seriously my keyboard only has 3 presses at one time and that is just not enough for this game. Almost broke my hand punching my crt monitor after every turn would result in ♥♥♥♥ing my car up so bad. Still an amazing game, but you just need a wheel to play.EDIT 11/24/16: Ive had a real gamepad for awhile now and it makes things so much easier			"

												In terms of hours played I might not have played a lot compared with other people, but I've been playing racing games since I first had a PC/Console. Most of the racing titles are easy to beat or have wonky physics (exceptions are made ofcourse). This on the other hand feels fantastic to drive! Just bought a wheel primarily with this game in mind. All the early access hours were spend on a Xbox 360 controller though. If you are worried that you need a wheel in order to enjoy the game fully I can safely say that you don't.Every since the CMR series ended I have been waiting for a great rally game. The previous Dirt games weren't that, but this is. Be prepared to crash a lot in the beginning, but also be prepared to get addicted.			"

								It's been a long while since I've picked up a gamepad to play a driving game; indeed it's been a long time since there's been a driving game that I've been genuinely excited about. Having stumbled upon DiRT Rally, and having purchased the title on a whim, I'm can honestly say that the game has completely exceeded my expectations -- even in its current Early Access form.I'm no seasoned racing-sim professional, not by any stretch; however, it seems that DiRT Rally is set to deliver a bona-fide rally driving experience in what is a serious departure from the arcadey, lowbrow mayhem for which the DiRT series has become known.The game is visually gorgeous and the sound-design is spot on. But what's most impressive is the feel -- the handling of the vehicles, the physics, and the immersion. Although cliche, the game really is easy to play but difficult to master. It offers a challenging but highly rewarding experience that I've not known before in any racing title. Comparisons have already been drawn to Colin McCrae (also of Codemasters fame). Such comparisons are totally warranted.There are some obvious limitations with the game at the moment. But far from being nit-picky I will let the development run it's course and post a more thorough review upon full release. I am more than satisified with my purchase to this point, and would definitely recommend the game to any seasoned rally-sim fans or even someone looking to try something new :)			"

												DiRT Rally takes sport seriously, but it has some problems too.Pros:*Great driving - fun, responsive, each car feels different.*The tracks are dangerous and punishing*Driving with a steering wheel, with no HUD and assists (just the co-pilot) is a BLAST!*Graphics are nice*Online events create an amazing competitive feel and variety.Cons:*This game suffers from the syndrome where you fall out of the track and your car gets instantly put back, BUT sometimes it actually DNFs you and shows your car as unrecoverable. This makes no sense, since at times I can fall out quite far and be put back and at other times I get a DNF with sliding out just slightly and if you proceed, then you are DNF'd from the WHOLE EVENT - this makes ZERO sense. Sometimes you slide out quite slightly (experienced it mostly in winter stages), you get an ''unrecoverable car"" and you can't even progress to the next stage) - and at other times I can hit a wall at 150 KM/h and keep racing. There is NO balance here...*The crashing visualisation is very weak compared to other Codemasters games - I was actually expecting, that I crash and destroy my car and it would make sense that I can't continue, but that doesn't happen. Sometimes it is too easy to blow my tire (after a minor crash) and at others I can't get any response from a crash. Read the previous point - it works together with graphics, where it almost always seems illogical, how you can/can't continue a race. The biggest issue for me is those annoying fade out->fade in(put back on track) sh*ts - it's stupid! Let me crash properly and make a proper response in visual and actual damage! (There is always a restart option.... except where there isn't)This game has a LOT of things I have always wanted in a real rally game, but others pull it back at being the same old same old. Generally, if you make to the end of the race and don't crash - it feels like the best thing EVER, until you crash....7,5/10 (it is a good score, btw - still recommended)			"

												Firstly, up until now not one single racing game has made me cringe even close to what I do in real life when heading towards a tree, barrier, bank or other solid object with way too much speed. Given that I've bent or broken at least half of my cars while racing and I was a big fan of the venerable Richard Burns Rally (& the RSRBR mod), I like to think that's a good indicator of the tone of the next two words.Until now.Dirt Rally is the best rally game in existence, bar none. RBR was just as good for it's day, but if we'll be realistic it's now over a decade old & it's time to move on. Dirt also captures the sense of speed better than RBR ever did and it's perhaps even more punishing on mistakes - especially in the online Daily, Weekly & Monthly Events. There is no rewind, no restarting. You crash, you're done - they way it should be.Now, to the game itself - I'll start with the short list of negatives.- To be honest, I actually feel the cars may have slightly too much grip, however this is coming from over a decade of RBR. It's not 100% sim, but it's more than close enough.- The stages are made up from one stage per country. This provides heaps of content if you only drive the short stages but it's easy to start memorising the courses after a while.- The only hillclimb is Pike's Peak.- No Australian stages! I live in Coffs Harbour & would absolutely love to be able to barrel along some of our brilliant local WRC stages in game.- The damage model is perhaps a bit too forgiving.Now, for the positives.- Aforementioned cringing when heading face first into a tree.- The graphics are top notch, on max settings it looks absolutely stunning - but still is a little bit much for my R9 390!- It's really, really well optimised for PC - the scaling is huge. That's somethign rare in these days of crap console ports.- The handling. I did say above that it felt a bit too grippy, but it's easily the best on the market at the moment. Really, it's more than enough to create a realistic portrayal of rally and it feels totally natural once you get used to it. I suspect a lot of my problem is I'm playing with a XB360 controller as I don't have a wheel yet.- All the stages, Pike's Peak & the Rallycross circuits are taken from real life tracks - Col de Turini (Monte Carlo), Ouninpohja (Finland), Sweet Lamb (Wales/GB), Baumholder (Germany), Pikes's Peak, Hell (Norway), Lydden Hill (UK) and others. Most are very close, although there are slome slight variances on the rally stages; presumably to save HDD space and make the stages more exciting.- The cars are excellently modelled & sound great too. In fact, all the sound work in the game is top notch.- The co driver & his pace notes. I'm so glad they got an actual navigator to read out the notes for each stage, as they sound so much more natural and the timing is mostly spot on. There are a few late calls that can cause some panic moments here & there, but you learn to drive around them. That's part of rallying and overall they've done a fantastic job.- The daily, weekly & monthly events. These help to change it up a little & add a fair bit of pressure to race fast & clean, as there are no restarts - you spin, no rewinds or restarts. You write off the car, you're done, that's it. The wager events add to this immensely, with the opportunity to get good money if you drive well but lose even bigger if you don't. Absolutely love it!If you're a rally fan or even just a driving game fan or car enthusiast, pick this one up. It's worth every cent at full price, and then some.			"

I could not believe the level to which the game (and my driving abilities) were improved with a decent quality force feedback wheel and pedals. I siwtched to manual gears. Assists were drastically reduced. It was remarkable.So I dumped some money on DIRT Rally, as I love the genre and thrill of the sport. Sadly the market has been so quiet for a few years so I've had to be sated with the occasional forays back to the terrifying realism that is Richard Burns (RIP).  But loading up DIRT Rally? Wow! The immersion provided with decent peripherals take the whole driving genre to a new level. The quality of the force feedback the game provides and control of the cars is something else entirely. Pushing a twitching Renault 5 turbo over an ice patch on Monte Carlo rally and feeling the steering go light as you try and rescue the car before you hit the wall is heart-stopping. Pikes Peak in a rainstorm?! The feeling of total control and knowledge of the grip that is on offer at each corner of the car. The butt-clenching feeling of helplessness as you've overcooked that ""Left 4"" in the forest, or desperately hanging on to the wheel over that sequence of terrifying Finland jumps knowing you need to claw back a few tenths but may may well be destroyed in the process of trying. I've played rally games since the dark ages, but none has hit me like this since the original Colin McRae. This game really is incredible. But it's real. It feels real. It looks utterly amazing. The sound is spot on (to anyone that doesn't have a garage full of Group B cars, at least). The co-driver is faultless. The differentiation in feel and driving techniques needed in the variety of cars and surfaces is truly humbling. And the main thing is this: every corner you ace, every yump you spot perfectly? That was you. Proper goosebump stuff - Truly an incredible game. Play this, poop your pants, say ""Thank Goodness it's just a game - a terrifying and utterly immersive game""... then go watch a Youtube link of Colin in the woods  and realise that people actually do this!

												I have approximately 1000 hours with Richard Burns Rally and its mods during RBRs lifespan. Now that throne might have been overtaken by a very surprising game house, Codemasters, masters of pad suitable arcadish racing games (my opinion until now). Now we just need mods, as to begin with, PACENOTES EDITABLE thank you. I miss my finnish co-driver while venturing around Finland, England etc. narrow roads fast.Otherwise, very good job Codies! Game is really fun to play and is also suitable for virtual rally drivers of all kinds, hardcore racing wheel people and (haven't tested, only heard stories) gamepad folks. Get a wheel and press more gas, no brakes!			"

								From playing this for only 5 hours and a bit, I'm completely deaf from the very loud engine noises. And yes I did try and turn the sound down but it made no difference at all. Jokes aside, this the most realistic driving/racing game that I have ever played, and I've played a fair few. Everything on the car is a moving piece and on some cars you can even see the engine running through the boot. It's just little details like that that make a good game. 10/10 would go deaf again.

								Good graphics, good sounds, very nice core game here. 2 issues that are serious for wheel users, read below.So far im impressed with the direction Codies have taken making a more realistic rally game because im the type of customer who bought one or two Dirt games in the past and then stopped because i wanted more realism. What they need to sort out/improve is the FFB (Force Feed Back) and deadzone for wheel users. The FFB is kinda like in typical Codemasters games where there isnt enough information coming through. Heavyness and vibrations isnt enough for a sim/simcade and its not enough for people with good wheels/pedals. There is also a rather large deadzone, but it hasnt bothered me too much so far. Both issues can be tweaked a bit. People have come up with XML tweaks to make the FFB better for example. Still far from good, but better. However its hard for people coming from titles like Assetto Corsa where the FFB is great, and so far Dirt Rally has quite a bit to go before it gets anywhere near Assetto Corsa quality FFB. Personally i dont need that good FFB to enjoy Dirt Rally, but it needs to get better. From what ive seen i think Codies will try improve the FFB. At least i hope so.Real review coming later when Codies have gotten further with Dirt Rally - Early Access. Would i recommend it now? I think yes. But only if you are ok with FFB not being very good yet, and you got money to spend on a WIP game in development. The core game here is great. The stages/cars looks great and the physics feel pretty darn good, and there is no typical Dirt coolness to menues or the rallying itself - its a much more mature/realistic rally game that is harder and more realistic than the usual Dirt series (the discussion board is filled with the typical ""Dirt"" clientel that asks to make it easier - lol). With FFB improvements and less deadzone this will be very nice if they keep it the way it is.I have to add something. Ive read about people saying the performance is bad in Dirt Rally - Early Access. So far i havent experienced that on my humble machine. I run most on HIGH with a few settings on MEDIUM. Textures and all the juicy stuff is on HIGH and i run it on 1920x1080 with - so far - no performance problems at all. Its super fluid at 60FPS constantly. I havent tested all combos yet so that might change, but so far so good. Specs:AMD FX 8350 8core @ 4.2GHZ - Nvidia GTX660 2GB - 8GB RAM.			"

								Initial impressions - Early Access - 28/04/2015For a long time there has been a niche in the racing game market for a proper rally simulator, which has not been filled properly since Richard Burns Rally. Codemasters think they have a solution in DiRT Rally, which marks a strong departure from the 'arcade' feel of previous DiRT releases.This review covers the current (April 2015) Early Release version of the game. It is split into four sections, the first dealing with aesthetics, the second with video, the third with audio and the fourth with gameplay. I've listed pros, cons and tips/suggestions for improvement.The aesthetics:Pros: Minimalist theme, logical and intuitive menu navigation designCons/suggestions: A dark 'theme' option for the menu would be great for tired eyes, more options could/should be made available for areas like the HUD. Specifically on the weather, perhaps there should be a system where the seasons, time and weather conditions can be set independently, as at the moment there are only presets.Aesthetics rating: 7/10The video/graphics:Pros: A refined engine which doesn't overstress the system, fantastic attention to detail and good texture resolutions. Harsh weather means genuinely poor visibilityCons/suggestions: The game appears to be using the existing game engineVideo/graphics rating: 7/10The audio:Pros: Adds so much to the immersion in each map, e.g. windscreen wipers make a noise, the sound resolution is goodCons/Suggestions: More speaker options could be usefulAudio rating: 10/10The gameplay:Pros: Rewards good driving, strongly punishes poor driving, more immersive than most games I've played. Changes in terrain are obvious but subtle enough, changes in vehicles and vehicle setup are obvious, each car feels as though it has its own personalityCons: On a couple of stages it was unclear which direction to head in even with the pacenotes, I got a graphic driver issue when I went the wrong way on one occasionSuggestions: A tutorial system for the vehicle setup would really helpGameplay rating: 7/10Overall rating: 7.75/10For an Early Release the game is in fantastic shape in my opinion. There is still a lot that can be improved but thankfully nothing fundamental. Codemasters have got the basics right with the driving, the physics and the immersion, with the audio a clear step above previous DiRT releases.Keep up the good work!			"

												Overall a very good game and I'm having a blast playing it. It isn't a ""sim"" as much as people say it is because of a few ""things"". It is difficult to say where that game sits as it seems to be based on a hardcore sim idea, but with a less sim-like finish to make it accessible. Still, it will give you a hard time and will require a lot of dedication to stop crashing into trees and rocks.There is no real modern competition and it is still one of the best driving games so far. You won't regret your purchase.Detail:Pros:- The UI is clean and works properly- Good controller support and user-friendly settings- Very good co-pilot, his voice changes according to your speed and doesn't sound robotic at all.- Visual damage is excellent- Driving like a rally driver pays off, pacenotes are crucial- Physics compared to the game's direct competition, though they aren't perfect (see cons)- Each car has its own specific behaviour- Engine sounds are good- Career mode serves a purpose- Daily events - despite giving pretty lame rewards IMO- Excellent optimisation: Very good graphics with pretty low requirements.Cons:- The co-pilot isn't consistent through locations. In Germany, his calls are too late so you end up braking too late, and in Finland it is the exact opposite. I shouldn't have to change how early I want the calls to be every time I enter a different location.- Physics to a certain extent. Yes, they might be the current best ones for a rally game, but you can still feel that they are a bit Grid Autosport-ish, especially on tarmac. Cars overall have too much grip on gravel, and not enough on tarmac. Mid-engined cars pendulum effect is exaggerated and the 208PP just gives me cancer as it oversteers all over the place at high speed.- Failures: Yes, you do have punctures but hitting a tree at 60mph won't damage your car to a point where it is a simple DNF. You can hit rocks at 90mph, your car will go on. Richard Burns Rally was much more punishing on this, and I'm disappointed there is no slider to choose how punishing crashes should be.- Career mode to unlock cars' real stats is silly, to be polite. I guess they needed to justify the career, but still I don't know why the f*** I should have 220bhp on my WRC until I have enough mileage to unlock its real 300bhp.- No tire selection.			"

												30 hrs of gameplayFirst things first dirt rally is one of those games that will make you love and hate yourself and the same time, it is very fun and enjoyable once you understand the small tricks for getting a better time anywhere. All though if you are really grinding the game to try and get the community delta achievements and keep messing up you will get angry. Just give up for the night and try some other time. Dirt rally was one of those games that I played for about 3 hours at first then got bored of it and left it for about 2 weeks and came back to it, Boy am I glad I did .  I absolute love this game. Became really addicting and fun. Even just doing a Hotseat type game with my friends was really fun and we had a great laugh.Tips for beginning  learn the basics I.e. Callouts, difference between FWD, RWD, 4WD The Scandinavian flick is extremely useful (shifting the cars weight in the opposite direction of a upcoming corner and flick into it, to gain a faster speed exiting the corner) don’t worry about not coming first every time you’ll get better soon Dirt Rally comes with no bulls***, Just good and gritty driving, no drifting or story line (Colin McRae dirt 2) Overall this is the best ""Dirt"" that i have played (I have played Dirt 2, Dirt 3, Dirt rally) In fact this is the best driving game i have played to date.I would highly recommend this game.  9 /10 (some small bug fixes needed)Specs 16 GB ram i5 4690K970 Ti This game does not take that much to run but needs high specs for ultra-high graphics.This game is hard to play with a keyboard, a controller or steering wheel is a lot easier. There is no rewinds (dirt 2) restarting a Stage cost ingame money50 hrs of gameplay Listen to your co-driver.The reason for co-driver calls is to describe the road ahead so that despite having not driven the stage before you can confidently attack the stage. Listening to the calls gives you a mental picture of the road ahead allowing you to approach corners with an understanding of the challenges they will present. Timing is crucial and in Dirt Rally.Scenery can be distracting if you’re speeding round a corner in the Greek hills with near death cliffs and the co-driver calls “right 3, Don’t cut” but it looks like a “right 5, cut “don’t go with your perception of the course listen to him he will give you an advantage overall if you learn how to control the car over all terrain and in all corner type situations This diagram can help with corner call outs  Corner callout guide  [blog.codemasters.com]Have recently returned home from a 2 month holiday to find Dirt has been updated for VR and with this update there is a bug denying any actions after the loading screen and sometimes crashing the game, game is unplayable at the current moment 9 Aug..

								You played rally games before, right. You jump right in, turn off noob helpers and pedal to the metal... and you will crash on first corner. Now, you have two options: restart and try again or quit.One of those options will end up with great experience and great satisfaction of accomplishment, other one with desktop view. You decide.You're not a wuss. Got your Mini, and rocking on stages. Maybe it's time to check some online challenge. You get into new powerful car, ready to destroy this stage. Almost instantly game teaches you what word humble means. You're so ""bad♥♥♥♥♥quot; driving Subaru on 2nd gear. After that, you will go back to your Mini and be happy that you can drive that on 4th gear.DiRT Rally is like a cat.			"

								TL;DR Review: Essentially, it's the Dark Souls of racing games.Full Review: I can happily max everything out on my system at 5120x1200 and it looks fantastic, both while driving and in the replays (i5 3570K & R9 280X). It's also challenging, in that thrilling way that is genuinely rewarding when you get it right. DiRT Rally is absolutely the best racing game I have played in a very long time. I am not a hardcore racer (not even close), but there seem to be a lot of reviews saying it is purely a sim or that you should only play if you have a fancy wheel. While it does feel like there is a lot for the sim-heads, to me it feels very approachable using an Xbox pad, and that's without all of the assists turned on. As long as you are prepared to try and fail, there is a lot of fun to be had from this game no matter what your previous experience is. If you like to be out in front and coasting all the time, then maybe this isn't for you. If you like to push yourself to the limits, get DiRT.			"

								I have to go ALL THE WAY BACK to 1987 to Accolade's Test Drive for the Amiga--the last time I was hopelessly addicted to a driving game.  Of course, the former is laughable by any measure nowadays, and I can only wonder if we'll laugh at today's racing games 30 years from now pondering how we found a title to be quite this amazing.  Dirt Rally has an incredibly replayable, difficult, and addictive nature to it.  I will find myself playing ""just one more stage"" again and again, and it has become my go-to game.  I highly recommend a controller (or driving controls...just not a keyboard/mouse) as the analog inputs are very much needed.  Dirt Rally is much more a simulation and a challenging one, which makes the realism seem much higher than your typical driving game.  It has three modes currently--rally (my favorite), hill climb, and a circuit against other vehicles (ai or pvp).  Each is unique and takes time to master.  I have yet to master the latter even at a basic level.  Additionally, there are daily, weekly, monthly, and league challenges in addition to 5 difficulty levels (of which I have seen just two in 60+ hours of gameplay).I cannot recommend this game highly enough!!  The best part is that since they are still in early access, they continue adding new features, tracks, and cars, while fine-tuning what they already have.			"

								Always used to love the old racing games.One of my early gaming memories is playing against my dad on Total Drivin'. Things have come a long way since then but I've always loved off track racing games. Dirt3 was good but then I had to go through the nightmare that is gymkhana.This game is unforgiving and has a brutal learning curve. Expecting to drift around a corner at full speed? Not going to happen. Rewind back to your mistake and fix it? Not anymore.For tyre kickers like myself it has been a hard slog to the finish, with many a restart and curse in between. When you finish though. My God does it feel good.			"

Additionally, there are daily, weekly, monthly, and league challenges in addition to 5 difficulty levels (of which I have seen just two in 60+ hours of gameplay).I cannot recommend this game highly enough!!  The best part is that since they are still in early access, they continue adding new features, tracks, and cars, while fine-tuning what they already have.			"

I dont recommend keyboard & mouse as you need fully control of your car around these norrow roads.Cockpit view looks fantastic with a detailed dashboard... what else can you ask for? it feels like racing rally!well done to codemasters !!

								Always used to love the old racing games.One of my early gaming memories is playing against my dad on Total Drivin'. Things have come a long way since then but I've always loved off track racing games. Dirt3 was good but then I had to go through the nightmare that is gymkhana.This game is unforgiving and has a brutal learning curve. Expecting to drift around a corner at full speed? Not going to happen. Rewind back to your mistake and fix it? Not anymore.For tyre kickers like myself it has been a hard slog to the finish, with many a restart and curse in between. When you finish though. My God does it feel good.			"

												The codemasters rally game everyone has waited for. Since DiRT took to energy drinks and gymkhana........A true homage to Colin McCrae Rally!!! Dare i say the best rally game to date on all formats?.....HELL YEAH! This game ticks ALL the boxes. Great engine, great handling, nice graphics, true rally gameplay in fact i honestly cant think of anything bad to  say......the menu musics not to my taste, but i usually turn it off anyway. For those unfirmiliar to the series, its a great rally game. It can be very unforgiving, but thats the point with rally. One mistake and you've killed your car! The rally cross and different classes give enough variation but dont expect gymkhana or powersliding for points, its more simulation than arcade.Sound 10/10Graphics 9/10gameplay 9/10 (will possibly rise to 9.5/10 depending on content to come.)Overall 9/10BEST RALLY GAME ON ALL FORMATS EVER!!!!!!!!!  Colin is finally smiling down on codemasters again!!!			"

												Dirt Rally is a sensory masterpeice.  The sounds are amazing, every nuance you would hear in car and outside are perfect.  Graphics are well done, few sims racers can capture the atmosphere of the place they are representing.  Game play, though hard at times, and some have said impossible, is very rewarding when you run a clean stage.  This is not a game for first time sim racers, nor should you be playing Need for Speed and expect to beat the game, or work up the leaderboards quickly.  It takes paitence, and time.  Drive slow and steady, the speed will come.			"

								It means something when u become a car lover from a game. This game is awesome! Free dlc! Awesome new parkours and modes! Compatible with almost every wheel! And the graphics and design of how you can play the game is just in and out awesome! I recommend this game alot. At first its hard especially if you have a keyboard like me (Thinking of buying a wheel). But at some moment u get the hang of it and find your car that makes you win the game, It doesnt matter if your not the competitive type of person because you will always get rewarded for atleast trying to win the race. You have daily,weekly,and monthly races where you can earn some extra cash by racing on a special mode for example: Playing on night mode with an Toyota Celica on a dirt map. The game offers a wide expansion of trying to win the race by learning your mistakes and trying to win over and over again. a must buy!			"

								Dirt: Rally brings back what made the Colin Mcrae series what it was in the 90's and early 2000's. It provides a semi-simulation feel that lets it sit with other more serious racing games without becoming inaccessible to those looking for a fun rally game.Plays great on a controller, but probably would demand a wheel for those looking to get most out of it.Presentation is outstanding with great graphics and sound that emulate the aesthetics and grit a rally event should. The attention to detail is really appreciated. Replay:

												When this launched in early access I was taken back to a time when Dirt games (Colin McRae) were simulators not wannabe arcade games.  Sure the game was minimal in tracks and cars but it showed the intent of the dev team perfectly.  This is the game we want to make now, are you guys in or not?Well yeah, I was in.. did they come true on their promises?  Yes, all of them IMO and then some.For an early access game to support force feedback wheels, that's good but kinda necessary for a racing simulator.  For it also to support TrackIR for headlook and my HD3D monitor is awesome and it looked amazing.Fast forward god knows how many months and the games been launched and now the VR patch has dropped.  It was a hefty update but I'm very happy to say it just worked.  Launch game, bam it's running on the Rift.  So TrackIR sold, HD3D no longer necessary.This is the rally game you've been waiting for; if you've just got a joypad... jump right in it's perfectly playable.  If you've got an FFB you're in for a treat; if you've got VR you're in for an even bigger treat especially on the wet stages, bloody rain!tl;drThis is not an arcade game though, it will require a decent investment of time to get good.  8 hours or so into playing it and er... well I still suck.  Now the Rift patch has dropped though I can start investing more time; this is what I've been waiting for.This game has the developer support, the peripheral/accessory support, tracks you'll love to hate, the cars you want to drive and the ongoing online challenges you want, it has a good single player mode with multi stage races, car damage with correct time scales to repair the car between stages.

												Linux-specific part: Rally runs really well for me under Arch. I got a big scary warning at first launch that my OS was unsupported but I've had absolutely no problems.The game itself is great. This is definitely more of a simulation than DiRT 3 / Showdown was, which I like. There are upgrades and tuning of the usual things (brake balance, diff strength, suspension), but they aren't the focal point. The focal point is fast-paced blind driving with little room for error.I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I'm very happy with its Linux port.			"

								Great game! Finally a game that challenges you to the max!The game is in early acces but the build is really stable! Haven't had any trouble so far. It's a real challenge to drive fast and control your car in tight corners .. To much steering results into a crash so you really have to be carefull with your controls!But after 30 mins or so you'll get the hang of it!If you want to beat the n1 time on a stage you'll have to drive very fast , so fast that you crash almost everytime you take corners, your heart will definently pump faster!! The car  handles as it's supposed to: Real and not arcade-ishCan't wait to see more cars and tracks added to this!!Cons:- Realistic car handling- No gymkhana/arcade gameplay- Challenging from the start !!- Amazing sound engine- Game is made because the community wanted it- Devs listen to their fans- Realistic weather/terain- Beautifull graphics- Easy to run on almost every pc- More content to come!Pro's:- Hard to control- colin mcrae's name is not on the box :(((			"

												Colin McRae Rally is back! The most reasistic rally-driving experience you can get today (on PC at least). Since Richard Burns Rally came out a decade ago (if you remember it, like I do, i'm sorry, but we're too old to play videogames anyway), this is a must have if you want to enjoy an authentic sim without Ken Block, bright colours and stunts. The game might seem easy at first, but it all changes when you try the fast cars - they are unbelievable. And yes, the wheel is recommended. Tried playing with an Xbox One controller, it is bearable, but your driving reflexes don't work with controller sticks as well as they would with a proper wheel and pedals, like when you get sudden oversteer, for example. Overall an amazing piece, with Classic rally, Hillclimb, and Rallycross, all our favourite disciplines.I'll see you at the start of the Special Stage.			"

Too many games these days play themselves, all you need to do is press a few buttons. This game requires skill, theres not stupid Ken Block BS or gymkhana. This is what happens when develops LISTEN to the fans, and gives them what they want. If you enjoyed the rally games of old, you'll LOVE this!I do think the price is a tiny bit high (40NZD) i believe 25 NZD would be a bit more reasonable, however this game doesn't feel early access at all.You won't regret it if you purchase this game!

								Codemasters have gone back to there roots ! , this reminds me of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 on a new engine ! A pure simulation that dumps you in a deap ditch wanting to improve yourself.Dont confuse this with the previous somewhat arcade dirt games ,its a brutal ,bumpy,difficult heart pounding simulation and not for the impatient.LIke in 2.0 you have to fix your car within the alotted time with the best team you can afford inbetween races.The sense of realism in the cockpit/dash views is immense together with amasing realistic sounds and damage coadmasters are creating something really special here. I suggest you buy this now and save yourself some money as price hikes are incoming with the more content they add,For those that are waiting for multiplayer ,there is already some kind of time based daily/weekly tournaments in the game with live pvp races comming soon....10/10 would flip and die going to fast on a bumpy 6 right turn over and over again ....

Painful dude. Painful.So, if you want to win you have to take some risks, right ?!.And that ♥♥♥♥ing risks will put you in a ♥♥♥♥ing tree !

								One of those games that <insert censored word> you 'till you love it. The first few attempts I didn't finish because the game has a damage model that you cannot disable, so now playing pinball around the corners. In spite of the DiRT name, no Circus, no overhpyed coolness, just a plain and simple Rally game. You don't get magic repairs, after two stages your crew is allowed to spend half an hour patching you up with duct tape and chewing gum, and damage persists over the whole course.Roads have a realistic feel, and most of all, a realistic width - you don't drive on six lane highways. I suppose the hardcore fans will miss more setup options than the ten or so settings you can change, but that is fine with me.  More Gran Turismo type parts would have been nice too. If there is anything negative I can say about the game, I'd say there aren't enough locations, but then, this is Early Access so this is perfectly okay. Please bring back Kenya :)I have no problem recommending this game. I'm curious what is still planned for it.			"

												Dirt Rally has some of the most intense, immersive racing around. I almost always play racing games from a behind the vehicle cam but I play this with helmet cam, it gives a better perspective on the road ahead and all its undulations and makes it super intense. You need to listen to and decipher complicated instructions about the track ahead so your brain needs to be engaged and in sync with your hands. You are only ever in tenuous control of your car if you want a good time so you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Crashes are absolutely brutal and will ruin your run, but its funny to have a missed instruction lead to you hurtling off a cliff or into a tree. The career structure is dull as dishwater and it takes way too long to unlock new cars early on. The non-rally events are pretty thin. But hot damn is the rallying ♥♥♥♥ing great in this.			"

												Excellent Rally Game. Equal or maybe even better then original Colin McRae Rally 1+2I highly recommend this game if you are into Rally. DiRT Rally is brutal, back to basics Rally driving. With an emphasis on brutal. Get ready for some practice laps.Best enjoyed using a steering wheel, or at least a gamepad. Unplayable with M/KB.Requirements:- Nerves of steel- 101% focus on drivingRewards:- Pure adrenaline- A true rally experience- Unparallelled feeling of success after finally beating a best time			"

												0/10 - Because review scores are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tCodies latest rally sim is exactly that, a proper sim... for the most part.The cars are mostly from DiRT 3 with a few extra cars thrown in but they were chosen in DiRT 3 for a reason and they all seem in place here.I do club rallying myself and D.R is exactly that, it's basically racing old WRC cars in semi-pro events that somehow pay major dollars, you end up doing the same stages over and over again so I recommend playing this game about once every two weeks rather than just sitting down and playing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.The stages are really 6 locations with 2 massives stages cut up into pieces, now, in a club rally we do this all the time but even then in real life the stages are all 20km long. D.R feels like a rallysprint but this also allows a few more people to complete events. The monthly challenges can be up to 2 hours long - That's a regular rally on a Saturday night for most real drivers.The game itself is graphically lovely, the physics are insane and show just how good Codies can make games.But nothing can replicate the amazing terror of throwing yourself through a dark forrest on a logging trail that was only driven on the last time you had a rally there. (and I'd love for Codies to come to Australia and make you sim racers have a go at some of our stages)This was plainly thrown together to get a CMR style title back into the mainstream press and now that it's released the 2nd game will most definitely be a WRC game with a car and stage list to make you think back to the old CMR days, Having some old oddities of cars would make a nice addition to the seemingly standard car list that lands in every rally game.Beast of a game that punishes you for mistakes.

												I have such nostalgia for Lancia. Every time it comes back in a daily I'm reminded of their RELENTLESS performance (not my words, check wikipedia) at the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally. I knew right then and there that they were future WRC material, despite the fact that the mid-engined Stratos wasn't even built yet.I'd reckon it was a good 15 years before they hit their prime, at the 1987 World Rally Championship. To think that they also won the WRC before then in an underpowered Stratos is simply incredible. IMO that was the greatest single season performance by a car in WRC history, the kind of thing that puts Renault, Citroën, Audi and Subaru all to shame.It's absolutely pathetic that the team was never picked up over a powerhouse brand like Fiat. They would've put Volkswagen in their place and pounded their stage times, just like they've done to rivals every year. With such prowess, I can only assume that Fiat made them an offer and, being the true Italians they are, Lancia decided they'd rather rebuild their ailing childhood heroes.Nonetheless, I would expect big things from Lancia in this game. Dirt Rally is a real CHASSIS game and I'd bet Lancia has the best one in any category. Nothing short of a top 5 in stage WRs would be acceptable. For the monthly rally, a victory is on the cards for sure. Just look at the stats. 4wd won every WRC event from the 80s onwards except against the Lancia 037, to which the Quattro lost once. Lancia got in Audi's head, got that PSYCHOLOGICAL advantage, and will blow the FRs out of the water when they go wheel to wheel. They're gonna be gunning for the win, I'm sure of it. Honestly, the only question I have about this game is whether you can handle driving a REAL RALLY CAR.			"

								""The Dark Souls of Rally games.""This statement is bang on, this game is incredibly hard... but the moment you nail a hairpin right 40ft up a mountain at terrifying speed, it all becomes worth it. This is not an arcade game, this is more sim than anything else. The DiRT in the title is all that this game has taken from the previous games in the series. DiRT Rally IS hardcore, but it is incredibly fun to play and is very well optimised to boot... I am running it in eyefinity 3x1 at a resolution of 5760x1080 on an FX8350/R9 290 on ultra settings and it runs extremely well, 50/60+fps with no AA, 40/50fps with AA on.There's a lot of content too, 3 different countries with many different courses and a really nice selection of cars ranging from the 60's to present day.and the great part? It's not even finished yet...If you're a Rally fan or even driving games in general but don't mind putting the work in... Buy this.10/10 would have heart attack again.			"

												In DiRT Rally your co-driver has a second voice he uses sometimes. It's a quiet voice, used when the engine is silent when you have just slid off into a briar patch, a certain tone that says: ""I'm being a professional about this, but you just messed up."" The agony of failure and the triumph of victory has always been the appeal of great rally games and DiRT Rally is a throwback to the greats.There's a bit of differing opinion in reviews because of the inevitable comparison to Richard Burns Rally. If you are coming from RBR then these cars are going to feel too forgiving and too easy to control. If you haven't played RBR then DiRT Rally""s cars will impress you with their difficulty and unforgiving disposition.It's DiRT's championships that are truly difficult it's completing the stage fast enough to win that requires lots of practice.  It's focused on gameplay rather than physics like RBR but it is still the best physics sim outside of RBRSound design is jaw dropping.Stages are amazingly detailed and varied.No, this is not the same as RBR but what it is instead is the rally game that everyone has been waiting for, in fact, the best rally game ever. They knocked it out of the park.			"

												This is unlike my marriage, it's new, exciting, thrilling, willing to give you more.  It truly is the most realistic rally game available.  The graphics and handling are amazing.I've only played 5 hours of this game so my review should not be decisive but if you like racing games and on the edge of your seat white knuckle thrills, this game will deliver.Racing games like this should be played with a steering wheel for the most realistic feel of a rally driver.  It's very accessible and designed for beginners and experts.  It never remembers my logitech G27 settings but that's a small price to pay for such a great PC Rally driving game. I love you DIRT Rally and I love my wife :-)			"

								Early days but looking like a very promising rally simulator. A significant number of people seem to be comparing it the highly regarded Richard Burns Rally - which I played a fair bit of back in the day - and certainly seems to be of that ilk. It punishes mistakes and rewarding consistency. This appears to have little in common with the DiRT titles that have gone before and, even these early access versions, is far superior to any of the WRC titles from BigBen.A limited but wondefully varied selection of stages to date, complimented by a fabulous selection of rally cars both young and old. The damage model is a particular highlight. I've consistently managed to suffer punctures - which are both visually rendered and affect handling - which with continued running results in blowouts and you running on the rim. It's currently Early Access but I'm very optimistic.			"

												If you go into this game with the mentality of, ""It's just another dirt game,"" you will not have a very good time. It is a DIrt that a lot of the fans have been asking for. A back to basics Rally simulator. The gameplay is fast paced and requires quick reactions to the smallest movement of the car. This is something that I would recommend a wheel for, as a controller may not be very accurate. Be sure to tune your force feedback; The default settings can sometimes fool you into overcorrection. The graphics may leave some disappointed because it does use the same engine from the last dirt games, but you won’t have much time to worry about them when you are trying to stay on the track and dodge the trees.

								Bear in mind this is Early Access and it gives you ALL content from now on. Every addition and update will be FREE.Further more there's a horizon till the end of the year for release, meaning there's a schedule for updates you should check on the Official Site of the game. There's lots of room for improvement and it'll be improved exactly because it is in Early Access ""Mode"" atm. ⦿ I can't say too much with only 4,5hrs in, but i can express my first impressions as to what i liked thus far:⁍ The slick and minimalistic Menu design.⁍ The low loading times.⁍ The car setup and Team Management ""microtransactions"".⁍ The various options in Career Leagues (gradually earning a place to Masters). Great Online Events, racing with no ""Rewind"" or ""Restart"" option available makes them more challenging.⁍ The fact that there is no kind of actual Micro-transactions for the game. For example no one can buy CR or a car etc. Similar that by purchasing Early Access here we get all content. Respect.⁍ First time behind the wheel is brutal...and i have watched ""Nymphomaniac II""... a learning curve that makes the experience more compelling. The handling of the car demands all of our attention, as it should in RL. Instincts are vigilant while behind the wheel.⁍ I don't like using the term ""Realism"" that much, but in the case of sound it should be mentioned. Driving from the Dashboard view i can hear everything as it should be. Crystal clear, pure sounds of gravel (or any other surface) under the wheels. That adds to the feel of the car.⁍ The option to create our own Custom Leagues and Events!⁍ The fact that they are listening the community, asking suggestions/feedback etc. One of the most important factors is to keep the interaction alive. Giving feedback like Patch Notes even for the slightest thing, explaining why they won't implement something the community asked is essential. Personally i wouldn't mind at all being denied something, we get exaggerating when we are given ""card blanche"". Keep it raw as it is now, make it even harder i would say. Practise makes perfect, time, commitment should be the factors to reward in the end and the feel the game gives feels very close to that. Similar to RL. Good work all around (Devs), kudos.⦿Things i don't like though:⁌ Regular, random crashes.(...)⁌ As mentioned by many, the Force Feedback needs working still. It takes away from the feeling of the car and that is pretty vital for a Simulation Racing game.There are prolly things i'm missing here but much have mentioned in Forums, so i stay positive on this one. Cheers.			"

												Don't look any further if you want one of the best rally racing game on the market. I grew up with codies when they created TOCA, which was one of the best game. Then, time went on, and TOCA 2 came out, and still as good. Then Colin McRae rally, which was an outstanding rally game, then codies went more arcade with TOCA 3, Dirt 1, Dirt 2, etc... Now, codies is back and made sure that this game would go back to the source. The handling, the tracks, physics, everything about this game is spot on. Obviously, since it is a PC release, they have nvidia surround support. The best way to experience this game is with a steering wheel but codies got keyboard and gamepad support. After over 200 hours, this game is still getting me back in. The challenge is high and master level will be though. Honestly, if you love racing, just simply get the game.			"

Early Access Review
								Until now, I have never been engrossed in a sim racer because of the actual racing. Usually, my desire to collect and upgrade cars is what drives me to continue playing games like Gran Turismo, or Forza, because racing in those games can be downright boring. Not so in Dirt Rally, with which I am obsessed right now. I usually don't get infatuated with a game unless it is RPG in nature, but this game has got me hooked.The racing really gives you a feel of power because the cars feel and sound amazing, and the amount of challenge means that success is extremely rewarding. Successfully drifting through a hairpin turn gives a great feeling. Another reviewer said that this is the Dark Souls of racing, and I wholeheartedly agree. Prepare to die, a lot. If you are up for a challenge and love a good race of any kind, I strongly recommend this title.			"

												Best Rally Racing Game in the civilized world at the time of this writing bar none. (note by civilized world I would like to stress; the market/s.)Yes this is opinionated but honest and unbiased recommendation but that's not the point, it being; that this game is immensely good (involved and evolved) in terms of various aspects that have to do with gaming and then namely in the Rallyesim (sub)genre. -It is just as much fun as the Dirt series was, which by all means could be considered an arcade-""sim"" (more 'arcarde' then 'sim' IMHO),-It is just as easy to drive (like say... Richard Burns Rally) respectfully,-with a somewhat strong emphasis on real simulation this one takes the cake, for sure. -As it is the newest addition in the hereford mentioned category it has a lot to offer, with the newest, most recent rendition above all (if you care for your games looks, this is your pick).-(but;) Most importantly the racing, gaming experience is right on point, and could be possibly (I think) considered true to (real) life physics, from what I can feel 'driving'.This is what a lot of people, from what I could gather have been hoping for, expecting and waiting for (including yourz truly) hence now is the time for it to be delivered; see here and look no further. I think that someone who isn't involved with Rally Racing would, after seeing this game in action get hooked and would want to jump right in. I got it in Early Access and this is to me proof of (that) concept; it's great but remember: Skill takes a lot of practice and mastery equals dedication.Might you choose to pick this one up; Enjoy!! I love it, and now time for me to jump back in myself. Peace!(ps kudos@Devs, I think deservingly so. Hellufa produc, LOL ;)			"

Early Access Review
								After almost 50 hours it's probably time to do the review. Been playing since 0.45 and have played all different classes except the 2010's. From the 1960's ""beginner cars"" to the Group B monsters, back down to Group A to the recent day this game is trying to confine 50 years of rallying in one single game. Car models are well done, physics are as good as you should (yes, should, not could) expect from a simulator game like this and the rally stage are close if not exact replica's of their real life counterparts, there's no fantasy involved.But wait, there's more...Dirt Rally also features the Pikes Peak Hillclimb and Rallycross now, which I find fun to do, but my main personal focus will stay on rally stages, but just know it's out there and it is fun. We'll see if Codemasters decides to expand on these championships with more different hillclimbs or rallycross circuits.Onto the lesser things, as the game is early access, which is sometimes - just like alpha or beta - misused to label an unfinished product that will stay unfinished, there are rough edges. However it feels genuinely early access, and not an excuse. One of things most notable are stuttering/lag issues that seem to affect Nvidia people more than AMD. No mouse support, which is weird for a 2015 game and obviously the ""limited"" (take it with a grain of salt) content available for the price of now 42 euro's (I bought it for 24 or something a few patches ago as they did mention it would increase in price overtime, which imo is a fresh attitude towards otherwhise buyable DLC's or patches).Now I'm not going to go into the discussion if 42 euro's is the correct price right now - although that is still less than let's say Project Cars or Assetto Corsa - as that depends on your budget and how hard you want this game, but I can say this game is worth playing...a lot.Cause it's a sim, it'll take time before you get all green stage times and top the leaderboards, offline or online for that matter. And that's basically the real reason why I would advice this game, it's a longterm investment in entertainment, if Codemasters keeps up the patches like they do I can see this game being in the same league as Richard Burns Rally when it comes to lifespan.And that only means good news.So, to Codemasters: please fix optimilization issues with graphics and sounds...and you have yourself a gold mine with an inspired and enthusiastic community.Nectaria Coutayar			"

Early Access Review
								The most fun I've had racing since Richard Burns Rally. It's definitely a proper sim and huge improvement over the previous Dirt games. The physics, ffb, and wheel controller support are waay better. The game has steadily improved in early access and is a great example of early access done right. The devs have had a strong community presence  and have implemented feedback while continuing to put out quality content on a very consistent basis. Console owners will be in for a treat if they decide to release the final version on the PS4 and xbone. I'm very happy to see early VR support as well even though it's a rough implementation. If they continue to work on it the game should be amazing on the Oculus Rift consumer version. Overall the best driving game codemasters has ever made.			"

								I am going to preface this review by saying that I am not good at this game. I am not good at controlling my car even with a gamepad, and god help any of you that try to play with just a mouse and keyboard. That being said I think that this is a very very good game. The physics seem accurate (at least to a filthy casual such as myself), the tracks are supposed to be accurately modeled, and the sound, my god the audio is amazing. The gameplay is challenging, and unless you are much better than me you WILL destroy your car while learning it. Overall I'd say get this game if the idea of driving a howling turbocharged shitbox down gravel roads at 90mph while bouncing off berms appeals to you. I know it appeals to me.			"

Because of these two games, I bought a 200$ G27,right now, I can finish a track in DiRT Rally with only 1 or 2 small crashes and I can even drift a little bit in AC!Trust me, this game can teach you how to shut up and learn how to drive from ground zero.

												First thing to say about this game is, it looks really gorgeous. Despite the fact that my laptop has mediocre hardware, I could maintain a stabilized 60+ fps on high settings (i5 4200H, GTX850M, 8gb 1600 mHz RAM). The game itself needs your dedication to improve simultaneously so it really is not a casual gamer's dream. Game mechanics are jaw droppingly detailed and hard to keep up. It's been 2+ hours into this game but I couldn't figure out how the hell to keep the car on the road (I couldn't do better than 4th in a casual event in ""clubman"" AI difficulty). If you played earlier games of DiRT series, this is a lot different from the previous games. This is better in every single way and challenges you to spend hours to improve yourself. I can't deny the fact that it really expects you to improve upon it but it really is an amazing game. The variety of vehicles, classes and tracks could be expanded but, hey, it is still in development and I'm pretty sure, over the time, it will be even better. Would fall off the cliff 5 times a race again, 9/10.			"

												Words cannot describe my addiction to this game. I remember the first time I played this game like yesterday. The first car I chose was the Audi. When I heard that sound of the Audi, I knew I was going to have a blast. And I did, with 50+ hours logged in the game since buying it in June. (or was it July?) The handling model, added on with the challenge, is punishing. If you slightly tap a rock, that's a few seconds off your time. I like it that way. Then they added Rallycross. I had even more of a blast than on normal rally stages. It made me realize one of the biggest factors of the game-the speed. Okay the cars aren't as fast as a Ferrari, but they're enough to satisfy my need...for speed. This is a great game, and a great first entry into the DiRT series. It's something that you can play ffor a LONG time.TL;DR- So would I recommend this game? Yes. Just make sure you have a powerful PC. That laptop isn't going to cut it.(Or you could get it on console....if you have one.)			"

												Where to Start.This game is probably the most realistic ""Rally"" Simulator currently released. The game is quite hard to just sit down and pick up. Trust me, you will be in the hedge quicker than colin mcrae can say ""If in Doubt, flat out"". The game starts you off in career only being able to afford 2 cars, and here on out the only way to buy better cars is to win events. Sounds easy? Well, You need to take into account paying for your crew. They have a limited amount of use throughout the events, if you dont have a decent crew or pay for a cheap crew, less work will be done to the car in your half an hour slot. Overall, the graphics are good, sound is awesome to me. The cars generally sound powerful. Also, it has pikes peak. Recreated and looks fantastic.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and likes rally games. I would recommend at the minimum some sort of controller for gameplay, but a steering wheel for the best effect.5/5!			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DRIf you scroll down the reviews far enough to read this, I have one question for you:""What are you doing? JUST BUY THE GAME!""Ahem, right. Now there is a new update, version 0.9 early this November that adds a number of cars and updated the drive physics.For the better, of course.I can't belive how sensical things have become. Mind you, I'm not very good in this game, and despite plunging in the game quite early, I don't play it as much as others because of one thing, RageQuits. And being angry playing this game is a good thing. Bear with me.This is the most realistic driving simulation I have ever played. I heard news about Dirt Rally being released on Early Access from a popular image sharing in the interweb (not Instagram). I learned it's going to be true rally sim unlike those useless gymkhana stunts on previous DiRTs I never got the hang on after many hours.I was excited to read rave early reviews saying how it was going to exceed all previous iterations of Codemaster's DiRT games AND even Richard Burn Rally, the pinacle of Rally games. I tried RBR once, it was a pain to install, with all the necessary mods that took ages to download, and I didn't like the graphics, I didn't like the feels. The practice on that game alone was ridiculous hard and unrealistic. It didn't have support for my Logitech G27 and I won't waste my time getting my wheel working on a game that allows a car to slide around in gravel at 30kph. I played Shift 2 since, and became quite confident with my skills. I tried pCars after that, the physics was similar though I wouldn't say I'm happy with how cars handles. But DiRT Rally is something else. It's out of this world. No, seriously. THIS is the holy grail.It is Early Access, already in v0.9, but you got a fully functioning, mostly bug-free game that runs like a good completed game of the old days. Remember the times when we use DVDs to install games and we can play that game smoothly and comfortably right after installing it, without any Day 1 patches? That's how good Dirt Rally runs out of the box. Sure there is occasional bugs and hastles, but with each iteration it's mostly fixed and if the game hangs on you, perhaps it's about time to take a rest and wash your face. You've probably driven more than 100km in one sitting.Whatever price you pay for this game, it's worth it. You are essentially paying for a complete game that runs superbly well and in each month, there is a massive update giving players new features, new cars, and new game modes (probably). Think of it like buying a complete Rally game and earning free DLCs along the way. YEAH!So I dusted my olde G27 and hooked it up to my new gaming PC, built around this game!Bought my first Mini and hopped into the car.And man, I did fell off a cliff.Those reviewers before me are not joking.This is the real thing. This is the S-word-I'm-not-allowed-to-say. This justifies my new $1500 gaming rig. What you get is punishing Rally game that is as close to the real thing as it can be. There isn't any other game like this and sadly, I don't think there will be any other after this. RBR survived a decade for a reason. The masochists that we all are did not have anything else to channel our needs.DiRT Rally gives that in a beautiful and accessible way. No, you won't have to install mods and spend wasteful hours setting up your gears. Plug in a steering wheel and start driving.Even better now is the new RallyCross pack.That is the Holy S-word-I'm-not-allowed-to-say Fun I ever had. You are inside a jet engine that accelerated like a rocket and turns in four wheel against other cute rockets. Cute rockets that wants to end your Monday like a goat with murder tendency.Your opponents, the AIs, are sick enough to butt you, slam you off your lane, ram your back, flick your tail and send you to a separator, destorying your radiator. They are violent and I like them violent. It gave me a reason to be just as violent.The tracks are simple enough. When you first started RallyCross, it was just a simple oval with the trickiest bit being the joker. Now I don't know what that is at first and I hope the Devs would take some time making an in-game Encyclopedia for every rally terms in the game, but basically, it was a speed bump everybody had to take once. As you got better, the track got longer and more complicated, and boy, you will soon learn your limits and you will get addicted to want to break those limits.Now, the new November update completed drive physics for each car. I currently drove a Quattro, not the best car, I know, but I'm comfortable with it. The ride was stable enough and I'm never going too fast to my taste. But the new update makes me realise that it was actually weird going so stable around Wales in the rain, plunging through dips without my car bouncing about and hitting the trees, because that's what happens afte the update!Is that a bad thing? Of course not. It threw me off balance, and I have to re-learn the car again, but thinking back, it's probably how it should handle. You're going over 100 on mud anyway, how could it possible you're going straight with the throttle hammered down? That's what I love about this game and the team at CodeMasters who are responsible with its development. They worked very hard to make sure every detail makes sense. It might not be a perfect sim, I don't have a reference point because I don't do real world rally. But playing this game also makes me a better driver in the real world. You know, I kinda feel it when I could slid the tail of my car, it just takes a little nudge up the handbrake, just a little bit and I'm skidding, but no, won't risk it.Because just as in DiRT Rally, you don't perform risky manuevuer to show off. You aim to deliver the car across the finish line. Sloppiness and the urge to try something stupid, like ignoring your navigator will send you crashing, and more often than not, going slower does make you go faster.This is the game to buy if you are a masochist perfectionist.

												Where to Start.This game is probably the most realistic ""Rally"" Simulator currently released. The game is quite hard to just sit down and pick up. Trust me, you will be in the hedge quicker than colin mcrae can say ""If in Doubt, flat out"". The game starts you off in career only being able to afford 2 cars, and here on out the only way to buy better cars is to win events. Sounds easy? Well, You need to take into account paying for your crew. They have a limited amount of use throughout the events, if you dont have a decent crew or pay for a cheap crew, less work will be done to the car in your half an hour slot. Overall, the graphics are good, sound is awesome to me. The cars generally sound powerful. Also, it has pikes peak. Recreated and looks fantastic.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and likes rally games. I would recommend at the minimum some sort of controller for gameplay, but a steering wheel for the best effect.5/5!			"

												UPDATED REVIEW:Since the game released, and my initial review along with it, things have changed, mostly for the better. However I will discuss some things I still feel need to be addressed. I also want to go ahead and point out I did not pay regular price because I bought the game in alpha stages, so my opinion as to the content recieved for the dollar figure will be skewed, but hopefully not too bad. Now on to business.DiRT Rally does a lot of things well, in my previous review I mentioned graphics were great, but you also didn't lose performance, it is a very smooth very beautiful game, the sound is unparalleled, probably the best part of the game compared to others, bringing it right there with iracing as far as sounds. The handling was a concern previously, and to me, it still is, I still feel the setup does not effect the car as much as it should. Content is still my biggest concern, I feel that there are more than enough cars, but far too few unique rally stages. At 10 unique stages, and with only one Hillclimb location, and 3 RX tracks I feel  there is just not enough content. Now that I've mentioned the good the bad and the ugly I will break down some of these points. These are all points I made previosly that I just feel like I should explain a little betterThe good--Graphics & performance. I've seen prettier games, but none of them ran as smooth. I enjoy watching the replays because of the detail and effects, but when I'm driving none of it gets in the way, or feels over the top, it doesn't hinder framerate, and it just feels like it is exactly where it should be for 2015.-Sound: Possibly the best sound of any racing game ever. You can hear the gravel hitting the car and this gets louder as you go faster or louder as you skate sideways kicking up more gravel. The snow banks make noise when I lean against them  and I can hear how much it is slowing my car based off the sound, the transmission whines, the turbo spools, the antilag system spikes the gear connects, the brakes squeal, the handbrake even sounds like it does is real life when it connects. The only bad thing with the sound is the co-driver, I still feel he is too quiet, and this is after altering my sound settings to make it the loudest thing on my sound, I just feel it gets too quiet at parts and makes it hard to understand.-Required driving technique: Previously I mentioned that the ""handling was good"" what i meant was that the techniques required to drive these cars is very accurate to what would be needed in these cars in real life. Left Foot Braking, heel toe, scandinavian flicks, weight transfer, throttle feathering, and even holding the clutch a bit longer in the old cars makes them drive a bit better. You can really learn how to manipulate a cars weight in this game, the only game that showcases this better is iracing, which is in it's own other dimension in the sim world.The bad--RX AI aggression: I don't know who did it, but sometimes the aggro button gets held down a bit too long for the AI in Rallycross and they tend to just do really stupid things to take themselves out of the race, or to take you out of the race. contact is great between them though, which is an improvement since release, and I really enjoy RX on SP and MP experiences.-AI times in rally and hillclimb: It is just a bit harsh. In rally you are supposed to race at 95% but in order to beat the AI you about have to memorize the stage and hit every corner without missing a beat. What I've learned to do when I can, is to race against the community delta, because it is a more accurate representation of what a decent stage time would be in rally.-co-driver: It is inconveniently inconsistent in volume. When you are doing flatout on gravel it is very hard to hear the pacenotes through it, and in real life they wear earpieces to prevent this, I would recommend some sort of change, however the information and timing has improved greatly since release, otherwise it would be in the ugly section.-extra controller support: I still have some slight issues with my handbrake not getting recognized at the beginning of a stage, I will say this is nowhere near as annoying as it used to be, though, because for the most part it doesn't do this in the midddle of a race and typically I don't see adn issue at the beginning of an RX race, where it would effect launch control. So this also has been greatly improved.The ugly-Lack of content: There is only 10 unique Rally Stages (but many versions including those same stages reversed and mix matched between parts ot create other stages and also broken down to creat shorter stages), 3 RX courses (with 3 layouts each) and 1 Hillclimb course (3 time period accurate versions, 100% gravel, mixed, and modern 100% paved) Now I am impressed at how well they mix and match the stages and impressed also by the various versions of Pikes Peak and the subtle differences that end up making a significant change ot the way a corner is taken. Also I feel each stage, course, and Version look great, and you can add various weather and time of day to most of them which is nice, but this is a game released in 2015, we should expect more unique stages, and although I hate to say it, I feel a $5 DLC pack for a  new locale in rally and a $10 pack for a new HillClimb course would be fair since they feel and look so amazing, I just hope Codemasters has a  plan for that in the near future.NEW ISSUES:-Static, uninteresting Crowd:The crowd looks pretty good, but they don't really look alive, and they certainly make no effort to get out of the way or help you get your car back on course. This is 2015 this shouldn't be too hard to pull off, considering RBR had camera men that would be out in the middle of the road and run back off, and sometimes... you would hit them in the process. I would also like to be able to screw up a turn and go into the crowd area and they move out of the way, or attempt to at least. It would just add some immersion. And definitely an animation while your car is reset would be neat.-Create your own pacenotes:This would be a cool idea and would add again to the immersion. I just feel in 2015 this could have been accomplished and would add a bit of control over the information liek you do in real life with the recce session.-Real-time Rally:What I mean by this is instead of just having your car on the stage and aleaderboard of supposed times that other MP drivers have ran or AI have ran, what if there was a mode made where all the cars queued up in line like in real life and were launched at 30 second intervals? I would love to be running my stage and see the tire marks of the last guy, and maybe even run into a smoking car on its roof. It would certainly be entertaining in the MP area and add ot the immersion in SP as well.=================================================================Overall with the games improvements since launch I can happily say it gets a 80/100 . If they made changes to the issues I experience with current features it would immediately leap to 89% but without making an effort to make the game ultimately better than games from 10 years ago I would not ever be able to put it in the 90% area. If they added the features I mentioned I would feel more inclined to do so, but although this game is pretty, feels good, and sounds stunning, I just can't say without a doubt that I will stop playing RBR, if for no other reason than the massive content alone. However I still would recommend this game to any rally sim fan.			"

								Dirt Rally is coming along nicely. Cars are lovely to handle (I like challenge and this almost like RBR). Graphics are good. Narrow roads on stages are big plus for me. Only thing I'm currently disappointed about is that there is not enough unique stages. Locations like Germany use same bits of roads several times through the rally. I like the work Codemasters did with the first three locations, but the Germany was a big let down stage-wise.			"

Before you read into this, note:I do not own a wheel.However, prior to buying DiRT Rally, I had a go with my brothers set (MOMO Black, popular back in the day). The driving felt pretty comfortable. Didn't have any problems with it besides that I'm an inexperienced sim driver and sucked at it, but for that short moment I had so much fun. The feeling threw me back somewhere in time I hazily remember playing Live For Speed and sucking at that, too. But most importantly, it felt real.Seriously don't try this with keyboard ...For now, I have to make do with a controller only. Mind you, this one is so cheap it doesn't even have the analog bumpers like a ps3/4 or x360 /XO controller, but your mileage may vary (no pun intended). The settings offer full keymapping for every input type, this is great. Main input devices are keyboard, gamepad, or wheel and pedals (I guess there's no reason not to play this with a flight stick or guitar hero controller if you really wanted to.. (update: tried, guitar controller definitely works)) and basic gamepad/controller is the middleground here. Manageable, in my case. I, like many others, would recommend that you shouldn't start this game with a keyboard, at the very least go grab a controller from your favourite console and you are set, maybe after minimal control tweaking. The defaults are impractical, imho.I might update this review when I get more hours into the game. "

								I have waited so long for a real rally game. Ever since I was hooked into it from Rallisport Challenge 2 on the Xbox. I haven't  played a rally game that was as great as that since. I have finally found it. This game is exactly what I wanted from the moment I started the first couple of races. My laptop can only run medium settings and the game is still gorgeous. Very well optimized. The feel of the cars are just perfect(no assists on). I haven't got too far into it so I don't know how much content there is. I don't care though, I am just happy that I finally got my long awaited rally racing gem. Thank you Codemasters. This is it. Last time I played a great rally racer was when Halo 2 was popular. So lets hope the new Halo lives up to that fact.			"

												When I first got this game in Early Access, it had all the markings of a fantastic game. The only reason I didn't recommend buying at that point was just that, it was Early Access and there wasn't a whole lot to do or see. Now that it's finally v1.0, I can safely say this is a must have for my fellow rally racing fans out there. Granted, I'm not a hardcore enthusiast whose past memories include the Colin McRae games or Richard Burns Rally, but I enjoyed the DiRT games despite them lying on the arcade side of the spectrum. This game is a much more realistic depiction of rally racing as opposed to the colorful, Gymkhana infested games of the series' past, and I love it. No longer can you take a corner at full speed and get away with it, or slam into the car ahead and deal with minor engine problems. Have I mentioned how gorgeous and well optimized this game is? A must have for rally racing fans, and fans of racing games alike.			"

								Dirt is back where it should have always been RALLY! Yes there hillclimbing and autocross to be added through the early acess development but the Rallying is imroved beyond recognition over previous DIRT versions, This is more  McRae style simulation, only a few hrs in so far and first impressions are very good, nice long stages (powys wales, sweet lamb in the dark and rain! in a metro 6r4...epic!).No flashbacks!! no gymkana pure oldschool rally the stages are tight and unforgiving, full damage effects pretty good at this stage.Team management is in, hire and fire crew that impact your stage repairs etc etc.the 17 cars available are a rally purists dream collection ranging from 60's mini cooper through to the 2010 fiesta RS.If Codies adresses the  bad parts (and they say they are committed to improving the game through feedback) its going to be a stand out Title well above what folks have come to expect from the ""DIRT"" series, in fact I would have considered dropping that title to head off any ""arcade""  prejudgement.As expected with Early access plenty of stuff needs work: graphics need optimisation and polishing but not too bad at that. force feedback on the G27 is squishy and a bit muted even at max settings (need to work on the profiler a bit maybe?) manual clutch seems to have not effect beyond on off (no effect on engine revs) so dipping the clutch is a matter of ON/OFF right now.the damage visuals are poor especially any windscreen cracks just look like white marker pen lol (a shame because physical damage effects seem almost right.

												This game is a load of fun as a simulator, and by that I mean, if you love to stay focused and make every move percise and accurate in effort to keep the fastest laptime, this game is unmatched.. If you are looking fora casual racer, look elsewhere.			"

												Ridiculously tough. Infuriatingly rage-quit worthy. Harder to drive with a steering wheel (for me, the G920 w/ shifter) than any car in real life......but that's why it's so god-damn fun.- Also, you'll never see a rally driver and think ""man, that looks easy and fun"" ever again. Well, maybe the fun part...			"

												I purchased this game a while back as an early access and reviewed it negatively so I want to ammend that now, as the game has evolved into something I find quite enjoyable.  The realistic physics is challenging but all the more rewarding as you progress and begin to master it.  I did find it absolutely necessary to set steering sensitivity at 100%, as whatever the default setting had been was unplayable for me.  The graphics is great but not overly demanding.  In fact, it would be fully playable on even my small 13"" gaming laptop if not for the only remaining negative point.  If you're running a laptop with nVidia Optimus switchable graphics (which is almost any current nVidia-powered gaming laptop,) you cannot run the game in fullscreen!  It simply refuses to comply, even if you edit the ini file.  Apparently this has been an initial issue with previous Dirt releases as well, which makes it all the more ridiculous that they let this one out with the same problem - and that it remains a problem with this title more than a year after initial public release!!  Note, AMD's switchable graphics is not afflicted with this problem but AMD only has roughly 25% marketshare among gamers.  Even so, I give the game five stars for being one of the few real shining stars in the PC driving game category.  I'm just glad I hung onto my older AMD-powered gaming laptop to play it!!			"

								It feels like we finally have a true successor to the DiRT/Colin McRae (RIP) series.  The game plays extremely well for 'early access' and looks fantastic at 1440p.  I am excited to see what the devs do from here.  I'm only 4 hours in and feel like I will easily get my money's worth.  If you liked DiRT3, tolerated the ones in between, then you are definitely a candidate for this game.  Well done.			"

								I dont normally do too many reviews, but felt I had too here. First I am a keyboard player, so i was a bit worried reading some reviews. I have been a keyboard player, since the early days of Colin McR Rally and i have also played the recent Dirt games, which have been disappointing due to a lack of focus on pure Rally. This game ticks all the boxes! its a pure rally game, back to the good old days of Colin McR. I have been playing for a couple of hours now, I am not ashamed to say the first attempt did not go well ........ the mini did not even see half way through stage one. That when old senses came back of i need to protect the car and listen to pace note (something very noval for a Dirt Game!). I started to do that and it has started to come together. This game is hard, you really have to listen and feel the road. I have still not got completed a stage where i have not have moment of out braking myself or going a bit wide, that what keep me coming back for more, i want to finally nail a stage. I nearly did 10 mins ago, but on the final corner i slide wide and caught a tree............. so close yet so far. In regards to the keyboard, its fine, its like a rally games back in the 2000's, you just have to have a bit of skill and not drive like an idiot (or like in other Dirt games!)			"

								After 16 hours of this game, I can honestly say that it is the most satisfying rally game that I have played for quite some time. Dirt 3, in my opinion, was a mess, the rally was quite fun, but the rest of it was just utter sh*t. But this, this masterpiece that Codemasters made, is the most intense and thrilling rally ""simulator"" I have played to date.There is honestly nothing wrong with this game as to date, but, I believe the external damage, such as door panels and bumpers, etc, need a bit of work. When I do multiple flips, I would love to see my whole car pretty much ripping apart. Overall, this game is just amazing. The rally aspect just feels so unique and Codemasters are all over this game in terms of updates and hotfixes. It is truly just a breath of fresh air in the rally simulation world. I applaud you, Codies. Fantastic work!			"

								Playing this with a keyboard/mouse is out of the question. Even a 360 controller is tough. This game is awesome but it seems to be better enjoyed using a steering wheel set up.... which I do not have.Driving on a gravel road at 115 MPH requires more finesse than my controller can provide. I think a wheel would better handle the micro-adjustments required to keep my car from becoming a tree ornament.I don't think this is anything DIRT did wrong, I think its just that you wanna play this with a wheel.Other than that, the car choices seemed a bit small when I played it. But I might just be spoiled from FORZA.			"

Altough the game still has flaws which are pretty much expected given the development state it is in, CM is doing a great work and showing the game has potential to be de definitive rally simulation experience (its core is already arguably better than RBR overall).

								Very fast rally game! Fun to drive all of the cars for ""free"" and test them out. Glad to see games moving away from ""you have to unlock this to drive this.""  Its a good plan in Dirt Rally where you can drive all the cars, but if you don't ""own"" them you don't make any money. GFX are awesome! Wish I had a super powerful GFX card to experience more of the shiny cars, but I'm on a budget here!Controls have me on the fence a little bit. I cannot seem to get the G25 steering wheel to work as good as I want to. Sometimes it feels like over-powered steering with no feel to it and other times it feels slightly heavy with perfect feel. But it always feels like a dead-zone when travelling straight.  Wish I could get some center tension just like a real car.I really like the sounds and engines are like music to me, so its great!I still feel like the cars are ""hovering"" at times, and I'm not so sure about the 150 foot long jumps! But it sure is fun!Damage is ok, but you can bash into things and still keep driving.  And I have succesfully ripped off all four tires!  (It stops driving then).  Overall great , fun game and the codies work hard for us, so you need to appreciate that.			"

The controls are tight and your mistakes are your mistakes. The damage and team mechanics are fantastic. Rallycross is a blast.

												If you don't own a Logitech G27 (I'm sure the G25/G29 are great too) you'll never understand why this game is as great as it really is. Finally finding that sweet spot in your controller/game settings and setting an impressive time is exhilirating. I couldn't even begin to tell you the amount of times I attempted the entire Pikes Peak Hillclimb event (roughly 10 minutes), all to squeeze a few more seconds out of my time. I would easily give this game a 10/10. For a racing simulator it has spared no detail in achieving perfection. From the beautiful maps you travel, down to the online leaderboards, Codemasters has finally found their sweet spot with Dirt again.			"

								This game is truly the Dark Souls of the racing genre. Codemaster took out all of the handicaps that were in dirt 3 and made the handling of the vehicles more realistic, but diffucult at the same time. As of right now (May 2015), its still in early access and only has about 16-17 vehicles, but they vary across many different specs ranging from a 1960's mini cooper to a modified Fiesta and  Impreza. Normally i would have been disapointed with such a small selection of cars, but each one has thier own unique feel to them which makes the harder to learn and thus more time is required with each car. Overall, I believe that if you are a fan of the dirt or rally series, and you can managae to take a beating, id get this game. Knowing Codemasters, they arent going to drop this game in the middle of development like other developers have.			"

												I'm not going to give this a thumbs down due to my poor experience with this game. But, I can only recommend this to people who are seriously into simulation racing games, and also understand the challenge of rally racing compared to a normal race track. Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.I've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.Another thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.The car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you. And lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to ""recover"" your car and put up with being severely time penalised.If you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.Big ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.

Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.I've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.Another thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.The car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you. And lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to ""recover"" your car and put up with being severely time penalised.If you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.Big ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.

												If you don't own a Logitech G27 (I'm sure the G25/G29 are great too) you'll never understand why this game is as great as it really is. Finally finding that sweet spot in your controller/game settings and setting an impressive time is exhilirating. I couldn't even begin to tell you the amount of times I attempted the entire Pikes Peak Hillclimb event (roughly 10 minutes), all to squeeze a few more seconds out of my time. I would easily give this game a 10/10. For a racing simulator it has spared no detail in achieving perfection. From the beautiful maps you travel, down to the online leaderboards, Codemasters has finally found their sweet spot with Dirt again.			"

												Best rally game since Richard Burns. Solid, predictable handling that feels authentic but isn't punishing. Each car feels and sounds different. Good selection of stages. They don't look spectacular graphically and they don't have many ""landmarks"" so to speak, but the road geometry is spot on which is all that matters in a rally sim. Haven't had a chance to play with my Momo wheel and pedals but it's pretty easy to control with a gamepad. If you like driving sideways through forests and miss the old Colin McRae games, you need this.			"

												Best driving game ever made. Nothing is a purer driving experience or challenge. More infuriating than any other racing game, but also more rewarding. Lacks content in locations, and depth surrounding the racing, but makes up for it in car selection and the depth in the driving experience. Brilliant team of developers that have listened to a niche community of die hard rally goers in an attempt to create the best rally sim. Thoroughbred rallying at its upmost best.			"

								I rate this game: Hours Played/10Amazing game. I have a setup with a 32"" tv and my g27 wheel mounted right in front of it. The beauty of this game will not tire you. You can spend hours just driving around derping around (which will happen at the start) and still have fun by taking in the beauty of the environment, the realism and attention to detail of the tracks, the accuracy of the sounds, etc. I like that this game has native support for the g27 wheel. The forcefeed back this game provides is pretty spot on from what I can tell. The physics help a ton and I often times really feel like I'm driving a car (especially considering I use the view with only the hood in the front so my TV looks like a windshield). Races are difficult. You will have to keep in mind the conditions of the road and the weather. Go slow and steady until you get a feel for the game's physics. I have been playing for only 15 hours-ish (my steam time is actually wrong, which everyone knows) and I've managed to lower my time from 10 minutes to ~5:30 for the first championship tracks. Yet I'm only in 5-6th place xD Honestly, I can't see myself getting 1st until I've put atleast 100 hours of game time into this game. That's how difficult it is. But that's also what I love about it. It's realistic, it's not an arcade game where the cars can go 160 mph on any surface. Playing it with a wheel makes it so much better and you can literally buy the g27 wheel and be perfectly content playing just this game. This game will force you to learn how to drift and drive manually (I use the sequential shifter on the g27). Acing a really hard turn is something you will make a goal and practice for. Yes, this is a game where you repeat tracks over and over to practice. That's why getting a wheel makes it that much more enjoyable, because it feels like you're gaining actual driving skill as well. Did I mention the graphics? It's just uncannily beautiful.			"

												This is probably the best racing game I personally have ever played. The physics and wheel support/force feedback is excellent. This game supports controllers to a reasonable degree but I would highly recommend using a wheel if you can. The graphics are great, but not quite PCars level, and the detail on the road surfaces and weather effects (which both impact how your car handles) make you feel like you are really driving a rally car. This game is also incredibly well optimised and will run well on most rigs.The only downside to this game I can think of is there aren't that many cars relative to other games, and I have found the rallycross mode to be quite underwhelming.Other than that, I'd highly recommend this anyone who enjoys racing games.

												This game works for all sort of players, keyboarders, controllerfreaks and the simhead using a wheel. It is balanced throughout all the levels so that everyone can compete. But do not think it'll come easy from the get-go. The game shows it can be used competively with own leagues and proves itself when it comes to realism over and over. Yeah, I can hardly figure out what to say. The only negative thing is that there is no way to get a throttle-input for keyboard, so it'd be easier to balance through corners, this can only be done with controller or wheel.			"

								Playing this with a keyboard/mouse is out of the question. Even a 360 controller is tough. This game is awesome but it seems to be better enjoyed using a steering wheel set up.... which I do not have.Driving on a gravel road at 115 MPH requires more finesse than my controller can provide. I think a wheel would better handle the micro-adjustments required to keep my car from becoming a tree ornament.I don't think this is anything DIRT did wrong, I think its just that you wanna play this with a wheel.Other than that, the car choices seemed a bit small when I played it. But I might just be spoiled from FORZA.			"

								if you are looking for a game you can win the first race and every race after that. FIND ANOTHER GAME. This game is for the down to earth racers that have been waiting for a real rally game like this. I love the damage can only be repaired after the second stage and its only as much repairing that you crew can manage in a 30 min window before the next heat. the snow stages are a killer and really hard to hang on to the road. driving into the crowd or off the track can cost you up to 15 sec.  N0 GYMKANA!!!!!!!! this game really makes me happy. i've never had as much fun losing a race as i have here. if you want to know what the real drivers go through make sure you don't cut the corner when they tell you or you will die.....and speaking of co-driver. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FIXING THAT AS FAST AS YOU GUYS DID!!!!!!!! i was one of the lucky north americans that had a dead co-driver and you guys fixed it before i even woke up the next day. this is going to be a really enjoyable early access game.

								Never has there been a racing game that felt as real as Dirt Rally. I first started racing and was crashing every corner, I suffered throgh it and quickly got better. It is the dark souls of racing games, hard but fair and if you wreck its your fault. Getting faster times is exhilarating it will leave your hands sweaty and shaky after finishing a race. Highly recomend this game along with a g27 wheel.			"

												Finally Codemasters decided to create a traditional rally simulator. DiRT Rally has the essence of what matters the most in rally - trying not to lose control of the car, squeeze into every narrow corner to beat it as fast as possible and also it gives us a large dose of emotions. As we know, fractions of seconds are very significant in rally, and sometimes you can make one little wrong move and it can affect on your final score, so it's necessary to stay focused to the end of the track if you want to end with a decent results. It's certainly not a game for casuals, it requires some skills and basic knowledge about rally from you, it's not some Need for Speed where you can easily drive over 200mph and easily squeeze into every corner without making any efforts. If you're looking for challenging and demanding game, it's definitely for you. Don't give up quickly, it usually takes even 10 hours to learn the basics. If you can complete a single track without crashing your car (without driving assistance) - it's good. And one more thing, this game desperately needs a good steering wheel, without it it's impossible to feel the physics model and the satisfaction from driving. I personally recommend good old logitech G27. It's not cheap, but it's definitely worth your money anyway. If you want to play on a keyboard, just leave this game.			"

												Possibly one of the best rally racing sims of all time.Codemasters has succesfully brought the Dirt franchise back to the roots that many rally fans want.  This game is pure rally, raw and unforgiving. Graphically the game is very nice and mostly optimized well.   I am running an i54460 with a GTX 960.  This is a modest PC but I can get 50-60 fps with most graphical options set at ultra.  However, Advanced Blending should only be turned on if you have a beast of a pc. I see a significant drop in frame rate when Advanced Blending is enabled.The Physics and controls are very tight and realistic and as you drive the cars you unlock new modifications, from advanced tuning setup to engine upgrades.This game is of course best played with a driving wheel controller, I have a logitech driving force GT that works well with Dirt Rally.  Force Feedback needed a few tweaks but I am happy with the end result.  I also play with an xbox1 controller because I live in a small space with a baby and the wheel makes way too much noise.  This game is still playable and enjoyable with a controller, with many adjustments available for saturation, linearity, and deadzone for steering, throttle, and brakes.The difficulty levels and learning curve are steep compared to previous games in the Dirt series, but with practice you will learn to love the challenge.Part of the difficulty comes from one of my complains about the game.  The pace notes from your co-driver are often too late, sometimes corners are called almost as you are inside the corner.  Other corners are called completely wrong.  I trust Codemaster to fix this issue in the future, but for now it can be very frustrating to wreck because your co-driver called a hairpin right as you are entering the corner.I would also like to see more stages, although the variety within the currently available stages is great enough to keep races from becoming repetative and easily memorized.  Although you will remember a few of the infamous corners and sections in each of the stages.  Beware The Rock Of Greece, perhaps placed there by Atë herself.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who appreciates a serious and challenging driving sim.  If you have been unsatisfied with the past Dirt games, you might be pleasently surprised by Dirt Rally.  Howeverm if you are looking for arcade action, I would not recommend it to you. But, if you still want to have a go, don't be discouraged by the initial difficulty.  You will crash, and you will crash often, but it is part of the learning process that leads to a great feeling when you finally record a clean stage.Recommened to : Hardcore driving sim fans, WRC fans, Masochists.Not recommended to : Casual racing game fans, Impatient people with short tempers.

								Rally is the finest form of racing out there. And Dirt Rally is the best example of fun and serious attempt to simulate it. I don't normally buy early access games but I'm always ready to support good PC games coming from Codemasters (having enjoyed those Colin McRae games in the past).I love the feel of the driving with my T300 wheel. Dirt Rally is fast and quite unforgiving (especially those Rally Cross AI drivers can be real a-holes). It also looks and sounds great (weather variation etc.)I'm building my racing rig for the upcoming HTC Vive or Oculus Rift VR HMDs and I believe the game supports Oculus development kit already at this point. I'm sure they'll have the VR fully supported when the time comes. Highly recommended! "

												This is the best rallying game since Richard Burns Rally and the best Codemasters racing game for some time.Codemasters has made a gem thus far and with it being in early access, I'm sure it'll continue to grow.+ Graphics are very good and you get a great sense of immersive feeling when driving.+ Pacenotes are detailed and thorough. Information overload at times but I love it!+ Sounds are brilliant, though need adjusting to hear the co-driver properly.+ Stages are of good length and decent variety. It's great having longer stages, finally and also Pikes Peak.+ Great controller support. I've been able to fine tune my G27 to how I like it to be.+ Great variety of cars (Group B, Group A, WRC spec and more).+ You can turn the entire HUD off so it's just you, your co-driver and the road.+ Addition of hill climb is another dimension to the game.- Need a button to turn lights on/off.- Cut scenes before the start of the stage I feel are needed. You press continue and you're at the lights if you're ready or not. No time to take a breath before you go.- Pacenotes at times on 'Normal' setting come up too late, meaning you're into the corner your co-driver is describing.Overall, an absolute wonderful game to date. I've never finished a rally game before where I've slapped the wheel with joy after driving through a stage. This game just brings utter joy and will do to anyone who likes racing and/or rallying.

								DiRT Rally is a complete, down-to-earth rally game that doesn't waste your time with cutscenes and stories that often feel out-of-place in racing games. Gorgeous and challenging tracks, classic cars - old and new! - such as the 205 T16, the MINI, the Stratos and the Polo WRC.This is not a game for those who are getting into the genre. DiRT is a pick-up-and-play game with a realistic approach to the genre made to be played with few driving assists and few HUD displays. While it does accept a keyboard as driving input, it is almost mandatory to play it with a steering wheel (or a gamepad, if you're used to them).Graphics and sound are amazing and really add to the atmosphere - you can really tell the difference between an arid, dusty trail and a wet countryside road. Last but not least, the developers are known for their racing games and DiRT has been receiving lots of love and attention. Tons of new tracks and challenges have been added and they're still at it. Definitely worth your money IF you're into serious racing games.Oh, if you want a different approach with more gimmicks and different play styles, stick to its predecessors (like DiRT 3). Great game too.			"

												This is the best rallying game since Richard Burns Rally and the best Codemasters racing game for some time.Codemasters has made a gem thus far and with it being in early access, I'm sure it'll continue to grow.+ Graphics are very good and you get a great sense of immersive feeling when driving.+ Pacenotes are detailed and thorough. Information overload at times but I love it!+ Sounds are brilliant, though need adjusting to hear the co-driver properly.+ Stages are of good length and decent variety. It's great having longer stages, finally and also Pikes Peak.+ Great controller support. I've been able to fine tune my G27 to how I like it to be.+ Great variety of cars (Group B, Group A, WRC spec and more).+ You can turn the entire HUD off so it's just you, your co-driver and the road.+ Addition of hill climb is another dimension to the game.- Need a button to turn lights on/off.- Cut scenes before the start of the stage I feel are needed. You press continue and you're at the lights if you're ready or not. No time to take a breath before you go.- Pacenotes at times on 'Normal' setting come up too late, meaning you're into the corner your co-driver is describing.Overall, an absolute wonderful game to date. I've never finished a rally game before where I've slapped the wheel with joy after driving through a stage. This game just brings utter joy and will do to anyone who likes racing and/or rallying.

								Simply put: best Rally sim far and wide even though still in early access; Yet the devs are working quite hard on improving, enhancing, debugging, expanding (unlike those of many other ""eternal early access"" games). A good wheel with FF (and ideally with H-shifter, as the support is perfect even now and is being polished gradually) is a MUST to enjoy the game fully, if you intend to play it with keyboard, just please don't. Also, I'd like to stress how important a wheel controller for playing this game, much more than any other racing game I've played so far.And a word of advice - if you intend to play this game with keyboard or gamepad, don't you dare to post a neg review. -KTHXBYE			"

												Game Score: 9/10*Dare to take on the racing version of Dark Souls 3 ?Dirt rally is easy to play but mastering every corners is brutally hard. The game is very unforgiving as a tiny mistake from the driver could send the car off the cliff or could put you into the last place in the race. Getting to the 1st place in the race is a challenge to many new players and it takes more than a few hours to master the basics without ramming your car into a bunch of onlookers. The maps in the game is amazing. They are beautifully designed. for instance the woods looks very vibrant and detailed.  Maps like hills, race track, snow are some of the general maps that you will be able to play in the campaign mode. The physics in the game is mind blowing too, too much brake could distribute the weight into the frontal part of the car causing it to oversteer while too little could flip your car when your making a sharp turn. Did i not mention how amazing the graphics is. The game has beautiful graphics that makes driving in first person an enjoyable experience. As far as i have played, the game runs pretty good on the pc and i am able to run everything at ultra settings smoothly.All in all, a beautiful game designed with love and care and by far it is one of the best game from codemasters. However there's only one thing that can be improved which many would agree with me. It is to give the players more multiplayer contents. The multiplayer that they have in the game is quite dead.			"

												Best Rally game of all time. Edge of seat and stuff which requires great concentration but leaves you feeling very satisfied after any form of clean run.Try it with all assists off for the best experience and you will soon realise all of the vehicles are modelled differently dependant on their drivetrain (4WD, RWD, FWD etc). This massively affects your style of rallying in them and each car requires care to be driven correctly and within, or maybe sometimes just exceeding, its own limits.Absolutely love playing this and will be returning back to it for many years to come.

Thx Codemasters, after Grid 2 and DiRT 3 I thought you actally going down, now I can sleep with thoughts that you still CAN do something right if you actually want it. Repeat, 10/10.			"

												Best Rally game of all time. Edge of seat and stuff which requires great concentration but leaves you feeling very satisfied after any form of clean run.Try it with all assists off for the best experience and you will soon realise all of the vehicles are modelled differently dependant on their drivetrain (4WD, RWD, FWD etc). This massively affects your style of rallying in them and each car requires care to be driven correctly and within, or maybe sometimes just exceeding, its own limits.Absolutely love playing this and will be returning back to it for many years to come.

												Tarmac, Dirt, Mud, Sand, Water, Snow, and Ice. On all of these surfaces you will crash. You will flip your car. You will end up with broken wheels. At the end of the stage though (if you get there) the feeling of satisfaction is unmached in many other games and with each finish you'll want to push harder and harder going faster and faster, then you'll hit a tree. This is DiRT Rally, the single best modern rally game.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the Rally title you've been waiting for if you were a diehard fan of the Colin McRae titles of the early to mid '00s. Aside from a few complaints which I would really like to see addressed before early access is over, it's looking great.The driving physics are really good. No wacky pivoting slot cars here. Even though this is still early access, it feels like the physics model is well polished and top notch already. Stages are longer and also excellent- there are deceptive turns and blind twists that will get you crossed up if you're not paying attention to your codriver.The competition is brutally difficult, and that's a good thing. You actually feel a sense of accomplishment as you claw your way to a podium finish. Also, aside from the unicorn ""that guy"" who always seems to finish 1st, there's actually some variation to the AI drivers and how they finish in the race. You won't look at a series result and see the second place driver going 2-2-2-2, third place driver going 3-3-3-3, fourth going 4-4-4-4, and so on. It's believable. It's immersing. It also means that you can do very well in championships by being consistent and reliable.My biggest complaint would have to be the damage model being thoroughly unremarkable and extremely forgiving. What happened to what we had back in Colin McRae 04 and 05? Windows cracking and shattering on brutal landings, exhaust and bumpers dragging before falling off, sagging suspensions, groaning and screeching brakes, stalling motors... that really made the damage (and danger) feel visceral. Rough gravel rallies like Greece were punishing affairs. Also, in one of the earlier CMR titles you could look at the damage in the repair area, which was a nice touch!The new damage model feels like a drastic step backward, it's just mesh deformation that lets you get away with too much. For instance, on one of the tarmac rallies I came in way too hot on a turn, locked the wheels, understeered, and ate a concrete block hard. The radiator damage indicator lit up, but no smoke, no annihilated (missing) front bumper, no suspension or steering issues. I finished the stage without further issue- radiator damage level: 80%. What should have ended my rally or at least severely crippled the car didn't take more than 20% of the durability off of the most damaged system.With that said, though, it's still an outstanding rally title and worth getting in on early access.

												Bravo Codemasters! honestly I waited for such rally game for years and finally it is here. Beautiful graphics, excellent sounds, cool music and fantastic racing with hard level of difficulty which push you to drive all the time to the limit, with maximum focus. Many thanks to put classic rally with hill climb and rally cross together.  I recommend to everybody who love racing especially rally, who loves fun with rally cross and for perfectionists there is hill climb. Everyone will find the challenge but only few drivers will rule them all :-)			"

												Having played for a solid 165 hours I can honestly say this is hands down the best rally game to date. A fantastic physics model and beautiful graphics makes this a game I can't keep away from. Daily, weekly and monthly community challenges keep the game interesting and adds endless replay value. Negatives include: hard with a controller (wheel recommended), no sign of future dlc, no ghosts to chase. A must buy for any Rally fan, highly recommend!			"

												Only played about 10 hours but I will play more I swear. This is the best racing game ever. It's harder to ♥♥♥♥ing play this game than drive in real life and I completed the kessel run in under 9 parsecs. Sure you start off with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mini-cooper but if you play this game on manual (I play with drift assist and its still hard as balls, you play without it you have to basically go backwards into a turn to drift properly like a real pro and it's hard, you have to also spin your wheels the other way before its too late, but drift assist makes it easier) and I can barely place ♥♥♥♥ing 5th. It's still very rewarding. I do not suggest you play this game on ez mode its not fun that way, the fun is in all the shifting/drifting.EDIT: I want to clarify for those who might be looking at negative reviews, just a few things that's wrong with some of them:1. I'm not sure about the incompatibility issue, that could be very real, but not for me.2. 1st to R does not take 10 seconds, you instantly shift. But if you do not BRAKE and come to a FULL STOP while giving gas in reverse first, your tires will spin and it will take longer to reverse.3. It's incredibly realistic, how people are saying it does not simulate a rally racer right obviously haven't been in a real rally race. I imagine these people are holding down e-brake controls or giving too much gas and keep wiping out which is what would happen in IRL. The trick is to do small presses and to adjust in small increments. It involved a lot of finger movements on a controller so if you're a lazy gamer who does not like skill based controls much, this game is not for you.4. The amount of content is unlimited, it's workshop supported.5. I'm not sucking♥♥♥♥♥♥to this game, just proving some negative reviews who obviously don't know what they're talking about wrong.			"

												I should probably review this, huh, after almost 50 hours?This game turned out to be everything I wanted out of a racing game.  I haven't really touched racers over the past decade - I guess Need for Speed: High Stakes and 4x4 Evolution 2 were the last games I played in a big way, and though are hardly sim racers.I've had so much fun clawing my way from being total crap at this game, to being an average racer in the online Daily/Weekly/Monthly events (I'm going for my first top tier finish in this week's monthly event!  Here's hoping I don't blow a tire in the coming week's races).  The focus, patience, and ability to remain calm that this game requires are what bring about those frustrating moments when you blow a race right out of the gate with a bad first turn, the heartbreaking moments when your co-driver is calling ""turn right 3 to finish"" and you botch the last corner, and those amazing triumphant moments, when you get into a racing zen and put together a clean stage in the no-restarts community Daily event.I keep coming back every day to pit myself against the community, even though I know that I'll never be on the top 10 leaderboard for all the world to see.  It's still immensely satisfying to go from 25th percentile, to 50th, to 70th, trying to improve just a little bit each time I log on.  If you think you might enjoy holding on for dear life as you rocket a rally car along icy roads in Monaco and off massive jumps in Finland, and you don't mind if the game kicks your♥♥♥♥♥for a bit, I highly recommend DiRT: Rally			"

								Dirt Rally is a proper rally sim but there are some issues that need to be addressed before it can call itself 'finished' which aren't just related to content - and there's some stuff you should be aware of if you play with a gamepad rather than a wheel.ProsLooks fine to my eyesCars are varied and attention to detail (esp on interiors) is lovelyStages are based on (mostly) real locations and very detailed/realisticOnline stuff is handled well with Leagues/Challenges etc. already availableNew content is coming regularlyConsWhilst the cars have a detailed damage model, it's not used well Most accidents being either  'cosmetic damage' or 'you killed your car'  - the 'Reset to Track' allows people to cheat to avoid damage anyway - driving off-a-cliff oftens produces no damage at all but snowdrifts kill it completely (are they car-nivourous!?!? :) )Cars handle differently but as a pad user that means I'm having to change my pad settings for every car!Even sometimes for the same car on different surfaces.  I don't mind doing this - but they're not saved so I'm having to write them down (it's like 1985 again, I'll be doing handwritten pace-notes and a map next!!)Tarmac grip/handling isn't really there yet - esp when it rains Right now, wet tarmac is Rallying-on-Ice - albsolutely impossible with a pad at this point - but dry tarmac is MUCH better than it was in the earlier patch so *fingers crossed* "

Early Access Review
DiRT is back, and better than ever!12hrs played and I haven't owned the game for 2 days yet. I can't stop playing. This game is a masterpiece even in it's unfinished form.Ever since the day Codemaster released ColinMcRae Rally 3 I've loved the series. Recently they moved from a more serious all out rally feeling to a more ""arcadish"" offroad racing game. DiRT Showdown was in my opinion, a terrible game. They hit rock bottom there and there's many reasons I think so (which I will not write about here). I played DiRT 3 alot and I think it was overall a very enjoyable game. I also like the fact that there was many different types of racing. However, the longer this series has been going on, the more they have moved away from what it started with. I'm not saying eveything always has to be the same, but if you change something, you want it to be better - or atleast as good, right? I think their series went downhill efter DiRT 2. Not unplayable, but worse. Showdown became the final stand. I thought ""I guess the DiRT days are over..."". Then, without any advertising or news about it, a friend said they have a new game called DiRT Rally, so, with hope that Codemasters would better themselves and produce a game not just based around Ken Block and doing donuts infront of a crowd, I purchasd it *nervosity intesified*.Was I shocked... Yes I was. We hear about how ""graphics is not as important as gameplay"", ""graphics doesn't matter"" all the time here on the internet. While it is true that a game, with only good graphics but no fullfilling content, is not a good game, you have to undertand that graphics does enhance the gameexperience for most people. However, I am sure I could play this game without any graphics at all. Because the physics are right there. I have never in my life played a rally game that is this hard to master. Seriously, it is so hard. Realistic? Perhaps. I think it feels vrey much right on all surfaces except asphalt (which in the game can be played in Monaco). You may not agree, but I don't really think that the physics are correct there or it's just me having a really hard time understanding it. Overall, the physics are amazing and the game is definately worth you money if you want to play a realistic rally game. It's very very hard and don't even think about playing it with a keyboard.I first played with my keyboard and it was impossible. Then I went on to hooking up my G27 wheel. It didn't feel right. After that I plugged in my Xbox 360 controller. Just right. For me the controller is the easiest but I think it's all about preference. Don't bother with the keyboard thought, just don't. In the game you have a variety of cars to choose from. They are not very many, but sufficient enough to keep my occupied for now as every car needs to be driven differently and every car handles very different. The Championship mode is ver short and doesn't really feel like a complete championship but I'm sure it's going to be more later (atleast I hope so). Now they will also be adding Hillclimb racing, which I am very exited about. To end this review, I'd like to add a list of things I'd like to see in the game. I believe this game all the potential to become awesome and maybe even the best rally game I ever played but it need alot more content. Since it's only on Early Access though, I believe there will be more. Here's my list:  Bigger Championship mode  More stages  More cars  Changes asphalt physics  More types of racing like hillclimb, rallycross, and so on. Don't be afraid to look too much like DiRT 3 in that aspect. We still have the amazing physicsengine and no Ken Block. I'm just asking for more diciplines.  Trucks in hillclimb :)  Championship in every dicipline  Animation of people fixing the car between stages like in ColinMcRae Rally 3.  Rally Championships having 1v1 superstage at the end.[/u]No hate, just my thoughts.[/u]Wonderful game, good graphics, incredible physics. The potential for this one is HUGE. "

								Thoroughly enjoying this game even though it's EA it's got great content with more on the horizon. Runs perfectly at solid 60+FPS at 1440p on my system (i7 @4.2ghz, 970GTX, 16gb RAM) which is brilliant. Gameplay is a bit tricky to learn with a gamepad but once you get the hang of it it's superb fun and hugely rewarding.The community is brilliant also, very competitive but all very polite and eager to dish out tips and beat each others time. The online league daily event is a great way to see how you fair up against the competition.I personally much prefer this to Project Cars, not that PC is a bad game but this is much more entertaining and runs better, even though it's early access I haven't had even one crash or freeze. There is something brilliantly exciting about hooning a Group B quattro through a Welsh forest at night at 200kph.			"

								What can I say? I've been playing racing games since I was quite young, and racing sims when I figured out there was more to life. My vast experience could not prepare me for the beauty that is driving the rally cars in this game.You go from a rally championship in a car that I wouldn't personally want to rally to turbocharged, AWD monsters where, when the boost kicks in, you definitely have to compensate for it while you're going full drift monkey around that late apex, don't cut, dip, bump 2, because if you don't, you'll end up saying ""hi"" to the treeline. The video detail on maximum settings is beautiful, and the car details are amazing. The damage is about as spot on as it can get without being ""unfair."" If you're looking for something that will make your heart race and once in a while, give you a good ""pucker moment"", this game is it. Codemasters' updates are genuinely helping this game take steps, but I'd be happy if the only thing they added from now on were more cars. It truly feels complete to me, but I won't argue with progress. Buy it. Don't wait until they say it is finished. Get it now and enjoy the mountains of progress being made!			"

								Only true Automotive Enthusiasts will Truly enjoy this, it is hardcore. WOW Codemasters, you have made the only other racing game I can actually enjoy. Just WOW, I dont even know what else I could ask for in this game (Except an E36 M3 ;)My advice play with ALL ASSISTS OFF, HELMET CAM AND NO HUD. That is exactly how it is truly meant to be played, what a masterpiece this is coming to be. Great job I cannot stress that enough.  BTW I waited untill you fixed the handling on the RWD cars before I could say this. Im damn impressed at the level of improvement in realism and handling with all RWD cars. Forget every other racing game on Steam Gearheads this is the one. (If by some miracle we got Forza on PC this would be tied with it)  Why care what I have to say? Well I come from a family of proffesional racing, and am one of the biggest Car fiends youll ever meet plus I have a bit of a career in the industry to say the least. When it comes to games Realism is my  #1, thats a tough one for racing games especially and this does it almost too well.			"

Gameplay and ControlsGameplayThe gameplay is awsome, it has to be rally in the most purest form out there at the moment. It really hasa fast paced feeling to it no matter what car your driving. That being said the learning curve is super steap.You have to invest some time to get trough a really without loosing either quite some time or the shape of the car.But if you do! Man, hitting a corner at perfect speed in the perfect angle feels so rewarding and makes you forget thenumerous of crashes you had in that corner to get it right. But don't loose your cool because the next set of turns are justas important :-)The ammount of cars is more than okay. And in the midst of all of them are some really iconic rally cars. Plus cars get addedover time so not much to complain about that. And you dont swap cars every race as you really need to get a feel for the caryou plan on driving.And with the cars comes great finetuning. with explanation for those who dont know all to much about the in depth jitter jatterof cartuning.It's nothing more then a racing gaming in its purest form. Don't expect more from it. It's nothing fancy just 100% cars an roads.And for me thats a good thing. I really really enjoy this title.ControlsI can be verry quick about this. Keep in mind its not a fact I'm stating just the way I think about it.Steering wheel: Awsome!Controller (xbox360 for me): Awsome!Keyboard: NO! Grmbl!#@!Graphics and AudioGraphicsThe graphic options are fine. You can tweak enough settings to you likings though its not the best. It has to be said it runssmooth as the system requirements are not really all that demanding.But man oh man, this game surely is a beauty. The scenery and details of the cars are pretty amazing. I know its not the newestengine in the world they used but they surely squeezed all of the juice out of the old one.There is one world that sums it all up wich is: StunningAudioThe audio in this game is far above good. All of it!(okay, all that really matters)The sound of the roaring engines, the gravel shooting op agains the bottem of the car,the co-driver giving the instructions. The co-driver even pauzes if you hit a bump hard or get airborne.The only thing wich didnt bother me to much is that the music in the game is minimal. It's by no means bad, just not memorable.			"

								It's probably the closest thing we've got to the original Colin McRae, in regards to simulating rally [not just in the car handling, but in the actual race logistics; repairing damage in between stages, getting a decent crew who can repair more damage between stages etc].The stages are very long, and very challenging with lots of different road conditions to keep you on your game. Car handling will take a lot of getting used to if you are only used to Dirt, and even if not they still take a lot of concentration and planning ahead to drive them fast and not wreck horribly. The sound is top notch. What I was most surprised by was how good the video performance is. You can tell it has been optimised very well for PC. My system isn't exactly new by any means [Phenom II 940 @ 3.5GHz, Radeon 6970 @ 950MHz, 16GB RAM], yet I can run it comfortably with almost everything on Ultra settings @ 1080p. Framerate is around 60fps most of the time, and drops no lower than 40's from time to time. Very impressed!Overall, it's a pure rally game. All of the time and effort has gone into the rally experience, and it really shows. Would recommend if you are looking for a more hardcore rallying game.I will say to take some time to play around with the controls, however. In particular, when I started playing I felt a real disconnect between my control inputs [gamepad] and the car. What I found to be the cause was the 'Linearity' option under advanced gamepad options. Setting it to 100% fixed it right up, mapping my steering input 1:1 with the actual steering input.			"

												Quite possibly the greatest racing game I've ever played.  The physics are brutally realistic, leaving you pretty frustrated, but at the same time challenged to come back an improve yourself.  The graphics are incredible even on lesser powered systems, and super well optimized.For the best experience, get yourself a decent wheel, and then the game really comes alive.  All the cars feel unique, and handle vastly differently depending if they are FWD, RWD or AWD.  The one criticism is that it needs more RallyCross stages, but beyond that, it's bloody amazing!!			"

												If you are a fan of cars...no if you are a fan of racing cars on difficult terrain that will annihilate your senses and constantly punish you over and over again then this is the game for you!  One of the hardest simulated racing games I've ever played, DiRT RALLY takes the cakse for the most intense and most beautiful sprint games out there.  You will consistently lose over and over and over again but with each loss you will be rewarded with a lesson in car handling.This game is not for the faint of heart.  It will make you scream at your screen, bash your racing wheel, controller, or keyboard (God help you), and it might even deter you from ever wanting to drive a vehicle again.

												Now that the game's out of early access, I can safely say that this is one of best racers I've played in a long time.My only gripe is that the game doesn't have enough rally stages. There's two to three routes in each country with a few variations. However, the driving alone has this amazing combination of challenge and fun. Also, the sound design is some of the best I've heard.After Grid 2, I thought Codies lost their touch, but Dirt Rally has proved me wrong. This is definitely one of their best games, and they handled early access greatly. So I hope they do the same again with their next title.			"

								This is one heck of a fine game. I like the fact that it is more sim than arcade.My first couple of hours resulted in me not being able to put it down.Positives:- Excellent physics- Harks back to the days of CMR & RBR- While the graphics aren't of the highest standards, they are perfectly service-able. They are however really immersive.- When you simply want to beat your time, and just get a kick out of being able to complete a stage without crashing, you know they've done something really wonderful.- The sound is jaw-dropping - you hear everything- The pace-notes add so much to the game; tone changes as you speed up or go over bumps - it's so immersive- For an Early Access game, I cannot believe how polished it is.- Codemasters have a roadmap for this game, and if you invest now, you'll receive all the updates free - AWESOME!What were Negatives (have been fixed now)- Force feedback - It's so much better now; it feels great - in fact...* AC is good, but this is just as good now- Support for my Thrustmaster gear stick - This is supported now- No support for a clutch - This is supported nowNow I don't have any negative comments. Simply one of the best Racing games EVER! The best rally game for sure.			"

								As a person who has gone to rally school and races cars, I find it difficult to find racing games that parallel my interest and skill level. Dirt Rally looks good, sound great, feels amazing, and actually improves your driving ability. Each type of event requires different strategies, maneuvering, and timing. Quite frankly going from rally events to a PVP rallycross race can be frustrating as hell, because it's hard to adjust and there isn't room for error. Yet that is what makes this game great, they said enough with the casual 'rewind' racing games, and instead brought forward a gritty, toned beast. A game that makes you look at real rally drivers and finally say 'wow'. I can't get enough, even when I'm swearing and white knuckled on my G27 steering wheel, I keep coming back for more. I should say that unless you have a steering wheel/pedals setup this game might be a bit intensive, but hell, this game alone warrants buying a simulator setup. Puts other racing games to shame, and I couldn't recommend it more.			"

								After years of waiting for a new rally sim/game with better graphics/new engine over RBR, I'm happy that this has come around. Easily the best rally sim I've played, and well worth the price asked for. Just as hard as RBR, but with much better graphics. The only thing I think it really needs, is modding support. Modded stages and cars are what kept RBR alive, and I feel that it will keep this alive longer too if it's added.Also, the Flying Finland update is the most fun I've had in ages. Yes, the stages are slightly incorrect in parts (the jumps are too much IMO, either they got the jumps/bumps/crests themselves wrong or the car weight needs to be adjusted), but it's still great fun. 10/10, can't wait for the Modern Masters release!

												Hi all.First of all, REALY BIG THANK YOU for Codemasters that finaly you have made not easy, demanding game, with long stages and where you feel that you drive a CAR and not a CARTON BOX, whre during driving with all assists off in cockpit with steering wheel, I have to adjust the gas power on corners to not sleep the wheels so much. Very often I have to drive with 50-70% of the max power of vehicle and it depends on the surface, THAT'S IT. After autosport I have lost hope that Codemaster can do a good, hard, demanding, model of driving. My favorite games were TOCA 2, TOCA Race Driver 3(gravel traps option MUST BE ON), CMR2, CMR 2004 because of not bad driving phisics. And after 12 years of waiting finaly I have something on good level. For me the game could be even more difficult. I have made a suggestion here;http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/39704/hard-core-colisions-and-vehicle-damage-pay-for-all-from-cr-like-in-real#latestFor future, I am waiting for something on closed asphalt raceways with turning cars from Codemasters. Something like TOCA 2 and Race Driver 3(gravel traps ON) where you had to drive 200laps to learn how to handle the vehicle and all holes on road, next 100 laps for create car setup with telemetry. Such a games I love.Congratulations for DIRT RALLY team and driving phisics programers, model realy is not bad. Thats it!!! (finaly somebody has added 9,81ms^2 :D)			"

								Had to rewrite this as since development has continued my comments are resolved. It rifts, it ffbs, it just rocks. The finland update is just insanely fast and the handling now its off the chart. new scooby rocks, ffb rocks, pikes peak is great, i still dont like monaco or germany too much but thats only because the tarmac physics are not quite right, once you get on gravel or mud its just sublime.9/10 and only dropping that one point for tarmac. Insanely good game and far and away the best dirt game ever made. in fact its not a dirt game. its far better :)			"

I do wish the damage was more sensitive and realistic, but that's really my only complaint. I love how challenging the rally and hillclimb stages are, and the rallycross is extremely fun. This is one of the few racing games that actually puts me on the edge of my seat. If you like rally racing and challenging gameplay, I would highly recommend this.			"

All this was ruined in one ""stability"" patch. Codemasters can prove us all wrong in giving support for VIVE one way or another. Otherwise I and many others interested in newest VR technology have to seriously look for other rally brands.

												Great game. Perfect for VR simpod enthusiasts... If you have a Rift... otherwise you will need to use Revive to get your Vive to work with it since apparently the devs are more interested in getting a Linux version up and running rather then getting the largest VR market share HMD to be compatible natively. Nothing against Linux gamers as I myself have a seperate Linux machine but it just seems odd that the devs could careless about other HMDs let alone Vive or OSVR.But don't let that detract from a solid rally car game that is just as fun to play on standard setups. Even if you don't have an HMD but are looking for a good racing/rally game then pick this one up.			"

								This is hardcore.AND THIS IS IT!  The BEST rally game i've ever played!!  And now it's EASILY in my top 5 car games.  (next to Trackmania Canyon and others)  They really dug into the ROOTS of old Colin McRae.  THE ROOTS BEFORE DiRT.  R.I.P. He would be PROUD of this game.Codemasters asked, ""What do people want to see in the next DiRT game?""  I said, ""RALLY.  Strictly rally.  Stages.  Repair.  Heavy cars and damage that makes me want to cry."" They delivered everything I could ask for.  I even said, maye consider Hillclimbs.  And what do i see on the main menu...  ""HILLCLIMBS coming soon.""    They really listen to their fans.  BEAUTIFUL expanses of trees like no other game.  Day Rain, Night Rain.  Reverse. (so many variations)  DAMAGE that you KNOW you'll pay for in later stages.  Possibly lose a tire and still try to get to the finish line.  I love it.  NO REWIND.  You can restart for a cost.  EVERY single mistake has a COST.  (i love that)Dash cam is brilliant.PHENOMINAL sound effects.It even supports OCULUS RIFT VR, and detects it automatically.  In Rift, I look up and see a Quadcopter chasing my car!   ALL of the gauges in the cars interior work.Daily, Weekly and Monthly challenges.This is only the beginning, much more to come.  5/5  Bravo Codemasters!			"

								Sure, I'm only half an hour in but here's the inside scoop from my upcoming review for GoN of DiRT Rally. This is Codies' finest driving game to date of all their franchises and the best rally sim since RBR. It's immediately just that obvious.My suggestion would be to turn your HUD off and listen to the, for once realistic, co-driver voice-over... you'll never have concentrated this hard in a racing sim before.It's still early access so while content is lacking, you'll be too hard-pressed polishing your laptimes and trying to keep your car off its roof to care. FFB on the G25 is somewhat lacking although that may be a settings problem at my end... I can feel what they're trying to transmit through the wheel (primarly counter-steering and the sense of grip as dirt grabs your front wheels) but it's a little lacking so far.Absolutely stunned by this, had no idea it even existed. Just wow.			"

Each car feels special so far, and they take time to learn, by heart.There is an extensive damage model, even though the damage doesn't look very convincing on the car itself, it really impacts performance.The game is not perfect however. Graphics are good, if you don't stare. The fullscreen bug is back from Dirt 3, even worse this time, and I could have used a few more options regarding difficulty, even though it is cearly aimed towards the Sim driver.Driveable with a controler.Final note: A-Keep going that way, Codemasters!

								After only a few minutes of play the sound of ""vehicle damage"" i presume it was,  just was so annoying i couldn't play anymore.  A volume control for this would be nice.   Game has got promise, looks ok, physics not quite , (codies plz don't do us another autosport lump of mud, yes we like realistic physics but not so realistic that driving becomes a chore). This is a video game.  If it's not fun...they will not come. E-brake needs lots of work (unpredictable,inconsistent) and it seems like the width of the roads are not proportional to the size of the vehicle. This must be correct before any physics model will work ...i would think.  Otherwise the game seems pretty good. Is this dirt 4 with a new name or can we still look forward to a dirt 4 release??   In my opinion codies driving games are far superior to all others by a long shot and for that codies....you get lots-o-luv.   Thanks for the excellent work.			"

								Brilliant game, excellent simulation, stunning graphics and really good performance already and its only Early Access. The devs are active and seem really open to ideas and feedback plus you've got the assurance that its definitely going to be finished as its Code masters.Gameplay is stunning, driving is really smooth and fluid, physics are great and the courses are really good too, very much like real life courses (might even be real?).By far the best thing is the damage simulation, to see the body parts warping and twisting is crazy but beyond that you can smash windows, break wheel hubs, puncture tyres and damage countless other parts of your vehicle.Sure it has its issues, occasional graphical glitches, the car recovery system needs work and there's other tiny niggles but nothing you wouldn't expect in a EA game, to be frank in its current state it better than most recent AAA releases.Its worth noting a lot of wheel users are reporting some minor issues with things like wheel syncing and FFB but again CM are active on the discussion hub asking for reports and feedback to nail it down properly.This is going to turn into a great game, if you like driving and/or rally sims then you should buy this now while its cheap.

												Looking for a realistic rally game? Buy DiRT Rally, a truly great rally sim!This game is difficult, and I would personally say that if you do not have a decent wheel, do not buy this game, as it is so much fun with a wheel and you wouldn't drive a real rally car with a keyboard, would you? If you don't want to get a wheel, then... get a more arcade rally game I guess, like the older DiRT games.||| What does this game do well?+ Handling: It is difficult to drive fast in this game without messing your run up, or without crashing. You need to spend some time getting used to driving a rally car in this game. This is not an arcade rally game unlike the other DiRT games. When you finally get the hang of it, then its a whole new world. The feeling of getting through a corner sideways, and fast, in a rally car without hitting something and without losing control: its so amazing, but kinda difficult (depending on car and surface). But is all the hours of practice worth it in the end? Yes, no doubt!+ Cars: Good selection of cars, and they feel different. Really feels like they have put some time into each car. Sound are also very nice.+ Stages: Some say they are a bit too wide, which makes it easier to drive fast as you got more room to mess it up in, instead of just going straight into a tree, but those are mostly people that are really good at the game and that can drive extremely fast and controlled. Trust me, this game will challenge you.+ Realism: Each stage/track has different surfaces, and you will feel a difference. Its for example more than one type of gravel, and in Finland I personally (with the cars I have driven there) feel that I got more grip and more control of the car, but if I try the Welsh stages I feel like its a lot easier to go sideways and lose control of the car.+ Enviroment: Night stages, rain and snow makes the stages very fun. + Different types of rally: You got more than just ""classic rally"" (rally stages), you can also drive Rallycross which is laps on short tracks with mixed surface and it includes the event structure (heats, semi-finals and finals). So you can learn the tracks as there isnt that many corners and be really fast. You also got hillclimb with the famous Pikes Peak which is really fun and difficult.||| What could be improved?- Stages: More stages would make it a lot more fun. If you play the career mode you will basically go through the same stages over and over again, just in different cars, so its easy to get a little bit tired after many, many hours into the game, but the different cars makes the stages interesting, so you'll probably keep playing if you like rally driving. And as mentioned, night versions of the stages and snow/rain will give you variations.- Making the game run better, optimizing: I will admit that I am using an older GPU, so I understand that I can't play the game at max graphic settings, but the long stages really needs more optimizing if that is possible with the game engine. With my current settings I get steady FPS and nice visuals at the sprint stages and the long stages, but Pikes Peak, which is really long, really struggles. But it is a game by Codemasters, so what did you expect?  The game will run very well on more recent GPU's, so if you got a good GPU from the Nvidia 600-series or newer you should be able to play it at medium/high graphic settings and get a good and steady FPS. Always make sure to keep your drivers up to date!Edit: I am now using a new PC and the game runs fine. My old PC was low-end (Nvidia GTX 550 Ti 1 Gb) and around 5 years old, so most people will probably have no problems running this.- Force Feedback: The FFB is far from bad, but just like other Codemaster racing games the FFB isn't as good as I would like it to be in a sim. Its good enough to give me feedback about what the car is doing, how it is responding to the surface, but I think it needs some improving.Edit: I am not using a expensive wheel that has impressive FFB, but my wheel is far from bad. I have not researched this a lot, but as far as I know the wheel I am using is using a more simple design to deliver the force feedback, so DiRT Rally might not be optimized for this kind of wheel. I am using a Logitech DFGT. But just to repeat it: the FFB is NOT bad, but I would like to see some improvements.EDIT 08/4/2016: Codemasters really cares about this game. Continues updates adding new content and fixing bugs are amazing. A few days ago lots of new cars were added for free, thanks Codemasters!||| Overall score: This is a really fun rally sim, yes I'm calling it a sim even though some claim it is not a sim.It gives you plenty of challenges. Would like to see some improvements, but at the time of writing this review it is pretty good. 9/10			"

												DiRT Rally, the part where you actually drive the car is pretty fun. What completely ruins this game for me is the incredibly poor flow of the game. The way the menus are setup and the fun killing flow of the way you start (and restart and restart) a race when you really just want to practice or make a setup, in a word, stinks. It seems like every time I start to play this game I spend more than half my time staring at menus and restarting rallies. Every time I log off due to boredom, wanting just to run the trails without all the hassle. I have hundreds of hours into my other sims, like Assetto Corsa and iRacing but this one falls short in the fun category and scores very high in the annoyance category. Also, you have to earn absurd amounts to actually purchase the cars before you can use them in an official rally, so expect to waste a lot of hours just getting the cars that you already paid for but can't drive...Then you have to drive each car to get all the upgrades to be competitive. Sorry, but huge fail.Ultimately, after a year of ownership I have just 60+ hours into DiRT Rally.   "

								I have always loved racing games, and the original Colin McRae Rally was one of my absolute favorites. This is the first game since the original that has given me the same thrill of pure rally racing. I have played and enjoyed all of the Dirt games, but I always prefer pure rally, and have been hankering for a game that captures the spirit. Codemasters have finally delivered the absolute perfect rally game. It wasn't easy to get in to, but it certainly rewards patience and determination. I haven't mastered it yet, but I want to reset my career and start again, maybe placing better each time. Not many games deserve replay, but this one definitely does. I can't wait to see what the finished product looks like. The graphics are the most realistic I have ever seen. Can you tell how much I loved this game?			"

												I'm not one to be ""driven"" to review games unless I disliked it; but in this case I have to say something as I spend hours on Racing titles of all genres and platforms:I haven't been this impressed and excited by a new racing game since Colin Mcrae 2 on my long dead PSX.It's a brutal hard work experience that leaves your wheel hot and your arms exhausted.A super positive return to serious Rallying from Codemasters with no fluffy popcorn events, superfluous animations or annoying monologues from vain and expensive celebraties.Setting up your car has become a far more personal and technical task but the differences to the performance on track are distinctly noticable.I could go on but I need to go race...P.S. I'm speechless... It seems there is NO online Rallying. Just Rallycross!How... Why?			"

								Addicted to all kinds of Moto/MX & especially realistic car simulators I was, and still am, a huge fan of the Colin McRay 2005 and the there-up following Dirt rally games. But as of Dirt 3 I kept sitting on my hunger!! Still nice, but not realistic enough. When Dirt Showdown came out I really thought that the good days of this great series were bygones.Until NOW!!! DIRT Rally is totally up there and is realistic as it is difficult! Some people might find that it is maybe to difficult but that is what simulators are about! Tweaking the car also makes huge differences and driving without any assist and a clear HUD makes the experience even that more awesome!!For me this is a no-brainer: 10/10 even in Early Access!!!

												If you want a rally game look no further!I absolutely love this game. It's so refreshing to play a game that just simply works. Like back in the day when you had a ps2 and just put the game in and never worried about bugs or glitches or crashes. This game is so well optimized that I tried downsampling from 4k (I only have a 1080p monitor) on my gtx 970 and with the high graphics preset I had a solid 60 fps. I'm amazed I can run this game at 4k with high settings on a single 970 at 60 fps. This game runs beautifully and it just looks amazing. Now onto the game itself I also love what is has to offer. I'm not a hardcore racing sim fan so I can't give too much input on the realism but to me it's perfect. It could probably be a little more realistic with the brake control but other than that the cars feel responsive and the amount of traction feels right for whatever terrain you're on. It has the perfect amount of challenge and learning curve in my opinion. The co-driver call outs are great and you absolutely must pay attention and listen to them or you'll end up flying off the track. I feel there could be a bit more tracks though as I was a little surprised when it came out of Early Access but there's a fair amount. I wouldn't say the game is lacking in content but I can't say there's a ton either. There's I think 6 different main rally courses in seperate countries and within each of those 6 there are 12 or so different sections to play. That may sound like a ton but tose 12 include backwards versions of the same tracks and larger sections that just connects 2 smaller tracks. All of the courses look really good though and they all feel different and like a real course.But as for cars there are plenty to choose from. I'm no rally expert but to me most any kind of popular rally car out there is in the game. And the sound of the cars is incredible. I can't get over the sound of the cars. Everything just sounds so right, the engines bounce off the limiter and they pop on decel and it just sounds amazing. I love the sounds. Can't really describe them so you'll just have to get the game and find out!Also a side note I love the crowds in this game. Usually in racing games they'll just copy and paste 2d or really horrible 3d people around the track that look OK if you fly by them but look god awful up close. In Dirt Rally though the crowd is actually made up of greatly modeled 3d characters that are actually highly varied in appearance and they all aren't doing the same 3 stupid annimations. Just a small side note but that's always a pet peeve of mine is when they skimp on crowds but here they look great, even up close!All in all this game is a must if you like rally or any kind of off road racing!

								This truly is the best rally game since Richard Burns Rally. The cars feel very real to drive, and the sounds and graphics are also very impressive. My current graphics card struggles to run the game on Ultra though, but I do it anyways, since it looks so good on Ultra. I run it on Ultra with my Gtx 560 Ti 2GB, and fps differs in each stage, but it's mostly about 30 fps or so. I drive in cockpit view, using an Xbox 360 controller, and man, it just feels fantastic. The only problem I have with this game so far is the damage model. It's still far away from being as realistic as Richard Burns Rally's damage model. I would also like to see specifically which parts are damaged, like which parts of the engine are damaged for example, not just a health bar for the overall engine damage, and you should be able to fix the different parts seperately like in Richard Burns Rally. Well anyways, the game is excellent, and I am glad I bought it. I can only see it getting better and better.			"

								Didn't play for long last night.  The latest rally game I really enjoyed was the last McRae on Xbox (1 not One) so that's what I'm comparing it to.Was surprised to find I couldn't choose my own tires.  Why not?  Some sets that have a mix of tarmac and various gravels between stages... let me choose!Graphics are a bit underwhelming.  Not why most fans are here, but yeah... not the greatest.  Not terrible mind you.  Also, the killer UI from the old McRae games is gone.  Hopefully they do something to spice up the menu system.  It was always funny to see people blown away by the cool UI in the old games.  Not a deal breaker obviously.Gameplay is great.  Good sense of speed, responsive controls.Will update review as I play it more.   Really looking forward to the final release.			"

												If you've been longing for a modern rally game, look no further. DiRT Rally is the answer. This is the single best rally game out right now. If you were looking for a more hardcore experience than DiRT 2 and 3, this game will suit your needs. DiRT Rally focuses on rally racing. But it has three racetypes. Rally, Hillclimb, and Rallycross. Running up Pikes Peak in an Audi Quattro is absolutely terrifying, as you have no pacenotes. As a result, this game is fantastic.The physics in this game are awesome. Originally the force feedback was very poor, but after all of the continuous updates, the game feels much better. You can feel the cars transition from understeer to oversteer. It’s very easy to feel what the cars are doing. Never before did I think hooning a 100hp Mini down a mountain would be so much fun. This game also runs well too. On my i5 2nd gen at 3.2 GHz with 660ti and 8 gigs of RAM, I get a steady 60fps at 1080p on high settings. It’s easy to see that the devs of this game care about community feedback. But this game isn’t really for the casual gamer. Even with on screen pacenotes (which I disabled), this game is still very difficult. This game begs the player to play with a wheel. You can play great with a 360 pad, so it isn’t unplayable. It’s actually fun regardless of what kind of device you play with, minus a keyboard. But if want to experience this beast in full, a full setup is a must. And you can finally map all the controls without having to remap each time you play! The car list is pretty good, with a small amount from each era. From E30 M3s to a Lancia Stratos. Some Group A and B cars. RWD Group B. FWD kit cars with a crazy 280hp. Icons like the Subaru Impreza and Audi Quattro are in there too. There’s a good amount of stages to run as well. From gravel stages in Wales, to snowy narrow mountain roads in Monte Carlo. Oh and the Flying Finland Update is awesome. Those stages are insane!In summary, if you’re looking for a hardcore rally sim to carry the torch of the old school legends like Richard Burns Rally, this is the one. Buy it! You’ll crash a lot. But once you figure it out, this game becomes perfect. The first time you run Pikes Peak without crashing, you’ll watch the replay and wonder how your reactions became that of an alien. This game rewards skillful players, and it just keeps me coming back.9/10 Final Score			"

												[1.0 Release, 08 December 2015:] Now that Early Access is over I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. Nearly all of the issues I had with DiRT Rally have been ironed out throughout the year, with my final biggest gripes being sorted in version 1.0.This is a wonderful representation of Rally with a great selection of cars from the history of the sport. I'd love more locations, but the stages that have been included are very high quality and provide an excellent ""greatest hits"" of what rallying around the world has to offer. I am very pleased with their decision to model real-world stages.The actual driving experience (using G27) is simply one of the best pieces of computer-based entertainment I have experienced. I said something similar in my initial review below, but this has only improved in my eyes.The RX and Pikes Peak content are nice extras to the game. It'd be great if this project leads to a new licenced rallycross title that continues with the more ""authentic""/""sim"" approach to modelling the sport and includes the full World RX season, as well as a ""sequel"" to DiRT Rally that simply has a larger selection of rally locations with a bigger budget.DiRT Rally is an excellent title. If you have any interest at all in the sport (and ideally a wheel) and are prepared to fail a lot (all part of the fun!) then this is well worth the purchase.[22 May 2015:] My rule of thumb in judging an Early Access game: ""If development were to stop right now, would I be happy with my purchase?"" In this case, it's a definite yes.And luckily, development is on track to add a lot more and produce a truly fantastic game once 1.0 comes around. I am impressed with the way the development team is handling community feedback and it seems they are listening to the right things. In its current form it still has its problems, particularly the FFB, but the main ones have been acknowledged by the dev team and fixes/improvements are in the works.It is not easy, but in my opinion that is the way it should be in a game aiming to be a rally ""sim"". I am not super skilled at sims, but play with a wheel and no assists, and I have only won two stages in career mode so far (over 30 hours). But that doesn't matter, as my gradual improvement has been one of the most rewarding things I have experienced in a game.Despite a few flaws at this stage of development, my time spent with the game in the first few weeks has been some of the most fun I have ever had at a computer.

Introduction:Overall/So far (8/4/15) this is a very solid game for PC racing fans. Keep in mind that this is a racing sim not just some fun casual racing game. If you're expecting an expansion of the DiRT series like 2 & 3 it's a very different game. Pros:Amazing graphicsRealistic PhysicsGreat Car soundsVery few bugs for Early AccessGood selection of carsGreat tracksOptimized quite wellAbility for masteryCons:Some times it's too realistic which is difficultWhen playing you can't chill and race, too realistic and AI is too good for that Very little car options (maybe because of early access..?)Restarting/Recovering is quite depriving and criplingRecording your gameplay is quite bad for performance (maybe just me)Conclusion:I would definatly recommend this since it isn't expensive and they are always adding free content throughout development. If you enjoy sim racing and rally/offroad racing this game will entertain you.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  "

												A epic game..Rally at its best, from attempting to tame the group B monsters to the old classics right up to the moden day wrc cars..each stage is a test of reslove pushing the cars{ and yourself} to the limits.Graphics are outstanding each car is a work of art, each stage be it tarmac gravel snow or mud is beautifuly designed, weather dynamics sublime.car avanced setups are very good ,knowing that your tweaked suspesion shaved two seconds of your best time always brings a grin.I like rally games...but for a long time there has been none..not any more....10/10....Colin would be proud.PS. when your co driver says"" right 5 be brave"" and your in a 480bhp 205t16 on wet tarmac...dont listen.

												This is by far the most complete and detailed rally game released for the modern generation. The last game to get the genre this spot on was Colin McRae Rally 2005 (also made by Codemasters). Having played both Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo and WRC 5, I can safely say this game is head and shoulders above the rest.The driving physics are spot on. The cars feel weighty and alive, the sense of speed (Especially in Finland) can be terrifying, and there are many cars (Group B) that are a real handful to drive. There is a great challenge to this game. Put it this way, I have got 80+ hours in this game and can get in the top 100 on the daily events, but I still frequently mess stages up, often spectacularly!The rallycross is outstanding. The attention to detail is insane, including implementing the joker lap and having Niel Cole (UK World RallyX presenter) as the spotter. However, there is a negative to this feature and with the game as a whole.What tracks and stages there is in the game are outstanding, but I feel there isn't enough. Each rally has 12 stages, but they are 2 stages cut up and run both ways, which has been an approach to rally games recently and I can't stand it! Games like Colin McRae Rally 3 or 2005, they had multiple stages, all unique. I feel they should have spent more time making more stages (which they may well do).Overall, this is a must buy game for any rally fan or anyone who enjoys racing games. The car selection is outstanding, the graphics are stunning and what stages there is are wonderful. Just be warned, the career mode isn't fulfilling and there will come a point where the stages start to feel a little stale.			"

												Best rally sim since RBR handsdown.+Graphics 9/10Good. Doesnt leave anything to be desired.+Sound 8/10I really love the sound of gravel spraying to the cars body and the engine sounds are beautiful. Some points are taken by little bit unclear co-driver notes. You can crank the volume way up and hear the notes better but i think they shoud have gone for more ""dry"" eq sound to distinguish the notes from the background noise.+Handling 9/10Feel for the road is really good. Force feedback works well and is tunable to  a good extent.+Cars 9/10Different cars have different characteristics and feels. Tuning your cars setup really makes a big difference. Group B cars <3.-1 point for not having custom liverys. +Tracks 10/10There is a good variety of rally stages and conditions. The stages are really detailed and challenging. Flying Finland is one of my favorite locations. You spend half the time soaring thru the air at those stages, its just crasy.-Damage modelling +6/10There are different types of damage to the car like punctured tyres etc. but i would like to see better body damage modelling because at this point it doesnt really seem to affect the driving too much when you collide with a rock or a tree at high speed.For the overall score i would give 9/10This game is what i have been waiting for since rbr started to get out dated.

								Once the force feedback is fixed (I've gotten used to it, but the wheel feel is strange, needs some improvement) this'll be swell. The one thing I do like about the force feedback is the feel when leaving/hitting the groud - you get a real sense of it.I stall, I hit trees, I burst tires. Sometimes I even finish a race. It's just like real rally!Edit:A few hours in and I'm now able to finish the races and am having a ball! Proper rally sim - unforgiving (do not buy if you're after an arcade racer) and all the more fun for it.The UI is nice and clean, moving around is easy (using my G27 as sole input device) and the way the career works is really nice, not halfassed at all.I've been a fan of the whole Dirt series, this is an excellent evolution.With this, Assetto Corsa and Project Cars all of my racing needs are catered for.

								This is actually quite great.Brings back a lot of real rallying that has been missing for several years in the series. Let's also say it's quite a challenge, and there's always room to improve yourself and your driving in various cars and stages.I must say though, even though I'm fully aware it's early access it does need more stages around in different types of rallys like for example Sweden, or Kenya or something funky, but in the future more stages to the already existing rallys that exist. I also miss the Mitsubishi Evo's dearly and in general want to see the expansion of cars, especially 90's and 2000's. Hoping for it! That aside I think codemasters has done a great job with what they've provided so far, and every update has been really nice to see.			"

Great fun, excellent eye candy, the scenery is very well modelled and makes you feel like you are driving through a forest. ( Though you wont be looking at the scenery).Get ready for some high speed, high intensity action in the newest version of DiRT, and be fully immersed in the scenery/surrounding environments.Expect Updates at the moment, as this game is early access, and stuff may yet change, but 11/10 loved it, would recommend.

								For any fans of DiRT 3 that just felt something missing, this is your game. No Gymkhana BS, just pure rally goodness. Playing this game with a game controller works just fine, but to get the full DiRT Rally experience I highly recommend invensting in a FFB racing wheel if you do not own one already. There are many different car classes to choose from, including 1960's FWD clunkers, all the way up to modern day rally beasts. Beware, this game is as close to a rally simulation as one will find right now and therefor has a learning curve. This is a must have game for racing sim fans and especially rally racing fans.Pros:-Detailed car setup customization-Plents of real life tracks with innumerable stages in each-Realistic(ish) game physics (more in cons)-Team management-Challenging career championship system-Lots and lots of rally cars with all drive types (FWD, RWD, 4WD)Cons:-The edges of tracks do not seem to act very realistic (i.e. clip a bank on the outside of the track and send your car into a deadly barrel roll)-With my FFB racing wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) I had to spend a few days tweaking the Logitech control panel as well as in-game settings to get the in-game FFB to feel rightOverall I would definitely give this game a 9/10 right now. Keep in mind that this game is an EARLY ACCESS title and Codemasters is working on fixing any issues and adding more content to the game to keep the player base enthralled in the gameplay. Since picking this game up a week ago, I have played for several hours every day. There is just something so satisfying about setting a great stage time and placing first in a championship. "

								Physics simulation is weak at this point: the handbrake is incredible efficient to get a non-sliding, full-stop even on loose gravel; the car always moves in the direction the wheels are pointing out (hard to explain, but this should not be the case); and they manage to make 300 bhp WRCars feel sluggish. Still, I recommend this game even as early access.			"

								I've never said ""F#ck"" so many times while playing a driving game. If you grew up playing Colin Mcrae and Richard Burns Rally, then this is for you. It's extremely challenging and unforgiving but the satifaction of finishing a stage without crashing is immensly satisfying.			"

												This is by far the most complete and detailed rally game released for the modern generation. The last game to get the genre this spot on was Colin McRae Rally 2005 (also made by Codemasters). Having played both Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo and WRC 5, I can safely say this game is head and shoulders above the rest.The driving physics are spot on. The cars feel weighty and alive, the sense of speed (Especially in Finland) can be terrifying, and there are many cars (Group B) that are a real handful to drive. There is a great challenge to this game. Put it this way, I have got 80+ hours in this game and can get in the top 100 on the daily events, but I still frequently mess stages up, often spectacularly!The rallycross is outstanding. The attention to detail is insane, including implementing the joker lap and having Niel Cole (UK World RallyX presenter) as the spotter. However, there is a negative to this feature and with the game as a whole.What tracks and stages there is in the game are outstanding, but I feel there isn't enough. Each rally has 12 stages, but they are 2 stages cut up and run both ways, which has been an approach to rally games recently and I can't stand it! Games like Colin McRae Rally 3 or 2005, they had multiple stages, all unique. I feel they should have spent more time making more stages (which they may well do).Overall, this is a must buy game for any rally fan or anyone who enjoys racing games. The car selection is outstanding, the graphics are stunning and what stages there is are wonderful. Just be warned, the career mode isn't fulfilling and there will come a point where the stages start to feel a little stale.			"

												Best rally sim since RBR handsdown.+Graphics 9/10Good. Doesnt leave anything to be desired.+Sound 8/10I really love the sound of gravel spraying to the cars body and the engine sounds are beautiful. Some points are taken by little bit unclear co-driver notes. You can crank the volume way up and hear the notes better but i think they shoud have gone for more ""dry"" eq sound to distinguish the notes from the background noise.+Handling 9/10Feel for the road is really good. Force feedback works well and is tunable to  a good extent.+Cars 9/10Different cars have different characteristics and feels. Tuning your cars setup really makes a big difference. Group B cars <3.-1 point for not having custom liverys. +Tracks 10/10There is a good variety of rally stages and conditions. The stages are really detailed and challenging. Flying Finland is one of my favorite locations. You spend half the time soaring thru the air at those stages, its just crasy.-Damage modelling +6/10There are different types of damage to the car like punctured tyres etc. but i would like to see better body damage modelling because at this point it doesnt really seem to affect the driving too much when you collide with a rock or a tree at high speed.For the overall score i would give 9/10This game is what i have been waiting for since rbr started to get out dated.

												Bar none greatest 'pure-rally' driving game out there. Supports a ton of wheels and wheel options, the graphics are very pretty considering how optimized they are, the performance is stellar, and the engine/road noises are unrivaled. I'd write a lengthy review, but honestly if you're the type to even consider a pure rally game, then just buy it. Plus, Codemasters have done an excellent job updating and supporting this title post-launch too.			"

								DiRT was a great game; variety, depth, and style combined to deliver one of the best racing titles in memory. The series took a step away from simulation with DiRT 2, using a more arcade-y physics package, gimmicky races and locations, and tacky cameos from Pastrana and Block. DiRT 3 and Showdown...more of the same, if not even worse.Finally, Codemasters brings us back to the glory days, giving us a rally game worth playing. No nonsense, unforgiving (to a fault at points, and yes, Wales, I'm speaking of you), visually impressive, and just plain fun. I've barely gotten into the game, yet I've found myself with white knuckles multiple times in a Mini with barely 100 horsepower. Looking forward to seeing the finished product.			"

It's just so damned pretty and is refreshingly easy on your hardware.  I'm not qualified to rate sims or arcade but this seems like a great mix of the two. Serious racing, serious controls, beautiful scenery, addictive replays. Love the damage system too.Pile into the 60's Mini, do a run at night in the rain. Be terrified!			"

								I have always loved racing games, and the original Colin McRae Rally was one of my absolute favorites. This is the first game since the original that has given me the same thrill of pure rally racing. I have played and enjoyed all of the Dirt games, but I always prefer pure rally, and have been hankering for a game that captures the spirit. Codemasters have finally delivered the absolute perfect rally game. It wasn't easy to get in to, but it certainly rewards patience and determination. I haven't mastered it yet, but I want to reset my career and start again, maybe placing better each time. Not many games deserve replay, but this one definitely does. I can't wait to see what the finished product looks like. The graphics are the most realistic I have ever seen. Can you tell how much I loved this game?			"

Early Access Review
								My take on Dirt Rally (pre order release): Two words or less: Merciless Fun.The good, the bad, the ugly and the indifferent:Can't speak to controller land, I don't equate controller and SIM at all; it's like an oxymoron. That said, it's not really a SIM, it's a very serious game with some decent underpinnings and good enough visuals to get the job done. Be prepared to play with the FFB settings to get rid of the muddled center and spring action and tweak the rest of it to get what you want. Well at least get it close enough... Once tweaked the FFB is as passable as AC or Race Room; canned as the day is long but giving the appropriate info. This is with  the base Fanatec ""4za"" wheel with an Elite pedal set, other wheels will vary.One thing I lament right off the rip is the fact the wheel button/pedal schemes are cast in cement. It's 2015 not 1995... They say they're going to address this for different wheels which is great news, however I have to wonder if that will include telling the game I want to use a particular pedal or button for something regardless of input device. I am really hoping they get beyond the control schema looking at me stupid with a face full of ""you want teh clutch pedal to do what..?"" (...a clutch pedal that isn't usable in my pedal set ATM to boot, again something they purpose to fix...) The flexibility to add stand alone shifters and e-brakes for custom cockpits will go a long way towards immersion and aren't something I'd consider optional in this day and age, it would be a detriment to the title to leave this kind of thing out again.While we're weeping and wailing and gnashing teeth, the menu still being straight out of console land for a PC title is a bit bonehead classification worthy. You'll need to drag out your wheel manual and note what buttons are what numbers. Once I figured out where the buttons were it was navigable, I could even change the liveries with my shifter paddles. It's not like you can't get from here to there in the game on a wheel; it's just a PITA to do so on some occasions. I was able to use the keyboard as well, I had no issues mixing and matching the return and escape buttons into the wheel button mix at first. Once I got the hang of all the buttons the keyboard was able to be set aside. I shouldn't have to work so hard to get through a menu, mouse support should be like 2 or 3 on the list of things to fix/improve/implement. It's a PC game, it needs PC control.The environment and atmosphere are done very well. Track side is lively enough yet not overbearing or intrusive. The graphics are dated but look just fine in play mode as I flail the wheel in 3rd hanging on for all I've got. Replays don't look quite as good, but are more than passable for me. I think they hired GT5 to make a guest appearance or something. While the surroundings look very good, the cars are aliased and a bit blocky and the damage model looks to be lifted straight from Kaz' special vault. Gotta love elongated oval lights that stretch like silly putty after an incident...Speaking of damage... The ""get some and have to repair it"" side is perfectly done. It's not a stretch to have to swap tires, re-balance them or replace a cracked/stressed/bent rim. Clogged filters, oil changes, damage to the body and cooling systems or brakes that took a beating on a particularly bad section. All of this is there in a simple slider system. You repair them with Time, allotting what you can to whatever you want to fix. It all works well enough, isn't overly complicated, calls for some strategic decision making and acts as a wear and tear factor in addition to damage. At the end of a stage, money is subtracted from your winnings to bring the car back up to snuff for the next event. Again, a simple solution that's just enough to make for some nice extra immersion.I like how the crew expands and affects the car under you, just enough to give the ""elite team"" feel without going overboard. Throw in the simplified team management of hiring engineers and there is enough to give the game that little bit of extra depth. It's not like the game will collapse into a black hole without these features, but to me they are just enough to complete the whole Driver-Team-Race Day feel into a nice cohesive package that really helps establish immersion before I ever hit the track.I love the fact you can screw up. Royally. Like blow an entire stage or event due to being daft at the controls. In most minor incidents you can recover with a time penalty, a slight of hand that mimics the fans rolling you over or pushing you back to the stage so you can continue. However there are times when as a driver you really mess up and go too far off or do too much damage to continue. In those cases that's it, you're done. I'm glad the game has the stones to flirt with this kind of stark reality, I've already seen too many cries of take it out. I hope they don't. Really makes me appreciate the times when I get it right, and let's face it; nothing makes you learn how to drive better and use your head more than a couple DNFs.The drive physics feel very good, they equate quite well to my real life experiences in similar conditions. The FFB gives me enough but could do so much more in this area, the information is somewhere between basic and detailed once the wheel is tweaked. I don't find issue with the braking, in a straight line with a vehicle specifically equipped for the conditions it's not surprising to see the level of performance the game gives. Where I look is when the car is out of shape and you ask it to do something it shouldn't be able to do. The first time you try to stomp the pedal while being slightly sideways and find it only makes you go more sideways and you find the road really isn't as wide as it looks and that trees and gravity are not your friends it begins to sink in that maybe the brakes aren't as good as you thought. I find the throttle control is very good, very much fun. Ripping the hairpins with the e-brake and powering out is a blast, feathering the throttle for that last bit of speed as you bob and weave and hang on is quite satisfying. The car hangs on quite well, at least as long as you are on the course.There is one behavior I find peculiar, the car tends to bog down when no throttle is applied a bit too generously. In heavy mud, heavy snow or deep gravel I can see it, on ice or tarmac..? Not so much. The only thing I can think of that would cause this behavior is a ton of drive line drag, something that would be in play with short, tight gearing. That said, as much as I like that I can rely on this ""feature"" it seems a bit over done. I think this plays into the too much grip or braking too good feeling as well.The co driver works fine for me, and it's really well done. I love it when I get into fast or tight sections and I can get him to stutter or get a bit confused. Don't know if it's intentional or if the game is just trying to cue up files for the next corners, but hearing him fumble about just adds that little extra edge of urgency and immersion for me. I hope it stays that way.Over all the game is a bucket load of fun. I'm not constantly harassed by console energy drift garbage, the atmosphere and the drive are really well done, the stages are great including the almighty DNF for being an NDMF. (...non driving mother fill in the blank...) It's already a great run out of the gate for fun mixed with a good dose of realism. Yeah it has it's issues, but what game doesn't..? And they are only going to add more to it to boot. Worth the money already.If you're on the fence about it, all you'll get are splinters in your butt squirming around the should I or shouldn't I. Just take into account the limitations of presets for wheels and the menus being button and keyboard before you jump. Once past that bit of reliving the 90's there's nothing but merciless fun to be had.Cheers..!			"

												I purchased this game a while back as an early access and reviewed it negatively so I want to ammend that now, as the game has evolved into something I find quite enjoyable. The realistic physics is challenging but all the more rewarding as you progress and begin to master it...""As of late Codemasters have been at somewhat of a low point. F1 2015 disappointed many fans of the series and garnered mediocre reactions from the press. F1 2014 was a similar situation, with Dirt Showdown again lagging behind the competition. This new title being developed in early access is a step into the unknown for Codemasters, however this new approach may have done the game some good. Unlike their recent releases, this game gives of a vibe of quality over quantity, something that is always welcome.This approach has also given Codemasters feedback from the community that they can act on in real-time, something they have done very publicly. Having played the game for more than 40 hours, I have not encountered a single bug or issue with the game, reiterating this point.Unlike previous installments to the franchise, this game is not forgiving for new players. As a player that has experience with a wide range of racing titles it took me several hours the master the art of not wrapping my car around a tree at the first sight of a corner. The car moves around, reacts to the surface of the road and if done correctly will give the player a fantastically immersive rally experience. Gone are the overly American Gymkhana enthusiasts urging you to “put that clip on Youtube”. Not that this was ever a terrible direction for the Dirt franchise, but it did seem to detract from the actual rally aspects of the game somewhat.Alongside this, the game is graphically impressive, something we have learned to expect from Codemasters. The environment is rich and true to life, with sparks and other particle effects lighting up the screen.The damage model is realistic in both the visual and the practical sense. If a player is careless they will pay for it, as repair times and repair costs will begin to climb. The car will begin to lose bodywork, wheels – and steam may even star escaping from the car. All of the mentioned effects reinforce the potential consequences of a mistake. This coupled with the solid audio and sound effects grounds the player in an immersive and believable gameplay experience.I would have to recommended this title to anybody with a keen interest in racing games or indeed the rally scene itself.  More casual players should be more cautious as this game could be frustrating to players who aren’t as familiar with more sim focused racing games. It’s easy to put a lot of hours into this game, and racing around the high speed forest stages in Finland is extremely fun once you have mastered the new handling model. This title could be a real turning point for Codemasters who have struggled to really hit the nail on the head as far as its more recent titles are concerned.""			"

								Great game. I havent enjoyed Rally this much since Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Theres a certain satisfaction in taking a corner just right that I just never got from the other DiRT games. The struggle to keep your car on the road while trying improve your time is real. And I love it.It does crash a bit too often on my system though. I hope this gets fixed soon since it's still in Early Access.			"

								I have always loved racing games, and the original Colin McRae Rally was one of my absolute favorites. This is the first game since the original that has given me the same thrill of pure rally racing. I have played and enjoyed all of the Dirt games, but I always prefer pure rally, and have been hankering for a game that captures the spirit. Codemasters have finally delivered the absolute perfect rally game. It wasn't easy to get in to, but it certainly rewards patience and determination. I haven't mastered it yet, but I want to reset my career and start again, maybe placing better each time. Not many games deserve replay, but this one definitely does. I can't wait to see what the finished product looks like. The graphics are the most realistic I have ever seen. Can you tell how much I loved this game?			"

								Highly recommended...even if you don't like racing. Get a gamepad, get the game, be prepared to want a wheel.I was on the fence about driving games/sims. DiRT Rally tipped the scales. It's just so damned pretty and is refreshingly easy on your hardware.  I'm not qualified to rate sims or arcade but this seems like a great mix of the two. Serious racing, serious controls, beautiful scenery, addictive replays. Love the damage system too.Pile into the 60's Mini, do a run at night in the rain. Be terrified!			"

								HOLY HECTIC!Expect to be challenged, especially when using wheels, this is very different in difficulty (Realism i think :P) from Dirt3, much harder, much more developed in the way of advanced car mechanics/track mechanics. Great fun, excellent eye candy, the scenery is very well modelled and makes you feel like you are driving through a forest. ( Though you wont be looking at the scenery).Get ready for some high speed, high intensity action in the newest version of DiRT, and be fully immersed in the scenery/surrounding environments.Expect Updates at the moment, as this game is early access, and stuff may yet change, but 11/10 loved it, would recommend.

								For any fans of DiRT 3 that just felt something missing, this is your game. No Gymkhana BS, just pure rally goodness. Playing this game with a game controller works just fine, but to get the full DiRT Rally experience I highly recommend invensting in a FFB racing wheel if you do not own one already. There are many different car classes to choose from, including 1960's FWD clunkers, all the way up to modern day rally beasts. Beware, this game is as close to a rally simulation as one will find right now and therefor has a learning curve. This is a must have game for racing sim fans and especially rally racing fans.Pros:-Detailed car setup customization-Plents of real life tracks with innumerable stages in each-Realistic(ish) game physics (more in cons)-Team management-Challenging career championship system-Lots and lots of rally cars with all drive types (FWD, RWD, 4WD)Cons:-The edges of tracks do not seem to act very realistic (i.e. clip a bank on the outside of the track and send your car into a deadly barrel roll)-With my FFB racing wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) I had to spend a few days tweaking the Logitech control panel as well as in-game settings to get the in-game FFB to feel rightOverall I would definitely give this game a 9/10 right now. Keep in mind that this game is an EARLY ACCESS title and Codemasters is working on fixing any issues and adding more content to the game to keep the player base enthralled in the gameplay. Since picking this game up a week ago, I have played for several hours every day. There is just something so satisfying about setting a great stage time and placing first in a championship. "

								Physics simulation is weak at this point: the handbrake is incredible efficient to get a non-sliding, full-stop even on loose gravel; the car always moves in the direction the wheels are pointing out (hard to explain, but this should not be the case); and they manage to make 300 bhp WRCars feel sluggish. Still, I recommend this game even as early access.			"

												One of the best racing games I've ever played.For best results, turn off all assists in the option menu for a realistic game.It's very addicting and lead to me playing 5 hours on the first day of having it.However I sometimes find that the co driver will sometimes clip audio clips andhim only having one voice and only a few recordings of each line makes him seem robotic.And at some points the lights are too bright and at others they're too dark. I would'veprefered it if the lighting was more balanced to make seeing the track easier.Overall the game's extreamly fun and addicting.The greaphics are pretty good but you don't notice them as much when you're going fastand the game is very satisfying, and the few issues I've found can be easily fixed.5 hours of play and no crash yet. on a rig with 16gb ram 2 970's and an i7 4770kthe game's run silky smooth. There's no stuttering from SLI. But then again, I'm not sure if it has SLI support.Either way this is one of the best realistic racing games out thereI rate it an 8.8/10Worth full price (however It's a little cheaper on♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I simply cannot express how much I love this game and how excited I am to own it. For awhile I've been looking for a good racing simulator on pc. I've owned the previous Dirt game (Dirt 3) and had a bit of fun with that for awhile. I got used to the arcade style and as soon as I hit the first corner in this game, I flew off the cliff. Confused I restarted the race and tried again. This time spinning out and flying off a cliff. Holy crap, the physics are real in this game. Tuning your car before the race in order to meet what the course will throw at you is vital. This game gives the true feel of what its like to handle fwd, rwd, awd, and 4wd on different types of terrain. Along with what its like to drive a car with 100 horsepower vs 600 horsepower. I still cannot get to the top of Pikes Peak without losing a wheel or busting my radiator. I reccomend this game if you are looking for a very challening racing game. Be prepared for no map while driving, no driving lines, and no ""car invincibility"". Do not buy this game if youre looking for a casual racing game. You won't find it here. But if you are looking for a good racing simulator on steam like I have been for awhile, buy it. You wont regret it.			"

								In spite of being early access, this is already the most fun I've ever had in a racing game.  I'm also very pleased so far with the way the studio is handling the early access release: they have a clear road map of what they intend to do and when they intend to roll out new rallies and game modes (e.g. rallycross); they release weekly status updates; every Thursday they update the list of bugs they're working on; and they've repeatedly pledged not to try to start charging us for things they're adding to the game.  It's also being developed for PC, so no worries about bad porting like certain other recent racing game releases.As I write this, it has four rallies each with a bunch of stages, a great selection of cars, and good driving physics that make for a really fun and intense experience.  The main area that stands out to me as needing work is collision physics -- snowbanks basically act like solid ramps, and sideways collisions into walls or hills don't seem to do half as much damage as I'd expect.  Force feedback with a racing wheel also doesn't feel as realistic as it could be yet.  And on very rare occasions, the codriver reads the wrong pace note for a particular corner, or reads it a bit later than I'd like (though if that's a big problem for you, you can configure how far ahead you want notes to be read in general).   All in all, for a game that's only on version 0.5, I'm extremely happy with DiRT Rally, and eager to see it improve and expand.			"

												I've always been into my racing simulators, and to me, this is the best yet.I think it even beats Richard Burns. If you didn't like any of the previous Dirts, don't judge it based on those because this totally loses the arcade feels, with a wheel it feels like a real car. I use the Logitech G29 with Manual Gears, Clutch, no assistance and the feeling of realism is just great.I've never seen physics like it. The sound effects are superb, if you put a headset on, you can hear so much more, the gravel hitting the arches, the spitting and popping of the tuned engine, the creaking of the chassis.I can't stress how good this game is, even as a casual gamer like me.They've got rid of those awful cut scenes that they used to force you to watch between races or at the beginning of a new save. They used to really do my head in, but none of that rubbish anymore.You can pick your pit crew and upgrade your car, set it up for the races and have Shakedowns (Practice runs) to see how the car responds to the new settings.Definitely worth a buy if you like Rally Games or Simulators.

								Amazing. I don't write reviews for games, because . . .  i just don't. I read other reviews and I don't bother to add my voice to the chorus. But I feel inspired with DIRT RALLY because it is just . . . great. It's the rally game I always wanted. It's tough, but you feel progress as you become a better driver. It's freakin' gorgeous - just try and make your way across the hills of Wales on a wet, rainy afternoon and not look at the cliffs and trees off in the distance. It doesn't replace DIRT 3, which is a great arcade driver, but sits along side it in my collection as two of my most played games.  I can't believe this is ""early access."" If you like driving games, and you must if you are reading this and considering purchasing DIRT RALLY, do it. You won't be disappointed (just remember the value of practice).			"

								A great racing (simulation) game. The graphics are not mind blowing but still very good, when you see the dust a few hundred meters behind you or the water splash driving through the muddy Wales. The Sound is amazing especially the historic cars sound like beasts. Sitting at the start with the Audi Quattro and the Stratos or the newly added Hillclimb cars, it's just an epic feeling listening to that monster sound. The Stages feel like real Rally stages and look quite similar to the real-life models. The handling feels alright, even tho it can still be twitched a bit along with the FFB. Even tho it says Early Access, DiRT Rally feels more like a finished game that hasn't too much content at the moment. But there is a lot of content to come, next month there will be a German rally stage that puts you on a full tarmac course, and then later the summer Codemasters will add the biggest action motorsports has to show, with rallycross, to the game. Along with other content (also cars), there's no doubt that this can be the greatest rally game since and for a long time.""If in doubt, flat out"" - Colin McRea ;)			"

												DiRT Rally is what a rally game was always meant to be. It is incredibly challenging, especially if you use only a mouse and keyboard, and is unforgiving. My history in racing games started with Grand Turismo 3, on the ps2. That was considered a ""racing simulator"" and was challenging at the time. From there it went GT4, GT5, some DiRT 3 and a little bit of Forza. I would put DiRT Rally on par with Forza in the way the cars take damage and how that damage is felt by the player. Blow a tire and you will know it when you lose traction, power, and steering control. The different surfaces also handle differently. Snow is different than gravel and is different than ice which is different than dirt. It can take some time getting adjusted to each different road type when you are going from one event to the next. The games progression is very rewarding, you have to learn the cars you drive in order to progress at any real pace. There is also a nice progression for mastering a car you really like. I personally enjoy the Mini, which is a very low ""tier"" car, but I am able to progress with that car and go to larger and larger championships. I would recommend this game to anyone who is very into rally racing or racing in general. It is not for those enjoy arcade or need for speed type racing games. This would be a perfect game however if you are looking to move on from that genre. Can be frustrating at times but also incredibly rewarding.			"

												This is by far the most complete and detailed rally game released for the modern generation. The last game to get the genre this spot on was Colin McRae Rally 2005 (also made by Codemasters). Having played both Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo and WRC 5, I can safely say this game is head and shoulders above the rest.The driving physics are spot on. The cars feel weighty and alive, the sense of speed (Especially in Finland) can be terrifying, and there are many cars (Group B) that are a real handful to drive. There is a great challenge to this game. Put it this way, I have got 80+ hours in this game and can get in the top 100 on the daily events, but I still frequently mess stages up, often spectacularly!The rallycross is outstanding. The attention to detail is insane, including implementing the joker lap and having Niel Cole (UK World RallyX presenter) as the spotter. However, there is a negative to this feature and with the game as a whole.What tracks and stages there is in the game are outstanding, but I feel there isn't enough. Each rally has 12 stages, but they are 2 stages cut up and run both ways, which has been an approach to rally games recently and I can't stand it! Games like Colin McRae Rally 3 or 2005, they had multiple stages, all unique. I feel they should have spent more time making more stages (which they may well do).Overall, this is a must buy game for any rally fan or anyone who enjoys racing games. The car selection is outstanding, the graphics are stunning and what stages there is are wonderful. Just be warned, the career mode isn't fulfilling and there will come a point where the stages start to feel a little stale.			"

								It's not as sim as Richard Burns there's way too much grip and lack of inertia but the driving model is passable, beautiful graphics and group B cars. The standouts so far have been how the camera captures suspension working and the way track geometry affects driving both feel really good and with further refinements to the physics the game could be great.

												I've always been into my racing simulators, and to me, this is the best yet.I think it even beats Richard Burns. If you didn't like any of the previous Dirts, don't judge it based on those because this totally loses the arcade feels, with a wheel it feels like a real car. I use the Logitech G29 with Manual Gears, Clutch, no assistance and the feeling of realism is just great.I've never seen physics like it. The sound effects are superb, if you put a headset on, you can hear so much more, the gravel hitting the arches, the spitting and popping of the tuned engine, the creaking of the chassis.I can't stress how good this game is, even as a casual gamer like me.They've got rid of those awful cut scenes that they used to force you to watch between races or at the beginning of a new save. They used to really do my head in, but none of that rubbish anymore.You can pick your pit crew and upgrade your car, set it up for the races and have Shakedowns (Practice runs) to see how the car responds to the new settings.Definitely worth a buy if you like Rally Games or Simulators.

												I've been racing Richard Burns Rally for several years before stopping altogether just because I got tired of it and could not find any other similarly appealing rally game. I never considered Colin McRae Rally or DiRT series as a replacement due to its obvious arcadish physics. As a matter of fact, CMR3 was my first racing game after I bought a steering wheel, and I had such an awful experience that I dropped DVD-ROM into garbage can three days later. Yes, I tried original DiRT but it only reinforced my belief that Codemasters will never deliver anything decent. Yes, I also tried Milestone's WRC series, bought the very first installement hoping for a bright future despite existing shortcomings. Milestone also failed to meet my expectations.DiRT Rally brought me back to simracing after over 6 years of waiting. No, DR is not as good as RBR in terms of car simulation and handling. There is a room for improvement and I hope Codemasters stay on this path without dumping DR down to mainstream racing game.I would highly recommend it to any rally sport fan, but make sure you have a controller or better a steering wheel, and don't expect it to be as good as RBR. Just have fun. And don't cut.			"

								It's still early access but this game is shaping up to be awesome. I've played pretty much every rally game that's come out for the PC since the late 90's, Mobil 1 Rally Championship, Colin McRae, Dirt, Richard Burns Rally, you name it I've played them and this is up there with RBR and M1RC as one of the greats.Handling feels pretty realistic in that cars aren't on rails, you can't let off the gas to make every turn at near full speed, damage is pretty realistic in that a slight off can puncture a tire and do some bad damage. The stages are longer than in DIRT but not nearly as long as M1RC or even some RBR stages, but they're decently long at about 6-8 minutes for the majority.There are a lot of different types of cars and they do feel realistic for their age, ie: modern WRC cars are insanely fast and handle a lot better than some of the early FWD rally cars (Mini). If you want a really good rally game that looks pretty pick this up as soon as you can, I don't think you'll regret it.			"

								This truly is the best rally game since Richard Burns Rally. The cars feel very real to drive, and the sounds and graphics are also very impressive. My current graphics card struggles to run the game on Ultra though, but I do it anyways, since it looks so good on Ultra. I run it on Ultra with my Gtx 560 Ti 2GB, and fps differs in each stage, but it's mostly about 30 fps or so. I drive in cockpit view, using an Xbox 360 controller, and man, it just feels fantastic. The only problem I have with this game so far is the damage model. It's still far away from being as realistic as Richard Burns Rally's damage model. I would also like to see specifically which parts are damaged, like which parts of the engine are damaged for example, not just a health bar for the overall engine damage, and you should be able to fix the different parts seperately like in Richard Burns Rally. Well anyways, the game is excellent, and I am glad I bought it. I can only see it getting better and better.			"

												[1.0 Release, 08 December 2015:] Now that Early Access is over I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. Nearly all of the issues I had with DiRT Rally have been ironed out throughout the year, with my final biggest gripes being sorted in version 1.0.This is a wonderful representation of Rally with a great selection of cars from the history of the sport. I'd love more locations, but the stages that have been included are very high quality and provide an excellent ""greatest hits"" of what rallying around the world has to offer. I am very pleased with their decision to model real-world stages.The actual driving experience (using G27) is simply one of the best pieces of computer-based entertainment I have experienced. I said something similar in my initial review below, but this has only improved in my eyes.The RX and Pikes Peak content are nice extras to the game. It'd be great if this project leads to a new licenced rallycross title that continues with the more ""authentic""/""sim"" approach to modelling the sport and includes the full World RX season, as well as a ""sequel"" to DiRT Rally that simply has a larger selection of rally locations with a bigger budget.DiRT Rally is an excellent title. If you have any interest at all in the sport (and ideally a wheel) and are prepared to fail a lot (all part of the fun!) then this is well worth the purchase.[22 May 2015:] My rule of thumb in judging an Early Access game: ""If development were to stop right now, would I be happy with my purchase?"" In this case, it's a definite yes.And luckily, development is on track to add a lot more and produce a truly fantastic game once 1.0 comes around. I am impressed with the way the development team is handling community feedback and it seems they are listening to the right things. In its current form it still has its problems, particularly the FFB, but the main ones have been acknowledged by the dev team and fixes/improvements are in the works.It is not easy, but in my opinion that is the way it should be in a game aiming to be a rally ""sim"". I am not super skilled at sims, but play with a wheel and no assists, and I have only won two stages in career mode so far (over 30 hours). But that doesn't matter, as my gradual improvement has been one of the most rewarding things I have experienced in a game.Despite a few flaws at this stage of development, my time spent with the game in the first few weeks has been some of the most fun I have ever had at a computer.

								Once the force feedback is fixed (I've gotten used to it, but the wheel feel is strange, needs some improvement) this'll be swell. The one thing I do like about the force feedback is the feel when leaving/hitting the groud - you get a real sense of it.I stall, I hit trees, I burst tires. Sometimes I even finish a race. It's just like real rally!Edit:A few hours in and I'm now able to finish the races and am having a ball! Proper rally sim - unforgiving (do not buy if you're after an arcade racer) and all the more fun for it.The UI is nice and clean, moving around is easy (using my G27 as sole input device) and the way the career works is really nice, not halfassed at all.I've been a fan of the whole Dirt series, this is an excellent evolution.With this, Assetto Corsa and Project Cars all of my racing needs are catered for.

Pacenotes are not always right, the co-driver sometimes says useless ones, and sometimes fails to mention things that will end your race (happened a few times with me). Also there isn't a lot of tracks available to play on, each rally has 4 stages (increases when you get promoted), 2 of which are the reverse of each other, Rally Cross has 3 tracks and Hill Climb has only 1... The game is still a lot of fun to play, and still worth buying just keep these in mind before you purchase it.			"

								Well, first off I must say that this game was wayyyy different than I thought it would be. The reason why I say this is because the other Code Master games I have played, such as the DiRT games have been far far easier than this game. This game is an actual simulation, not a racing game that is going to walk you through every aspect of its mechanics. Instead it dumps you on your face where you will fail time and time again until you start to understand the mechanics, or are used to rally car physic type stuff (or you destroy your keyboard/controller because you can't stay on the ♥♥♥♥ing track). In my opinion Code Masters took a very good turn as far as game types, and I think they should continue down this path. I definately reccomend this game if you are ready for a challenge, but overall this is a very, very rewarding game when you nail the physics of it and get that satisfying pay off.			"

								I have always loved racing games, and the original Colin McRae Rally was one of my absolute favorites. This is the first game since the original that has given me the same thrill of pure rally racing. I have played and enjoyed all of the Dirt games, but I always prefer pure rally, and have been hankering for a game that captures the spirit. Codemasters have finally delivered the absolute perfect rally game. It wasn't easy to get in to, but it certainly rewards patience and determination. I haven't mastered it yet, but I want to reset my career and start again, maybe placing better each time. Not many games deserve replay, but this one definitely does. I can't wait to see what the finished product looks like. The graphics are the most realistic I have ever seen. Can you tell how much I loved this game?			"

												So is Dirt Rally any good?  Well one thing i can say is thank god Codemasters have finally done away with all this fist bumping Gymkana nonsence and taken the series back to its rallying roots. After purchasing your 1st car... (I chose the 1960's mini.) you can take up a career ralling your way to victory...(or not), and become a legend in the Rally scene. Let me point out that Dirt rally is bloody hard. There are no rewinds in Dirt Rally so one mistake can lose you valuble seconds. As i'm sure most of you know its best to hit this game with a control pad or steering wheel setup. im currently using the Xbox one control pad. Dirt Rally is very good but it still has issues that need patching. Im using a AMD 3.5 GHZ cpu with 16 gig of ram and a GTX 960 GPU. I can run the game with everything on High and it runs very smooth. Between 60 to 120 FPS however after using the game for about 20 mins i encounter micro stutter for about 10 to 15 seconds that will put the best of us off our game. Considering you need alot of conentration during the stages to stand a chance of finishing 1st, its not good to have a major drop in FPS. Having said that, even when i have the steam FPS counter in the corner, its still registering 60 + FPS during the stutter so i'm thinking maybe a memory leak. Other than that Dirt Rally is a joy to play and if you enjoyed any of the original Rally games of times past then i highly recommend it to any rally or racing fan.			"

												Nothing compares to DIRT Rally in terms of having the feeling of really driving a rally car. Its hard, rewarding and exhilarating.Other rally games might have more content (we all hope for more tracks and cars for DIRT Rally! DLC or not) but that does not matter much if the feeling of driving is not there. And the only game that comes close to that feeling is DIRT Rally (have tried  all the other rally games). Period!I actually find DIRT Rally a bit easier than most of the more arcady rally games around, since you actually have the feeling of driving in DIRT Rally.			"

If you just casually played DiRT 2, 3, or Showdown, this probably isn't the arcade racer you are looking for. This is a legitimate Rally Sim. The career mode is much improved with a full team and realistic car damage.I'm having a blast and it's only been in Early Access for a week now.

								DiRT Rally is an amazing game plagued by one potentially experience-ruining issue.Visually, the game is superb. The game performs well on a variety of hardware (having personally tested it both with an older HD 6870 1 Gb and a brand new R9 380 4 Gb) and has excellent lighting and texture/detail features. There is some rather annoying dithering to plant life, but that's forgivable, and usually does little or nothing to hurt the experience. Menus are well-designed and simple, too, making navigation through the game's options easy for beginners but powerful for advanced users.Likewise, both sound and physics are absolutely wonderful as well. Cars control like cars, with all the quirks and difficulties thereof, though the game already offers a number of difficulty tuning options to make handling easier or more realistic depending on your preferences. Music is minimal, but appropriate when it is present, and all the vehicles sound unique, with a well-voiced navigator at your side whose vital help never grows annoying.If so much is right, then what is the problem?The save system.Simply put, disable Steam cloud saves first thing, and hope to your chosen deity that that fixes the issue, though in some (or even many) cases it won't. The game has a bad tendency to lose save data, costing players hours of progress, often in an unpredictable pattern, with the data safe one session and gone the next.The game is still Early Access, and for an early access title the feature suite and performance are superb. However, if the save feature is not fixed by launch, then that alone will make or break this game's value to many players, since progress is neither arbitrary nor fast. However, if the risk of losing save data doesn't scare you, then this is most definitely the racing game you've been waiting for.			"

												DiRT Rally is what a rally game was always meant to be. It is incredibly challenging, especially if you use only a mouse and keyboard, and is unforgiving. My history in racing games started with Grand Turismo 3, on the ps2. That was considered a ""racing simulator"" and was challenging at the time. From there it went GT4, GT5, some DiRT 3 and a little bit of Forza. I would put DiRT Rally on par with Forza in the way the cars take damage and how that damage is felt by the player. Blow a tire and you will know it when you lose traction, power, and steering control. The different surfaces also handle differently. Snow is different than gravel and is different than ice which is different than dirt. It can take some time getting adjusted to each different road type when you are going from one event to the next. The games progression is very rewarding, you have to learn the cars you drive in order to progress at any real pace. There is also a nice progression for mastering a car you really like. I personally enjoy the Mini, which is a very low ""tier"" car, but I am able to progress with that car and go to larger and larger championships. I would recommend this game to anyone who is very into rally racing or racing in general. It is not for those enjoy arcade or need for speed type racing games. This would be a perfect game however if you are looking to move on from that genre. Can be frustrating at times but also incredibly rewarding.			"

												This game is the most fun I've had in a racing game for a long time, it reminds me of games such as Gran Turismo 4 and Need For Speed Porsche Unleashed.  This is definitely the spiritual successor to Richard Burns Rally.  I play with the Steam Controller and a Fanatec Porsche GT2 wheel.  If you like racing games and you enjoy difficulty, this game is for you!			"

												I simply cannot express how much I love this game and how excited I am to own it. For awhile I've been looking for a good racing simulator on pc. I've owned the previous Dirt game (Dirt 3) and had a bit of fun with that for awhile. I got used to the arcade style and as soon as I hit the first corner in this game, I flew off the cliff. Confused I restarted the race and tried again. This time spinning out and flying off a cliff. Holy crap, the physics are real in this game. Tuning your car before the race in order to meet what the course will throw at you is vital. This game gives the true feel of what its like to handle fwd, rwd, awd, and 4wd on different types of terrain. Along with what its like to drive a car with 100 horsepower vs 600 horsepower. I still cannot get to the top of Pikes Peak without losing a wheel or busting my radiator. I reccomend this game if you are looking for a very challening racing game. Be prepared for no map while driving, no driving lines, and no ""car invincibility"". Do not buy this game if youre looking for a casual racing game. You won't find it here. But if you are looking for a good racing simulator on steam like I have been for awhile, buy it. You wont regret it.			"

I can't stress it enough that this the best racing game I've ever played, and I've been playing racing games since the first need for speed. It's regulary updated with new content, it's one of the hardest and most challenging racing game, the graphic is beautiful, well optimized in PC, no micro-transaction bullcraap, multiplayer is fun, the sound.... man... the SOUND... I could rev that ford focus all day everyday. This game ain't arcade, this is Dirt Rally, you will ditch your car on the first gaddamn corner. U see that ""BUY"" button? CLICK DAT♥♥♥♥♥♥♥MANG!			"

												At last Codemasters have actually made a game worthy of being called a simulator and not just that, but a proper racing game.. *cough* F1 *cough* piece of wank...Can't recommend this game enough, it makes you listen to the ♥♥♥♥ing pacenotes because if you don't you'll be hugging the closest tree to you.It's a must have for anyone who loved playing RBR!EDIT: After putting a few more hours into this game, I realised a few things. Pacenotes are not always right, the co-driver sometimes says useless ones, and sometimes fails to mention things that will end your race (happened a few times with me). Also there isn't a lot of tracks available to play on, each rally has 4 stages (increases when you get promoted), 2 of which are the reverse of each other, Rally Cross has 3 tracks and Hill Climb has only 1... The game is still a lot of fun to play, and still worth buying just keep these in mind before you purchase it.			"

								This is actually quite great.Brings back a lot of real rallying that has been missing for several years in the series. Let's also say it's quite a challenge, and there's always room to improve yourself and your driving in various cars and stages.I must say though, even though I'm fully aware it's early access it does need more stages around in different types of rallys like for example Sweden, or Kenya or something funky, but in the future more stages to the already existing rallys that exist. I also miss the Mitsubishi Evo's dearly and in general want to see the expansion of cars, especially 90's and 2000's. Hoping for it! That aside I think codemasters has done a great job with what they've provided so far, and every update has been really nice to see.			"

												Edit: The game is now in the 1.0 stage. My review below is now obsolete and I will update it later this month I've tried to write this review for the person who knows what kind of game this is and give an idea of what it's like to play the game in its current early access state. This game has a LOT going for it and I am optimistic about the final release. I'm so glad to see Dirt stepping away from the arcade rally genre and working towards furthering realism. There's an awesome vintage car selection, great graphics (that aren't over-processed like other racing games), frequent updates, and transparency with early access players. However, I recommend waiting for the final build, unless you're a hardcore fan and don't mind spending the $. As of 7/1/2015, the game has some issues. (1) Even on high-end systems, the game struggles to maintain a solid framerate. I am using a GTX 780, and struggle to maintain 60FPS, even with the preset set to Medium. I'm guessing that this will be resolved in the form of some kind of optimization, but I guess there's no guarantee. (2) Coming from other simulators, the physics don't always feel correct. This is especially true when on tarmac. The ""Tarmac Terrors"" update only exemplifies this issue. Going through a corner, understeer transitions into oversteer in an unnatural way. Group B cars on the tarmac portion of Pike's Peak will do AWD burnouts in 3rd and 4th gear, which is great fun, but not necessarily realistic. On tight gravel courses these issues also exist, but are compounded by rough track edges, which will roll a car that's gotten too close to the edge of the track. (3) The much-needed force feedback update resolved many player's issues, but it still feels wonky when using a wheel. With a G27, I find that I am constantly adjusting steering linearity and FFB settings. Part of the problem is that I can never get steering input to feel 1:1. It either demands too much input (feels like a greyhound bus) or too twitchy. At times, the force feedback feels great, but other times it doesn't feel correct for a given situation. Drive a few laps in Assetto Corsa using FWD, RWD, and AWD cars and you will see the kind of FFB realism that's possible. For a game that's being marketed as more of a simulator, these are issues worth talking about.			"

(I still need an upgrade) its a big improvement.

												One of the best racing games I've ever played.For best results, turn off all assists in the option menu for a realistic game.It's very addicting and lead to me playing 5 hours on the first day of having it.However I sometimes find that the co driver will sometimes clip audio clips andhim only having one voice and only a few recordings of each line makes him seem robotic.And at some points the lights are too bright and at others they're too dark. I would'veprefered it if the lighting was more balanced to make seeing the track easier.Overall the game's extreamly fun and addicting.The greaphics are pretty good but you don't notice them as much when you're going fastand the game is very satisfying, and the few issues I've found can be easily fixed.5 hours of play and no crash yet. on a rig with 16gb ram 2 970's and an i7 4770kthe game's run silky smooth. There's no stuttering from SLI. But then again, I'm not sure if it has SLI support.Either way this is one of the best realistic racing games out thereI rate it an 8.8/10Worth full price (however It's a little cheaper on♥♥♥♥♥			"

								DiRT Rally is an amazing game plagued by one potentially experience-ruining issue.Visually, the game is superb. The game performs well on a variety of hardware (having personally tested it both with an older HD 6870 1 Gb and a brand new R9 380 4 Gb) and has excellent lighting and texture/detail features. There is some rather annoying dithering to plant life, but that's forgivable, and usually does little or nothing to hurt the experience. Menus are well-designed and simple, too, making navigation through the game's options easy for beginners but powerful for advanced users.Likewise, both sound and physics are absolutely wonderful as well. Cars control like cars, with all the quirks and difficulties thereof, though the game already offers a number of difficulty tuning options to make handling easier or more realistic depending on your preferences. Music is minimal, but appropriate when it is present, and all the vehicles sound unique, with a well-voiced navigator at your side whose vital help never grows annoying.If so much is right, then what is the problem?The save system.Simply put, disable Steam cloud saves first thing, and hope to your chosen deity that that fixes the issue, though in some (or even many) cases it won't. The game has a bad tendency to lose save data, costing players hours of progress, often in an unpredictable pattern, with the data safe one session and gone the next.The game is still Early Access, and for an early access title the feature suite and performance are superb. However, if the save feature is not fixed by launch, then that alone will make or break this game's value to many players, since progress is neither arbitrary nor fast. However, if the risk of losing save data doesn't scare you, then this is most definitely the racing game you've been waiting for.			"

												I'll start by saying I've played these rally games since the very first one, Colin McRae Rally (1998) on PlayStation 1.I dont usually write reviews but for this game, I had to.This game is what every other rally game aspires to be. VERY nice graphics. They are so good that you could actually mistake a screenshot for a real picture.Great physics, and car handling is on point.A system in which you select and hire members for your rally team, can upgrade and buy new cars, and in between rally stages, have to decide which parts of the car you want to repair, to fit within the time limit.You can customise EVERYTHING in the car to fit the racing conditions, and even load configurations from the workshop.If you are used to playing DiRT 3 or Showdown, the handling, and the speed at which you have to travel will be hard to get used to at first, but when you get it right, and finally smash a time on a rally track, or come first in rallycross, the feeling is amazing.This game brings back memories of the old Colin McRae games, before they absolutely ruined the series with DiRT 3 and Showdown.I could not recommend this game more. Buy it if it's on sale. Buy it if it's not on sale. Buy it if the price increases to £50. You will not be disappointed.Points to consider:No gymkhana.No Ken Block.Not arcadey.No rewinds.No Ken Block.No gymkhana.Just rally in its purest form.			"

												DiRT Rally is what a rally game was always meant to be. It is incredibly challenging, especially if you use only a mouse and keyboard, and is unforgiving. My history in racing games started with Grand Turismo 3, on the ps2. That was considered a ""racing simulator"" and was challenging at the time. From there it went GT4, GT5, some DiRT 3 and a little bit of Forza. I would put DiRT Rally on par with Forza in the way the cars take damage and how that damage is felt by the player. Blow a tire and you will know it when you lose traction, power, and steering control. The different surfaces also handle differently. Snow is different than gravel and is different than ice which is different than dirt. It can take some time getting adjusted to each different road type when you are going from one event to the next. The games progression is very rewarding, you have to learn the cars you drive in order to progress at any real pace. There is also a nice progression for mastering a car you really like. I personally enjoy the Mini, which is a very low ""tier"" car, but I am able to progress with that car and go to larger and larger championships. I would recommend this game to anyone who is very into rally racing or racing in general. It is not for those enjoy arcade or need for speed type racing games. This would be a perfect game however if you are looking to move on from that genre. Can be frustrating at times but also incredibly rewarding.			"

								It's not as sim as Richard Burns there's way too much grip and lack of inertia but the driving model is passable, beautiful graphics and group B cars. The standouts so far have been how the camera captures suspension working and the way track geometry affects driving both feel really good and with further refinements to the physics the game could be great.

												Buy a wheel, some pedals and a stand. Prepare to crash many, many times at the first corner. Then, one day, after many hours, execute a perfect power slide through that same corner. Rejoice. Daydream about taking that corner the whole next day. Settle down again. Time for that second corner.			"

												Hands down the best rally game out today, probably of all time. It forced me against my will (at least that's what I told the wife) to buy  a modern racing wheeel. When I am at work I am constantly thinking of ways to shave off one tenth of a second on corners. You will lose constantly. Don't expect to win races in this game/sim, just try to go faster and have fun. And you will have fun!			"

												Finally codemasters returns to the roots of what made them great.  For those of us who were a little dissapointed with the arcadey style they started to follow this one takes us all back to a more realistic rally game that a lot of us really love.Every corner matters, every bump can send you offbalance and if you are not paying attension you will crash. Choosing when to push the car to the hair raising limit and when to hold back makes all the difference.10/10 Best rally game to come out in a long long time. I've only played a few hours @ the time of writing this but i'm sure i'll be putting a lot more time in when I get a chance.			"

												After first 2 hours of game play i was wondering, ""what's with the difficulty?!"" Difficulty at first felt really brutal and i kept losing and losing and the time gap just kept growing but i decided to keep trying and eventually i started winning championships, which brings the difficulty up for the next championship. Current trend for game difficulties seems to be very casual so i have got bored with many games so i really appreciate this system where i have to get gradually better until i start winning and at that point game reacts and increases the difficulty automatically so it keeps me alert and keeps the game challenging. This difficulty also means that this game is not for casual friday nights with few beers because of the concentration that is required to play the game, though we can always argue about this depending of how good the player is with driving games and which type of peripherals are used to play. (Game pad or proper steering wheel with pedals and so on...)I've been playing with xbox 360 controller and i've had all the assists off except automatic gear change. Because of the realistic car handling and so on i think a proper steering wheel and pedals would do more justice to the game simply because real rally cars aren't driven using xbox360 controllers not to mention using clutch and chaning gears on a controller, which feels a bit ridiculous. Game pad can be customised in game to be more or less sensitive to meet your preferation.After all this has been a very good game and good change after playing all these RPGs with swords and shields. Money well spent.			"

												First review Good to get away from the arcade type of rally that the previous Dirt games are and to get back to the gritty rally sim that this developer is renowned for creating. Update 05/08/2015A few months after release Codemasters have supported the games development by making improvements and making fixes. They have also included a ton of new content such as WRC FIA Rally Cross and Hill Climb and included the relavent rally car classes with the events.Dirt Rally is shaping up to be codemasters best rally game to dateUpdate 17/11/15As we get closer to the release of the game and the full RRP in December all i can say is buy the game now. The game has come a long way since it's ential early access release back in April of 2015. Codemasters have supported it's early access phase on Steam and have provided regular updates in the form of tweaks and game content. I find the online daily, weekly and monthly events worth while doing because you can see how you improve with time by using the world leaderboards as with these events you only have one shot to get over the finish line and provide your best time. Dirt Rally has also had input from professional WRC drivers to help with the authenticity of the car handling and rally stages which has certainly helped with how good this game has become. Go on Youtube their are videos of the drivers playing the game.   Their is no doubt about it apart from the co-driver that needs more tweaking forget all other rally games that are available on the market. Dirt Rally is the best and most realistic Rally sim that is available. If you are a fan of rallying and of the FIA WRC this game is for you. Final Release update 8th April 2016 I have seen this game be develop since it's day one launch into early access Dirt Rally was great then but light on content and the cars had a few balancing issues but over the past year they have provided content updates such as new cars, game modes, and system stability updates. At this moment in time i am enjoying Rallycross the most can't say why but i am. the final version of the game is supurb it is no longer light on content and the stability for pc is amazing and graphical wise in 1440p the game is beautiful it plays like a dream. I said it not long after Dirt Rally was released that it was shaping up to be Codemasters best rally game and it has this is the best rally game/simulater that i have played since Colin Mcrae back on PS1. This game is hard and unforgiving but very rewarding when you win. Put all other rally games down yes im thinking Sabastion Loeb Rally, WRC 2015 this is the only rally game you need. Codemasters you have done right by your fans keep up the good work, Excellent job with DIrt Rally you have really given what your fans were asking for :)			"

								I would recommend this game but the Degrees Of Rotation needs to be fixed, Most sim racers like my self come from Rfactor 2 and/or Iracing and Degrees of Rotation is a big thing setting aside the cars,tracks, and force feedback. For handling, I give it a 9/10For the game itself, I give it a 10/10For the cars, I give it a 10/10For the tracks, Again, a 10/10Overall it is a 9.5/10 from me. The whole real life turning your steering wheel a whole 900 degrees in order to turn the car and in the game it only looks like I'm barely even turning the car. I would REALLY want this fixed and I understand this takes a tremendous amount of time to work on but I hope it's sooner rather than later because the more the year passes by, the more racing genre games come out and the more other games come out and make people lose interest in the game while there are those that stick around because they are fans of the game and don't want to see it die out.

								The best rally game on the market. The sounds are bananas they are right to the T with every car. I just sat at the start line reving the Stratos for 5 minutes. The game plays like it looks incase you are wondering. However if you are a wheel controller person I have not been able to really find my wheel a good thing. The 360 is read. The force feedback is weak and there is no feel. However, since this is an early access I just used a xbox controller and I find myself not missing the wheel as much. If you like realstic (especially old school) rally buy this game. Good stuff.			"

								This game is SO great! I got this game in a package when buying my AMD graphics card not even knowing anything about it. I downloaded it and started playing it and it was not what I expected. It is NOT like most racing games in which you simply hold down accellerate and win. No, this game requires learning and strategy to pull off hairpin and right angle turns after a 50 meter plummet. I've only used a keyboard, but my friend uses a controller and he and I both highly reccomend you use a controller for this game -- as most racing games, to be fair.Anyway, once again, great, very well-created, detailed, challenging game.

								This is the game I've been waiting for, This is what I've always imagined as ''Forza Rally''. There's just no flaws really and its only Alpha, Graphics and enviorments are AMAZING aswell as the car physics. It's unforgiving and hardcore, after my first event I recieved a penalty instead of reward for being so sloppy which is AMAZING. Lets not forget the sound, guess what? its AMAZING. If you're having second thoughts about this game, DON'T! This is the best rally game to be released ever, BUY BUY BUY. +++Cred to Codemasters!			"

								Dirt Rally is probably the most realistic rally game and one of the best racegames ever made.I bought it because i am a fan of the Dirt series. The handling of the cars is pretty realistic which causes taht the game is very difficult. I am havin now 5 hours of play and i have never won an event. First it is really hard to get used to the steering, but after you find out that you have to use your gaspedal very carefully it is real fun.I can only recommend this game to everyone who loves rallygams and everyone loving racegames. I am really looking forward for the final version			"

								WoW ! This game is the best rally game since RBR. And for Codies, since the 1st Colin Mcrae!I've even not played GTA V since this came out! What more can you say!I was not expecting this at all, after the direction Codies have been heading for the last 10 years or more. Previous Dirt games have been drivel IMO and F1 games not great either.As for Dirt Rally, the physics feel pretty good, not quite up to the standard of iRacing,Assetto Corsa,rFactor 2. But it feels a million times better than anything Codies released for a long long time!A bit of work on surface bumps and FF and it will be right up there.I have a lot of sim racing gear. Fanatec CSW with V2 pedals. A Lightning SST H shifter, Triple screens. All this works with no fuss really. Multiple controllers are not a problem.It really is much more rally like, like the real WRC rally. There are stages and all you do is Rally. apart from messiing with crew members which is pretty cool too. There's none of that other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te!Thank you Codies! Please carry on making thisa a rally game, dare i say sim to be proud of! 11/10			"

								Codemasters made me fall in love with rally early in my childhood due to Colin McRae Rally 2 and 3.Now it has come to surprise us all with the early acces of Dirt Rally, a release with very good potential, and most certainly a very good startThe graphics are impresive, the sounds arn't even worth mentioning, if you play with headphones...you are thereThe driving model is very good and chalenging, still retaining some accesability, but much more close to a sim than an arcade if you turn all the asist off, every mistake will count and the tracks are unforgiving for that. It still isnt Richard Burns rally in terms of handling difficulty but it is there.This could very well be the Rally game that all of us have been waiting for.A very pleasant surprinse, well done Codemasters you brought my childhood back :DThis time show us you do care and make history.

												I wholeheartedly recommend DiRT Rally. However, there's a few things you should know if you're considering buying the game:It's brutal and unforgiving. This is not Forza -  if you crash your car so badly that you can't get back on the track, you get a hefty time penalty and some considerable repair bills to boot. If you mess up, the game will punish you.It's not really a game, either. This, friends, is a simulator. It's not branded like one, but it is one. If you want a game that'll let you be stupid and do ridiculous slides around corners, defying every law of physics ever written, then go play Project CARS or Assetto Corsa or something. If you want something that is about as true to life as a game can get, this is the game for you.Speaking of true to life, this game absolutely is. Handling the cars, despite being absolutely not cartoony, feels real. They feel weighty and if you try to do something stupid around a corner, you can feel the cars fight it. Especially if you're using a controller or wheel, which I would seriously recommend.The graphics and SFX don't detract from the atmosphere either. The game looks and sounds fantastic.All in all, this game is absolutely not for everyone. An acquired taste, I'd call it. If you want something you can hop onto every once in a while and burn some rubber doing doughnuts and drifts, look elsewhere. If, however, you want a gritty, true-to-life rallycross simulator with excellent graphics and sound design that's so immersive you can actually smell the petrolium fumes, DiRT is your game.			"

								IF YOU LIKE RALLY EVEN A LITTLE bit... BUY THIS GAME!This Dirt game is diffrent then 2 and 3. It droped the gymkhana (sorry for spelling) and focuses on the world of rally.This game is still in early access and with what is here pre hillclimb and any thing other then just time rally runs i already feel like my 31 bucks was worth it. i would have easily been satifed with paying 50 -60 for this in its current state, knowing that some things will be fine tuned and added.I dont feel like this is a normal dirt ""game"" i feel like this is a rally simulator a thousands times more then the original dirt. why? Because the terrain and weather make it feel like your actually on a gravel road or that snowy, icy tarmac mountain side that you might fall off around that next hairpin that you pulled the ebrake to early on. point is this makes me feel like im in a rally car cruising down some dusty windy road going way to fast. PROS (just the big ones)CLUTCH and H-SHIFT PATTERN SUPPORT FOR G27most wheels you can at least use gas , brakes and steering until support(or go buy a g27 like me cause you had to much fun with a thrustmaster and wanted to go all out)TIMED LAUNCHyou have to hold ee brake and floor it for best possible launch. too early you get docked -10 secDAMAGE and TEAM MANAGEMENTso you have at least 4 stages to get your car in one piece. between each race you can do repairs for time. with money earned from races you can get better team members and your repairing becomes more efficent.GRAPHICSTHEY ARE GORGEOUS at least as good as forza next gens, if not better.CO-DRIVERi had no clue exactly whathe was shouting but you will know what a left 2 dont cut is when you see it and understand so you can focus on what is coming up next. you can also make him shout it out earlier or later if the default timing is off to you. it really depends on how fast your taking it.CONSnot all wheels supportedearly accessno hill climb yetdamage is a lil to strong. car should get totaled if you go 80 into a wall. hope the y add a damge slider.

Only buy this game if you're into rally style racing this isn't a game isn't for everyone as it ONLY focuses on rally style racing! [Does a great job at it]4. Graphics look amazing maxed out with the exception of a few fancy settings but all textures at ultra at 1440p. [Solid 60Fps] - Changed to 1440p since I got a new monitor.5. Mistakes can cost you the race and or your car being a 100% loss for that run which just means be careful of your surroundings and sudden drop offs. [Been there done that]6.No BS ""Paid DLC"" all free updates and no microtransactions. Once you buy the game 100% of the content is free from there on.Cons:NONE at this time!===================================================================OVERALL: Great Game!(Will update my review overtime)			"

								The best rally game on the market. The sounds are bananas they are right to the T with every car. I just sat at the start line reving the Stratos for 5 minutes. The game plays like it looks incase you are wondering. However if you are a wheel controller person I have not been able to really find my wheel a good thing. The 360 is read. The force feedback is weak and there is no feel. However, since this is an early access I just used a xbox controller and I find myself not missing the wheel as much. If you like realstic (especially old school) rally buy this game. Good stuff.			"

								So awesome to finally get a real Rally driving game. I usually hate games where you get everything from the get go, but in this game I would love to pay money to buy all the cars, because I dont have time to play so much to unlock everything. The RallyCross and the HillClimb is also great features to have and I just love the variety of the cars! Just perfect! And the game is actively developed and updated! Would buy again!			"

								this game is a good simulation rally racer, its tough and requires you to learn and pay attention, you cant just mash the throttle and expect to do the best. it does have some issues running full screen with my gtx980m but it runs in windowed mode and it runs great and looks great. a must have for anyone who enjoys rally racing games.

												Dirt Rally is by far the best simulator I have ever had, ofcourse opinions are personal and everyone has one!I like the adjustability of the seats, the realistic feel, and sounds,the fact when your headlights are smashed up in a crash, you need to continue without lights, very anoying during a night stage, I can tell you that!!It was very hard to adjust from the crappy WRC1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, no matter what you hit during a stage, everything still works in this so called sim, but WRC is nothing more than a arcade game, a very flimsy bucket of rust with a very thin layer of chrome!Shame on you Milestone and Kylotonn to rip off your customers like that, You guys are a joke and you suck at what you do!Codemasters did what is right! Create a game that works, no fancy FIA/WRC licence, no disneyland, get the real simplayers on board with a realistic game that is hard that is true, but it is so much moreeee fun! Thank you Codemasters!			"

								I'm not going to give you a list of Pros or Cons for this game.What I'm going to say, is if you want a realistic, authentic and heart pounding corner clipping experience then buy this. That's it. There is no other game out there that has the Rally style down like this does. It's purely thrilling and ther satisfaction is real, because it takes real dedication to master each track and car. And it's only in Early Access....!I am looking forward to what this game has in stock for the future. So yes, buy this game right now.			"

								Yes, time for my review :-the handling, physiq of the car so far is good, except a few car that i cannot master, i don't know this is intended or not.-graphic is great , but sometimes the grass when on night look pixelaited.- alot of car (in my opinion ) this is rally of course not need for speed or gran turismo.-challenging track even the track is still few-the weather is nice-sound is superb-the difficulty on careers is something new, start from open to elite and if you can handle the elite you will be relegated ( nice idea ),something need to added ( in my opinion this can make the game more immerse )- can you add some cinematic wen win the series , like on the podium perhaps.-adding another damage (electronic so the co driver and the metric is doesn't show up or break)-adding split time between opponent, so you can catch up when opponet or you getting slow like on dirt1-3-adding random event like some log/rock or animal pass trough the roadcongrat codemater one step to make great rally game			"

I got stuck and as I was backing out the wheels were throwing snow on to the wind sheild very realistic loose snow flying up water splashs. this is the off road version of excellence thank you code masters.

												They fixed almost everything I thought was wrong with it. They must have listened to what the community had to say. DiRT Rally still lacks an open free sandbox simulator experience, where you can host your own servers, setup your own gamemodes and rally through the woods in whatever car, alongside a friend and throw on some mods... but it is Codemasters, so what to expect, really? The transition to a more sim-like experience was unexpected, so I guess we have to be thankful for that! In terms of simulating rally this must be the best one out there. Assetto Corsa still holds the throne as the best racing simulator with a more open ended approach. Host your own server, set your own rules, throw on some mods.. Maybe this ability will appear in DiRT sometime in the future, but who knows..			"

												I got this game a few months ago and all I can say is... it's easily one of the very best driving simulators I've ever played. I heartily recommend this game. Only issue I have is that all I want for Christmas is a G920 racing wheel!! I am sortof refusing to play it until I have a wheel. It's really hard going using a control pad. Flying around in a rally car at a million miles an hour using just an analogue stick is tough.Positives :Amazing graphics. Quality control settings. Extreme simulation. Nice presentation.Negatives : You loose the ability to blink.9/10 or 10/10 once i get my wheel :) :)			"

												What a game. I cannot stop playing it, but noobs beware: this will utterly destroy any shred of ""driving skill"" you think you have. Spend the time adjusting a wheel and experience a car the way a car should be experienced. That simple.The loving amount of detail, the accurate in car noises including the hollow ""tub"" impact sound of the shell, the frenetic exhaust spitting that is as visceral as it is correct...Most of all, if you are an AMD user, BUY THIS GAME. Fury X, maxed settings, 60fps everywhere. Locked. It's a glorious game worth twice as much as it offers, in a day and age where half the maps are cut out for 6 DLC's.Bravo, wunderbar, currently getting a budget for a full racing setup now.			"

												Bravo for Codemasters not leaving Dirt Rally in ""work in progress"" limbo like the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ racing sims. This game is amazing if you like rally racing. This was the best Early Access I've ever participated in. Be warned though, this game will squeeze every inch of driving skill out of you. Definitely not for the faint of heart. When you keep practicing and learn the nuances of rally racing, it blows up into one amazing experience like nothing else I've played. 130 mph in a group B rally car, just barely clip a strategically placed rock on the side of the tight dirt road, and flipped my car 13 times, only to have a tree stop me dead in my tracks.11/10, would flip and die again.

What more can you say!I was not expecting this at all, after the direction Codies have been heading for the last 10 years or more. Previous Dirt games have been drivel IMO and F1 games not great either.As for Dirt Rally, the physics feel pretty good, not quite up to the standard of iRacing,Assetto Corsa,rFactor 2. But it feels a million times better than anything Codies released for a long long time!A bit of work on surface bumps and FF and it will be right up there.I have a lot of sim racing gear. Fanatec CSW with V2 pedals. A Lightning SST H shifter, Triple screens. All this works with no fuss really. Multiple controllers are not a problem.It really is much more rally like, like the real WRC rally. There are stages and all you do is Rally. apart from messiing with crew members which is pretty cool too. There's none of that other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te!Thank you Codies!

								IF YOU LIKE RALLY EVEN A LITTLE bit... BUY THIS GAME!This Dirt game is diffrent then 2 and 3. It droped the gymkhana (sorry for spelling) and focuses on the world of rally.This game is still in early access and with what is here pre hillclimb and any thing other then just time rally runs i already feel like my 31 bucks was worth it. i would have easily been satifed with paying 50 -60 for this in its current state, knowing that some things will be fine tuned and added.I dont feel like this is a normal dirt ""game"" i feel like this is a rally simulator a thousands times more then the original dirt. why? Because the terrain and weather make it feel like your actually on a gravel road or that snowy, icy tarmac mountain side that you might fall off around that next hairpin that you pulled the ebrake to early on. point is this makes me feel like im in a rally car cruising down some dusty windy road going way to fast. PROS (just the big ones)CLUTCH and H-SHIFT PATTERN SUPPORT FOR G27most wheels you can at least use gas , brakes and steering until support(or go buy a g27 like me cause you had to much fun with a thrustmaster and wanted to go all out)TIMED LAUNCHyou have to hold ee brake and floor it for best possible launch. too early you get docked -10 secDAMAGE and TEAM MANAGEMENTso you have at least 4 stages to get your car in one piece. between each race you can do repairs for time. with money earned from races you can get better team members and your repairing becomes more efficent.GRAPHICSTHEY ARE GORGEOUS at least as good as forza next gens, if not better.CO-DRIVERi had no clue exactly whathe was shouting but you will know what a left 2 dont cut is when you see it and understand so you can focus on what is coming up next. you can also make him shout it out earlier or later if the default timing is off to you. it really depends on how fast your taking it.CONSnot all wheels supportedearly accessno hill climb yetdamage is a lil to strong. car should get totaled if you go 80 into a wall. hope the y add a damge slider.

								This game is sooo good. I tried it with 900 degree @ my G27. I'm gonna test it with 270 next time. The graphics are SUPER! And I have been waiting for a good-looking rallysimulator.Just the feeling of holding the handbrake before going off... man.Only thing is that I want some more feeling in the FFB, but that is it.  Seriously good job with all aspects ingame!!			"

								Thank you Codemasters.RBR is still great, but over 10 year is far too long time to play only ONE rally simulator.I can't wait to see what we are about to get when the game goes final. Keep up the good work. Don't make compromises. We want hard core driving.			"

												First review Good to get away from the arcade type of rally that the previous Dirt games are and to get back to the gritty rally sim that this developer is renowned for creating. Update 05/08/2015A few months after release Codemasters have supported the games development by making improvements and making fixes. They have also included a ton of new content such as WRC FIA Rally Cross and Hill Climb and included the relavent rally car classes with the events.Dirt Rally is shaping up to be codemasters best rally game to dateUpdate 17/11/15As we get closer to the release of the game and the full RRP in December all i can say is buy the game now. The game has come a long way since it's ential early access release back in April of 2015. Codemasters have supported it's early access phase on Steam and have provided regular updates in the form of tweaks and game content. I find the online daily, weekly and monthly events worth while doing because you can see how you improve with time by using the world leaderboards as with these events you only have one shot to get over the finish line and provide your best time. Dirt Rally has also had input from professional WRC drivers to help with the authenticity of the car handling and rally stages which has certainly helped with how good this game has become. Go on Youtube their are videos of the drivers playing the game.   Their is no doubt about it apart from the co-driver that needs more tweaking forget all other rally games that are available on the market. Dirt Rally is the best and most realistic Rally sim that is available. If you are a fan of rallying and of the FIA WRC this game is for you. Final Release update 8th April 2016 I have seen this game be develop since it's day one launch into early access Dirt Rally was great then but light on content and the cars had a few balancing issues but over the past year they have provided content updates such as new cars, game modes, and system stability updates. At this moment in time i am enjoying Rallycross the most can't say why but i am. the final version of the game is supurb it is no longer light on content and the stability for pc is amazing and graphical wise in 1440p the game is beautiful it plays like a dream. I said it not long after Dirt Rally was released that it was shaping up to be Codemasters best rally game and it has this is the best rally game/simulater that i have played since Colin Mcrae back on PS1. This game is hard and unforgiving but very rewarding when you win. Put all other rally games down yes im thinking Sabastion Loeb Rally, WRC 2015 this is the only rally game you need. Codemasters you have done right by your fans keep up the good work, Excellent job with DIrt Rally you have really given what your fans were asking for :)			"

Early Access Review
								DiRT Rally now leavs early access, so I am refreshing my revew.Long story short, DR is just amazing. If you wonderting DR is worth buying or not, this one would never let you down.Graphics do not seem to be best one around, but it is satisfying.Feels of driving, It's just solid, you can feel and imagine car's mass and how tyres are working.  Might be difficult for begginers of whole kinds of racing game, could be challenging. Unlike hardcore sims such as Assetto Corsa and rFactor2, cars of DR are much more manageable and still provides us with thrills when you push it to the limit. Sometimes it feels too quick to settle mass movement of cars but still fun.Contents: DR has several game modes not only ordinary rally(needless to say, it is great) but pikes peak and rally cross. To be honest, my personal Opinion on RX is not so fun but Pikes peak is much more fun and enjoyable. I want codies to add another stages of pikes peak and its cars.As you know, every game has cons, DR is not an exception even if those cons are minor ones. At first, DR lacks bits of online features and Credit earning and upgradeing cars are sometimes boaring.(But still better than games that have car editing system)Also lacks Ghost car(replay) feature,  sometimes pacenote goes wrong and no way to correct it. I don't know if anyone have read through this text but I hugely appriciate you guys and Codies' hard work! You did it Codies, keep going !			"

								I've only played for a few hours, but I can already tell this is the best rally game I've ever played. I spent a lot of time with the rallysport challenge games back on the xbox, and then with dirt3 on the PC. Dirt Rally is like an entirely new experience.Each track is difficult and unrelenting, and will push drivers' skills to the max. I've been playing with my 360 controller, and it works pretty well. The sounds are amazing, the graphics don't look bad either. The best part of the game is the handling. This game feels so realistic, I can hardly believe it. You can feel the front tires digging into the gravel while turning, something I've never felt in a game before. They've been adding content, and its all just feeling really good. Great work codemasters, this might end up being you're greatest achievement.			"

								Brilliant game, waiting for this for years. A little suggestion, when you for example puncture a tyre it would be nice to repair it in race for a penalty of 2 or 3 minutes, just like when you go off course and you recover the car and you receive a 15 sec penalty. There is no need for fancy animations or something, just a sub menu with some repairs on the go, in exchange for a time penalty, you can do this with the headlamps when you damage them in a night stage. It's a brilliant idea, isn't it :) please please make it happen and than it would be the best racing game of all times, not that it isn't right up there.			"

								Its Really Hard...Coming from someone who played Dirt Showdown and Dirt 3 I thought it was going to be a breeze like those two games. Its not. Codemasters have realy steped up their game here and it feels amazing 60fps on Ultra seems like your in the car and the attention to detail is amazing you can hear dash rattles when going over a bump or the engine revs high. But with that comes the driving, its like your actually rallying I had to turn all the helpers on and take most corses slow to get a feel with my logitech controller and even at that I still crash. I wish Codemasters would bring back the flashback feature to make fixing mistakes easy but that would take away from the realness of the game. Overall its awesome just be prepared for the challenge			"

From what I've played of it so far, I can say that it is very enjoyable and the learning curve is pretty easy to get used to. Overall it is a really great experince and I would recommend anyone interested in racing or cars in general to pick it up.			"

								IF YOU LIKE RALLY EVEN A LITTLE bit... BUY THIS GAME!This Dirt game is diffrent then 2 and 3. It droped the gymkhana (sorry for spelling) and focuses on the world of rally.This game is still in early access and with what is here pre hillclimb and any thing other then just time rally runs i already feel like my 31 bucks was worth it. i would have easily been satifed with paying 50 -60 for this in its current state, knowing that some things will be fine tuned and added.I dont feel like this is a normal dirt ""game"" i feel like this is a rally simulator a thousands times more then the original dirt. why? Because the terrain and weather make it feel like your actually on a gravel road or that snowy, icy tarmac mountain side that you might fall off around that next hairpin that you pulled the ebrake to early on. point is this makes me feel like im in a rally car cruising down some dusty windy road going way to fast. PROS (just the big ones)CLUTCH and H-SHIFT PATTERN SUPPORT FOR G27most wheels you can at least use gas , brakes and steering until support(or go buy a g27 like me cause you had to much fun with a thrustmaster and wanted to go all out)TIMED LAUNCHyou have to hold ee brake and floor it for best possible launch. too early you get docked -10 secDAMAGE and TEAM MANAGEMENTso you have at least 4 stages to get your car in one piece. between each race you can do repairs for time. with money earned from races you can get better team members and your repairing becomes more efficent.GRAPHICSTHEY ARE GORGEOUS at least as good as forza next gens, if not better.CO-DRIVERi had no clue exactly whathe was shouting but you will know what a left 2 dont cut is when you see it and understand so you can focus on what is coming up next. you can also make him shout it out earlier or later if the default timing is off to you. it really depends on how fast your taking it.CONSnot all wheels supportedearly accessno hill climb yetdamage is a lil to strong. car should get totaled if you go 80 into a wall. hope the y add a damge slider.

												i played colin mcrae rally 04 on ps2 when i was younger and that was amazing, i´ve waited along time to find a good rally game just like the old colin mcrae games, but i´ve never found one.One day i was seacrhing on codemasters page and i found this game DiRT Rally i thought it would be like Dirt 3 or something, But it wasn´t a DiRT game, this is a Colin mcrae game where the passenger tells you things you dont understand and dont listen do and just drive like crazy.This game is difficult and hard to play, i think this game is for the rally drivers and for the players that want a realistic experience of driving a rally car. The handling on the cars is very realistic.Dont buy this game if you want to play a game where you can drive like in GTA or some other racing games that are not realistic(i dont say that GTA is a racing game)10/1011/10 would drive in to the cliff again			"

Its even better than RBR and thats saying something. I havent really done any other SIM racing other than this since it came out, it really is that good. Strongly recommend you getting a Steering wheel and Pedal set for this though.

The popping from the exhuast of the Subaru, a beautifull sound, recognisible to any Scooby fan. Hands gripping the wheel with solid confidence as you fly through a gate, missing it by mere inches.

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I haven't liked racing games for soo long. But this game is something else. It looks SO realistic (maxxed out in 1080p) and the car handles like a real vehicle. I play from helmet view and the steering wheel (in-game) shakes with the ground realistically, the rumble in the 360 is realistic to the point you can drive based on it (just like in real life when off roading and feeling the road in your steering wheel), the weight of the vehicle is spot on, the sense of speed is spot on, oh my gawd I totally enjoy this game. The VERY FIRST TIME I played it i didn't crash but did a great lap! My real life driving skills (which are superrrb) translated perfectly into the game. I'm awestruck. This is so much fun I can't put it down. Even if you don't like racing games, GET THIS NOW. This is next gen ^2. It's remarkable. Ok. It's 4:36 am. Time to stop playing. Good night.			"

The game is just an absolute treat to all the senses. i have a medium powered rig but the game seems very well optimized for pc gaming, im able to max out nearly everything besides shadows and anti aliasing without much framerate drop at all. I find myself completely ignoring the campaign simply because i love hopping around all the rallies and trying all the different cars.  which brings me to my only gripe about this game.  it feels a little lacking in the way of content.  I know its a rally only game im not expecting a 200+ roster of cars.  But it seems to be completely missing some no brainer cars, for example the legendary celica gt four awd is missing. every single generation is absent.  the subaru legacy and mitsubishi galant vr4 were a few others i was really hoping to see. hell they have a whole class listed as 1960's rally, and it only has one car in it.  the game just seems incomplete in the way of a car roster.  other environments like desert, or more urban tracks would have been nice too with some rallies in africa or north america as a few examples.  Id recommend waiting til a sale and picking it up, for 30 dollars i am completely satisfied with my purchase, it is an amazing rally simulator that has gameplay that will not dissapoint.			"

												I'd happily give Codemasters my left testicle if they bring the AE86 into this game. This game is like the Dark Souls of driving games, it's gruellingly difficult and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who gets easily frustrated, but for any hardcore rally fans, this is the game for you.

												DiRT 2 was what I have played the most out of the DiRT Franchise. Even back from its initial release date in September 2009, the physics of the game were pretty impressive for the ""technology of its time."" The way the suspenion and tires handle from different terrains along with the style of driving you're using, the game really adapts to pretty much exactly how you want to drive. Now, DiRT Rally is utterly amazing. The physics have improved astronomically and are so close to really life it's not even funny. Again, the DiRT Franchise continues to be the best rally racing game I could play. All the way back from the original DiRT, I can't stop playing these games! I need to get use of my controller back!			"

												tl;dr:Only full throttle, 70% of the time in air, flying with 100km/h through a finnish forest in my mini cooper.8/10 would fly again with british airlines.Honest Opinion:At first it's very challenging and you need to get used to it. But after a few minutes of gameplay i found out that this game isn't really a sim (anymore?).I've seen a few gameplays from early access and most people said it was a sim, but it does feel a lot more like a simcade, thus it can be played with a normal controller, but a proper FFB wheel is recommended for maximum fun.Nonetheless it's pure fun as said before, flying through a finnish forest in a mini cooper, redlining it all the way in 4th gear. Also the graphics aren't that ultra high quality but that doesn't bother me much IMO, sounds are great and physics need to get used to at first but is really fun if you get the hang on it. And still it's very challenging. Plenty of cars and tracks to have fun on, so replayability is also great (even though i haven't had it for long now, but you'll never drive one track the same over and over again!). Carreer mode is good and will probably take time for me to get through. All in all: If you just want fun, maybe buy it in a sale or something for a little less. If you want a pure sim on the other hand, and come from games like Netkar Pro, Assetto Corsa etc., don't buy it. Best thing would be to try it via family sharing from a friend and see yourself if it's worth the price and if you like it.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic, certainly the most fun I've ever had in a racing game. There is a broad range of cars, and customization for tuning each vehicle. The courses, detail to realism, vehicle performance, and overall feeling is very well done. I spent my time in my first races yelling in frustration at the game due to difficulty, this enticed me to strive for improvement, which forces you to maintain complete focus of everything you are doing. As you improve after each race, it makes the challenge completely rewarding, and the true fun begins. Most racing games I have played are beautifully done in many ways although; I believe lack the challenge that is necessary to continue coming back. Dirt Rally, from my experience is the complete opposite of a typical, 'hold your hand', racing game. If you love racing games/simulators with a true challenge, this game is most certainly for you. *I would also suggest purchasing a wheel and pedals if you do not own one, it is not the same without (in my opinion).

												Dirt Rally is an exciting racing game, and a damn good one as well. I love this game, the challenge of trying to take corners with confidence while not flipping is insane. Some courses are 7 minutes of grueling turns and rapid successions of bends. I'd definitely recommend this game, but to people who'd rather have a more realistic game and not something aimed at the more casual racers.With all that being said there are somethings negative, the game does not support borderless windowed. Or at least not one that works like every other borderless window. The game sits below the taskbar and part of the bottom is cut off. Also you can't save replays and view them later, which really sucks if you make an anwser corner or run but can't record it.			"

The visuals are pretty good and I can get stable 60fps with my GTX 960 on ultra settings with 1080p. Audio quality is great.  Dirt Rally is lacking some features and ""features"" from previous games -- namely Replay Rewind that allowed you to undo any mistake or the 'annoying dude' telling you to 'upload that to youtube' ;) Removal of the rewind feature has made the game way more punishing, and at once, infinitely more rewarding.

												This is DiRT back to it's roots. Pure rally, no Gymkhana bullcrap. Amazing rally stages jam packed with nice details. Really good pace-notes most of the time, recorded properly, so your co-driver doesn't sound like a robot. A decent selection of cars, each with their own characteristics. And of course, rallycross and hillclimb are there as well.One thing I would like is a ""Repair all"" button when repairing your car between stages. In rallycross you have 60 minutes to repair, so unless you've had a really big wreck in a race, you will have time to repair the car with time to spare. It becomes a shore having to repair every component separately between each race.A must buy for rally enthusiasts. Just get ready to crash... a lot...			"

												Probably one of the most frustrating racing games i've played in a long time and i'm saying that in a good way, normally i'd setup the controls and from then on in it would be win after win. This wasn't the case for Dirt Rally which requires far more skill than just knowning your racing line, you need to read and take into consideration road conditions, camber, car type and always listen to the co-driver.What keeps this game fresh is that once you have master one type of car, you'll have the funds to move up to something more powerful which is a whole differnt ball game again. If you want a game that will challenge you and sick of the same old racing games - get this for sure. "

												DiRT Rally is one of the best rally based games I have ever played. From the ultra realistic handling model to the way cars behave on gravel, sand, tarmac, snow and ice. (Yes there is ice in this game). Well organized menu and a great selection of cars. Though I however would like more than one map for hill climb cars or bring back the Trailblazer cars. An account for ""Race-Net"" is required to play online which is annoying to make an account to play online. It took me 10 minutes to connect and create my account to play online. Worst of all, wheel users would be dissapointed for the fact that you're either gonna have to change the sensetivity or degrees of rotation of your wheel (420 degrees is my recommendation) or do alot of steering to turn the car in a direction. And it gets worst if you can't change those settings on your wheel. Luckily I can. To get 1st place is very hard even on the easiest difficulty *yes I know 5th and up is easy* but 1st place is a tall order. This game is not for arcade gamers, this is a simulation. If you want an arcady type rally game get DiRT 3.			"

												unfortunately there is no ""neutral"" score for reviews on Steam.I am giving a good one because it´s a good game, but i cannot suggest everyone to buy this game. it´s an awesome rally game, but it is NOT for everyone (me included - i made a couple of races, and asked for a refund).Frustration in this game is at ""Dark Souls"" level. It´s a simulation, and Rally simulations are incredibly hard.Assetto Corsa is also a hardcore Simulation, but you can still drive pretty ok because you are on asphalt, which makes a huge difference.So if you are a big fan and you don´t mind getting frustrated after the first race, go for it. Nice graphics, nice phisics, nice everything.If you liked the old Dirt games, absolutely do not buy this game. You will not like it at all and you will write bad reviews, that this game does not deserve.I warn you once again: this game is hard and it is not like the old Dirt games. "

												First off, I do not play this game for skill or anything in particular.It had a perfect Oculus-Support for the DK (though not yet for the CV).For me its a game I can jump into and have a few minutes of fun with driving through amazing tracks. They are really charming.With the Rift, the immersion is astounding. With a good wheel you can actually feel it, when losing a tire and have a look out the the drivers window to check on the left ones. :)I will give it an positive review, even though the Oculus-Support is broken for the CV.The review will be updated as soon as this issue is fixed.

Early Access Review
								DiRT Rally (DR) is the benchmark for rally sims in 2015, with rally, rally cross, AND hillclimb to play with. It has cars from the ancient Austin Mini to modern WRC cars, and everything in between, including the legendary Group B cars, and the courses selection is excellent, from gravel-y Greece to tarmac/snow Monte Carlo to dirt of Wales, and similar variety for rallycross, just somewhat less for hillclimb. The graphics engine is very scalable, and delivers surprisingly high frame rates even on older machines, as well as capable of mind-numbing graphics on triple-head setups (not that I have one, of course) with sufficient graphics horsepower. And the driving model, oh, wow, what driving model. It's been compared to the seminar benchmark, Robert Burns Rally, and compared favorably (as that game is out of print and only mod community are keeping it alive). And it has live multiplayer for rally cross, Steam integration, as well as online league support for rallies and hillclimbs so each can just race the event and submit it for the world to see. And there's even a bit of RPG, as you can play the career mode, where you start in the lowest rank and win your way onto higher ranks, unlocking better cars, using your winnings to hire engineers to help you tune the cars, and unlock upgrades, as well as perform repairs at the rally rest areas. And the best part? No more gymkhana. There is no more association with Xgames, and you won't see Ken Block and the gang any more. If you are even a LITTLE interested in rallying, you should get DiRT rally. You won't regret it.			"

												Labour of love and something of a return to form from Codemasters. They have set a very high standard to live upto for future release. Has been called the ""Dark Souls of racing games"" and with good reason, the slightest mistake will have you getting intimate with the local flora. This means that there is a long learning curve and a high difficulty level, but tremendous satisfaction when you do a clean run. There are plenty of stages, in a wide range of environments, from the snowy tundra of Sweden, through the forests of Wales, to the gravel canyons of Greece. There are also a wide range of cars ranging from the 60s with the Mini Cooper right through to modern day cars, including the fearsome Group B monsters - this adds a further dimension as each car handles differently and requires a different skill set to master.Highly recommended - even more awesome in VR - feels like you are actually in the car. A must-have for anyone who likes driving games.			"

												Excellent driving mechanics, and physics. It works well even on wheels without Force Feedback. I also tried it on a controller and it is still very serviceable. Sounds are great. Including Pikes Peak is icing on the cake. Learning curve is a bit steep but manageable, the tutorials do a good job of explaining how rally racing is different from track. On the other hand the game could have had more variety of cars and tracks, and the graphics are a bit dated, but I am so hooked that none of that bothers me. Overall an awesome game, and you should try if you're a fan of racing games.			"

												Flipped my Mini back onto its wheels, got an acheivement. 10/10 would Flip Again! On a more serious note, the game is very playable with a 360 controller, in fact, I score in the middle of the top tier daily with the 360 controller. The game has minimal issues compared to other sims, however there is less content then I expected, but certainly enough to keep me entertained. It's worth every penny at full price, since there is no DLC price-gouging (thank god). PS: if you're new to racing sims, I would recommend watching a few tutorials and buying a 360 controller if you haven't already. Though it is much easier to drive with a wheel, if you're willing to invest a pretty penny!			"

												 It's quite an amazingly good game. Definitely need a steering wheel with force feedback to get the full enjoyment out of it. I've never really been into gaming all that much but a few months ago I thought I'd try F1 2013 and got a T-100 wheel(on sale being dumped by one big on line place). Then Dirt Rally went on sale here at Steam and since I liked F1 2013 I crowbared the money out of the pocket and bought Dirt Rally. Having done a little bit of off road rally-esq type stuff in the past the realism is very refreshing over other arcade type comp games. The graphics are really fantastic as is the way the action and feedback is. Not actually being in a car in reality obviously loses the sensory input of feeling how the car is performing like being at the threshold of breaking loose and spinning out into vehicle recovery time penalty land but then it also isn't costly like that would be in reality either. Especially the part requiring hospital ER services lol!!! But I like it so much at this point that again it's crowbar the cash time to get a larger monitor since the current one is only 27""(Only?) So now I've started researching HDTV big screens for use as a dedicated monitor. So considering I've never been into computer games and want to do a big screen I guess that says something about how enthusiastic I am about Dirt Rally and F1 2013. I also have iRacing (but got it direct from their site).Dirt Rally I would recommend to anybody that's into auto racing comp games.  >:)			"

												The cars all drive about the same, nothing feels different in each class. Would have liked to feel like my car selection is based on engineering preference but it comes down to a much simpler formula of finding the best car in each category. But this is an Arcade racer, not a simulator. I'm enjoying it immensely when I don't have to race AI in RallyCross. The AI will fishtail, t-bone, and rear end you as a team. They never do it to each other and that makes racing them feel utterly ridiculous. That is a seriously bad flaw that destroys immersion like a shotgun to the balls.I definitely recommend this game but wait for it to go on sale. It's not worth full price as it is now and probably won't ever be. There just isn't enough truly enjoyable content. Rally is a great mode that this game excells in but Hill Climb and Rally Cross just blow all that Rally does right. Yes, there are a ton of cars to unlock, however, once you've driven one in each segment, you've driven all of them. The only major differences are in engine placement and drive wheel setup. And for each setup? They all drive the same.I have to say though that the Team Management aspect does make you feel like you're a part of the Rally circuit. It's cool picking your engineers and trying to optimize your cars' needs based on each one's basic flaws. It adds a layer of immersion that not all racing games are capable of doing.I feel the need to mention the distinct lack of realism in the reflection of finite details such as running your car in to a wall at 80mph sideways, then driving away in a straight line with almost zero change to handling and acceleration. That is what makes this a mostly arcade racer. There are sim elements but things like alignment never going bad, repairable tires, being able to grind on your driveshaft like a skateboard without snapping it in half, and your vehicle's uncanny ability to take critical real world damage and keep on keeping on is just silly.Fortunatley, this is a very fun game that offers hours and hours of enjoyment.Don't spend more than $30 on this game. It's fun but it's not great.			"

Dirt Rally will challenge you, it's mechanics, style and design are both mature and well thought out. Expect to come in the middle of the pack until you learn to drive these cars, but once you do you will push yourself until the sun comes up the next day. This is more than gaming, this is a lifestyle. This game can stand as the sole reason it's worth investing in a great computer and VR and it'd still be worth it. Rest in peace, Colin.			"

One rally you'll coast to victory and the next you'll have to spend hours learning the stages to beat one Ai driver that sets times minutes ahead of the rest. Victory seems to be scripted and it makes your time almost irrelevant, which is obviously dumb AF.			"

												This is probably my favorite game at the moment.  The steering and handling of the cars is very realistic.  Takes a bit of a learning curve but once you understand the controls it is a lot of fun.  Highly recommend going through all of the ingame tutorials and checking out tips on youtube.  Best Dirt series game I have ever played by far.  The details and the graphics are really good too.  Very impressive.  Great Job Code Masters!			"

												Flipped my Mini back onto its wheels, got an acheivement. 10/10 would Flip Again! On a more serious note, the game is very playable with a 360 controller, in fact, I score in the middle of the top tier daily with the 360 controller. The game has minimal issues compared to other sims, however there is less content then I expected, but certainly enough to keep me entertained. It's worth every penny at full price, since there is no DLC price-gouging (thank god). PS: if you're new to racing sims, I would recommend watching a few tutorials and buying a 360 controller if you haven't already. Though it is much easier to drive with a wheel, if you're willing to invest a pretty penny!			"

												I have a lot of games. I have very few that I've put hundreds of hours into. Dirt: Rally is one of those few. I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. It looks great, sounds great, feels great, even with a humble xbox 360 controller. The best compliment I can give Dirt: Rally is that it really feels like you're hurling metal down dirt roads at speeds that raise questions about your sanity. Give this game the time it deserves and you'll be pulling off sick corners that feel even better than they look. The daily/weekly/monthly challenges are great. Leagues are great. If I could reccomend one game on steam it would probably be this one. Its a no-brainer if you've ever watched rally clips and thought to yourself, ""that looks fun."" It is.			"

												It is the best current driving PC game, but that is because the others just dont work on PC's or are still in never complete development stages. The controller works (ps3 copy), but i have to add it everytime. A save controller setting button would be good and more insite to what the sliders accually do. As the current automatic save system does nothing. Its not a sim unless in real life you park the car up a wall at 90 degs once or twice on a stage or get yourself into so many arkward spots that you have to press the reset vehicle button. The car and track scale is off and the cars seam to wide. Looks and sounds good. The handling physics are great in places just not consistent. The are too many minor obsticals to spoil a run and kill the car (unrealistic). 6/10 a good start but a long way off completion.Edit: Na it's just another PC driving game that does not play well on PC full stopEdit: Plus there is no online player community. Had 4 lobbies less than 30 players in total each time. Its becoming an epic fail.			"

												Pretty good. Difficult, but if it wasn't it wouldn't be rally. The snow and loose gravel conditions are pretty harsh as can be expected. It looks good, it sounds good, the cars drive nicely. With a wheel and peddles it worked great. The upgrades system was sort of lacking a bit if you ask me. I am used to Gran Turismo's upgrades system so to me it seemed sort of bland. It has more of a Test Drive Unlimited upgrades system where you just get an engine package and you win it in a race and then it's already equipped for you. then you are upgraded. That's basically my only complaint. There could probably be a few more cars too but that aside it's pretty decent. It's fun. Rating: 9/10			"

												Perfect VRThis game is about perfect for VR gaming with a steering wheel. Unlike another popular racing game out there for VR, this game allows your head to stay in line with the road. Just like in real life. So the result is, no motion sickness. All racing games should set their head perspective the way Dirt does. Aside from that, there are insane numbers of tracks, lots of cars to drive. I love this racing game and I would say this is now the absolute best racing game for VR out right now.  "

Early Access Review
								Just came from Dirt 3 (which I absolutely love) to this game. I agree with most people that the ""dude-bro"" feeling of Dirt 3 is pretty lame, but the game itself is absolutely top notch. Although, however good the game is, I was getting bored with how good I am at Dirt 3. So I read the reviews talking about how hard Dirt Rally is and decided to give it a try.I. LOVE. THIS. GAME. At the time of writing this review, I've only had Dirt Rally for about a day or so. When I first booted the game up, I instantly sucked at driving all over again, and I loved every minute of it.  It gave me a feeling very similar to what I feel when I play Gran Turismo. Learning how to really drive and use the Power Brake PROPERLY was a real challenge but I'm starting to get used to the way the cars handle. Speaking of the handling, it's perfect. With a little fiddling around in my controller settings, I was able to make the vibration controller link with my suspension and tire grip, which really lets me feel the weight, momentum, and grip of my car, EVEN ON A CONTROLLER!Some reviews are saying the controller support isn't all that great. I have to agree that, Out-of-the-box, the controller support IS a little wonky. Don't let this deter you from buying the game though, as a little fiddling with the sensitivity and linearity in the controller options will perfect the experience on a game pad. The tracks are open, long, and full of hazards that will end your run and kick you in the pride. They have a good number of tracks ALREADY and their version of pikes peak is not only awesome to drive, but it really does look like your in Colorado when you're driving it (I'm a colorado native so I REALLY appreciated that). With a handful of more tracks and cars, this will be the greatest rally sim ever made, and I mean that. GOOD JOB CODEMASTERS! If any of you read this, I am incredibly impressed with this game, and every one of you should be very proud. The sound, The handling, The environment, The effects...all on point. 10/10 ""I'm loving sim racing again""			"

												This is DiRT back to it's roots. Pure rally, no Gymkhana bullcrap. Amazing rally stages jam packed with nice details. Really good pace-notes most of the time, recorded properly, so your co-driver doesn't sound like a robot. A decent selection of cars, each with their own characteristics. And of course, rallycross and hillclimb are there as well.One thing I would like is a ""Repair all"" button when repairing your car between stages. In rallycross you have 60 minutes to repair, so unless you've had a really big wreck in a race, you will have time to repair the car with time to spare. It becomes a shore having to repair every component separately between each race.A must buy for rally enthusiasts. Just get ready to crash... a lot...			"

Just playing those alone worths it.I played rally games looong time ago, played dirt 3, and a lot of other racing sims (AC, PCARS, GRiD Autosport), but out of EVERY car driving game I played ever since I've got my wheel, this is the most enjoyable, most competitive, and less frustrating !

												My final review.What I liked:- Handling and Physics: Handling feels solid and physics adds wheight to the vehicle.- Graphics: Oh man, the landscape looks soo beautiful, also long lasting dust cloud and particles effects/tesselation!- Well optimized: Running this game with an HD7870 with medium/high settings at steady 60fps- Night time, car headlights.- Ultra realistic engine sound.- Cockpit viewWhat think is missing:- ""Ghost Car"" For personal best time in rally mode as well as in multiplayer. (One of the old Collin Mcrae games had this feature) it's nice to know where your friend made a mistake and whatnot...- More carsWhat I didn't like:Playing with the Xbox360 controller;As much as I enjoyed playing the game for the first 60hours, on tracks like Sweden - BjorklangenI started getting bored and sick of playing, the track is surrounded by snow banks, if one of the front wheels of the car even touch it, the car spins out. As if it wasn't enough the track is slippery and narrow as ♥♥♥♥♥. The experience then becomes tiring, frustrating and dull.Overall: 8/10.			"

												I bought this game during early access, the moment it became available, played for a while, and recently got back to continue playing...I'll give it 8.5/10 !!This is my chill & just drive go to game, where I enjoy the driving process, handling is amazing, tracks are as well, and whenever I reach the end of a stage I just rewatch the replay, because it is A.MAZING !There are several categories to race in, hillclimbs, and small compact races.On race net there are new challanges every day, every week, and every month. Just playing those alone worths it.I played rally games looong time ago, played dirt 3, and a lot of other racing sims (AC, PCARS, GRiD Autosport), but out of EVERY car driving game I played ever since I've got my wheel, this is the most enjoyable, most competitive, and less frustrating !

 Dirt Rally  is nothing like the racing games which I've played before, it isn't as arcady and punishes you for every mistake you make. If you don't have any experience with similar titles you may struggle in the beginning just like I did.But be patient, after hours of hitting rocks, driving off cliffs and raging, it's gonna be the best racing experience you ever had as you try to master every track.What I like most about this game is how much variety it brings. No track feels like the other, as you drift through sands, try to maneuver over ice and snow and speed through mud. And all of them look amazing too.			"

For whatever reason I'd simply never been able to get the same kick out of other general racing & rally games since, but this has most definitely changed all that. My very first race - obviously a little rusty and so coming last place - I had a huge grin plastered on my face.The sound design, car mechanics and attention to detail is just so good and from what little I've seen so far, it looks as though there's a stack of content; this is a definite buy for any fans of racing games.

								Finally - A racing game I'm terrible at.... Seriously I spent the first few hours way off the pace, or in a treeAfter years of Rally Games being a virtual representation of a Ken Block's party bus, we've got a proper one at last.  I'm a regular of the Assetto Corsa, Rfactor and similar sims - but have always had a soft spot for rallying, even if that meant playing DiRT 2 and 3.  With narrow stages and cars that handle like they should means a much better experience,  Ignore the whiners complaining that they can't drive, and the NFS crowd complaining about a lack of sense of speed - Threading a group B car through the welsh forests gives you a sense of speed.Also the World Rallycross is ridiculous fun - Even if the AI is a little slow even in the Official championship or Masters difficulty.My advice - If you have a wheel (I'm rocking a rather old Driving Force Pro), buy this game - turn off all the assists and get going, at first you'll be struggling to keep the mini on the road and keep up with the leaders, but once you're over the learning curve it is completely worth it.

Wheel is recommended, almost required. This game does not hold your hand, it has no tutorials or anything like that. Just pure Rally.			"

								First DiRT game ever, and first rally game ever.Absolutely love this game so far. Beyond my expectations.Excited to see what's to come in updates, as this is already a solid game that will no less than go down as one of the greatest rally sims of the modern time. Yes I say sim, because this doesn't play as easy as a game does. You really have to know what you're doing, what to brake, when to cut, where to ride to cut your time down. I've played tons of racing games over the years, as well as a few sims. Nothing compares to how difficult, yet rewarding this one is. When you do hit that hairpin just the right way, or you do follow that crest jump the right way, nothing feels better than coming out without a scratch, because trust me, as you learn there will be many of them. After about an hour or so of looking up what the hell my co-driver was saying (mind you, new to rally here) I jumped back in and learned my car. Shakedowns will save you for those tricky deceptive junctions and turns you'd normally go too fast on, everything in this game is a missed opportunity if you don't take it. Easy to try, but absolutely hard, yet fulfilling to master. Can't wait for more cars and trials, I'll be playing this for a LONG time.			"

												To me this game reminds me of single track mountain biking only with a Rally Car.  I have played codemaster games for many years Dirt, Dirt 3, Showdown and this game is challenging and gruelling.It is difficult to go full speed compared to Dirt 3 for example, the driving physics are very ""real"" and starting out you will flip your car and hit things.  Once you get over the learning curve the game really has no equal in driving sims.  The terrain has so many different levels it is hard to drive the same ""line"" ever. Online play is great, kind of lonesome without people to race against.  You just race against their time, but the ""Bonus"" credits are welcomed in a game where it takes a while to buy the cars.Overall codemaster has created a game for the driving ""gamer"" and harcore codemaster fans will certainly enjoy this title.The UI is very good, clean and easy to follow with ""huge"" buttons.  Buy this game if you enjoy codemaster games.  If you enjoy playing with ""real"" people buy Showdown.Thank you,Later  "

												Dirt Rally has become an obsession for me. After getting my G27 configured correctly this game came to life.That is no exaggeration. You will find yourself leaning into the turns and wincing as you come close to rocks and trees.The Sound is great! The rocks pinging off the fenders, the engine roaring, the gearbox sounding off, and the co-driver calling out directions all add so much to the realism. The co drivers voice will shake during those tense moments. Just terrific! The car selection is ample and tunable. The visuals are very good while the game easily runs 60fps at all times on older rigs. Choice of rally locations are a bit limited and stages are derivations of a single large track within each location. Everything about the gameplay is exceptional. The menus however are not good in my opinion. They are the worst part of this game. Getting into a quick race isn't ""quick"". A screen for picking the region. A screen for picking the stage (vague description of the stage). Ascreen for picking groups of cars. A screen for picking the actual car you want to use. A loading screen and three clicks once loaded to get into the race. Options for the racing wheel are split between the regular control options and within your in-game profile. This had me scratching my head for a day or two. I had to look it up online before I could even use the game. Menus aside this game is contagious to anyone who has joined me in my game room. I Love it and so will you. -Scott			"

Highly recommended for those who are experienced virtual rally drivers and to those who want to make a first step towards the world of rallying!			"

Some people already running their mouth that it is't real deal, well now here look's just like that, and the rally's are all based to real roads and countries but not full rallye's. These are rallies for gamer's and it's just good in that way. RBR didn't have real rallye's, so didn't that good WRC in PS2... 1,2 and Evolved... something like that, plus C-M's. Keep it going Codemasters, you have already made the best rally game ever!			"

								""left 3, dont cut"", *cuts* off into the tree's.  11/10 would cut again.In all seriousness, I don't think Codemasters could have made a better decision by doing early access. On every forum, including Reddit, Steam, and codemasters forums, they take all the feedback from us to better the game for US. I like that in a developer and appreciate everything they've done with this game. The only thing I REALLY think needs work is the force feedback. It doesn't seem natural. When you slide into a turn, the wheel is fighting you when you turn the opposite way you turned in, the wheel should be easier to go back the opposite way, and fighting the way you turned in. Other than the force feedback, and the GOD DAMNED BUSHES in Finland, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone.

								Dirt Rally is an incredibly good driving sim, its is almost hard to believe this game is not even finished yet.  Even since version 0.5 this has felt like a complete game.  The driving physics are spot on, the graphics are incredible.  This is one of the first true ""next"" gen experiences out there today.  I am sometimes shocked at just how amazing this game looks.  The textures are out of this world. The rain and snow and night time environments are exceptionally well detailed.  With every update they seem to add more and more content.  Perhaps the only thing it is missing is a Lancer Evo rally car.  There's a huge variety of locations and cars.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for this title.  I'm not sure how this game does not have more hype behind it, it does not seem like alot of people are talking about this game...but they should be!			"

												Best Rally game in a very long time, DiRT Rally is a huge improvement over previous dirt releases in terms of physics and realism. This is the first racing game i've played where you cant just hold throttle down mindlessly on every straight, because if you do the game is going to punish you. The feeling of speed is conveyed really well, and going fast really feels like you are taking a risk. The career mode  in my opinion is the only part of the game that needs improvement, saved only by the online career events help keeping it fresh. The career mode would be improved if there were more stats kept on how you've done, including best times for each stage, more events & different championships (Group B Hillclimb anyone?) Currently you can either do an event, check your garage or check on your engineers.. The ability to employ engineers does add some depth with the perk system giving you the ability to fit your crew around how you race. Overall, if you enjoy jumping into a game and simply racing you'll enjoy DiRT Rally, if you want to play around with cars in the menus this game may not appeal to you as much. Overall, This game is a huge step up from previous releases, and i'd recommend it to anybody who enjoys sim racing games. This game may be difficult for a casual player to pick up and be competitive immediatly, but in my opinion the difficulty is part of what makes the game rewardable when you do finally nail that perfect run.

												So a while ago I bought my self a wheel with sequential shifter and three pedals to get more into racing sims because I was really hyped for Assetto Corsa but I quickly realised that I bought a wheel for rally cars and driving race cars with it was a pain. So I stopped playing Assetto Corsa and the wheel started collecting dust in a corner. I kept looking at it thinking I wasted my money. Fast forward to when Dirt 3 was given away for free and after the first rally event I was hooked. Sadly, Dirt 3 was way too easy and also way to annoying for me (Duuuude... You should totally put that to YouTube). So I started looking for a good Rally sim and the top game that I find everywhere is Dirt Rally. Well let's just say that there no longer is dust on my wheel and that I managed to start sweating in front of my pc even though it's winter time.This game is a lot of fun, challenging and really good looking. All the dream cars from the good old rally days are in it, you can customize your cars setup to every detail and while it is a sim and it certainly is all business and serious while you're racing a stage it still doesn't take itself too serious outside of that (No... Seriously don't cut).So if you're looking for a rally sim that is easy to get into if you're a noob (All the assists are there and the stock setups for the cars are really good and can get you pretty far and if they no longer cut it you can start fiddling with your bits and then shakedown.) but can give you a challenge even when you're quite experienced then look no further Dirt Rally is your game!Tl; dr: Buy it, it's a good game!

								This early review is based on Dirt Rally v0.3 (the launch version).So, Dirt is back and with big promises of authentic rally. Indeed, Dirt Rally has ditched all that controversial ""dude bro"" attitude and trick race mentality Dirt 2 brought onto table. While I never felt Gymkhana was a bad test of skill, it's refreshing to see a new rally game from Codemasters that focuses on the core experience. Dirt Rally is all about cars, stages and notes. The vehicles dance from side to side on quite narrow roads. You have only little room for error, especially since the Rewind function is gone. If you go out, you can continue but with a hefty time penalty. If you crash hard, you will break your car. Repairs are available in between stages, but everything is time consuming and you may risk getting additional penalty. Also, repairs cost money that is reduced from your earnings - making it more difficult to hire better engineers and buy better cars, some of which cost over half a million.Simply put, the design encourages to pay attention on stages. Listen to the notes and prepare to swing the car around a corner before you see it. It's a game of high risk, high reward.The gameplay is rather engaging. Of course, this is a highly subjective area, but I think there's great sense of speed (helped by solid game engine that's pushing 60fps with lesser-than-recommended hardware), making it almost scary to race flat out. Variable road surfaces can give you wildly different levels of traction. Left-foot braking is useful, and without assists, you need to be careful not to lock brakes as it will make the car slip straight out. You can even stall the engine if you don't keep your revs up in hairpins.The difference to previous Dirt games is clear enough - however, compared to Richard Burns Rally Dirt Rally doesn't seem quite as deep and demanding. For e.g. it's easily playable with a gamepad (Xbox 360). That can be a good thing, depending on how you look at things, but perhaps Codemasters could make the handling a bit more unforgiving for the hardcore, while still maintaining playability with optional assists. Especially the fastest cars seem to slow down too much when you let go of gas. I suspect real rally drivers need to use the brake pedal more actively to control their speed.In the current version there're only three events, each containing a dozen (or so) of stages. As in previous Dirts many stages are actually smaller sections of longer ones and you'll drive these in both directions. This is where the main weakness currently lies. To make Dirt Rally a worthy successor of the legendary Colin McRae games, Codemasters need to work hard on events and stages to avoid repetition. And as far as they have said, that's the plan.But in its current condition, Dirt Rally is just a promising game that's missing a lot of ""something"". I have enjoyed it so far, but then again, there's not much competition around these days. While I haven't encountered any major bugs, the thin content is a telltale sign of Early Access, and if you are on the fence on this, you may want to wait and see a couple of updates before buying.

								So far great and fun Rally game. It is already in a great playable state, with an exlusive chance to become RBR killer if community will be very strong.Easily worth money.			"

Early Access Review
								tl;dr; very promising, but needs better force feedback asap!The early access only came out today, so this is just a point in time observation after 2,4 hours of driving 3-4 cars on 3-4 stages - it's a lot of fun, especially with the Oculus Rift DK2 on!Graphics are good, but can of course always get better. Luckily, with a rally sim, this is more than good enough. I mean, you won't have time consider the number of polygons in a tree unless you park in one. I also guess that codemasters are very efficient, With my GTX 970 the default gfx settings in Dirt Rally are set to ""ultra"", and I still can't hear the fans spin up.  And while things aren't as detailed and shiny as other recent sims out there, the weather  and daylight effects are beautiful, and driving in both rain and moonlight was a blast. And, oh my god, the sound of the group B cars... This might just be why I couldn't hear the fans on my graphics card :)The bad part - remember, this is early access day 1 - is the force feedback. After trying many different settings on my G27 I'm still not feeling it. I really need more information from the wheel to get the level of immersion a simulation like this requires, so I can't really tell how ""realistic"" this feels yet. That said, driving on snow, mud and gravel seems to be close to what I guess the real thing is like, but on asphalt the cars seem a tad too planted. Looking forward to seeing this title develop in the future!			"

Early Access Review
								I've never bought a DiRT game before. I've always pirated them because of my disappointment at their arcade-ness, and general lack of any realism. I don't buy early access games anymore. I definitely don't buy games on the day of their release. And certainly I do not buy games without reading in depth reviews first.That's why it shocked me when I found myself reading the release announcement for this game and my mouse pointer heading for the buy button.Codemasters have got this game so right, and it isn't even done yet. Every single aspect of the development process has actually paid attention to what the type of person who plays this kind of game wants. They've finally listened to all the complaints, and they've built a fantastic rally game. It shows. Right down the readme folder with instructions for how to hack on the game in various ways.I had some issues getting oculus set up, and honestly, even now it ain't set up right and it feels like i'm watching the world through muddy water. That said... the immersion of driving that 1960s mini, with no hud, no overlays, along some desert stage, feeling the understeer and the lift off oversteer the way it should be. Actually having to work the car in and out of the corners instead of just spinning the wheel and burying the throttle the way that you would have done it in DiRT/2/3. The feeling is intense and just amazing.Thank you codies, for finally listening, and for making the game that so many people have desired since RBR.			"

								Love it so far. I see a lot of comments about it being a sim and if you liked Dirt3 or don't use a wheel then this isn't for you. This is not true. I bought this on the back of those comments thinking I might not like it because I do like Dirt3 and I don't have a current working wheel but I find it easy to get into and have played for several hours in my first sitting and love it.It is more challenging and less forgiving but still awesome. Don't be put off by those comments. Give it a go if you love rally. It's really good. It doesn't have those reverse time options but I never used them anyway. edit: btw i use a xbox 360 conroller, i have a gt force but it doesnt work with win 8.1 :(			"

								AT LAST - THE NEXT-GEN COLIN MACRAE RALLY GAME THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVBER BE MADE - HAS BEEN!Be under no illusions - this is a dream come true - as others have already said -  its like the Codemasters have listened to me personally and given me everything I've ever wanted  in a reboot of the old (pure) CM Rally series. They've also extracted all the tiresome shouting and 'Americanisation' of the recent titles.Not only that - for an early acces game it already scales to your PC like a dream (I'm running it at 7680x1600 - across three DELL 30"" monitors with a mix of HIGH and ULTRA settings and its silky smooth).The pace notes are the best in any rally game (ever) and the new visual indicators and voice acting are unsurpassed.Even the menu music is exactly to my taste.BUY IT - it will bring all those memories from 20 years or so ago flooding back.THANK YOU SO MUCH CODIES!

								Not really played much yet but the gameplay time as of the writing of this review I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone.Whilst being in early access it feels extremely polished. The optimization of the game itself is well above average, 100+ fps with  ~50% CPU and GPU usage using full ultra settings. (i5-4690k and a gtx 970)Whilst I'm not a big fan of rallying in general I fell in love with the games on the xbox 360. Will test more before I give a full review as I've only done 8 stages. "

								As much as I enjoyed DiRT 1/2/3 in parts... this is the game I've always wanted. I've not had the same thrill and fun since Richard Burns Rally (although saying that, it is far far more forgiving than that ever was).A rally school would be a nice new feature, but I'm not really interested in the proposed rallycross additions.

								Hi,Really excited about this early access release.Didn't expected anything in the near future and the BAM!! WhooohoooI used to love colin mcrae 2!This I'm gonna love too. Only thing I've noticed that bothers me a little bit is the handling : It feels like the game is helping you in every turns. I tried disabling all the driving assist but on some courses, I barely turn the wheel at every corners and it makes me turn perfectly or almost. Didn't feel it in the first few races but on a monaco in snow track, it was almost doing the hairpins for me.I use a driving force GT. But overall very excited about this new game! awesome!!!!			"

												Thank you Codemasters for bringing a true Rally game. I'm currently using a controller, but plan on getting a racingwheel/stand JUST for this game. It is the most fun/frustrating thing ever as I grit my teeth and hang on for dear life sliding through the slopes and turns of trees, snow, dirt, and asphalt. SO worth it. I highly recommend this to any true racing fan. Graphics - 10/10Audio - 10/10Physics - 9/10Fun - 9/10Difficulty - 10/1010/10 would burn through a set of tires. (Also, FREE DLC and updates left and right with new content?!?! Who wouldn't want to be a part of this??)			"

												So a while ago I bought my self a wheel with sequential shifter and three pedals to get more into racing sims because I was really hyped for Assetto Corsa but I quickly realised that I bought a wheel for rally cars and driving race cars with it was a pain. So I stopped playing Assetto Corsa and the wheel started collecting dust in a corner. I kept looking at it thinking I wasted my money. Fast forward to when Dirt 3 was given away for free and after the first rally event I was hooked. Sadly, Dirt 3 was way too easy and also way to annoying for me (Duuuude... You should totally put that to YouTube). So I started looking for a good Rally sim and the top game that I find everywhere is Dirt Rally. Well let's just say that there no longer is dust on my wheel and that I managed to start sweating in front of my pc even though it's winter time.This game is a lot of fun, challenging and really good looking. All the dream cars from the good old rally days are in it, you can customize your cars setup to every detail and while it is a sim and it certainly is all business and serious while you're racing a stage it still doesn't take itself too serious outside of that (No... Seriously don't cut).So if you're looking for a rally sim that is easy to get into if you're a noob (All the assists are there and the stock setups for the cars are really good and can get you pretty far and if they no longer cut it you can start fiddling with your bits and then shakedown.) but can give you a challenge even when you're quite experienced then look no further Dirt Rally is your game!Tl; dr: Buy it, it's a good game!

Early Access Review
								ITS A GREAT RACING GAME! 8/10 you should buy it. here is the negative review on things they should considerits not 100% ''sim like racing'' but not the crew either and way better then grid autosport WITH a g27.the racing once you have a good setup is very nice, there aint no story line, at all. you do a beginner championship and if you win, you go up in a harder category until you reach the maximum level. thats it.  Online is ok, a bit of ramming but people are not that bad and LEAGUE PLAY is pretty cool if you join a group on facebook and talk with people posting they're result and pic.the big cons for me  (its a great game dont get me wrong) the first grid had a history where you were buying better car on ebay and build your own team and it was very addictive. on this one you hire engineer to help you repair damage between round but there aint no cut scene or wtv. there is a money system to buy cars but it doesnt feel like climbing the ladder to be the king of anything. #2 you NEED A HANDBRAKE and this can be frustrating to buy a 200 or 400$ handbrake or to build one that look bad and isnt so reliable...#3. its pretty hard to configure the steering to get good settings and the game only use 540 degree (or somtin like that) so you can use 900 but the hands of the driver will stop half way and you dont get any advantage.

												I drove over a bump in Finland and landed in Sweden. Unforgiving but not frustrating. Would benefit from some tutorials or ways to practice a sequence of corners without having to restart the whole stage. Runs well on Ultra on a mid-tier PC, but AMD cards have some issues with transparency aliasing which is ugly and annoying.			"
