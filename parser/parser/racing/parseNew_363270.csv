Early Access Review
								Offroad 3DX is a physics based point to point racer, not dissimilar to the Trials series, albeit with some interesting and innovative twists.Gameplay:First off, although very accessible, O3DX is hard..... Very hard, you won't be flying through the levels like in other physics racers. After the first few tutorial levels are finished, you'll have to work hard, just to get to the finish line on most maps. The first thing that stands out in O3DX is the fact that although you can only move your vehicle on a 2D plain, all the levels are rendered in 3D. This gave the developer, the ability to add things like tricky, slow corners and dynamic camera views. Mastering the levels requires a mix of leaning forward and backwards as well as clever management of the brakes and acceleration, as you progress through the levels, the game also throws some quite tricky puzzle elements at you, these portions of the game can't be solved with horsepower, only brainpower. If I would have any criticism about the gameplay at this point, it would be that each level forces you to use a particular vehicle, whether it's a big heavy 4x4 or smaller ATV style vehicles. Some customization options would go a long way, not just on what vehicle you can use, but also livery's and other options to alter the appearance of each of the vehicles. At this point in time, they come how they come, like it or not.  That being said, each one feels distinctly different and are very fun to drive.Graphics:For the most part the graphics are amazing, the actual levels themselves are beautifully crafted, with great textures and animations throughout, light shafts illuminate the environments and sometimes you can't help but give the environments more attention than the task at hand. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the majority of the vehicles, while some look OK, others look a little low-res and somewhat stand out (I'm looking at you Jeep.) That being said, the game is still in Early Access and I'm sure that at some point,  the developers will give the vehicles the same love they have given to the beautiful environments.Controls:Controls are fully redefinable through the launcher, which is always a nice feature. The default keyboard controls are simple but very intuitive, responsiveness is nice too, I've crashed and blown up many vehicles during my time with O3DX, but at no point did I feel the controls were to blame for my demise. At the point of writing this review, I have been unable to use my Xbox 360 controller, this seems to be a known bug that has been acknowledged by the developers, according to a forum post, a patch to fix this issue will be published in the very near future.Summary:O3DX is a very well realized point to point physics racer, it offers some new and interesting innovations to the standard formula and they have executed these innovations very well, Easy to get into, but very hard to master, perfectionists will spend hours mastering each of the games levels and even if that's not your thing, O3DX will still consume plenty of your time, The graphics although a little substandard at times, will completely wow you for the majority. If you're a fan of games like Trials or Joe Danger, O3DX is right up your street. I'd have no hesitation in recommending O3DX even at this early point of development. It's not quite there yet, but even now, it's more polished than other games that have already reached the end of their development. At this moment in time, I'd give O3DX a 7.5 / 10.			"

Early Access Review
								Take a bit of Trials Fusion, add a splash of Joe Danger, and cover it in DIRT: O3DX is a whole lot of fun.You control an off-road vehicle that you race along a set track. The game is on a 3D map but your vehicle automatically stays on a linear path -- the gameplay and skill is where you rev up the gas, where you apply the brakes or handbrake, and, most of all, where you lean forwards or backwards to keep control during the big jumps and steep climbs. One mistake and you could stall, hit explosive barrels, or even fall off the track completely.Each of the (currently) 30 levels may be relatively short, but it's a challenge to reach the goal for each one. And that doesn't even go into the fact each level has several stars to collect, some of which require fine-tuned controls to take an alternate path (often a lower or higher level than is easily reached); as well as a set time to beat.Graphics look beautiful, with sun flares, dust or snow kicking up beneath your wheels, and atmospheric effects like rain or snow on certain levels.There is also a lot of variety in levels, from deserts with dusty hills and mesas, to lush fields with ruins, to snowy hills.The game has a nice thumping soundtrack throughout that really fits with the theme of wanting to go fast, keeping the adrenaline pumping. The vehicle engine sounds also sound real, as if you're really close to the action.The game  has a few minor bugs which should be fleshed out during the early access period, but it's very much playable and fun to do so,			"

								I have played while under Early Access Alpha version and it only had a few bugs, nothing gamebreaking.The game overall comes out really fun, like a rollercoaster ride, but also gets more challenging as you play.+Pretty cool Menu Setup, easy to navigate around in.+Alright Graphics.+Audio is good with some nice rhythm music.+Very easy gameplay controls, but can be hard to master at times.+Challenging gameplay.+Steam Trading Cards ;)+/-Might become too hard at times, some levels turned out to be very challenging for me :)+/-No Checkpoints, i put this as plus/minus cause i think its a matter of personal opinion, this is also a huge part of why the game feels so challenging and hard at times.-Overpriced abit compared to what it has to offer, not much, but just abit.-No Achievements and no unlockable extra content.-Physics feels like it needs abit more work, it can be very hard to control and also makes buggy things at times, such as driving through obstacles can make your car fly around and explode so you have to start over.Overall during Early Access, i will give the game a 6,5/10.

Early Access Review
								cooles spiel, mal eins bei dem man nicht selbst lenken mussand now more in english:The Good: Yes, I recommend O3DX. It’s a fresh new approach to sidescrollers. In fact, it’s kind of a blend between a side-scroller, a physics puzzle racer with a little bit of rally in-between. Great fun.Great graphics.Ample content.The devs are friendly and responsive.Frequent updates and bug fixes.Participation with the players via a dedicated Alpha testing group.The Bad:This is a new genre, although it doesn’t seem like that from the start. And therefore it takes a while to get used to it. You might expect to pick up the controls and get going from the start, but there are a few things you need to get used to first. Because it’s not a pure sidescroller, the controls will flip whenever the camera angles flip. This will take some time to get used to. But once the penny drops in your mind it becomes natural. Needs achievements.Needs Steam Cloud.Some vehicles are not polished.Takes a while to get used to this new approach.Yes, it's in Early Access, and the items on my bad list might still be attended to. But, it is actually quite polished already and ton of fun.			"

								Played a few levels and had a blast. Even after hanging my front tires on a scaffold and blowing my entire screen up *whistles*. Take note, you don't control the direction you drive, but you control the movement to edge your vehicle in/through the obstacles presented to beat the clock. Some of which you might say, ""piece of cake"", then question why your vehicle is upside down. The obstacles I speak of add a nice challenge and might even induce rage...if you are not too busy laughing at yourself. This game has a unique concept in my opinion and I can honestly say I am looking forward to see how the game develops.			"

								I wanted to like this game. At first glance everything about it feels likeable! But unfortunately looks aren't everything. I sincerely hope they will make it a great game and fix most of the problems before it leaves early access! First the positives:+Great music!+Graphics are ok, nothing to brag about but nothing to sneeze at either+Core concept+Varied environments & tracksbut then the negatives:-Controls feel weird with camera that changes angle all the time-Wonky camera, obstructing view all the time-Cars feel glued to the ground (like steering a rock)-Car engine sounds-Wonky physics, exploding barrels destroying you even though you weren't even close-Game menus need a lot of work, navigation is 'off'Can't recommend this game at this stage, you will just feel frustrated most of the time.Good luck devs! I know you can make it a great game if you don't rush it! I think it's just fair to point out that devs are quick to answer gripes and questions. They also interact with the community frequently. "

Early Access Review
								seeing this game in the new releases list, i snapped it up immediately (i'm a sucker for any off roading type games)what struck me immediately about it (aside from the control issues which i'll touch on in a moment) is that it wasn't at all what i expected in terms of gameplay, though. that's not entirely a negative thing. just a different thing.the gameplay is rooted in the tradition of things like elastomania, trials, joe danger, and other games of the like.  you have no control over steering and such, just acceleration, braking and the forwards and backwards angle of your vehicle.  that said, however, this game is much, MUCH harder than those it shares elements in.  i initially found myself just flooring it to the end of the level, and while it worked fine in the first tutorial level, the 2nd one put me entirely in my place and i had to rethink how to play, entirely. the whole puzzle element of this game seemed a bit weird and even unlikely, at first but it works very well and the whole thing is a lot more about being careful and planning your approaches and rethinking things several times over before taking off, than other games of it's type.  it's actually fairly clever and often maddening. the graphics in this game are really nice - the terrain and lighting are well about what i expected. the vehicles themselves seem a little toony in contrast with the environments but are perfectly workable. as another review pointed out, it's still early access and it's quite likely those are still going to be fiddled with, some.now, the controls: well, it's an early access game and they are actively working on this problem and apparently have a fix coming out very shortly, but if you want to use an xbox controller or the like, you'll have to remap everything before playing as it's entirely set up wrong and you will not be able to get your truck to move using the default layout - keyboard control works just fine, though and given the simple controls, work perfectly well.one thing that has REALLY struck me about this game is the developers, themselves.  i had initially left a negative review citing the controls and a couple other issues and was contacted fairly quickly. the devs seem very receptive and concerned about the opinion and issues people who have purchased this game have and remedy any issues, which in combination with a fair bit more time in the game since my initial review finds me rating this positive, now.fun game. would play again and am anxiously awaiting their next.

Product received for free
												From the dev's store page:AAA visual fidelity: Through harnessing the latest rendering technology and fine tuning resources to match your device, you are presented with immersive, realistic rides through breath-taking terrains of exquisite detail and class leading special effects.Yeah...this game looks like it was made in 2006. There is absolutely no need in this day and age for an on-rails driving game. It was a genre originated from system limitations that should have died when technology surprassed the need for simpler mechanics in games. Not only that but its incredibly easy to get stuck on stuff especially on the multi-level platforms that you jump onto.Screenshot[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]And theyre trying to charge you 9.99 for it. All while straight up lying about the graphics being 'AAA' quality. I assumed this game would be crap when they were giving out keys for greenlight votes, and now my assumption has been confirmed. Stay away for anything more than maybe 50 cents as something to pass a little time, or to get the trading cards like I did			"

								This game isn't very good.  Basically, it is a game where the player presses the A button and watches the Hot Wheel go down a defined track.  The physics are wonky as are the camera so there is never a feeling that the vehicle is under the player's control.The state of development is stable and looks decent but I don't think that it will get much better.  O3DX is simply a bad concept.			"

Early Access Review
								Cool Game! First I just want to say that the graphics are awesome! I am a big fan of offroad games and I think the vehicles in this game are really cool. I like the controls too. Its simple and allows you to focus on other aspects of the game, such as hitting ramps at fast speeds and making your way through some tough obstacles. I like the camera fly over in the beginning of each level. It kind of gives you an idea of what is to come and some of the levels are awesome. O3DX is definitely a game that disturbs your nerves a little, which makes it so much more fun and exciting but scary at the same time. I like the fact that the game plays like a side scroller. Its something a little different which I like. I do suggest some level of vehicle damage. I think it would add more realism to the game. Full Controller support would have been nice too. I am not a fan of using a mouse or keyboard, so its a bit of a hassle to work with a mouse in the menu.Overall the game plays very well and it is definitely a burst of adrenaline when you tackle these obstacles. I would recommend this game for all offroad enthusiasts.			"

								After playing this game for few hours, I want to specify few things:Remember the car games that you had to the stars to complete levels? Well I got a nostalgic moment Cause this game did it a big time!I'm not looking for high end games that recycled every time like Need For Speed, This game actually has real content to offer you.The control of your vehicle is not an easy task, But for me it's challenging because you need to make an effort to progress the levels.The effort the developers did to make this game different from the others are well known: The actual levels themselves are beautifully made, Also great textures and animations, light shafts illuminate the environments.Bottom line, If you seeking game with real life physics and best way to spend you time in, I really recommend this game.

								Well, the first thing that came to my mind when I was playing this game was that it's very familiar to the Trials franchise. And that's a good thing, Trials games are amazing. O3DX does a really good job on captivating you, you will play, your tires will get hooked on a ledge and flip your car around, you will hit barrels that are filled with instantly exploding... well something, and BAM, you're dead and you're trying again. And oh boy is it fun! The game is pretty well done and is running really well, still, being Early access it still has it's share of bugs, but that's to be expected and they are not game-breaking. I'm really waiting for what the developer does with the game and hoping much more content will be added. It's simple, it's fun and you will get back to have more of it!			"

												I've got mixed feelings about this game. On one hand I love the concept and simple controls. On the other hand it's hard to play a game that crashes all the time, and doesn't let you control the camera.The first level pack is fine, but even on sale it's not really worth $8.49... maybe $4.24.If the second level pack worked like it's suppose to, then it would be worth $8.49.And if I could get to the third level pack, then it would be worth $12.50.And if I could finish the game and feel satisfied, then it would be worth $14.99.I also noticed the store page is slightly misleading. It attempts to present the game as a new release for 2016, but this game has been in Beta since 2014, Alpha since 2015 and STILL is a Alpha product. But, I also have to keep in mind it's an Indie game with lack of help. And since they don't have much help, the developers are not seeing their bug report messages either, which makes matters worse. It's hard to find good help these days.The game uses the Unity Coding engine, which is not so forgiving with slouchy logic code (so I've heard). Don't get me wrong here, so far it looks like they've done a great job, but obviously it needs more tweaking and optimizing to be done to it before it's considered a finished product.The vehicles and terrain look really nice even on the lowest graphic settings. I find the vehicle crashes to be hilarious, but sometimes you crash for no apparent reason and have to reset the track, which is not funny at all.Sound FX are pretty basic, you get what you pay for. But I would like to give the devs kudos to the handbrake SFX, because it sounds exactly like somebody is parking in your driveway outside. I've already fooled 3 people with it so far.Most of the music rocks! I'm digging the soundtrack to this game. Big kudos on that! - But I would suggest the music to continue playing during a track reset instead of restarting the music. That gets kind of irritating after a while, especially since you do have to do a lot of resets while learning each track.The game certainly has a challenge to it. Many of the tracks have intense situations where you MUST successfully clear an obstacle exactly right, or else suffer another reset to the beginning. So prepare to see a lot of loading screens. I sort of wish the game didn't have to do a reload for a track reset. There should be a way to do a simple recovery to the beginning and just set particular variables to zero again... but I'm sure the devs had their reasons for doing it like they did.IDK... over all I think I'm going to sit on the fence with this one 50/50. It has big potential... it just needs more work done to it.In the game's current state, I can not honestly recommend this game. At least no further than the first level pack. I guess I would be recommending 1/3 of it ??? But, SORRY, it's thumbs down on this game until they fix it.			"

								What I can say about this game.... Very.... strange.... I mean it doesnt mean its bad game but my first impressions were something like: This game is pretty odd. But after few minutes I realized whats going on. This game pretty much feels like Trials Fusion with a twist, and that twist is camera and cars.... I had amazing time with this game tho, It was very relaxing for me to play through some of the levels but I kinda feel like it need a checkpoint system because some of fragments were pretty hard and I had to reset my level just to try jump or go behind some barrel or other obstacle. The best thing about this game is its soundtrach which is amazing :D It suits very well. I also like the main menu- concept with the steering wheel, It looks very cool :D, Sure, It doesnt have BF4 graphics but this game is all about a gameplay, If you got some buck that you want to spend, go ahead and try this game, you wont regret it :)			"

Early Access Review
								O3DX is fun. That's the first thing you should remember. I'm saying it at the beginning, because this game is early access, and this review is going to mention a lot of things that still need to be improved. But the game is fun, and challenging, and I really enjoy playing it.What the creators of this game say, is that with O3DX they have tried to create a new game genre. Something different for gamers to experience. Have they accomplished it? Well...Lets start with first impressions. First impressions are not that great. The first few levels of O3DX are extremely easy, and honestly left me somewhat confused to what the point of the game is. If you've ever heard of Trials Fusion, then you will know what I mean. O3DX is like Trials Fusion, but with cars. If you don't know what Trials Fusion is, it's like a side scroller, but in a 3D environment. Your vehicles is somewhat ""glued"" to a set path, and all you can do is choose when to accelerate.The steering is extremely simple, you can accelerate, reverse, break, and lean your vehicle forwards and backwards. Which is where some of my initial confusion came from - in the first levels all I needed to do was hold the up arrow button. You can imagine my reaction, what's the point of game where you just hold one button to complete a level?However, I looked at some of the reviews, so positive, all mentioning, you should at least get through 6-8 levels before you judge. So I did, and then I got to the good stuff.What the first levels did was getting me used to how the vehicles react. They also showed off the truly lovely graphics of the various environments that you drive through. (This game is definitely lense flare central, and I love it, I'm a sucker for a good lense flare.) Getting used to the dynamic, cinematic camera angles is another thing. They look great, but they also add some difficulty as very often they won't allow you to see the path ahead. You have to quickly learn to memorize the paths. The first levels also allowed me to enjoy the badassery of the short but very rock'n'roll soundtrack. On a side note, some levels also offer a sudden unexpected slow motion moment, when the car is doing a particularly epic jump. Not gonna lie, it's entertaining. The developers also mention extremely realistic physics in the game, and I would be willing to agree the cars reactions are usually very much on point. With the occasional sillines, when for example my car instantly flipped onto its hood when it literally touched a wooden plank on the road.Once you get through the first few levels, and you think you got the hang of this simple game... it gets unbelievably more difficult. The further you get into it the more obstacles the levels introduce. Some of them explosive, some of them mobile, some of them just really really difficult to get through. Having a good feel of the acceleration rate and timing in this game is everything, and it's very unforgiving. When a game is challenging I start really having fun. If I am willing to retry the same level 20 times in a row, that's a sign of a great game.In the end I do have to remind everyone that this is early access, and early access always comes with a baggage. In the short time I played it, the game crashed on me twice. It also presented sound issues (turned off SFX and music, and yet the slow mo sound effect blasted out of my headset unexpectedly). All in all though it's a fairly polished product by now, and the devs are updating it daily. Literally a day after I played it for the first time they released an update that fixed most of the problems I had. Would I recommend O3DX? Yes. To people who like rage inducing challenge level, and to people who like simplicity. It got me smiling, and it got me very very frustrated, and then very satisfied, when I managed to beat the challenge that was in my way. And in the end, the only thing that truly matters if you enjoy playing title. And I did. Very much.			"

Early Access Review
								Accidentally pressed delete instead of edit, fml. 18 Minutes, that was how long of a chance gave this game. While harsh sounding I simply cannot tolerate this unpolished mess of a game.First things first lets review what this game really is, O3DX or Offroad 3D X-treme is to give a better perspective a game that plays like trials fusion which is a visceral, fast, and difficult 2D sidescrolling racing/physic game. Except it is a poor imitation of the Trials series.Lets go with the graphics, at first glance it looks alright on the screenshot right? Well not really because take a look at this  Image  those line effects you see? Not dynamic, they are baked in which means that in the situation like you see in the image in which I am going at 1 km/h it still appears giving a silly illusion of speed which is not there. The textures are muddy and bland plus the props are overused.SoundThe only saving grace this game has is the powerful BGM meanwhile the SFX is terribly inconsistent. E.g the sound of the engine is simply a few second of sound noticeably looped ad infinitum while the sound of tyre crunching against the dirt sounds like someone took a plastic dustpan and ran it over a gravel road over and over again whilst Simultaneously drowning out any other sound the game might have had. Also that gravel sound also plays even if you are driving on the snow. Meanwhile other sound effect sounded like they came out of the SNES era, not powerful and actually felt pretty awesome, for a child that is.Gameplay is hanging corpse for this kind of genre, to get addicted to this sort of game it must provides plenty of physic puzzles, great illusion of speed, and a compelling enviroment all which this game does not have. The car [a ♥♥♥♥in.g humvee] cannot even get its sorry buttock over the a little hill and it will find any reason it can to lose its goddam.n speed. Go over that bump? Lose speed. Tight corner? Lose speed. Best part is when you manage to conjure enough speed and go over a ramp only to find out you triggered a bulletime mode [that is only specific to that one spot] you will inexplicably lose all of your speed. Physic puzzle? More like pray to whatever god you have that the model of physic they are using does not screw you over, I restarted a level 3 times and it behaves differently for all of those 3 times not to mention that so called obstacle will screw you over because they are placed just outside your camera view and other obstacles are just floating rings given no reason as to why they are so and will blow your car up because fuel tanks are convenietly placed all over it and will explode at the touch of a feather.So would I recommend this game? Hell no. If this game was my student and I am its teacher I would give it a B+ for effort but a deserved D- for execution. Avoid it if you can and just get the other game that does it even better than this.Oh I forgot to mention, in order to give off a feeling of dynamic to the track the camera will randomly move around a preset path to show you highlights and so on which does not work of course and instead gave me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ migraine instead. Plus I can clearly see the car is going 10 km/h you are not fooling anyone.In short, a sloppy game done wrong in a genre where explosion, speed, and a sense of visceral is of the utmost importance.

								Really promising on-rails Trials-style game currently in Early Access. I find the presentation to be very appealing; the graphics look pretty good on the highest setting and the variety of environments is nice. The variety of off-roading vehicles available to 'drive' should appeal to petrolheads everywhere.Even on the first difficulty level I'm finding some of the courses to be quite challenging, so this should turn out to be a tricky and addictive game with a solid few hours of play time. Here's a video with my first impressions:

								I wanted to like this game, especially because I got it for free. But after playing it for 20 min I can see why they give it away. Sure, it is early access right now, but even if this is the roughest form of the game, there is no way this will ever turn into something good.Pros: Nice MusicEasy to playCons: (Everything else)The physics feel outdated and fakeThe sound effects are garbage (more like pre-alpha placeholders)The graphics... for a unity game, you can not expect Unreal graphics, but this is terrible.The levels are plain and since you are on rails all you do is pretty much press one key.The challange is a terrible on rail camera moving all over the place hiding obstacles.  Summary:The controls are simple, drive, reverse, lean forward, lean backward. A 2D side scroller tried to be 3D. There is no point to it, all this does is add a confusing challange, you go one way, and the keys are reversed you go the other way the keys are reversed. The camere switching sides of your vehicle. Both vehicle and camera are on rails, nothing you can do. This just hides obstacles so you crash, or get stuck and restart until you memorize the exact thing you have to do, if it does it.There is not much to this game, the normal price tag of $10 is insane. I got this for free, from the developers and I will never play it again.			"

								This game is strangely addictive. On paper, the whole idea sounds really bad - you control the speed, braking, and weight distribution.... the game handles the steering. In practice, the game is cracking and a lot of fun.Graphics are nice, Gameplay is entertaining and quite often frantic. Could easily be one of those games you fire up to kill 30 minutes of boredom.

								O3DX, how shall I compare thee? To a summer's day? Uh, no, think again buddy!...Ok, let's start positively...- First of all, we can see this game is very acceptable graphics-wise, and is perfectly acceptable for what it is.- Sounds: Can't say they're amazing, but I didn't find them annoying either, so we'll call that a positive as well....So now we'll talk Negatives...1. NO resolution options - this might only affect the Mac version (which shouldn't be an excuse), but it's a little annoying because the way this game is setup (due to the camera, mentioned in my gameplay issues below), you really need to run it in a smaller window.2. Although a minor gripe, it's still something that should be better implemented, and that is, I found it hard to navigate all the menus with the keyboard, and had to use mouse to get around half the time.3. Lastly, and this is probably the most serious of issues - the actual gameplay. Seriously, this is perhaps the most important thing to get right, and it bombed badly. This issue is so important to address let's have subsections:a. The first gameplay issue is the camera zoom/pan/angles - because the camera is zoomed in so much most of the time, you can not see far enough ahead in the track to adjust your speed or angle of the vehicle. This single point alone made most of my gametime frustrating, restarting levels because I stuffed up due to not seeing the obstacles in time.b. Second gameplay issue I came across was the sudden drop in speed of the vehicle when going up a hill or when you land even slightly unevenly - this caused me to have to restart levels due to not having enough speed to get over an obstacle, or not getting big enough jumps.c. Third gameplay issue that I'll mention is the unexpected vehicle crashes that occur - I might be driving over an obstacle, and all of a sudden the vehicle will crash, or, on one occasion, the vehicle randomly jumped in the air and crashed into nothing before landing in a mess on the road.I can forgive everything else, but I gave up playing after 1 1/2 hrs due to the gameplay issues alone. The random vehicle crashes, the vehicle speed issues, and bad camera make this more of a game of luck than skill. I actually played this briefly quite a few months ago before it came onto Steam, and it really doesn't seem to me like it has changed much at all since then. Due to this, I am not putting much hope into the gameplay issues being sorted before release, but let's hope the devs do.			"

								This game is pretty awesome. It took me a while to convince myself in buying this game and I am glad to say that I am not regretting it. The first few levels was a bit easy but around level 5 things start to get interesting. I like the camera angles and the slow motion effect during the crash -Its pretty cool. The physics in the game is pretty solid too and I like the way the wheels fall off when you crash too hard. One thing that must improve is the menu..it's a bit confusing but so far I am enjoying the game and would recommend it to other players.			"

								This is just a ramble, but please don't buy this game...This game feels like a poorly made copy of whatever the current flavor of Excitebike is (Trials:Fusion?). The controls are either unresponsive or meaningless most of the time. On the first level, I had numerous rollovers on hills that I had previously passed without a problem. I passed them without using the joystick, simply pressing accelerate and then suddenly the truck doesn't have enough power on the next playthrough? Things like this seemed to happen frequently. The sound was terrible with the gravel effects drowning out the sounds of the car or almost anything else. The music was probably the best part of the game. Oh, and it looks like another cell phone port which is probably why the controls are so rough. It's really hard to get the average user to tilt their tower back and forth to control the car.			"

								O3DX has decent graphics, not spectacular and the sounds are acceptable. The actual gameplay, the thing they need to get right, is just not good or fun. Cinematic camera angles? The camera is zoomed in most of the time so you can't see far enough ahead in the track to adjust your speed or angle of the vehicle for the upcoming obstacle. The way the camera pans and angles doesn't show whats ahead and just focuses on the vehicle. It made playing frustrating not being able to see the obstacles in time. Your vehicles speed feels sluggish and not powerful at all. Going up hills or landing unevenly causees drastic drops in speed leaving you unable to get over the next obstacle or not getting a big enough jump. Easy controls? The controls, minimal as they are, just aren't as responsive as they should be.  Ridiculously Realistic physics? The animations and physics are poor and need a lot of work, everything looks and feels stiff. For a game thats supposed to be about speed and physics, it doesn't deliver at this time. Being EA, it may improve by full release and if it does I'll edit my review.			"

  This game, is simple, challenging, and extremely fun! I LOVE it! ! ! Note: Keep in mind that you don't control the direction you drive, but rather the edge of the vehicle. It may sound a bit dumb, but once you get in the game, you'll find it strangely addictive, and FUN to play. Now, for the review.The game is just a master piece. Yeah, sure, it might not have the Crysis 3 graphics, but the whole game is just a blast of fun, addiction and just challenge in general. An amazing mix, if i do say so myself. Here is a nice picture i took in-game The controls are easy to master so, i'm pretty sure you won't rage about it, however about the obstacles that lie in the game, i don't know. A bit of puzzles here and thereAs for the game, racing, amazing stunts, great vehicles, and lots, lots of explosions! ! !PS: Cool guys don't look at explosionsBut seriously, the stunts and just the tracks are mind blowing. The environment is something to look at while you are doing those badass stunts. The physics are smooth and will provide you with some nice time. Now, in short. The game is amazing, as much as i write about it, and just try and explain how good and addictive is, the best way for you to understand it is to buy the game. So, buy the game, it's only 9.99€/$10 (Should be around that) and just witness and gain' the amazing experience the game has to offer yourself. "

								I actually want to recommend this game, the graphics is really beautiful, but at the current state, I can't recommend it for now.Previously I complained about the camera, which now I've used to, but now another one is the physics, which is one major flaw for a game like this. For example, when your car hits a wall of wood plank, chances are your car will barrel roll or even amusing, floats upwards like the car suffers from an explosion right below it. It's amusing, but also kills the purpose of playing this game.			"

								O3DX is a game I find hard to recommend. In my short time playing the game I had a bit of fun with it, but there were also a lot of frustrations and parts that just made me want to rip my hair out.The game plays a lot like a Trials type game. The only issue is that the vehicles in this game have physics that are constantly changing each time I play the level. It took me a good while to beat the first level just because the car would sometimes not go fast enough to get over a rock.The game is also very unforgiving. There are no checkpoints at all, and if you make one mistake you are stuck and have to go back to the beginning. I just found this rather annoying. I would go too slow and get stuck. I would go too fast and hit explosive barrels that blow up my vehicle.Another issue I had was the controls. This is more so due to how the camera is worked in this game. With a static camera that stays in one position the controls make sense. With it constantly rotating it makes it hard to figure out which button will rotate me forward and which will rotate me backwards.The only other thing I found wrong with the game is my timer always seemed to be bugged. Instead of going up at a constant rate it was very jumpy and updating at random intervels. A sort of meh thing but it still bothered me to look at.Not all of the game is bad though. It looks really nice and and the music, though it does drone, is also well done.Overall I'd say my experience was rather lackluster, but it is in early access (according to the store page as I'm writing this) so maybe some of this will change in the future? I don't know. I enjoy the concept of the game and love games like this but it's just hard to recommend this one in particular.			"

								This game is currently Early Access, but its already more complete than many games upon release. I’d say O3DX is uinque, fun, and worth exploring. To be honest, I have followed O3DX since I received it on a bundle long before early access and have been playing it for months now. My initial thoughts was that this might be a bit odd. It took me a while to realise that this is a side scroller. Because unlike the typical side scroller everything happens in dimensional space. But once you understand what they did this new genre starts to make sense. This is not a side scroller. It’s a Dimensional Scroller and it works. Give it a go, but wait till you finished at least 8 levels before you make your decision			"
