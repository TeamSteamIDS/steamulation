												This game is flawed as hell but damn if I didn't have fun with it. It's a platformer with an emphasis on speed running and mild puzzle solving where you play as a girl trying to escape a virtual world called the Nexus. You can double jump, air dash, and ground pound. You can also bounce of the heads of enemies or kick them around with an air kick. You also have an emergency jump that's on a timer that allows you to jump really high every 30 seconds. You basically just race to the finish while doing all these things in order to progress. The big flaw of the game is that sometimes the controls just feel like they don't respond. You go to bounce of the head of an enemy that is your ticket to the next platform and then suddenly you fall past it to your death. This maybe happened 1 in every 30ish enemies but it was really annoying. However, I feel as though the developer may have understood this was an issue which is why I believe the emergency jump was put in. It saves you from mistakes and keeps you going when you should have failed. The only other real issue was the final level's ""boss."" The boss uses different attacks at different stages but sometimes you advance into the next stage when an attack from the last stage is happening. It results in a mechanic that was easy to avoid in the last stage killing you in the next since it is not really fair for that stage. This all seems bad but the game does so many things right. Movement is fluid and the music is amazing. The graphics are not great but there are still a few moments that look really good. I would recommend it on a sale since the game is short but for 5 dollars I would say it's worth it.			"

												I realy like it!At first, many problems prevented us playing comfortable.Now the problems gone.I like not only the comfort but also the worldview of this game.デザインと世界観がとてもいいゲームです。以前は非常に大きな問題となっていたゲーム内での動作も改善され、理不尽な難しさもほとんど無くなりました。自由に空を飛びまわる感覚はまさに爽快でスピード感に溢れています。欲を言えばもう少しストーリーに厚みが欲しいですが、続編アップデートを公式がほのめかしているので、今後も期待できそうです。			"

												Link: The Unleashed Nexus is a fast-paced action puzzle platformer made by Reminisce. You start off as an anime girl who seems trapped in some sort of void or chamber filled with ethereal beings which you can pass through. Afterwards, you jump into the actual puzzle platformer aspect of the game. There’s a very helpful tutorial that teaches you the basics of dashing, moving, flying, etc that should appeal to newcomers to this genre and game overall. Soon after the tutorial is finished, you get placed into the game where you have the freedom to dash, fly and move around the area to reach the goal piece which is a glowing statue of sorts that you have to hit in order to proceed to the next room or level. I’m going to list some pro’s and con’s this game has to offer and finish off my final thoughts on this game.Pro’s+Intuitive Gameplay let’s you make your own choices and act accordingly+Japanese and English layout and subtitles+Challenging to the point where I got stuck on room 2+Fast Paced+60 FPS+High resolution settings+No cutscenes or dialogue saves the developers a lot of money+Full Controller Support (I personally use the Xbox One Controller)+Only $10Con’s-Single Player makes it so there’s no interactivity with other players (not even leaderboards)-Little sense of direction-Decent Graphics (if you’re looking for Unreal Engine graphics, look elsewhere, they’re decent enough)-Very few graphic settings. (Only “resolution”)-Not an original concept (lot’s of other devs have made games like this; i.e Cloudbuilt)-Hit detection for certain models slightly buggy-ONLY Japanese and English layout and subtitles-Puzzle layout’s feel familiar (copypasta)-No cutscenes or dialogue makes the gameplay slightly staleHonestly, this game is pretty decent for this dev studio’s first indie release and for being only $10. If you don’t mind the slightly repetitive levels, little sense of direction, no cutscenes or dialogue, the game offers a cool experience if you’re looking for something you can play for a little bit at a time and if you’re a fan of the genre, you should get it. I recommend it for the price tag and the fact that it’s a generally decent game for this studio’s first release.By the way, you can also find this review on my review site here[www.tacotaku.com] "

												The game itself is in depth and challenging but the UI needs work. Story being displayed in small white text in the middle of your screen in a timed game is a little annoying and the menu likes to exit full screen. If you can get past the UI issues, it is a wonderful and beautiful game.			"

												If you're looking for an enjoyable, relaxing, immersive platformer that requires precision and has a thumping soundtrack and clean, simple, ""Japanese"" esque graphics look no further. The animations of the main character (mostly the run animation) is a bit goofy looking but also fits the overall game created. The presentation of the game itself is pretty solid, however, with cool introductory bits for each level. Checkpoints are scattered throughout the level, but are sparse enough to balance both a challenge and avoid frustration from having to redo too lengthy of a section should you fall off. Numerous abilities beyond ""just jumping"" ie divebombing onto certain platforms to trigger other effects, as well as a midair kick to activate platforms round the game out from being too simplistic. Add to all of this the occassional ""boss fight"" and the game is an all-around pretty solid package. If you see the aesthetics and gameplay and think you might be interested, it plays better than it looks, and offers a unique experience.			"

												There's a lot that could be held against Link: The Unleashed Nexus. The menus are oddly difficult to navigate, the controls are sometimes janky (which makes a huge difference in a 3D platformer like this), the story is alright at best, the cartoonish art style of the protagonist looks weird against the more realistic backgrounds...in short, it's not the most polished experience you'll see.But all of that can be forgiven by how awesome the whole thing feels. Ever wanted to be a girl who can jump, air dash, and platform with the best of them? You do now. A short experience, but a fun one and recommended as long as you're ready to tolerate some platforming frustration.Oh, and: awesome soundtrack.			"

												utterly broken, unplayable garbage.don't let my play time fool you, i idled it for cards, some time ago.i've never been able to get past the first tutorial level because the controls are such an unresponsive mess.  it seems rather sporadic and random how the game chooses to respond to your button presses at any given time.   i honestly have no idea how the people who've given it positive reviews have managed to get anywhere. after playing this with multiple controllers, keyboard, etc.  i'm at a total loss.i wish i could have refunded it, but i had it too long by the time refunds were a thing on steam.

												Unfortunately I can't recommend the game - it has an awfully neat visual style and nice music, but some optimisation issues aside there just... seems to be something wrong with the controls.  Primarily the double-jump functionality, which seems unable to remember whether or not you're already airborne.  Oftentimes this leads to a jump from a platform performing the double jump immediately, leading you to fall short as you can't jump a second time.  So far the first/tutorial level's been uncomplete-able due to this issue.			"

												Interesting concept built in the Unreal engine. Somewhat of a short game, yet still enjoyable. Does have a few performance issues with jittering, and a lack of graphical settings.I'd rate it 8/10Pick it up during a sale, then sell the trading cards to recoup 1.50 of what you spent.			"

												Highly recommended based on concept alone. Sure, it's short and controls don't always feel precise (specifically when bouncing on enemies), but with a great soundtrack and dreamscape ambience coupled with intriguing platforming elements that leave little margin for error, there doesn't exist a worthwhile 3D game quite like it: If nothing else, play it for the very last level of the game, which is exhilarating enough on its own to warrant a purchase at a discount price.
