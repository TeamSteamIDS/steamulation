 JumpJet Rex	JumpJet Rex is a very challenging  2D platformer that stays true to video game classics with its music, gameplay, and visuals. You are the Earth's first Dinonaut and you recieve an urgent call telling you that a meteor is heading to Earth. You must go back home to save your planet. Gameplay	Through my playthrough I have used a controller. The levels are well designed. However, I have run into a few bugs that ruined my experience. The bug I found was on the first boss fight where I would glitch into the boss and be stuck, or glitch under the map and be stuck. The levels are challenging and fun and the music is amazing. After I beat the first boss, I saw a difficulty curve appear as levels get much harder to beat. Through the game you can collect $$$ to buy customization items for your dinosaur. You will be able to play the game for hours upon hours. This game is one that will cause rage in certain levels. Throughout the game there are collectibles hidden throughout the map which you can find and they will be added to your room.  Consider buying this/ not buying this if Consider buying this if:	- you like the classic feel with videogames- you like 2D platformers- you like a challengeConsider not buying this if:	- you do not like rage games- you hate dying (most likely you will die a lot)- you hate pixelated games or 2D platformers Rating	 Pros	+ many hours of gameplay+ customization+ music is very well done+ gives an authentic classic feel+ difficult and a challenge+ many collectibles+ dino basketball Cons	- may glitch- may have random lag spikes ( it did for me at random moments within this game)- huge difficulty curve- may become slightly repetitive - only local co-op Final Thoughts	JumpJet Rex is an amazing game with a magnificent soundtrack and a perfect old-school feel. The huge difficulty curve is annoying and you sometimes will run into bumps. However, overall as a game I am impressed with JumpJet Rex and am happy to have played it.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

  Introduction            	JumpJet Rex is a fast-paced and retro styled platformer. You can play the game just for the story, or you can be the perfectionist by beating the time and not dying at all. The story is not to be taken serious, but it is very funny and cute. The gameplay is tons of fun and it can be very challenging when you are trying to get all the stars throughout the game. I had a blast playing JumpJet Rex; from the audio/visuals to the gameplay, JumpJet Rex is a nearly perfect game. I’m sure if you have the chance to play JumpJet Rex, you will have a blast throughout the whole experience.  Pros               
Amazing gameplay High replay value Really cool hub-world Perfect audio  Cool retro style Funny and cute story  Great mechanics Controller support Gfx options and rebinding support    Cons              
Fairly short story. Nothing else wrong it (I couldn’t think of anything of else wrong)    Conclusion                 	 JumpJet Rex is a nearly perfect retro platformer. It has basically everything you would want in a Retro Platformer for PC (Amazing gameplay, High replay value, really cool hub-world, Funny and cute story, Great mechanics, Controller support, and Gfx options and rebinding support). It was very hard to find anything wrong with JumpJet Rex and it really deserves more attention. I would highly suggest you to pick up JumpJet Rex as soon as you can.   Video Review

Early Access Review
								This game is RAD.I'm not the kind of person that likes to play platformers - I usually get bored and frustrated by them really quickly.  This, however, is GREAT.  It's like Super Meat Boy met Flappy Bird and gave birth to a dinosaur with jetpacks on his feet.  ""Eww, Flappy Bird! That game is soooo stooooopid!"" You may or may not have just said. ""That also came out in 2013!! Are you stuck in the past, grandma?!"" Haha okay there buddy, but seriously, hear me out!  In my first dive in I found that the game was very easy to pick up; the controls were very responsive and so easy to grasp that within minutes I was literally flying through the levels like I was DINO-PETER PAN!  It feels like its at the right speed too - not too slow to make it feel clunky, and not too fast to make it overwhelming.The art style is super cute - I just love my lil' Rex with his lil' cyborg eyepatch - did I mention you can dress up and customize Rex?  Yeah, you can DO THAT. And it's AWESOME. I may be just biased though because I'm a GIRL.  Who sometimes plays into GENDER STEREOTYPES.Aaaanyways, the levels are quite diverse and I never knew what to expect going into each one, which is fun! I love mysteries! I mean it's not exactly Jump Jet Agatha Christie but y'know, it's cool.  In all seriousness though, the level design is tight. There's also no forced tutorial but rather a main hub where you can learn basic mechanics and manoeuvres either yourself or through training, which is a nice option. This game, despite being so easy to pick up, is very punishing - something that it openly advertises, so that's probably what the devs were going for.  I found myself getting a little frustrated with the first boss battle after I died a ton trying to figure out how to beat it.  The problem with this one battle was that the pacing was so different from before - I'd been trained to just GO GO GO as fast as I could throughout the previous levels while in this battle I had to wait for the right time to attack - it was actually easier to stand still than to keep moving.  Despite this I've still really enjoyed JJR and heavily recommend it to anyone that is looking for a strong platforming game that you'll not only have a ton of fun playing but will also challenge you. Even a filthy casual like me enjoyed it! Support your the indies, guys! :)			"

Early Access Review
								As an avid platforming fan, I am often very cynical/analytical when it comes to playing new ones. I'm stuck in the past, rarely do I find a platformer that I feel can stand up to the SNES era.JumpJet Rex though, took me totally by surprise. I didn't expect to fall so hard and fast for this game.I always look for specific things in a platformer, a formula for perfection if you might:Difficulty - Is the game challenging? Will it make me shout profanities but still make me eager to go back for more? Check. JumpJet Rex is no easy ride, though the difficulty curve put in place is sublime. Not too fast, not too slow, excellent pacing.Controls - I can get really wound up about clunky controls in platformers. There is a certain ""feel"" that needs to be reached. I have no qualms about the controls for JJR, very reponsive, reactive and creative.Replayability - Will I feel like playing through the levels again? Will I get attached to the world the developers present to me? JJR hits this mark splendidly. Not only can you complete the levels, there are plenty of collectables in place. You are graded on each level out of 3 stars. Completion, not dying and time. You need a certain amount of stars to prgress onto further levels, so you will find yourself revisiting levels, and I wa absolutely glad to every time!Appearance - Is the game easy on the eyes? How is the level design? Seriously, JJR is one of the most beautiful modern platformers I have played. The graphics are fun, edgy and cute. You can also customise your little dino, LOADS of options available. You can buy customisation items from a store, with currency you earn IN-GAME, or find them hidden within levels.Boss Fights - Will the boss actually challenge me? Will I feel the rage build up as I am slaughtered over and over again and feel like a champion when I overcome them? JJR delivers this. The bosses require you to figure them out. There is zero hand-holding. Music - Will the music match the theme of the game? Will the music egg me on as I play through? JJR again, passes with flying colours. I usually game with my own music, but for JJR I absolutely love the soundtrack, it gets the heart pumping! Beautiful.In summary, I can't reccomend this game enough to anyone, epecially if you enjoy platforming! Seriously, it's a little dinosaur with jet-pack shoes. Buy it, you wont be dissapointed.Yours sincerely, an absolute platforming snob. Hahaha			"

								A really fun platformer.  The unlimited air jumps and dashes feel really great to control.  If you're only trying to beat the game, you can do so very quickly since the levels are short with multiple checkpoints.  But if you want to collect all the coins, all the hidden items, make the best time on any given stage?  You'll be replaying and practicing quite a bit.Speed run versus against friends seems like it'll be a lot of fun too once more people start playing.			"

								Ever since I was a kid, I loved trying to clear levels as fast as possible. This is what drew me to racing games, I would try and beat my friend's highscores by trying to perfect every corner. That's what JumpJet Rex feels like to me. It can be enjoyed as a regular oldschool platform game, or you can really sink your teeth into it and try and beat your own or your friend's scores. Great games need to have both depth and solid gameplay. JJR aces both. I'll be playing this one for a long time!!			"

												Very high quality platformer, you can tell they poured their hearts into this title.  Every little mechanic and animation is very well done, other platformer developers can learn a lot from this game.The steam release is excellent as there are a lot of additions which you do not see every day, like choosing a member on your friends and try to compete against them for a high score and even see their ghost in-game to race against.  It takes the normal super high quality platformer and adds in tons of replay value.			"

												Since this game has many reviews relating to how it is as a casual game, I would like to look at it from a speedrunner's perspective, since much of this game seems to revolve around that part. I've spent almost all of my time on this game speedrunning it rather than trying to go through and 100% the game, so I feel like this would help people looking for something fast to play.To begin, this is basically platformer, except you get to fly around so there's no actual platforming involved. Much of the challenge comes from a few enemies and obstacles scattered around. The amount may vary from no enemies and only a couple thorny bushes to 50 lasers shooting at you at once. Each map is a course where you must go through rings to complete the level. This game offers fairly simple movement in the form of flight that is nice for casual runs, but it can be very fun to utilize to its full potential in speedrunning. This is obviously subjective, but the movement is extremely fluid, making it so the only reason why a person would fail would be due to their own ability. Once you move into the actual level design, that's when things get a bit murky. I don't want to talk badly about the levels since anything can be speedran if you put effort into it, but some are extremely difficult and require a great deal of time and patience to do at the speed of top runners. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to think about if you're just looking for a fun and easy game to run. This game focuses quite a bit on ILs, so getting top times on each level could take quite awhile. I would say there is massive variety in the levels so I would also let that be known.This game offers a ton of things to collect in each level if anyone ever wanted to attempt to speedrun 100%, so that's a plus for dedicated people looking for some replay value. I wouldn't say it's to the point of obnoxiousness, but some of the levels are fairly difficult to 100% complete, which is where the speedrunning part becomes a lot more challenging to master. Overall, I think this is an excellent game with an active community and plenty of room to improve on. It has simple mechanics that take time to master and a hefty amount of content to explore, which is great for people looking for a lot of replay value.			"

												I regret to inform you that I write this review without having finished the game. Not for lack effort, but because it's just not feasible. I'll go into why later in the review.JumpJet Rex is a colourful speedrun game about a dinosaur that collects stars to save the universe. Something like that anyway. There are some 30+ delightful little worlds with each type of world (ice, desolate space base, etc.) seeming to have their own little chiptune to go with it. And these are some damn good chiptunes. I bought the game through Chrono GG so it came with the soundtrack and my god was it worth it. Definitely got some workout tunes out of it (should I ever be finish my selection of podcasts). Really, have a listen to some of them. You can also customize the appearance of your dinosaur, 4 elements. Head, skin tone, shoes, jumpjet particles. But that's dress-up and I don't find it particularly enjoyable. In each level you collect rings to unlock the gate. Pass the finish line and you've completed it, you earn a star. You can earn up to three stars per level. One for completion, one for not dying, and one for speedrunning. You need to collect some number of stars to unlock the next few levels. Simple enough. I usually settled for completing without dying to grind stars because I only needed to be careful to progress. But some levels are easy to speedrun if you take advantage of checkpoints (and dying). So I took those too. You can also download ghosts within the game of the top players in the world or people near your skill level to see how they do things. So it provides a good improvement tool within the game, well done. As the game goes on, and certain elements get added to the levels, I saw some SIGNIFICANT frame drops. Like, we're talking 2 fps frame drops. The culprits seem to be certain environmental objects. Patches of thorns that disburse leaves and these globules that travel up and down. And it became a real pain on a particular boss fight called 'Seedmour' in which the level is full of these thorn patches so after maybe a minute of fighting the boss you'd be unable to do anything for several minutes due to the fps drop. Alt-tabbing seemed to help, but I don't know for sure. That boss fight was a particularly annoying because after dropping the boss's health to zero you also had to ground-pound it before it got back up and if you happened to be stuck in 2 fps time when that window presented itself... prepare yourself to have to hit it again because there's no way you're going to do it in time. And this is why I haven't finished the game. Because in the later levels this becomes a constant issue and you kinda need the frames in a speedrunning game if you want it to be fun. (I suspect the issue is some kind of garbage collection or object recycling code).Other than that though, the game is brilliant. Definitely recommend giving it a go.			"

												An excellent platformer that gives you more degrees of freedom in regards to movement than you'd expect from a game of this type. It had a focus on speaking, but it's by no means necessary to progress, but it is quite precision based as one hit will send you back to the last checkpoint.Great pixel art, a fun physics system and a snappy soundtrack otherwise punctuate a great little 2D platformer that stands out from the crowd			"

												JumpJet Rex is a 2D retro platformer with NES-style pixel art graphics. You control Rex, a tyrannosaur astronaut whose job it is to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The gameplay consists of navigating your way through a number of 2D levels – 40 to be exact – plus four boss stages.The core gameplay is fairly simple – the central premise is that you have a pair of rocket boots, meaning you can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, boost yourself straight up at a high rate, boost yourself sideways at a high rate (which launches a mid-range projectile in the opposite direction), or do a butt stomp to deal damage to something below you. You also have a bicycle kick which deals damage in all directions around you.There are a number of enemies. Some of them can be killed with some of your attacks, while others can be temporarily stunned. More interestingly, most projectiles can also be destroyed by your attacks, allowing you to defend yourself from them.The bosses all have large numbers of hit points; three of them are fairly standard “large hit point gauge” bosses, though each of them has a way to be killed much more quickly. The final boss has two phases, and the first phase regenerates, making it easily the hardest boss in the game.The primary goal is of the game is the three stars you get for completing each stage; you need a certain number of stars to unlock more stages, and getting the “proper” ending requires you to get almost all of the stars in the game. One star is awarded automatically for completing each stage; this is generally not a terribly difficult task, as there are checkpoints in the levels and most of the stages are pretty generous with them. A second star is awarded for completing a stage without dying, and a third star is awarded for completing a stage within a certain time limit. You don’t need to accomplish both optional tasks in one run to get all three stars, but on many of the stages, the time limits are tight enough that you cannot afford to die, or can only die once, to get the time. Because the stages are persistent after your death, there are times when dying and respawning closer to where you need to go can cut down on the time needed to beat a level, and a few levels require you to do so.There are optional bonus levels and collectibles in almost every stage which unlock cosmetic improvements to Rex’s home base. In addition, each stage contains a large number of coins and gems which can be collected in order to purchase cosmetic items; collecting all the coins gives a coin bonus, and eventually, an achievement for doing it in every stage.Only the very final stage in the game does not have checkpoints, and it is a borderline platform hell level, making it pretty annoying.Overall, the game is pretty tough as far as such games go; it took me about 7 hours and 40 minutes to 100% the game according to the in-game timer. It is nowhere near the difficulty level of, say, a game like Super Meat Boy, but it is still fairly tough. The real challenge mostly lies in the speed runs, though in a few levels, not dying is the more difficult challenge.By and large, the levels are decent enough, but it is hard to shake the feeling that, for the first 3/4ths of the game, there isn’t much to denote your progress. The stages get gradually harder, but only the final nine stages really feel all that different from what came before. The game never gets too difficult (save for the final, checkpointless stage which is a borderline platform hell level, which is a bit frustrating) but apart from the final area there is little sense of progression.The game mechanics and level designs are decent enough, but the stages aren’t terribly pretty and are pretty bare-bones functional, as is typical in such retro games.In the end, I can’t really recommend this game, but not because it is bad. It is not bad. It is decent enough and I didn’t feel bored while playing it. What the game suffers from is being mediocre. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it is pretty much exactly enjoyable enough to keep the player from getting bored, never so good that you get actively excited about it. You just aren’t missing anything by never playing this game. And if you aren’t missing anything by playing a game, why give up eight hours of your life to do so?			"

												JumpJet Rex acts as the continuation of a distinctly mid-90’s branch of game design. A 16-bit arcade platformer, TreeFortress Games’ prehistoric space escapade merges the divergent sensibilities of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, into a game that is as smart and enjoyable as Super Mario, and as undeniably cool as Sonic the Hedgehog.First order of business: JumpJet Rex puts a dinosaur in space. Through a feat of Cretaceous engineering, dinosaurs developed space travel, and just in time, as a meteor has just been spotted with “extinction” written all over it. Outfitted with the best jetboots and novelty headwear money can buy, Rex must race back home to earth or become the last dinosaur alive.JumpJet Rex knows, with absolute conviction, exactly what it is. It’s a game where a dinosaur can and should wear an eyepatch. A game where collectible golden stars are the key to everything, and the best way to the exit is whichever makes you look the coolest. JumpJet Rex understands the earnest appeal of Sonic in his prime, blown out to a degree only the insertion of dinos could bring about. He hasn’t inherited the blue hedgehog’s patronizing finger wag, but it isn’t hard to imagine Rex as Sonic’s coolest unnecessary side character.But lest TreeHouse Games’ jet hopping reptile be too heavily compared to Sega’s functionally irrelevant mascot, JumpJet Rex also borrows liberally from other notable 16-bit platformers, while allowing itself space to develop its own personality. JumpJet Rex is about speed, but for the sake of precision more than novelty. Even if you neglect to go after the speedrun star attached to each level, JumpJet Rex has a way of making quick movement feel imperative. Partially, this is on account of most levels being designed almost like race tracks, whether linear point-to-points or arena stages that task you with collecting a certain amount of rings as quickly as possible. Mostly, though, you want to move fast because it feels cool to do so.JumpJet Rex controls like an absolute dream, allowing you to dash and hop around obstacles like the world’s premiere jet fueled acrobatic dinosaur (which you likely are by default). By opting for a less rigid movement system than most platformers, JumpJet Rex allows for a great deal of personality in how you navigate levels, a quality that begins to show more and more when you start attempting more difficult runs and need to develop personal strategies to clear them.Playing JumpJet Rex is incredibly rewarding because it successfully blurs the line between playing as the developer intended, and playing however feels best to you, lessening the frustration of sussing out a level’s path and turning it into a sort of reflex puzzle. The last few stages (and the very last one, most especially) do an agonizingly good job of disrupting this recipe, being both several orders of magnitude more challenging and tedious, but if nothing else these levels can almost always be brute forced without any real penalty for doing so. It’s a crude compromise, but it gets the job done.JumpJet Rex’s last few stages were an unfortunate end to an otherwise shockingly entertaining experience, but it speaks well to the game that even after such a miserable time beating my head against its final level, I’d still happily jump right back in to everything before it. That might be a bit like cutting the mold off a slice of bread and making a sandwich with it, but if it still tastes just as great, I can’t complain too much.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

I can say that it was a little to hard to resist giving him a hand on some of the harder sections when he asked and I actually had a lot of fun with it too.I also liked how you got awards for completing levels quicker, which can be tricky and dying can even be a strategy for speed at times.

Early Access Review
								Very promising oldschool 2D platformer with interesting, challenging and varied level design, which also allows for quick burst game play. Always pleased to see one of these games that's happy to tailor itself to all sorts of ability levels and not just limit itself to hardcore gamers. Being someone whose considers themselves as a fan of this genre, but as a midrange gamer skillwise, I feel it's the kind of thing that will challenge me, and even if some of its speedrun/perfectionist objectives may be out of reach for me, I'd be happy to play it until I get as much out of the game as possible. Nailing some of those early speed challenges is incredibly satisfying! A pretty decent soundtrack to boot.			"

								I love this game! It's fun, challenging, and awesome! The soundtrack and artstyle lead this tough but rewarding platformer, where you control a small, customizable T-Rex. If you enjoyed games such as Super Time Force, Super Meat Boy, and other tough platformers, then you'll love this game! You will keep replaying every level to beat your high score and to find the screts within the level. Anyways, this game is a steal for $10.00, and I really recomend it if you want something to play something that you'll have fun with. Rage, laugh, and enjoy: JumpJet Rex!			"

												You can have a blue t-rex with a red mask and JETPACK. IN SPACE.I MEAN.DINOSAURS IN SPACE.THIS GAME IS AWESOME.Now seriously. Sometimes is nice having a quick and fun game where you don't have to spend 62358 hours to finish it and you can always enjoy replaying it and trying to do all the challenges.			"

												I love this game! It reminds me so much of old gameboy/GBC games I used to play as kid but with smoother, less clunky controls. I was happily surprised to find the game mechanics and feel were nothing like flappy bird although the game's controls were inspired from it. I'm glad I did not pass off this game like I initially did with Hotline Miami and Papers, Please.			"

YouTube™ Video: JumpJet Rex Review 

			Views: 408		

			We take a look at the fast paced 2D platformer, JumpJet Rex! Rawr!!		

JumpJet Rex is a 2D platformer that puts you in control of a rocket boot wearing T-Rex on a mission to save the world from an incoming asteroid. The game consist of racing against the clock while navigating through increasingly difficult levels while collecting the power rings that unlock the gate at the end of the level. All the while you’ll be dodging spikes, missiles, robots, and zombie like plants from a variety of settings such as space, ice, and jungle worlds. Upon completion of the level you will be awarded stars that are required to progress the game further and unlock the next batch of levels; you are awarded one star for simply completing the level, one star for completing the level without dying, and a third star for finishing the level within the given challenge time limit. Along the way you will be able to collect numerous coins that can be used to purchase adorable cosmetic items for your tiny dino hero. The game boasts a gorgeous hand-drawn 16 bit retro art style that harkens back to the old days of the Sega Genesis. The game thrives on its fast paced race against the clock and one hit heart system that combine for at times, quite the punishing experience. The controls are fluid and responsive, whether you are jumping, dashing, or rolling, if you happen to die you won’t feel cheated because the controls were at fault, something that is crucial for a 2D platformer of this speed and difficulty. If you get frustrated easily or hate repetition then this is not the game for you, as you will quickly learn the ins and outs of each level as you repeatedly die over and over again. This game does not hold your hand and mistakes are not forgiven, the satisfaction of finally overcoming the challenge of racing the clock and completing the level without taking a single hit is a very rewarding feeling.  All in all the game offers a fun, fast paced, 2D platforming experience that that provides a high level of challenge as well as a high level of replayablity.			"

												If you like to beat leaderboard times and/or speedrunning, you might like this game. The game has an interesting 'speedrun' mode with the objective to achieve the fastest time possible. Though the game is fun playing casually, I found more enjoyment in beating people's times on the leaderboard. If you are looking to play the game casually, it's a very fun platformer where you are speeding through levels as a T-Rex with booster shoes! It also has a nice soundtrack that matches the game's nice 16-bit graphics. But it IS a short game(2-3+ hrs) and depending on how loose your wallet is, $15 might be a steep price to pay. I recommend this game and if it ever receives goes on a discount it would definitely be worth it.TL;DRGreat but short platformer. T-Rex in space, Chris Pratt would be proud.			"

												I think this is a great platformer but I don't recommend it because of the way new levels are unlocked.To unlock the next level, you need to achieve a certain number of stars from previous levels. You earn 1 star for completing a level, 1 star for for completing it without dying, and 1 star for beating a set time limit. However, just completing levels is not enough to unlock new levels; you won't have enough stars. Some levels are long and quite difficult to get through without dying. If you need the stars to unlock the next levels (and you will), you will need to restart the whole level every time you die. The game has checkpoints in each level, but you are punished for using them because it means you won't get the extra stars that you need to unlock new levels. The grind to get stars is annoying and frustrating, and I would much rather prefer levels be unlocked as the previous one is beaten, without the need for stars.			"

								If you're looking for a great ""platforming"" game in the mix of all the new space age shooters, JumpJet Rex should be your first stop. It's less of a platformer overall, because most of your time spent in the game will be in the air. The easy to learn, hard to master control system is comfortable, and flows well with the challenges provided by each level.Every element of this game has been thought through and executed with precision. Whether you'd like to play casually, or are a hardcore-speedrunner, this game has much to offer.Highly recommended, one of my top games right now.			"

												YES you should get it.I am not the platformer type but this is such a cute little game. A real hidden gem! It doesn't feel unfair, some levels are harder than others but game flow is achievable. The soundtrack is great on every level (and you can change the music in your home base too). The controls are intuitive and the pacing does not feel slow at any point (you have rocket boots). There is also hidden stuff to find if you're into that. The devs really seem to care. I haven't played that much but I absolutely LOVE it :)			"

												Lots of fun for both coop and solo. I'd recommend skipping straight to normal mode since the difference between easy and normal is that in easy you get 2 hitd before you die.This game is also lots of fun for speed running. To really optimize you may have to change your control scheme.One helpful thing I didn't realize one could do is to cancel your horizontal dash with your ""drop"" (b button on xbox controller). This is useful when jump-cancelling would kill you.			"

												JumpJet Rex is a solid casual jump and run.Unfortunately with a few flaws.Pros:- Nice retro setting.- Nice retro music.- Good control concept with the jumping jet boots (although it feels like flappy bird sometimes).- A lot of secrets.- Weird but nice and supershort story.- ""Super Mario Style"" amount of coins. Which you can use to buy skins. Nice!Cons:- Engine: One main problem is its performance. I play it on an i7 quadcore with an ok gaming video card.In a ridiculous resolution (1280x720). And the game lags in huge levels. I even got the feeling, that sometimes when I hit a button it just doesn't react at all. So there seems to be a technical problem in the core engine.- Speedrunning concept: The developers want you to speedrun the levels. There is a bonus if you finish within a narrow time limit. But you just don't see enough in a lot of levels with your small point of view. So sometimes, suddenly, out of nowwhere, an enemy appears or a big block goes straight towards you. And you don't feel like you had a lot of chances to avoid it, except for learning the level by hard. Wrong approach in my opinion.- Boss fights: The bosses mostly annoy me, they are hard but not in a good way. Hard to describe.- Full price is too expensive. I paid 5€ during sale which seems ok, but it is definitely not worth 15€.  Here you have better options (e.g. BattleBlock Theater).Conclusion:It's ok to play it in easy mode, casually, then you will have a lot of fun. But I wouldn't speedrun it or try to get every achievement.			"

Early Access Review
								Update [Spoiler Alert... Skip to Early Access section to avoid]: I beat the game in speedrun mode, took over two hours straight for me to do. I was behind in the race I was doing at first, but I quickly took a lead in the earlygame as I went through all the levels I knew beforehand in a flash, giving be this big star lead over my friend.  But when I finally did get to the home stretch, my friend took the lead and ended up getting to the asteroid before me. I managed to catch up within 10-20 minutes, and I actually found the path before him, but I gave up on the path as I assumed it was the wrong one... Then he ended up just telling me because we were both taking so long on the level.  We both took a snack break, pausing our games at the same time, and after we continued, I lost.  I kept going though, as I wanted to see how long it would take me to finish my run.  Yeah... I actually liked the experience, but the fact that a single mistake would cost me anywhere between fifteen seconds and nearly a minute really added up.  (Anyone else just kept jumping into spikes? I know I did. Alot.)  I'll be playing through the regular mode 100% before I modify this to be a full review.Before we go to early access section, just remember this.  IF YOU GET THIS GAME, IT WILL BE TOUGH.[Below was in Early Access, before the first boss was moved and some modifications to levels were made.]Jump! Dash! Jump! Dash! Die! Repeat until level is complete!Yes, this is a 2D classic-style platformer with a lot of hidden references.  I'll warn you this, it gives you infinite jumps.  Now you may think that's overpowered, but remember, the obstacles get pretty hard, and your afterburners are your only way of dealing damage other than ramming your head into some of the enemies.  One hit and you die.This game is EASILY speedrunner friendly, and unique.  Heck, they even let you test out the controls on the title screen!  I love it when games let me do that.  Gives me a convenient way to warm-up pre-run.You can customize the T-Rex you play as. (Spoiler alert: Mine already has a Megaman helmet!)  From colors, heads/helmets, boots, heck even to your boots' trails, it's all customizable.  The shop mixes up every 15 minutes of playtime after you leave the Dinonaut Base, so be ready to rush to the store and check it out if you have 2000 coins or so already!  (This timer includes time used resetting the level, from what I can tell, only time spent in the shop seems to not count.)The difficulty? Oh, yeah, it's quite unforgiving, but only if you want that no death star...  Otherwise you respawn at checkpoints... UNLESS you play on the harder mode--it even has rage quit in its name... Listen, that mode gives you 3 lives and no checkpoints for the ENTIRE game if I understand it correctly.  I've only played up to the first boss so far, though, so I don't know exactly how hard it'll get.From what I can tell, it gives you 3 singleplayer save files, so you atleast don't have to delete all progress files every time you restart the game.  Not sure if the files are seperate in Coop or not yet.  The controls are VERY accurate.  Once you input a control, it feels basically instant responses, atleast with the Xbox 360 Controller that I was using.  Oh yeah, did I mention?  It supports controllers directly!The soundtrack is excellent, infact if the soundtrack doesn't come with the game, I'll probably go ahead and pick up the soundtrack if it's cheap enough.  It's not often that I actually listen to the game's music/sounds if I'm not streaming my run, excluding certain games of course...  But this game easily passes to a point where I'll probably barely ever not listen to it.  Infact, this is probably one of the first platformers to make it on that list of mine.You can directly challenge the WR IL times if you wish, thus if you just want to try to hit a IL record, you can easily get ready to do so through that.  You also can challenge your PB--infact it does so on its own if you already have beaten the stage before apparently.  It took approximately 1.2 hours for me to get through the first set of levels and the first boss in total, if you include trying to get the 3 stars in most of the levels and the time spent shopping/adjusting to the controls. (Which I got in all of them except the boss!)I'll likely come back and update the review if possible after I have more gameplay.  But seriously, it's 20% off until the 30th, and you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free if you get it during early access?  It's easily worth the price tag for how much you can do in the game.  See you when I update this review, and if I end up not updating it, in the next review I do!(Rating of the game that I consider as of reviewing: 10/10, as I can't see any flaws so far, aside from the fact that there's a few things not in the game just yet, but should be in the game soon considering full release is upcoming!)

Early Access Review
								First review hype aside, I think Jump Jet Rex is an already decent game with great potential.  It was updated recently (showing that it's not yet abandoned) with the last set of levels and clear plans for the forth (and seemingly final) boss so has much of the game completely built therefore.  The new update also included one of the most crucial things required by all games, a.k.a. an extensive settings menu that (finally) allows players to escape full screen mode and alter sound within the game engine.  The settings themselves are rather basic, but that is passable in this case due to the basic nature of the game.  Despite being basic, this game WILL kick your bum time and time again if you are a casual player.  It is because of this that I recommend the game only to cautionary players who are aware of it's potential difficulty.  It is one game which is hard but in fair ways, so pros at games like Dark Souls may not be phased, but normal players can expect a challenging game with much to find and more awaiting for those patient enough to wait for each update.*****That said, THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and therefore I advise extreme hesitation as you may not get your money's worth if the project fails.

												This game is a retro-styled 2D action platformer. Its is colourful, charming, addictively fun, and very frustratingly difficult! As is the style with the retro 2D platformer, Jump Jet Rex throws its hat into the ring as an easy to learn, insanely difficult to master platformer. The aim is to simply collect all 3 ""stars"" in a level, awarded to you if you complete the level within a time limit, complete the level without dying, and one for just getting through the level at all. The challenge comes in the fact that the player needs as many stars as possible to unlock more and more levels in order to complete the game. You'll find yourself going back to old levels in the hope of beating it quickly this time, or without dying this time, all with the objective of collecting those prescious stars. The gameplay as one may expect is controlling a small dinosaur with jet shoes. That concept alone is endearing but the player can also fully customise the apprearance of their rex and their jet shoes. You'll be flying, jumping, and boosting your way through treacherously difficult mazes and obstacles. The game also features boss battles which offer a nice change of pace. Overall, this game is recommended for fans of old-school 2D platformers, the kind that are so addictive yet will have you screaming at your screen in fury at how difficult it is. Think Super Meat Boy, with jet shoes and you're not far off. However, if you are a gamer who would be put off bythe steep challenge, I don't think this game is for you.My score: 8/10			"

												It's unfortunate that, among all of these retro-throwback games, JumpJet Rex doesn't seem to get a lot of attention and is even negatively compared. It clearly has plenty of buyers and players, but it's still seemingly not often mentioned. Even after reading some of the criticism (not that there's much anyway) I am still flabbergasted as to why, because it's easy to see just how much of a labor of love this game is (and I'll note right now that the game controls great, don't know why that was an issue for anyone). Much care and thought has been put into the game, what with the level design coinciding with the strict yet still possible time limits given if you choose to speedrun levels. This is mixed with some legitimately nostalgic aesthetic touches which show that the people who made this game clearly were alive back in the day long enough to know what it was like. This isn't just any ol' imitation, I could legitimately see a game like this having been around back in the 90s on the SNES (not the NES despite the style of the soundtrack; the graphics are too nice for the NES otherwise), and as a child I could imagine this being my favorite game.Admittedley, as an adult it's not my favorite, as it can be frustrating at times, particularly when attempting to obtain some treasures in the game, though it is due to a legitimate toughness as opposed to any glitches or nigh-impossible fake difficulty. Though the game does get harder, it does become more rewarding to play as you feel like you actually accomplish things when you obtain victories, even minor ones, as the game takes practice rather than luck. This is the case whether you are speed-running, exploring to find secrets, or just breezing through the levels, and it's great that all of those options are available. The game retains its challenge either way since you'll be facing actual platforming (or ""platflying"") challenges, especially when treasure-seeking. I will say, however, if you do happen to just play through the game in a ""Point A to Point B,"" manner, you are not going to enjoy this game nearly as much since, especially for ten bucks, the game can actually feel like a great adventure (yes, adventure).Though I said it's not my favorite game as an adult, the passion the developers show here seeps into my heart and makes me love it just as much as they likely did, and so I still find this to be among the greatest games on all of Steam, possibly even the best of the retro-throwbacks I've played (if not, it's damn close). In terms of recommendations, particularly since it doesn't seem well-known or oft-discussed, it comes quickly off the top of my head among my first recommendations.			"

												Jumpjet Rex is one of those tough as nails platformers reminescent of the NES days. The gameplay is so solid and fun, easy to learn hard to master, the music is freakin' boppin, the bosses are awesome and innovative, there's slight customization where you can buy little outfits and stuff for your rex. This game has no dull moments. No filler levels or levels that cut short, making you go ""wow that was fast"". I beat the game in one 3 hour sitting, but I did not 100% it yet because the last few stages had me in an utter ♥♥♥♥ingraging mess because of the DAMN GLOBBY STUFF. I just want to thank the developer for unleashing the monster within me to get SO mad at the last level I opened a new can of my Rip-It Energy Drink, chugged it all in one go in front of my buds, and yelled ♥♥♥♥! really loud and beat the last stage after 200+ attempts in that ONE try.Thank you for JumpJet Rex, please make a sequel or DLC I love this game THANK YOU TREEFORTRESS GAMES!!!!

												JumpJet Rex is a fantastic new take on the precision platformer genre. The first few levels aren't fantastic but they let you get to grips with the controls and prepare you for the faster paced, more dangerous levels to come. The main focus of the game is to use Rex's foot mounted jets to stay off the ground and keep a solid momentum while jumping, flying and propelling forward through each level; collecting coins and jumping through rings along the way. Level design is very creative and although the levels are short the game encourages replaying them by offering rewards for no death runs as well as speederuns. Those are optional however so more casual players can still enjoy the game.JumpJet Rex isn't perfect, however. The soundtrack is quite good but a bit repetitive and the controls could be just a little tighter. There are upgrades to be unlocked as well but they're all entirely cosmetic. I think it would've been nice to be able to buy a few upgrades to jump higher or move faster.Overall I'd say it's worth the low price as the gameplay manages to be both unique and familiar at the same time, not to mention an absolute blast to play.

												First playing through all the levels and collecting stuff, I was a little indifferent. It was decent fun, but it was kind of on the easy side. Didn't really stand out.Going back and playing through in speedrun mode after I knew the levels kind of well, I got it, yeah. And going through and getting good times on individual levels by themselves, too, I got it. This is a great speedgame, but a relatively easy game on its own, for a platformer at least. It's like, a casual speedrunning game, or something. There's not a lot of competition in the leaderboards though, unfortunately.The bosses all have a trick to them that basically trivializes them but fighting them any other way is tedious, I find them very weird. Sometimes it feels like my dash input was being dropped, or the dash cancel was being dropped. Not often, but I noticed it, felt weird when it happened.Game looks nice, probably not enough levels, only about 45 and only a few take more than a minute when speedrunning, ends up feeling really short. Not a fan of some of the grindy achievements, but they're optional and most of the achievements are good.It's fun to play and optimize the levels and that's about all I could really ask, just wish there was a bit more of a challenge to it overall but ehh! Pretty good game, not one of my favorites ever or anything but I'm glad I played it.			"

												Fun lil' platformer that is worth checking out. Levels are broken down into 3 stars (1 each for completion, zero deaths and under time limit) and thus allows the player to decide how they wish to approach each given level. Though bosses are gated behind a prerequisite amount of stars, the amount that is required is rather fair and gives you the wiggle room needed to avoid doing those levels that you dislike (or perform poorly at). There is a wide amount of cosmetic  customisation that allows you to dress your dino in any way you wish (I went with a pink dino with a robot helm because why not). Price per piece seems to be a bit high, so if you plan on getting them all or wishing to 100% this game, I would imagine that it will take you a while to do so. I should note that I did not play the co-op nor did I play with kb&m. It felt more natural to play with a controller (Xbone) in order to get a bit more precision that is required at the later levels..All in all, worth picking up and giving it a go.			"

												Definitely a solid purchase if you're someone who likes:-solo time trials in racing games (this is the whole game basically)-fast paced, quick reaction gameplay-a good challengeYou probably wont like it if you're someone who:-Wants a chill game to sit down and play while watching a movie at the same time-Gets frustrated quickly from failure-Needs a story driven single player experienceI'm the type of person who gets bored of a game if I'm not dying/losing at least once in a while. That being said, I've only played for about an hour and a half and I love it. It's a great game if you've got 30 minutes to spare, or need something to do while another game loads/matchmakes.This game probably isn't for everyone, but if you think that you do fit into the criteria above, I'd confidently say that this game is a good pickup.

The overlaying meta of having Rex's spaceship, and the customisation via points is another great aspect.Graphics are pretty tight, and the controls are juuuuust right.

												TL;DRPros:A lot of variety regarding levels.Jet boots offer a fun variety of moves.Fair learning curve.Nice soundtrack.Rex Controls very well for this type of game.Cons:Looking back that game feels a bit shorter than expected.In JumpJet Rex you take control of Rex through a series of platforming challenges that can range from simple to pretty crazy (especially when going for specific stars.) The length of levels are about on par with 'The End' in super meat boy being ~45 seconds, however some maps can be upwards to 2+ minutes long featuring a multitude of paths to take or being a long path filled to the brim with traps.The main mechanic of the game are the Jump jet boots Rex wears. The boots allow him to jump anywhere in the air as much as he'd like, but if you wanna go fast, you can dash sideways, stomp down for faster falling speed, or boost upwards which is faster than spamming jump, but is initially much slower. Overall I love those boots, it's surprising how creative you can get with some obstacles and saving a lot of time on a nice chunk levels.The goal of each level isn't necessarily just beating them either, Like Super Meat Boy there's a par time that they push you to complete under, in my case they seemed pretty fair with a few curve balls they throw in to catch you off guard and force you to think out the box. Then there's deathless runs, which can be absolutely brutal on the late levels that can be ~2 minute long runs of non-stop pain for your Dino. There's two other goals that aren't necessary for getting the ending, grabbing all coins, and finding all secret loot stashed in the levels, so if you're a completionist, expect some hunts for specific coins or treasure.All in all that games pretty great, albeit a little short for my tastes. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of challenging platformers, there was a lot more fun than frustration and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.As of this review I've completed the game, 3 starred all missions, and collected all secret items so feel free to use that for a reference for the length of the game, although the game definitely has high replayability, and if you're crazy about getting those small times to earn nice spots on the leaderboards, then expect a lot more hours invested.

												The best parts of this game? All of it. The soundtrack, the gameplay, the customization, the co-op, the collectables... This game has a lot to offer, so really, when you beat the game, you're really not finished yet, there's still plenty left for you to do. There's still treasure, stars, and coins to collect if you're aiming for 100%. Even after you've done all that, there are two other ways to play, and then there's co-op.			"

												A fun little game mostly based around the precise movement of a cute (and customizable) dinosaur with rocket boots. You have to touch, or shoot at, all the rings in a level and then reach the exit. Doing this without dying, and doing it in under a (quite reasonable) par time gains you extra recognition in the form of Stars marking your completion of the main game objectives.The final stage aside (trial-and-error is not good game design, guys)t the game is relatively forgiving; I beat it on Normal with all 129 stars and hidden items after about 10 hours (so its $9.99 price tag is fully justified) but if you like to 100% games there's way more left to do after that. It would also be a good game to speedrun, as there's almost no randomness at all (enemies either follow fixed global-timer paths or move based on how you move) and it's reliant on your execution.

												Sooooo, what is JumpJet Rex?It’s a jump’n run game similar to Super Meat Boy. There aren’t as much levels in it (and they aren't as hard as in SMB) but the length of a stage is much longer than in SMB.You are a T-rex in space (a dinonaut to be a precise) who has the task to plant a bomb on a meteorite aiming for the earth (to prevent the extinction of all dinosaurs).Rex is equipped with a pair of boots which allow him to fly indefinitely (dash, rocket and unlimited jump). Of course you can’t just fly how you want. The levels are so designed that you have to carefully utilize your abilities to reach the end of a stage in one piece.In each level are 3 stars to get: one for finishing the stage, another one for beating a certain time limit and a third one for reaching the finish line without dying. As you collect stars you unlock more stages. Besides coins you collect in the levels, which you can spend in shops to customize Rex from tip to toe (different heads, body- , jumpboots- and jet stream-colors), you can also find hidden items in each stage which are merely decorative (referring to the gaming society and pop culture) but still nice to have because they aren’t easy to find and give you a feeling of accomplishment.Additionally to the normal levels are 4 boss levels. Those fights are entertaining and at the first sight very hard. But as soon as you look through the enemy and recognize their weakness you can finish a fight in a few seconds (which is also necessary to get the time star ;)).The 8-bit graphics are nice to look at; the different themes of the stages are good conversed to the player. As you would’ve thought the music is 8-bit chiptune. There are some tracks that I really like and furthermore none of the soundtrack gets annoying as you might have thought. Certainly the music and the graphics are not for everyone but if you are fond of 8-bit music and graphics there is no reason against JumpJet Rex (regarding the art and music).I’d recommend the game to those who’d like the 8-bit style, a challenge, and have no problem with doing a level over and over again to fully complete it (For your info: it is not necessary to get ALL stars to finish the game, 2/3 are sufficient to complete the game).

All the places he visits has a ton of gold coins and the occasional gold rings he has to fly through in order to beat the level.

												Another tough 2-D platformer, but with a nice twist to differenciate it from all the others on Steam.you play as a tiny t-rex astronaut with rocket boots, boosting through forests, snowstorms, temples, space stations and other themed worlds. You collect stars for beating the level, making it through without dying and beating the par-time for the level. You need these stars to unlock more levels. And I'll tell you right now, that if you just try to play the levels without going for those bonus stars, you won't get very far. It's almost always worth it to try and get at least 2 stars per level. Which can make things a little frustrating down the line when you don't have enough stars to unlock a level, but by then you'll be good enough at the game to go back and ace through some of the ones you missed. My verdict is that if you really enjoy 2-D platformers, this can be a lot of fun (and very cute.) But if youre hesitant, I reccomend waiting for a sale.			"

												Great fun, great game.Retro graphics and music.Very polished game. Great controls (played with Gamepad), great Hub and attention to detail.The game(play) itself is a fast paced ""platformer"", in which you navigate through levels using your skills.Everything is in-the-air, without the need to ever touch the ground, so it is obviously not a ""classical"" platformer.Controls consist of jumps, fast thrust up and down, a dash, and a spin. These skills have additional nuances to them, and are very responsive.Fast respawns make time-hunting enjoyable.Really, nothing to complain.The only things I didn’t like:* No dub, thus a little bit of text to read at the beginning - story wise. (obviously you can just skip the text.)* One of the early levels you can choose the order/direction you finish the level - I did it just once and left. The other levels I always completed multiple times, to get 0 deaths, time and potential secrets.Up to now I played about an hour, and finished a little bit more than the first section.I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who can enjoy fast paced, skill based platforming.It’s a blast.

												First off, I'm only past the second boss (which I think is about half way through the game looking at the level map) but I already love it!I got the free demo (totally reccomend if you are considering getting it) and I went and bought the game about 3 levels into the demo because I knew it would be great!The level mechanics (so far) don't change too much and it is based mostly on how you manoeuvre Rex with the main actions: Jump, Fly Up, Fly Sideways, Fall and Tail Spin. Once you get used to these controls speeding through the levels becomes a lot more fun and earns you extra stars whilst you're at it!It can be both very easy and very difficult depending on how you play (1st boss was a nightmare until I figured out the gimmick) but even if you don't want a challenge it is still really fun to casually play and not care about the time and death stars.I'm yet to try multiplayer so I can't review it but everything I've seen in the single player is an extremely high positive!

												I can fullhearthly recommend this game. I clocked almost 10hrs so far without any co-op or another difficulty and im still not finished.The game really reminded me of Blues Brothers from the SNES sometimes. You have your basic abilities at your hand and need to get good with them to beat every level and get every star. You will rage a lot but mostly due to your own failure in timing or wrong technic in using the abilities you have at your command. I noticed that first hand as I progressed further into the game, at first some time based stars in the earlier levels were impossible to get for me but later on I just breezed through them as I mastered Rex movements more and more.There will be challenge, but dont be afraid to take it. Play with a controller, warm up and then attempt the star you want to get. All stars are possible as far as I noticed, some require strategy but that is expected.I hope I get to play the co-op based modes (race and normal adventure).The only negative I could think of might be story related. But a game like this doesnt need a lot of story, the old SNES games never had a lot of story and carried their weight purely on the mechanics as does JumpJet Rex.			"

								A fun and challenging game for all. Although it can become challenging, a forgiving checkpoint system and game desgin allow for a more casual play for those who need a little more time to practice their skills. The shop system allows you to spend the coins you collect on hundreds of cosmetic changes including a dinosaur in a pug outfit! I highly recommend checking out JumpJet Rex. It's a lot of fun and very addictive!			"

								Think of this game like Megaman, but with a T-Rex. and it doesn;t make you want to take a hammer to the consel. It is one of THE best 2d Pixxel art games I have played in a long time. The music is very well done. and it has a T-Rex. there are tons of things to do to get more stars to challege your self, it has a T-Rex with Jet boots. Tons of Levels and Different costumes for the T-REX WITH ROCKET BOOTS!. So pick it up for sure, it will be better than any other pixxel art game this year. unless they make a game with two T-Rex's but i doub it. :)			"

												I love it! A hard platformer game that is diffrent from others I've played. It really stands out with gameplay and it's graphics . The game's controls are hard to get used to at first, as there are ways you can move that arent very common in platformers. Dying is common and levels get hard quickly - In total it takes about 10 hours of gameplay to fully 100% the game and it is very enjoyable. Definitely worth the price, would recommend to anyone who loves challenging platformers, like Super meat boy, Risk of rain, Spelunky or even ROM hack players on emulators.			"

												JJR is flippin' hard, but flippin' rad. Seriously. Think old school 8-bit intense gameplay paired with speedrunning and avoiding life-ending obstacles. There's also boss fights like Mega Man and you gotta use your dino-jetpack to fight them. Levels? It's got a whole bunch. Each level has certain objectives (finish without dying, complete under a certain time frame, etc.) and you earn stars as you complete them. Earn enough stars, you unlock more levels and bosses and progress through the game. Don't fret though, you've got as many tries as you'd like to complete the levels, theres no ""game over"" waiting if you're not quick enough. But for real, be prepared to be frustrated on certain levels. Sometimes you'll repeatedly make the same mistake of boosting into a laser beam....and yeah, you'll get annoyed. But it's still fun!The variety of level design keeps the game fresh as you play on and the cleverness of being a little dinosaur keeps it fun. If you collect enough coins while playing, you can buy aesthetic upgrades to change the appearance of your character and customize it to your liking. So could I keep talking about the game? Sure. But ultimately you should really give it a shot and see how you like it. If you're at all interested in games that challenge your skills in a fun speed-run/platformer way then I think you'll like this game a lot. 8/10 (needs more dinosuars)*Updated: So the game has had a bunch of updates as its progressed. A new health system is in place so you can take a few hits before you're ""dead"". This makes the game not nearly as hard as it was before, but still challenging. Theres a bunch of new levels added and secrets to find and all that jazz. Still awesome music too.*			"

Early Access Review
								I just wanted to say that this game is great. A wonderful 2D 8-Bit platformer that I absolutely recommend to anyone (although I would recommend waiting for the final release).  As an early access title, I feel that there are a lot of problems that, if fixed, will make the game a tad more enjoyable.GREAT STUFF ABOUT THE GAME8-Bit Graphics are beautiful and done very wellMusic is excellent, nothing to complain about hereWorld map is perfect, I like the conceptIt's funPROBLEMS WITH THE GAMEMy main issue is the controls. Being unable to assign buttons yourself and being a controler-less keyboard player, it's a real pain having to use the Alt key and Space key together (I'm on a Mac). I would like to be able to asign buttons myself.The main character is pretty stiff to control. What annoys me the most is the ""Y"" button which is supposed to make the character fly, but the acceleration is slow and constantly jumping is faster. Same with the ground-pound, which has an acceleration too slow and letting the character drop down is as fast. Also, more precision is a little better.The mouse should NOT be used at all in the game. It's a platformer, using a mouse is hellish in these cases.The boss's life bar is often stuck behind him, making it sometimes invisible. The first boss fight (that's as much as I reached) takes a ton of time to beat.The title screen confuses me. I prefer having a menu rather than controlling the character itself. Also, it is very confusing to understand what's going on. Finally, the character can go out of bounds.GLITCHESGetting killed by an enemy and immediately restarting the level, the music will no longer play until you get killed again and you don't restart.Reaching the High Scores will result in having trouble quitting, since you need to use your MOUSE to click the exit button and resume to the title screen.Overall, great game, I can't wait to see how the finished product will look like.

The game is entertaining both just casually and to competetively challenge for better times, Once a few dedicated people with good platforming ability start posting times this game has the potential to become a huge hit with youtubers, streamers and just at home gamers.

								JumpJet Rex is a game with retro, old school art and innovative mechanics.The first level tutorial is easy to understand and the controls are super responsive with an Xbox 360 controller. It's fun to customize my Rex, too. I have a pink and black one.Beating each level isn't the hard part. There's always a way to get by and do it faster. Even though there's a leader board,  I've found myself wanting to beat my own personal time over and over despite holding the #1 spot in a level.  As you keep playing, you'll find yourself addicted to besting yourself. Not a lot of games are like that. Recommended 100%			"

								All this time I was looking for the correct game to play on here, for the longest while that was The Binding of Isaac Rebirth until I heard the creation of this beauty.While still only in Early Access, it delivers fun and inovative game-play with the option to play and compete with friends.This is the kind of game I will cherish for a long while and come back to, why?It has immense replay value, a fun, cute mascot/character that everyone can enjoy to play as.The funnest part is it has a little of something for nearly everyone.Those who are competitive can enjoy going against the big guns in level completion time-wise in the leaderboards.Enjoy dressing up characters? The other fun part is accessorizing and upgrading your little dino.The most pleasing part for me is the design, it gives me the nostalgic Link to the Past, Earthbound, Snes feel to it. Making it extremely easy for me to play the game without discomfort.I highly suggest picking up a copy if you can, especially after early access.			"

								Assuming you've watched the trailer, you're getting exactly what it says. The controls are sharp, responsive, and leave everything up to the player after a very brief learning curve. The game becomes incredibly satisfying after you gain some mastery over the controls. The customization can be funny, intimidating, cute, or anything in between, and the list of customization options will only grow as I understand it. The graphics and art are absolutely charming and include just the right amount of retro, with some fantastic and appropriate music to match.If you're a casual player, there's some satisfying exploration and a lot of satisfying customization, and the difficulty will not overwhelm you.If you're a hardcore player, there are leaderboards and challenging secrets to collect. Achievements forthcoming, I hear.If you're a speedrunner, you'll probably live on the leaderboards. Also, the devs are listening to speedrunning feedback. This game will be a smooth experience if you want to do full-game runs in the full release if that's your thing. Get started now if you're interested, cause there are some exciting levels to compete on already!No matter what kind of gamer you are, there's something in this game for you. I'm already getting my money's worth with the amount of content in the game, and I can't wait for all the levels to be implemented.			"

								JumpJet Rex is a retro-styled platformer about T-Rex with a jetpack in space saving planet from a meteor. Do you still need to know more to get it?But, seriously, the game has extremely tight and polished controls (I'd say SMB level), very nice aesthetics, cool retro soundtrack and very, very, VERY tough levels (again, I'd compare it to SMB).If you like those kind of games - you'll enjoy the hell out of JumpJet Rex.A couple of minor downsides as of v0.2.0:- Music tends to stop after deaths sometimes- Game has only about 15 levels now, but more coming soon, so that's pretty much covered :DA bit of gameplay and me failing horribly in the video below:

												Solid cheap game. Challenging. Very satisfying to beat the game/difficult levels. It is possible to complete the game even if you aren't really good and in my opinion it isn't punishing for casual players compared to other hardcore platformer games. It is a punishing game if you go for no death & timer challenges.You'll occasionally have to find/play around bugs to reach top leaderboard spots if you get interested in that.I've gotten several rank one/high leaderboard spots and it seems that the timer on some of the levels do glitch out sometimes when you download an opponent ghost even if I'm faster and ahead of them it'll say my time wasn't better when I reach the finish line.

(review part 2) I've played through the game more and ive had a change of heart the game levels do get longer as you go with a nice element of challenge, you get used to the controling eventually, the music is still awesome, and i do like the custimization element as well.

The difficulty curve is perfect and its really fun to try and beat your own records. The soundtrack is awesome. The controls are very tight and responsive and the hitboxes are dead on. You never feel like you died because something hit you from too far away and you can cut corners next to hazard blocks insanely close without dying if you have the skill to do so.

								So this is a pretty interesting game. I never thought a game about a T-Rex in space with rockets strapped to his feet would be so addicting (mainly because I never thought about a T-Rex in space with rockets strapped to his feet). But it's quite a nice game. The controls are very tight, though the movement is by design not ""stop on a dime"" due to you know... flying. And rocket engine propelling. You need to know you're gonna stop and kind of plan your routes about 1/2 second in advance, and BOY is it addicting.This game will be speedrunners' dreams I think. No glitches, just pure timing and trying again and again XD.Oh, and it can get quite difficult too. Some levels had me cursing like crazy, but you don't want to stop. It's like a light, colourful, 2D Dark Souls Sen's Fortress where you die in 1 touch from anything and you can't attack but there are no enemies. Yes. That's basically it. At times difficult as hell, but so satisfying when you DO IT.Do I recommend it? I sure do. Especially for the price. It's only going to get better from here on out. And oh boy... THE MUSIC. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS THE MUSICCCCCCCCCC. It's so good.			"

												Polished and flawless, JumpJet Rex is a seamless weave of creativity and style. The controls are effortlessly simple, but each level will require you to hone your maneuvering skills in order to beat the par time. Every game mechanic is spot-on and well thought out, from checkpoints and waypoints to coin and star collection, nothing is needlessly grindy or unnecessarily obtuse. The challenges offered run the gamut from casual to controller-throwing, so a gamer of any commitment level will discover many hours of enjoyment. For those who love exploration there are secrets and collectibles on almost every level, and the boss levels have light puzzle elements for those who want to beat them under par. With multiple single-player and multiplayer game modes & minigames, there really is something here for everyone.			"

								This game is fantastic.It's a 2D beautifully pixel art platforming adventure game. Rex is a dinosaur trying to stop the evil from being so evil, a very straight forward and enjoyable theme much like the classics of Mario Megaman Donkey Kong and recent ones like Shovel Knight.But this actually has very unique gameplay mechanics. You mostly move around by dashing, dropping height, and jet boosting across traps, bad guys and spikes.Something you don't see at first too is that this game has the level of detail that makes it so unique and awesome to come back to. Like finding secret stages, secret exits, hidden coins, collectible items that come back to your Space HQ and decorate it, all with adorable and awesome design and art tune.This game right now is still in development, and even chatting with the players to find possible new awesome content. Right now it has quite a lot of content tho. A shop with very iconic references for unique outfits like Megaman's helmet, Castle Crashers, Sub Zero's Mask. And the shop randomizes which items you have available so it's a fun thing to check .Each stage is quite unique and the soundtrack follows the exploration-adventure theme fantastically.Even has some Speed Running mechanics and a game mode in the future, as well a Rage Quit game mode that I would not try since I would not have a death wish but awesomely referencing Michael from RT ""I believe"".

												This game doesn't know what it wants to be. It simultaneously attempts to be both a platformer in which you go as quickly as possible and try for the best time, and a platformer in which you hunt down secrets and get all the collectables. Neither of these goals are accomplished well.The air dash is extremely inconsistent and hard to control, and didn't even work half of the times that I tried to use it. Every trap on the map is on a global timer, which makes sense on paper, but it starts as soon as the level loads; this means that getting the best time will sometimes require you to guess when to actually start moving around so as to be able to bypass timed lasers and moving enemies. This also makes getting 3 star ratings extremely obnoxious to get, and certainly not worth the effort for achievements.Coins are strewn about the levels, encouraging you to pick them up, but most are far too out of the way to be able to still get a good time. There are also collectables and warp zones (for lack of a better phrase) that are only accessible if you go the completely wrong direction. Some collectables, as far as I can tell, are entirely unobtainable as well, and exist only to taunt you. Graphically, this game is a fairly forgettable 2D pixel art style. Nothing pretty, but nothing painful to look at either. Music is generic chip tunes, but again, forgettable. Sound effects are all but nonexistent as far as I can tell.Overall, this game is, as I've said several times already, a forgettable speedrunning platformer. Controls are slippery, most abilities don't work half the time you try to use them, and level design is laughable at best.			"

								I first played JumpJet Rex when it was a prototype browser game.  It sure has come a long way!I'm not a huge platformer guy, but JJR is pretty great.  I find myself replaying levels to get all of the stars (for not dying, completing it in a certain time, etc.).  There are sometimes secret passages in levels, too.  You can tell a lot of work went into what we have so far - and it's only in early access! You can even customize JJR!  I put a dang horn on my guy to make a dang narwhal dinosaur and I love it.If you like platformers, you'll love JumpJet Rex.			"

												WARNING keep in mind i never give 10/10s. because nothing is perfect. 9/10 is what i consider the best (like portal and papers please) keep this in mind while you are reading my review. My points system is BP or burger points. You each start out with 5 BP and they will be added and subtracted as such. As a die hard fan of indie games I can say I think this is by far one of the best. I'M SERIOUS! There is not enough of this kind of game type anymore! Witch for me is +1 BP i only played a bit of this game. but what i played was fun! it was high paced and oddly calming for me as i had to focus. Witch I say is +1 more BP. And the lvls are designed great (like most of everything else) so +1 BP story is basic but there will be no points given for it. same with controls. on the bad side I have 1 thing WHY ARE YOU TELLING US ABOUT SECRETS! I like there to be mystery about these things. But I hardly doubt it will cost a full BP for this discrepancy.  -0.5 BP IN THE ENDI leave you with a score of 7.5/10 BP I say well done lady’s and gents and may you keep getting better at what you do!

								65 million years ago dinosaurs ruled the earth and then suddenly vanished.... so we thought. Dinosaurs have actually lived among us for millions of years on a small tropical island called Isla Nublar. What was once believed to be  a hollywood movie, ""Jurassic Park"" turned out to be an actual real documentary about the events that took place on the island and documented the attempts that humans  tried to gain control over these dominant creatures.Due to unlawful experimentation the humans were able to give the dinosaurs extreme human like intelligence. It would ultimately be the downfall of mankind. Ever so tired of the villany of the humans, the dinosaurs rebeled against their captures and soon regained control of the island. Any attempts to reach the island were met with failure.For many years the dinosaurs planned a way to rid the world of the human race. Using the data collected from the scienist that worked there, the dinosaurs were able to construct and weaponize a lethal dna virus that could kill the humans with imediate exposure. Once unleashed , the virus quickly spread; wiping out the entire human population. Dinosaurs once again ruled the earth.Over 5,000 years have passed since the virus wiped out humanity. As time went on the dinosaurs intelligence continued to grow as did their techonology. To overcome their problems with moblity they designed space ships and rocket boots that allowed them to move with great ease. It wasn't long after they started to colonize space, setting up many space stations and offworld colonies. The second era of dinosaurs looked bright.Alas  not all was well in the universe. A dark long forgotten force had grown angry at the dinosaurs. In it's anger it summoned a huge meteor to crash on the dinosaurs home planet earth hoping to wipe them out from existance.Now as a first responder: JumpJetRex, you must save your home planet from annihilation. Using your wits, and of course your rocket boots; you must overcome the many challanges that face you ahead. The fate of the planet rests in your hands.Dinosaurs- checkSpace- CheckRocket Boots- CheckA damn fun time?- Check10/10			"

								JumpJet Rex, a game where dying is just the beginning! With intense platforming action, JJR keeps the palms sweaty every moment you play. You think having a bird flap between pipes was difficult? Try having a T-Rex with jump boots maneuver through a cavalcade of horrors that only get worse the more levels you play! Not only that, but once you think you're done with a level, you get a ranking system that tells you how inadequate you are as a person because you only just scraped by! So then you need to replay that level and do it better because you are adequate! And that's how you get hooked. Or at least that is what happened to me...Short review: JJR is an awesome, challenging game full of jumping, dashing and butt dropping! And also full of those godawful electric blocks,,,PS, there is an obtainable wall scroll of bacon! How can you not love that?			"

								Where to even begin with?Well for those who are in love with the platforming genre, stop reading my review andbuy this game immediately.Now for the other I'll detail it a bit more ;)Jumpjet Rex is a very fun, old-school yet modern platformer, but not your typical platformer. If you really need a comparison with other title, it would be a merge between Super Meat Boy and Fenix Rage. It's medium-paced, which makes it moderately ""hardcore"". By moderately hardcore I mean the kind of hardcore everyone can play, even casual players ;) So even if you're a casual player, don't be afraid by the trailer or the images !In term of gameplay, you have infinite jumps and dash to the sides, with various hazards to avoid. Each levels contains 3 stars to get, the first one is obtained by finishing the level, the second one by beating a time limit, and the third one by not dying more than a set number of times (for the first levels it's zero of course).Last but not least, the game has a heavy customization aspect. If like me, you like a good game in which you can over-customize your character in quadrillion of possible ways then this game is definitely for you. Each customizable piece of the rex has many parts available. The pieces are head/skin color/jetboots trail color/boots color. That really makes for a big variety.**CONCLUSION**Couldn't recommend it more. I hesitated for a long time, and I was awfully wrong ! Grab that credit card of yours and add this game to your cart right now (you even get a free extra copy to give to a friend if you buy it during Early Access).			"

								I've gotten through the first boss and have really enjoyed it so far. The first boss was fairly straightforward once I realized I could shoot lasers from my boots, but still quite a challenge to beat without dying.Which brings up the most interesting aspect of this game: The DIY difficulty. Any level can be completed by simply hammering through it and dying endlessly (all items collected are saved), but you'll only get one star. The other two are for not dying, or doing it under a certain time. I really liked this because it gave me a reason for going back, but also didn't halt my progress when I encountered a particularly difficult (for me) level. It's also much better than the seemingly arbitrary stars given out in Angry Birds.As far as the mechanics go, I can safely say this game plays great with a keyboard and mouse. The controls are tight, and when I die it was annoyance with myself for rushing and not being careful, never with the game itself for being unfair.Definitely recommend to regular and casual players alike, but if Super Meatboy is more your thing, this game (thankfully imo) is not that level of difficulty.If you'd like to see a video of me playing the first few levels and first boss, I've included it below. Fair Warning though: this video was done as a ""Let's Play"" mostly for my friends at work, so it contains commentary and all together too much swearing.

								JumpJet Rex is an arcade platformer designed to be rewarding and satisfying at any level of play. There is no difficulty option; you're set on course with all the necessary tools at your discression to simply have fun with the game, or make it a competitive speed runner to climb the leaderboards against your friends.Each level has a prime directive which is to get to the goal at no matter the cost, however you're awarded extra stars for completing a level with out dying, or reaching the goal in record time; however, like any good retro-inspired platformer, you're rewarded in your efforts for exploring and collecting coins. Scattered throught out most, if not all levels, there's secret warpzones and costumes for you to collect and buy to decorate Rex in your own fashion.The art is top notch, and each level is a vibrant landscape that you'll probably come back to multiple times again to beat your fastest time, and earn coins, and the music is excellent that - you'll probably get a few tunes stuck in your head in the same fashion Strike the Earth from Shovel Knight has become an instant classic much like the classic theme from Mario Brothers and other games.JumpJet Rex is a solid platformer that everyone should try regardless of the title of ""early access"" being plastered on it's store page. Support TreeFortress and their games, I'm thoroughly excited for what more this game will offer.			"

												I've had this game on my wishlist for quite some time, since it was in early-access. When it was fully released, it went on sale, so I decided to pick it up. I was skeptical at first, but I didn't regret it at all.The thing you'll be doing in the game is just getting to the exit of levels. To do so, you can jump an infinite amount of times with your jet boots, dash left or right, hold a button to fall faster, or hold a button to fly upwards faster than you could jump, although this is difficult to control. Projectiles shoot out of your jet boots each time you jump or dash. If you jump, they shoot downwards, and if you dash, they shoot out in the opposite direction you dashed. These can be used to attack enemies and bosses, which makes boss fights unique and interesting. Although, there are only four boss fights. There are 37 regular levels, not including the final level. To unlock the door that leads to the level exit, you need to go through rings scattered about the level. Sometimes this just means finding them once and moving on to the next one, other times it means all the rings are on the same screen and you need to go through the same ring up to three or four times; there's an amount of time that must pass before you can activate the ring again. The level design is overall pretty creative, and many levels have their own little quirks.It isn't as simple as getting to the end of the level, however. Three stars are available to be earned, depending on how well you do in each level. You can earn a star simply by completing the level, another by completing it without dying, and another by completing it in a certain amount of time. Completing a level in the target time is usually the hardest thing to do. Other levels are unlocked by stars. You can't simply just complete levels or you wouldn't earn enough stars. However, unlocking other levels is fairly easy. You can earn a total of 123 stars (of which I have earned 109). If I didn't want to, I wouldn't even have to complete the last levels of the game, since I had already unlocked the final level. The amount stars required for unlocking levels is very low, so don't worry about having to unlock every single star; some of them are very difficult.Scattered throughout some levels are hidden collectables. Each time you find one, it is shipped to Rex's space base. It's neat to see the walls become decorated with various different things, although they serve no function. Also scattered throughout levels are coins and giant rubies worth 1000 coins. Coins can be spent at shops to customize Rex's appearance. You can customize the color of Rex's boots, the color of fire or whatever it is that comes out of his boots, his body color, and even his head; there are heads that make him look like Rambo, a ninja turtle, and even Megaman (this is the one I use).So now for the little things. The music is... lackluster. There are probably around 10 tracks, and none of them are memorable. They're simply mediocre at best, and if a glitch occurred that would have muted the music, I probably wouldn't have minded. Graphics are decent. I'm disappointed that yet another developer chose to go with the pixel-art route, however. I'd like to see more... wholesome graphics. Controller support is good; if you use a controller with Xinput, button prompts change. I have 9 hours in the game and I have 109 of 123 stars. I'm not going to try to get the others, as the're simply too hard. For what you pay for this game, that's a pretty decent value for your money.There's not much else to say, really. It's a simple game that does what it does well. I highly reccomend it.			"

New fossil records show proof of dinosaur designed jet boots, this educational game takes that new information and uses science to provided the best guess of what they were like.Take control of a friendly hero to the dino-universe and save it from impending meteoric doom by dashing through rings and collecting gold coins.  Gameplay is a quick responsive jumping and air dashing to race through well designed levels, better performance rewards more stars used to unlock further levels.This fast moving action however does not translate as well to the boss fights which are sluggish, bland and occasionally buggy.

												Default gamepad binds don't work for me, can't rebind them (tried through ingame menu, searched google/SPUF for threads, found nothing). Dealbreaker for me in a game like this, quickly turned into one of the most annoying games I have ever played.If I could set the controls how I'd like them, I may still not recommend it for 10€, seems pretty repetitive and just not that interesting unless you care about leaderboards.

												Fun and challenging platformer gamePros:+ Fitting soundtrack+ Challenge+ Pixel art graphics+ Co-op for the most part+ Leaderboards (partly)+ Quite responsive controls+ You can customize your characters with accessories and outfits that have references to popular video game characters.+ You can choose to go for a speedrun, no death run or 100% collection run without having to do them all at onceCons:- Top time leaderboards seem to be either done in co-op, different difficulty compared to yours or cheated. There are replays where top solo leaderboard players tp/disappear to end of the level after a few seconds.- It can be hard to find some secrets. Some secret paths don't even show a slight highlight. This can make you spend a lot of time in each level.- Enemies can move out of their designated zone while fighting them using spin attack. Some areas require killing such enemies before the door to next area is opened, so you can lose a lot of progress in a level if this happens.- Co-op can be hard with limited vision.- Limited vision in Asteroid stage makes it very hard to see where all the collectibles are.- Controls occassionally bug out during retries/cutscenes and the last bosses second phase becomes very easy because of this.- Inputs seem to have slight delay.- Last boss fight requires a lot of almost pixel-perfect timings with all it's quick attacks and weak-spot regeneration mechanic... or it can be made very easy by just gliding at all 3 spots and then spinning with the controls bug.- It takes long to find enough money for all customization unlocks, meaning the game is somewhat grindy.- You can rarely get killed out of nowhere in Tower of Power8.5/10			"

												After getting a code of this game to play with my friend I decided to hop in a play before he was on, I ended up just going over to his place with a spare steam controller and playing it on the steam link.The game is terrible, it tries too hard to accomplish too many goals at once and attempts to have the same style of Duck Game.The game falls flat on its face due to not being set in what it wants to be and It fails to complete the actual goals it  presented early on.Would you buy this game for anything more than multiplayer?NO. Unless you are a speedrunner, buy Duck Game for a game like this that provides THE SAME EXPIRENCE more or less with better multiplayer and the same speedrunning gameplay but smaller package and better humor.

								All you do in this game is jump and shoot yourself forward.It's not very long, not very hard, too repetitive and there's no upgrade or anything. You can simply change your clothing and appearance. It's in early access and the final boss is missing still, but the rest is there. About 4 or 5 players are actively playing at the moment.All in all, I don't recommend it. It's more sonic without the speed than megaman/metroid.I was surprised that it was this boring and repetitive with all the positive reviews it got. It's literally just jump and shoot yourself forward. Nothing else!I recommend you to watch a video of it before buying. And thumbs up if you avoided buying because of this. Thanks ;).			"

												Fun and cute little platformer involving a T-rex with rocket boots. Fly through each level as fast as you can and activate all the rings while avoiding enemies, lasers and other hazards. Post your best times to the leaderboards. Plenty of secrets and collectables for completionists. I enjoyed my time with this game. The biggest complaint I have about it is that the last level takes place in the dark and is also a maze full of spikes. I didn't find it fun to die a ton of times trying to find the correct path. Once you know the way, it's not so bad. Pick this up on sale for a fun little indie title.			"

												This might be the most perfect game I've ever played. Each level is challenging, but the checkpoints make it so you don't have to run the level flawlessly before you can progress. Going back and replaying levels to get all the awards allows you to play the same levels in a different way; take it easy and explore to get all the coins, be precise and cautious to finish with no deaths, and then do a flawless run to beat the time limit. Overall it's really simple but comfortably challenging, and a pleasure to master. Gameplay has a really good flow to it, and I love the art and soundtrack. Awesome job, TreeFortress!			"

												It's been a while since I've played a speedrun-oriented game that isn't also sadistic towards its players. Also outfits are very, very fun to collect and mix! Your timeghost records your outfit too, so most of mine are different~The only disappointment so far is, avoid buying the jet trails unless you're certain that they're a significantly different color to what you already have, because I feel like either something in that system is bugged or there's just several colors that are too similar to each other? (For example, I have two sheer white trails right next to each other in the changing room. It's strange)			"

I also like how you get ranked on each level based on how quickly you reach the checkpoint, so there is incentive to beat the level as quick as possible.
