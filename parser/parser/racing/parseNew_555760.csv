												Quick and Easy: ----> Do NOT buy this.Long and Detailed:V V V V VThis is a prime example of something that shouldn't be on Steam.The game does not work and it is still missing content.A majority of the enemies aren't even colored in and are just black.  The entire character model is black.Most of the levels you can't even complete due to how poor the design is.  You'll be attempting the same level over and over again just to confirm what not to do.  The only levels that I could actually complete was The Tutorial, The Super Market, and the Construction SiteThe tutorial level doesn't work at all.  Also, it doesn't explain that you can crouch-slide, however you can't use this in every level.  The level where you ""fly""...  This one is a clusterf***.  First of all, you barely have enough time to complete it when taking the correct path.  Secondly, your friend flies above you and speeds past you while glitching through everything.  You originally are falling to your death, but you land on the ground and WALK the rest of the way.  Yes.  You're in a paraglider, yet you're WALKING along the path.  This game is a f**king joke.  Not in a good way, either.This needs to be removed from Steam's store.  This game is confirming my theory that there is no quality control on Steam.  They may have removed Digital Homicide's games, but that's because he sent Steam, ""Gaben"" a death threat.  Which is one of the only things that Steam seems to take seriously.  Death threats and money.			"

												This game has a lot of problems and does not provide the entertainment to look past them.The graphics aren't good. Windowed mode makes your mouse even worse. The English grammar is bad. The goals of each level don't really make you feel like you're having an ""adrenaline adventure."" So that's really the deal breaker.1/10 Speed			"

												This game has lot of potential, but first of all the devs have to fix the controls in the game.I like the idea and if they keep improving the game it would do great!I made a playthrough of the game:
