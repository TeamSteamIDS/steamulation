												This is an awesome racing game! Pros:+ Simple and easy to catch on+ Customizable controls+ Great if you have friends to play it with/8 players total (Duh! It's in the title, ""Eight Mini Racers"")+ Has fun powerups and... powerdowns?+ Has a ton of colors for each carCons:- Only has one volume option (Master Volume)- You can only connect by LAN (Local Connection)- Only has 3 cars- No AI racers for singleplayer- Singleplayer gets repetative after a while since you're the only one on the trackOverall I rate it an 8/10It's worth playing, and definitly worth the price! Again, it's localized multiplayer ONLY, so if you're looking for an online multiplayer option, there is none.(Sorry, I'm very bad at writing reviews, lol, please don't criticize me too much ;D)			"

												Reminds me Slick 'n Slide for MS-DOS, but with bigger (and boring) race course.The idea is great! But not executed well :-/Maybe the experience could change with 3 or more players. Or 8.I could imagine this with AI opponents and online multiplayer.Yeah, local MP is an almost abandoned theme nowadays, so that's a good point for this game.Brings back memories.In short:Like- Local multiplayer with up to 8 players (if you have that much...controllers)- Good idea- Simple as DNA (or 123)Dislike:- Boring- Lacks of AI opponents- Not much to do, especially in single mode- Maybe a track builder could help?...It's not a bad game (oh the HORROR, I want my money back ohwait, it was free...) or something.But it's not good either.There is a game called Musclecar Online which only lacks of local MP (online ghosts only), but got everything else.

												I love top down racers and so many of the don't keep things pure enough.  The great thing about Eight Mini Racers is how pure the actual racing is.I played multiple races against a friend and really had some fun races.

			Track 6 : Local co-op		


There are sixteen tracks varying from a simple loop to some quite complex circuits that involve you crashing through tyre walls and weaving left and right.I can imagine this is going to be a great example of for every player you add in the mix the game becomes amazingly more fun.  I can't imagine how great it would be with 6-8 friends!!  Obviously with it being local only, arranging this is going to only some can manage.  But four-players would still be awesome!The price tag refelects the simplicity of the game but if you have some local friends that enjoy simple top-down racers this represents amazing value!			"

												Would be so much better if it had multiplayer or a way of creating and joining temporary servers for local play in school or something.			"

												This is a fun game to play woth friends, but it would be a better game with a map editor, online racing, more cars, and drift racing. I give this game 9.5 of 10			"

												I thought this game would be fun, but it turns out the Singleplayer is just you driving alone, and there aren't any bots to race against whatsoever. The only way you can play this game with other people is through local multiplayer. If this game had online multiplayer, it could be a very fun game.			"

												If you played supersprint or Superskidmarks on Amiga or at the arcade you know what to expect, except much much worse and non graphical fun, also quite much more crappier gameplay. Go in your own memory and remember the good games that was before this hell on earth ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cargame with bad unoptimized car driving where only the mentally specially gifted are the true heroes...no not even them...there can be only loosers.Its better to crush a snail with your teeth than playing this game, they both leave the same taste in your mouth...I know since I actually feelt that I needed to see if that wasnt the better taste...with the snail...crushed.. no it wasnt I understood a bit to late..but then again I think you should consider crushing the snail instead of soiling your steam library with this inferior product of a so called game.Totally overpriced.
