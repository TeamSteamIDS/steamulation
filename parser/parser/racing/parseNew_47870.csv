												To start off, I can't say that this is my favorite NFS game of all time, but it is certainly up there. I have been a NFS fan for a long time, dating back to the good old PS2 days with Most Wanted and Carbon. So far no other NFS game, in my opinion, has been better than those, but Hot Pursuit is still a lot of fun, and here's why.PROS:The graphics are fantastic. The car models are awesome as always, and the scenery is beautiful. Yes, scenery especially matters to me because I want to be able to go for a nice drive, if that's what I'm in the mood for. It looks great at 200+ MPH too! Now don't expect Metro: Last Light graphics, but it really is a nice looking game.There are quite a few cars as well. I can't say for sure how many there are, but it's certainly enough to keep you busy with trying certain races with different cars or just taking them for a spin. Not to mention that for every normal car in the game there is a cop car counterpart, with the addition of a couple! So if driving at 250 MPH on a freeway with sirens on sounds fun to you, please give this a try! But what about how they handle?I personally enjoy how the cars handle in this. It is NOT a simulator in any way. It is arcade style racing with easy drifting so you can boost into those corners like a boss without losing tons of speed or control. To me it seems like all the cars handle in a very similar fashion, but I actually don't mind it. I don't think this type of racing is for everyone however, but it's not hard at all to get used to. Remember that this game is all about going fast to evade cops or bust racers using special abilities, so you can't be completely focused on realistic driving. But that brings me to another thing I love about this.In the game, whether you are a racer or a cop, you have access to EMPs, spike strips, roadblocks, extreme turbo, and more. All these make the game more exciting and tense. If you are a racer, you can drop spike strips on cops OR other racers and use EMPs to pass someone, and if you are a cop, you use all of these to take down racers. I especially enjoyed the cop career more because it is really fun to smash into other cars and send them into a barrel roll or other cool crashes.NEUTRAL:The free roam is one thing I always want in a racing game. Yes, Hot Pursuit does have it, but I feel that it is missing content. Being able to free roam as a racer, you would expect to occasionally run into a police car and get into some sort of epic chase, or vice versa being a cop, but sadly that just isn't the case. There aren't even any collectables! I guess the free roam in Hot Pursuit is pretty much there to test out cars or just go for a nice ride. So yes, it's nice to have, but it lacks content.The menus are sub-par. You can very easily tell that it is more suited for consoles. While I strongly recommend using a controller for this game anyways, the least they could have done was provide a more intuitive menu for us PC gamers.CONS:With the exception of changing the color of the car, there is NO customization. I guess I ""spoiled"" myself with the feature of customizing back when I played on the PS2 because now every NFS game that has come out recently has zero options to customize, and it has been very disappointing. I don't know why they ever took it out.Now that I think about it, the menu tutorial at the very beginning of the game is really dumb and unskippable. It's like they expect you to know absolutely nothing about how a menu works. It is completely useless and takes a couple minutes. Can't you just let us play the game already?  TL;DR:NFS: Hot Pursuit is a really fun game with very nice graphics, great selection of cars, and tense racing. While free roam could have been significantly improved, it is always great to be able to go for a joyride in any of the vehicles you have unlocked, including the cop cars. Taking down racers or the police using EMPs, spike strips, roadblocks and more is very satisfying and really adds to the gameplay. There is no customization, with the exception of painting your car different colors, so this is a big let down, but nonetheless a very fun game. As a racing game enthusiast, I have to give this game a 7/10. Very fun!			"

												One thing I have become increasingly frustrated with when playing racing games these past few years is that developers seem to throw more and more crap between you and actually racing with every new release. Hot Pursuit may well be the pinacle of this. The races themselves are a lot of fun. The cars have a good sense of speed, the sound is great, the crashes have impact and the game is very pretty all around. The problem is that you won't actually get to experience these things much. The majority of your time will be spent watching unskippable cutscenes, loading times, logging in on your EA account (with no way to save your login details so you don't have to enter them every singe time you start the game) or being harassed by the game to check out its totally cool social hub feature where it pretends to be Facebook. And God help you if the EA servers happen to be down, in which case the game will try connecting to them at the start of the game and the end of every single bloody 2 minute race, taking 10 seconds each time. It really adds up to the point where 50% of your time with Hot Pursuit is spent looking at♥♥♥♥♥♥you really don't want to see. Why can developers not understand that when someone buys a racing game, the chances are they actually want to race? No NFS, I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your unnecessary Facebook clone ""feature"", I don't want to try and connect to your instable servers every 2 seconds and I don't regard your variety of spinning wheels in loading screens or unskippable cutscenes with particular affection either. Please make them optional so I can drive some fast cars without jumping through a bajillion hoops for a 3 minute race. Thank you.			"

												The Original Car Chase game, revamped... At least that's what I expected. Back in the '98 version it was a great fun game of racing vs your opponents, and the police - avoiding insanely high speed crashes and shaving that couple of seconds extra off a track, or getting a little nudge in at just the right moment, to win a race.Fast-Forward many generations of game development and hardware cycles, and we have the reboot. Initially it looks promising, graphically it's a lot nicer, the tracks are interesting, and they've kept the tradition of high-risk shortcuts to get to the end faster - but this is one of the things that shows up the games truly hideous faults.1- The enemies are scripted to keep up, not actually racing around the track as they look, but constantly teleporting around the track to be close to you. No matter how good you are, you cannot get more than a few seconds lead, even on a car you just saw crash into a virtually impossible situation, while you are at max boost - he'll be on your tail and overtaking the instant you take a corner less than optimally.2- Speaking of cornering - it cannot be done without a horrible skid mechanic. You just dont get to keep control of the car. At the time the game was made, drifting was very trendy, and the makers seem to have decided to make it mandatory for every car, every race.3- The collision detection is horrible for such a high end racing game. Often you pass another vehicle, or other obsticle, knowing you've cut it close, but also knowing you've missed, when suddenly the game decides you've hit, and not just clipped something, but catastrophically flipped your car and ruined your race.4- Hardware support. After a few months of having this game, my nephew loved playing it for fun, so despite not being able to forgive it's foibles, I kept the game, but after I changed some stuff on my system, it's refused to run ever since. Gets to the loading screen, CTD with no error report.RIP NFS memories.			"

												In my opinion the best of the latest Need for Speed games.It has nice visuals, solid drifting mechanics and also pretty good multiplayer.And also it's nice that it's not capped at 30 fps like the later titles.Of cours like any other game it has it's flaws, there is no campaign at all (other than random racing) and the friend system seems confusing at first (at least for me) and there is not a lot of content other than the cars, all that you can do to them is change their colour.But if you get it for a lower price than i say go for it.It's a pretty good laugh when playing with friends.

												Hot Pursuit is a Need for Speed game in name only. This blisteringly fast racer has more in common with developer Criterion Games' own Burnout series than it does with any previous Need for Speed offering, despite lacking a number of features that are commonly associated with Burnout games. This isn't a game in which you're rewarded for crashing spectacularly or for jumping through billboards, but it is a game that encourages you to drive dangerously and to take down your opponents by any means necessary. The option to play both as illegal racers and as the cops that are chasing them brings some much-needed variety to the action, while spike strips, road blocks, and other satisfying countermeasures ensure that Hot Pursuit doesn't feel quite like any racer that you've played before. Regardless of whether your interest in Hot Pursuit stems from a love of Need for Speed, Burnout, or neither, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Just another NFS game. PROS:- Beautiful cars- Beautiful graphics- Beautiful landscapes- Easy, convenient mechanicsCONS:- Unskipable cutscenes- Scripted AIs- Tight limits for time trial missions- After the first few races, racing becomes too challenging, because, basically, you need a perfect performance to get the rewards, which are required for further progress. Just a single tiny mistake – and you're too late on the finish line.- The multi-player is almost deadThis if definitely NOT the best racing game on the market, but it's fairly enjoyable.Worth purchasing, if it's on sale for 5€ or less (otherwise, it's a steal for such an old game).My overall rating 6/10.

												This 2010 comeback of the Hot Pursuit series, developed by Criterion, is a great example of how not to reboot a game. Thankfully this game turned out to be very fun.In short, Criterion turned Need For Speed into a full-on car combat game. For those of you who were wanting a faithful follow up to Blackbox's 2003 Playstation 2 classic Hot Pursuit 2 will be greatly disappointed. If you come from Burnout 3 Takedown or Revenge roots, then this will be a tough call as well since iconic fictitious car brands and super accessible arcade driving physics are out. For those who love car combat or even kart and anti-gravity racers sub-genres may want to look into this game.Despite the fact that Hot Pursuit 2010 is rooted in reality, the core gameplay is about cops versus racers equipped with weapon loadouts duking it out on mostly point-to-point courses. There are a lot of mind games to be had, from intentionally driving backwards to strategically cancelling enemy EMP blasts.The driving physics are heavy and boat-like compared to past Criterion titles, but you can still swing your car left and right easily enough to stay in the realm of arcade driving. Once you engage in a drift, your car does feel significantly lighter so you can nudge your car mid-drift to slip through cracks in traffic obstacles. Swerving to dodge sliding spike strips isn't a trivial task however.As with any Hot Pursuit entry, you should expect to find plenty of exotic sports cars and super cars. What is interesting is that Criterion managed to fit in some very modest cars like the Evo, WRX STi and RX-8 without feeling out of place in a roster filled with Lamborghini and Porsche. You will be drifting on dirt and wet roads in the Evo and weaving past city cars in a police issued WRX STi. Speaking of police liveries, they look particularly amazing on the entire roster of the Law side. They don't all come in black and white either, expect some true to life palettes like peacekeeper blue, ranger green and even a patriotic flag on the GT40.2010 saw the release of Hot Pursuit by Criterion as well as Blur by Bizarre and Split/Second by Black Rock. While I do approve of this one-off reboot, some people may disagree because this does effectively kill off any hopes of a new Burnout game. Whether you love or hate this game, what is universally agreeable is that 2010 was a great year for racing game fans who crave for the return of action packed alternative racing.			"

												There is no NFS game that came after this that is better. This game looks incredible yet runs well on many PCs. In fact, it looks better than many games released since 2010, even games released in 2015 and '16. Here is a list of Pros and Cons, as I do in most of my reviews.Pros-Amazing graphics 6 years later, compared to other non-NFS games-Tons of cars to choose from (ranging from Mazda RX-8 and Subaru Impreza WRX STi to Bugatti Veyron)-You can play as a cop and a racer, which other NFS titles were lacking-Large open world (probably around 20x20 miles)-Lots of ambient sounds and awesome engine sounds-Special equipment for Racers and Cops (i.e. spike strips that can be deployed behind your car at high speeds, EMP to damage cars without ramming, etc)-Free Roam, which is great as you can just cruise in your favorite cars around a beautiful mapCons-The cars don't quite handle as well as they should, so you have to drift sometimes by briefly touching the brake then go around the corner in a quite-easy-to-control drift-You are forced to stay on the road and can't go offroad like in The Crew-Damage modeling is mediocre, a totaled car =  ONLY a cracked windshield, bumper hanging by one end, and some dents and scratches-You can't get chased by cops in Free Roam-After a certain point you can't get any more ""levels"" or ""points"", unlike in the 2005 version of NFSMW where you could get wanted by the police to the point where they chased you in Corvettes the second they spotted you, regardless of what you were doing.

												An Iconic Remake of the first and second NFS Hot Pursuit series. Originally released as NFS 3 Hot Pursuit in 1998, and Hot Pursuit 2 in 2002, The original versions of this game are mile stones of what started immersive, arcade style racing.  I have played every single NFS ever released and this one is my all time favorite...The physics...The wrecks...Drifting around turns...Mashing the nitros as soon as you see a straightaway...Wrecking your rival or the police is pretty epic...It's everything I dreamed a racing game would be growing up! P.S Stream your favorite music while you play!			"

												Racing games are one of kind games that are close at my heart. Adrenaline, feeling the high speed and defeating other racers is what i like in racing games. Need For Speed is not expection. Original Most Wanted from Playstation 2 is the best Need For Speed for me but Hot Pursuit is that good too... almost.Currently writing this review i have done 50% of this game and its pure fun.  Escaping cops and chasing illegal racers is always fun and challenging. Driving system is perfect for Arcade racing, Drifting is fun, graphics and sighseeing in this game is breathtaking. Enough of cars to drive as racer or cop. Map cointains variable playgrounds such as coasts, mountains, deserts forests, highways and clever and fast shortcuts. Free drive in this game is very one sided. You just spawn somewhere to map and you just drive and nothing else. I hoped there would been cops, side missions, hidden secrets and other racers.I Havent touch multiplayer yet but it looks nice what i have seen on internet. Autolog or also known as this game multiplayer system is made nicely and clean. If you have friends on autolog you can challenge them in single player missions to make better time, score etc. And you can see Friend's wall which shows their activity in this game. But otherwise if you are only looking for single player in this game, autolog is almost useless then.Summary:What i liked+Perfect ""arcade"" driving system+Being cop in this game is surprisingly fun+Map is breathtaking and fun to drive+Cars are sick!+And drifting! :DWhat i didnt like that much- Little car tuning in this game would been nice-Autolog useless if you are looking only for singleplayer-AI sometimes unfair-Free driving is big shame, nothing to do in thereFun, chaos and extremely fun to play! Basic elements of awesome racing game. 9/10 :)Sorry for my bad english, still learning!there may be spelling mistakes			"

												This game takes the worst features of video game UI design and mashes them together into an single product that makes me want to throw my controller at a baby. I launched this game and it took me literally 15 minutes to start playing. Here are some things you can look forward to if you buy this game:*Unskippable cutscenes all over the place, tons of them all the time*3rd party account registration *Automatic and uninvited use of your webcam *The game scraping your name from steam without askingI had a really great time being lectured by an annoying voice actor about how to play a video game for 10 minutes before I was allowed to play. I've never played a video game or used a computer before in my life so this was really helpful. It patiently explained that the career mode takes you through several races during which you gain points that can be used to buy cars. Did you know that the settings menu is where you can change the settings? THANKS FOR EXAPLINING THIS TO ME BECAUSE I AM A SUB HUMAN RETARD AND THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING ME SKIP THIS BY PRESSING ESCAPE BECAUSE I CANNOT CONTROL MY RETARD HANDS AND THEY SMASH VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE KEYBOARD THE ENTIRE TIME I USE A COMPUTER I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UPSET IF I HAD ACCIDENTIALLY SKIPPED THESE TUTORIALS JUST BECAUSE OF MY FLAILINGAnother feature I loved about this game was the unskippable ""loading"" screens where you are forced to watch cutscenes that show the track you're about to play on. I didn't setup a RAID 0 of SSDs and enough RAM to fit the entire game into volitile memory because I love to watch fake loading screens.  I played through Dark Souls 2 and saw maybe 1 minute of combined loading screens in 80 hours. I can load a map in CS:GO in about 2 seconds but  for some reason this game has 20 second long loading screens anyway. I am convinced there is a timer counting down the time until you're allowed to play the game; its sadistic. Anyway this game blows and don't buy it. If someone involved in the making of this game's UI is reading this then I hope you are forced to play the game because thats just about the worst punishment I can think of off the top of my head.

												Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a really good racing game with great graphics and gameplay. The only flaw is that there is no opportunity to tune your car like in Need for Speed Underground 2.When the online modes work, they really sing, allowing for hours to slip away into tons of entertaining crashes and near-misses. Unfortunately, they can also be extremely broken.Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is pure over-the-top driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, and the new Autolog feature breathes new life into the time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends.Criterion Games hits the old and trusty NfS-Series with a welcome and refreshing blast from the past. It offers fast and furious oldschool-action, plenty of mileage and an overall good ride. A lack of modes, some rather bland race types, the always present rubberband-A.I. and a lack of challenge bothered me. But overall I liked what Hot Pursuit had to offer. A lot!			"

												Well, how to start... I can say that this game is good :) Enjoyed it in every way. On wheel, keyboard. I like Need for Speed series from Undergroung 2 to new Most Wanted.  This new Hot pursuit. Well, it has some flies to catch... Cons:At first when you are playing as SCPD:Sirens - why are they even there? They are not working... Your sirens are turned on and nobody cares, nobody moves (yeah, just like in real life)Enemies - OP as hell. I had Lamborghini Murcielago, enemy had Dodge Viper. My top speed: 339 his 325. I was chasing him, speed 365, couldn't catch him... WTF, if Dodge Viper would go faster than 350 it will burn down, not even 370! So wat? How is that possible? Nitro system - SCPD is really bad if we are talking about nitro. Full nitro can be used for about 3 seconds. If you are racer, full nitro can be used for about 10 seconds.Pros: Nice big sortiment of carsCar look - it looks really niceSoundtrackFree RoamYou can play as racer or policeBig map, last race is really coolBUGATTI!!!!!MultiplayerI would do: 8,5/10 :) Hope this helped little bit :)			"

												People who grew up playing NFS Underground 1 and 2 will most likely be disappointed, since the focus on customization and 4-cylinder tuners that they know and love aren't featured in this game. People who know that Need For Speed existed before Underground will know that despite the powerups and pop music, this is the closest NFS has been to the original games in a long time.Gameplay-wise, from an outside perspective, Hot Pursuit does what an arcade racer should do best and focuses on high-speed driving above all else. Not only is the game arcade-y from a physics perspective, but it's actually set up kind of like a game you'd see in an actual arcade; you don't buy or upgrade cars at all, nor do you unlock the city part by part. You simply have a list of available cars, you pick what you want, and you start racing. I can see how most people would think that might be a negative thing (I myself probably would have preferred buying and upgrading vehicles) but I think the ""quick race"" approach works surprisingly well here. The driving feels good to me; the cars have a good amount of weight to them but are still easy to handle. Being able to play as a racer or a cop feels good too, and Criterion did a good job of infusing the game with some Burnout-influenced mechanics (such as takedowns and earning nitro) while still making Hot Pursuit feel distinctly like it's own game.The game does have some faults though. There's not a lot of content, there's no way to set up custom races, and the only way to escape police is to take them down; you're not going to outrun them because they're some serious rubberbanding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also, there's other ways in which the AI doesn't play by the same rules; if a computer-controlled racer's health bar hits zero and they total their car, they'll respawn with a brand new one. If you total yours, the race ends. Being able to crash your way out of a race is totally fine (I like it) but it's always frustrating in any game when the AI doesn't follow the same rules you do. It feels cheap. On top of all of this, the PC port is pretty sad. It'll run at 60fps and 1080p, but the graphical options you can choose are very limited. There's not even any options for things as simple as anti-aliasing.All things considered, Hot Pursuit is a decent arcade racer with solid driving and mostly satisfying cop chases. The lack of content and barebones nature of the PC port are it's downfalls. If you want a fresh arcade racer, give this game a try...but only when it goes on sale.			"

												I really like the Need For Speed games and this is one of the best games I've ever played:-Great graphics and I can play lag-free on my laptop.-You can play as a racer or as a cop.-NFS: Hot Pursuit is an open world game: You can select Cop, or Racer Free Ride.-You can use ""weapons"" such as EMP, Roadspikes, etc...-You can invite friends and play with them.I recommend you buying this game. It's just awesome. 10/10			"

												I dislike racing games. I do not find them interesting at all, but I wanted to get at least one racing game for my Steam library, so due to a nice discount I ended up with ""NFS: Hot Pursuit"". But this game isn't really a driving simulator, it reminds me of those ""car chase"" moments in the GTA-like games, which is just fine for me. The game is fun and playing as a cop I get to laugh a lot at how brutal the cops bust the criminals. One time I even made one car fly off a cliff and on the police radio they said ""good job, he's going to jail"", and I'm like ""nope, he - dead"".

												It's a good game overall, but it has some flaws.At first launch, you have to listen a long UNSKiPPABLE description about the menu points. It's like ""In the settings menu you can set up stuff"". Oh you don't say? The game treats you like a ♥♥♥♥ing reeetaaaard. It kinda reminds me of Burnout because you can't skip the stupid talk there either. The game menu is a horror and I can't use my gamepad to navigate in the menu.The graphics are sometimes incredibly beautiful, but sometimes it's crrrrap. The game lacks anti aliasing, so your edges will look like a buzzsaw. But the cars look nice overall and the lanscape is beautiful too, although sometimes they are not. Hard to explain. The graphics are nowhere near to the store page screenshots - in fact, they are just promo renders.This game has the worst soundtrack ever in the history of racing games. The songs are boring and slow, contains mostly hipster indie rock and some very bad electro. There are maybe 3 songs that's ok (2 dnb and one metal song), the rest are totally inappropriate for racing. I'm talking about the playlist not the orchestral songs. So really, I disabled the in-game music and made my own playlist with adrenaline pumping songs. In a racing game I wanna race not to fall asleep.Car customization is non-existent, all you can do is choose from a  handful of colors. There is a car that has only one color. Multiplayer is really good, it's fun racing with friends, but you have to sign in to EA♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so it's a pain. It's a fun game if you can get past the frustrating things like the soundtrack and menu controls. This title is not as fun as NFSHP2 which is the best NFS in my opinion, but its still cool. I recommend it to buy on sale, although it worths the full price too, but still...			"

												Pretty decent arcade racer. I played need for speed hot pursuit 2 on PS2 and its a lot like it. The maps feel reminiscent and it carries over the same pursuit mechanics (such as the EMP, heli, spike strip and roadblock). For a game released in 2010 it still holds up graphics wise.			"

												This game is really close to my heart. I absolutely loved NFS3 Hot Pursuit as a kid, and sank countless hours into it. Had high hopes for this game, and Criterion delivered an incredible experience.It's all about exotic cars, beautiful environments and police sirens. If you think a racing game should be about putting body kits and neon lights on your car, you're gonna be disappointed. This a pure old-school NFS experience, saluting the games from a time before all that all that nonsense became standard in racing games. There's no story, and the only customization is choosing the color of your car.At the time of writing this, the game is almost 7 years old, but still holds up visually. The game has a licensed soundtrack, with some tracks fitting for racing....some that don't. But pretty much everyone should find at least few tracks they like. It also has a composed soundtrack for pursuits, which seem to fit the tone, but they're not as good as the work Rom Di Prisco did on NFS3.The controls are tight, and the cars all handle the same (the only real difference being top speed and off-road capabilities). It's an arcade racer, so that's to be expected. There are two career modes: Racer and cop, each with its own progression and unlocks.If I had to describe the game with one world, it would be Pure. There are no distractions, letting you focus on satisfying your need for speed.  If you liked the classic NFS games, you have to get this one. You owe it to yourself!			"

												Hot Pursuit comes with great graphics,good looking race tracks and bad♥♥♥♥♥cars.The game offers you two perspectives.You are either a racer or a cop.As a racer you need to create chaos.You are rewarded for destroying cars,speeding and destroying the enviroment.As a cop you need to catch the racers using your high tech equipment.It is possible to call out blockades and back-up which is cool since in most of those games you are the one getting ganged up on.It's nice to have help for a change.Both the cop and the racer have similar game scenarios.As a racer you either race and try to get first with cops and other racers on your back or you try to get to a point in a limited amount of time.As a cop you need to catch all the racers or you need to get to a point in a limited amount of time,same thing as with racers.Both have some kind of ''skill tree''.As you move on with the game you unlock new and better equipment for your cars.Spikes,EMPs and speed boosts..just to mention some.You also unlock cars along the way.The game has a fair amount of cars both for racers and cops.I enjoyed the game but I found it really lacking that it didn't have a storyline to follow and it has no open-world at all.It's a game with nice cars and sweet gadgets but nothing more.If you are only interested in racing,this is a great game to pick up.

IntoxicatingNeed For Speed: Hot Pursuit is pure over-the-top driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, and the new Autolog feature breathes new life into the time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends. The single-player races can become somewhat repetitive and there are some presentation issues, but overall, Hot Pursuit is a blast. If you are looking for a high-octane racer that grabs on tight but doesn't take itself too seriously, give this one a shot.			"

												A great NFS Game.In Hot Pursuit, you get to have fun both as a racer and a cop.Play as a racer, race around the map with other races and say ""Puck da police"" while you ram and jam them..Then play as a cop and bust those same racers you were playing a while ago and say ""Slow down ya j3rks, stop jammin my b0ody comms""Free roam is sense less but the game map is filled with many events including :RaceHot PursuitGauntletDuel(stupid) Previews and Rapid ResponseThe map is also nice, variety of locations like deserts, snowy mountains, curvy drift roads, forest butNo city :(Lots of events which keep you entertained. Theres different categories of events.Racers and cops have their own equipments and abilties that can be used in hot pursuit.Online play is smooth and nice, its really fun to play with friends aswell as singleplayer.The graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, car handling is nice..... What else do you need ?Also variety of awesome cars. There is no customisation but that is fine. The game also has a rear view mirror.Cons:Veyron is too fast, uncontrollable. 0_oNo civilians to run over......(Is this inappropriate ?) "

												The game is amusing and the graphics are beautiful. To my mind, it is really worth the price. There are many ways to have fun and many beautiful screenshots to take (car crash etc...). You play the police chasing after the racers, or the racers trying to escape or trying to finish first and earn a gold medal. As the police or the racer, your main goal is to hit the other cars in order to make them crash. You have the possibility to drive a very big amount of cars, all power and all design, you can choose the car and the colour etc... . Also there are several types of maps, roads and weather. In short, the game is rather complete and you should try it if you like cars, races, crashes. Nowadays you can find better than Need for Speed Hot pursuit when you're looking for that kind of game but you have to try this one, it is so much fun! 75 / 100			"

												I have started playing Need for Speed since an early age beginning with NFS III: Hot Pursuit, therefore I managed to enjoy most of titles. Every NFS game has something characteristic, thus remaining unique. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit released in 2010 renews the Hot Pursuit franchise adding more sense of speed, more cars and spectacular crashes. The environment is gorgeous, you can pause anytime your racing career and just enjoy the mother nature. Even though steam has not added “Full controller support” I do not see any other way to enjoy and discover the full potential of this game than with a controller. With that being said, I have a need for speed right now, if you know what I mean!			"

												TL;DR version:  Good, wholesome arcade racing fun buried under in-game advertisements, unwieldy social systems, clunky menus and unskippable cutscenes.  Not worth buying even on sale (and I mean really on sale, $5 or less), unless you're very patient and don't have any better options available.Long version:  So, Criterion did the actual legwork on this game, which means the arcade racing is easy to pick up and fun to play with, the cars are pleasingly slippery through the corners and the crashes are spectacular.  The pursuit gameplay is basically just the races, only you've got lights on your car and the objective is to smash the other cars to bits rather than reach the line.  Over time various tools are added to amp up both races and pursuits, allowing you to foil tailgaters with spike strips, screw over those ahead of you with EMP blasts, and other fun things.  Said tools get upgraded and you unlock new vehicles as you rack up points for wins and completing time trial challenges.  So far, so Burnout.Really, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the core gameplay on display here, and I'd love to end the review and tell you to rush out and buy it.  It's an arcade racer by Criterion, of course it's good.  Unfortunately, it's been published by EA, which means there's a very large amount of unwieldy and unnecessary cruft not just weighing down the gameplay, but actively trying to prevent you from playing at all.Let's just walk through what happens every time you boot this game.  First, you're presented with an unskippable corporate logo animation.  Then, you're presented with another unskippable corporate logo animation.  Then you get an unskippable static image of several corporate logos and some legal text.  Then there's an unskippable animation introducing the title screen.  Finally you can press a button to proceed to the main menu - except first you have to get past the ""Autolog"" (social gaming feature) login screen.  You're not required to create an account, but they do their very best to convince you otherwise.  Once you find the ""cancel"" button there, you're treated to an unskippable splash image advertising Need For Speed World, an MMO which was cancelled in 2015.  Finally, after several minutes of wasting your time and advertising at you, you are deposited in the main menu.It gets better.  Or worse, I suppose, is more accurate:  The FIRST time you load the game, and the first time you access any feature, you're treated to a long, fully voiced, completely unskippable movie explaining what the feature does in exhaustive detail.   So the first time you load the game, you not only have to sit through several minutes of corporate logos and literal advertisements, you also need to suffer through 5+ minutes of being treated like a child who can't figure out what the shiny buttons on the menus do.Furthermore, every time you unlock a new car, or tool/weapon, or upgrade for a tool/weapon, or ""rank up"" your police or racer profile, you're forced to sit through yet more unskippable cutscenes as they loudly and lengthily tell you that you can now drop two spike strips at once or that you've now got THREE chevrons on your virtual profile.  A simple text box of ""Spike Strips updated: Can now drop double strips"" would do perfectly fine, but instead you get to wait through a full minute of animated guff pretending that there's a manufacturer making these items for you and here's how they work and here's some diagrams of them in action and I'D LIKE TO PLAY THE NEXT RACE NOW, PLEASE.It is, in summation, a game which does not respect your time, published by a company that sees you only as a wallet to advertise their other products to.  It fritters away your free time in dribs and drabs, taking several minutes to get you to the main menu, stealing away 30-90 seconds here and there to introduce new things in unnecessarily lengthy cutscenes, and chomping away 5 minutes or more the first time you access any feature or menu option to explain it in patronizing detail.  I bought this game on sale for something like $4, and I feel ripped off.Criterion made a solid game. They really did.  It's nothing spectacular, but there's also nothing wrong with it.  All the problems lay in the unskippable cutscenes, the unskippable logos, the unskippable advertisements.  It drains away all the fun and engagement and leaves nothing.   I haven't played the game for weeks, and I don't see myself going back.  There are better arcade racers out there that won't waste your time. Buy them instead.			"

												One of the best racing games ever made, in my opinion. When this first came out on PS3 I played it a ton. The PC version is even better (I should add I also put around a dozen or so hours when I had the PC physical disc version which I gave away when I bought it on Steam). The PC version looks great, and runs super smooth. Grab a controller and you'll experience one of the best arcade racers out there. The controls might seem a little difficult at first, but when you get use to the controls and unlock the better handling cars you'll have no problem driving like a maniac. Play as a racer, or a cop... each with a ton of stages to play. The online community is small for this game anymore (it did come out over 4 years ago), so if that's your main interest in the game you might be disappointed. Still a great game even if you just stick the single player stages.			"

												The best Need for Speed since Carbon. Delightful visuals, ridiculously fun multiplayer, gratifying level up system, and accurate driving mechanics. The game lets you take control of whatever side you want, the racers or the cops. Best part is that the chases are exhilarating from both perspectives. You're constantly unlocking things on this game, whether it is a car, a weapon upgrade, a milestone, or whatever, it keeps rewarding you. The prodigious amount of gorgeous and exotic cars are a pleasure to drive, accompanied by the ambrosial soundtrack. This game is not without flaws, however. If I was asked to define Autolog in one word, it would be crap. Connection problems are common with it, and its lack of support is disruptive. A minor thing is that there is no actual story mode, it's just a lot of random racing. It is not exactly an issue, but I think the single player could've been significantly better with one. Either way, this game is immense entertainment all around, if you can grab it and play it with some friends, I'm sure you will not be dissatisfied. Very nice job, Criterion. 8.5/10.0 "

												Usually I don't like racing video games. When I was younger me and my brother used to play the demo of Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2 from a CD-ROM which we got from a cereal box and we had wicked fun. When I saw that there's a reboot of the Hot Pursuit series I was sceptic but the child in me said that I should buy it for old times sake.Man I'm glad I did, it took me only a few minutes to set up a game and start driving I've instantly felt the nostalgic feeling, the same thrill of playing the game. The gameplay is smooth, polished and simple. There's no car customization and no story It's just pure old-fashioned driving fun. The graphics and cars are gorgeous and it runs well even on a laptop. I highly recommend it to anybody who is just looking for an arcade-type simple racing game to have fun and just relax, I think Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is the best choice on the market.The only thing I didn't like about the game is perhaps the lack of advanced graphical settings and the default controls (which can be remapped in no time). It's still a much better console port than for example the terrible terrible Burnout Paradise which I wish I haven't bought.			"

												Still one of the best arcade racing games at the moment in my point of view.You get to play with various cars, from Porsche 911 to Koenigsegg Agera. You can also choose whether you want to play as a racer or a cop. There are plenty of races, divided in many types: Time Trials, Interceptors, Hot Pursuits etc.And my favorite feature is the screenshot option, which gives you many filters and effects to take pretty photos ^*^Pros: +beautiful graphics;         + the ability to play as a racer or a cop and switching at any time;         + immersive soundtracks;         + dynamic weather types and cycle of day in free roaming;         + hot pursuits are intense, both you and the opposing forces using equipment to jam vehicles, call a roadblock, activate turbo and so on..Cons: -free roaming mode lacks initiative; it's good only for testing cars, as exploring gets ridiculously boring in a short while;          -no customization;          -Autolog, their online playing service, is pretty much dead; it's hard to find any match if you don't talk with a friend; I'd rather they switch to AllDrive service from Rivals, by all means better.Personal rating: 87/100 - Great			"

												NFS Hot Pursuit is the worst, most deceptive and most frustrating game of all the NFS series. I have bought all of them, and I`ve been a customer since the very first ""The Need for Speed"". For the first time I regret having bought one of them. After having spent 6 hours playing NFS:HP, I am through with the game: it is VERY FRUSTRATING. some of the opponents aren't fair, are too hard, there is too much ""arcade"" feeling in the game. The rules don't appear to be the same for the car you're driving and your opponent's. Anyhow, whoever developed this, should take some lessons in what a good racing sim shoudl be like.			"

												It was about ten races in when I felt a strange sense of deja vu, as if I had raced these tracks before. And then it hit me; I had - back in 1998. This wasn't just another Need For Speed game branded with the name of one of the more popular iterations of the series; it was a remake! Now, you have to understand; I loved the 1998 ""Hot Pursuit"" (aka Need for Speed III); released 16 years ago, it remains one of my favorite racing titles (it was /the/ favorite until Porsche Unleashed unseated it two years later). Its great levels, solid driving, stylish cars and kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack combined into an overall awesome package. Few of the later games in the Need For Speed franchise even approached the heights achieved by NFS3. But aging graphics and finicky hardware requirements meant it was increasingly difficult to relive the original experience. So when I started recognizing some familiar curves and sets in the 2011 remake, I got understandably excited.Not that the 2011 Hot Pursuit is a 1-to-1 remake; it's more of an homage, utilizing many of the familiar tracks but updated with modern graphics and an open world. Still, it's a glorious return to an era of Lambroghini's and Porsches squealing unsafely around hairpin curves on gorgeous mountain and desert tracks. The car handling is wonderful; not in the least bit realistic, of course (I call it ""pinball racing"" for a reason!) but it feels very solid. The tracks are varied and beautiful, with a nice mix of curves and straight-aways, with numerous shortcuts to add some variety. But sadly, for every step forward the game makes a grievous step back. Worst of all is the AI, which is so tightly rubber-banded to the player as to remove all sense of challenge or achievement. How bad is it? Even when I cheated and disabled the AI entirely, my opponents were never further back than two seconds behind me. I never felt as if my skills were being fairly tested because there was never any distance between myself and the AI. It absolutely ruined the single-player experience. Almost as bad is how pushy EA is with their ""Autolog"" online service, without which a good three-quarters of the game is non-functional. I have no interest in the so-called ""social"" aspects of racing, but I'd have liked to check my race stats without having first create an account for yet another online service. Other missteps include an over-reliance on beat-the-clock races, a completely pointless free-roam mode, unskippable movies and an unbearable soundtrack. All in all, the 2011 Need For Speed Hot Pursuit has the seeds of greatness - varied tracks, good driving, beautiful cars - and it kept me entertained throughout its single-player missions. But it erred in too many other areas for it to be considered as one of the highpoints of the franchise. "

												So far, I think of ""Hot Persuit"" as of culmination in the line of latest NFS games, where driving skills and all what-is-under-the-hood is strictly non-of-your-business. You just getting very fabulous-looking car models which you can operate on speed no-less-than-200kph, without any serious collisions on your way. In other words, this is an auto-xxx-show for 10-years-old.No doubt, it sounds very cool to drive a Pagani Zonda or Bugatti Veyron at high speed, with colourful world behind your windows, and some Great Deeds to make - like to chase and punish some fugitives as a cop, or leave any traces far behind as an ""underground racer"". No doubt. But in Hot Pursuit it feels more like rolling plastic models (1:18 or even 1:43) rather than driving real carbon 500+hp monsters. And again, you can't even open doors or hood on those models, they go ""just as it is"". And I guess I should be thankful that wheels are spinning!What's really bugging me, though, is not that unnatural ""plastic world"" feeling. It is about notorious DRM system, breeded with an multiplayer, and proudly called Autolog. Some reviewers adding it as a plus to a game, but for me, it is pure and simple disaster. A cadaver mockingly presenting itself as Friend. I was hating it even when the multiplayer in the Hot Persuit was alive, but now, when it's dead, and the game still thinks that autolog is the main game feature, and trying to connect to server every freaking minute... It stinks, and I can't stand it. Even the Uplay seems the white sheep after that Autolog-DRM stuff...What I like in the Hot Persuit'10 is the visual part and tracks. They bringing some memories from the good old times... at least for a while.But as of game in general, I really don't think it's good. Mediocre - maybe. Generic - for sure! For example - just listen to the cars voices... they are all nearly the same!Hot Persuit is brighter at first than NFS Undercover... But have even less benefits, other than cars manufacturers names. At least, soundtrack in the Undercover was cool and delivering. As of Hot Persuit ost... it is bleak and insipid, The best song from it, in my opinion, is ""Opposite Of Adults"" by Chiddy Bang. And the whole game's alike. "" Life is a party, I'm never growing up"". Sweet sleeps, 10-years old fans of this product, I'm not from your sandbox, but I wish you well. Just not hate me, if I'm not fit for your gaemes.My mark for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is 5.95/10. This is an empty shell behind colourful facade. And so it goes...			"

												Need for Speed done by Burnout devs has exactly what you would expect - super fast cars smashing and crashing. Playing as police is especially fun to stop illegal races either by smashing them or using gimmicks like helicopters or EMP bombs. I generally dont enjoy Need for Speed series but this one positively surprised me. Yeah it is just an arcade but good one.			"

												If you play this expecting realism you will ruin a wonderful game for yourself.I'm on my 3rd 100% completion play through and I'm still loving it.  The soundtrack, aesthetic, and gameplay create an experience that some how combines a relaxing cruise down the highway with an exciting high speed chase.  Very fun and varied single player campaign with loads of replayability. It's best with a controller but keyboard controlls are suprisingly manageable.10/10 Play this game.			"

												Received as part of the EA humble bundle as I havnt played a NFS game since NFS: Underground I was looking forward to the experience.  What I got was a highly polished, shiny console port with all the fun and excitement of a coma.The Pros:The graphics are lovely even on my very average gaming laptop (Quad i7, Radeon mobility 5830) and the selection of cars is everything you could ever wish to drive in the real world.  The cars feel quite quick with all the motion blur and the roads aren’t too busy so there is less chance of frustration in that department.  Sound is pretty good but after a short while you notice there are only so many different engine sounds in the game...The Cons:As usual with EA games, LOADS of hoops to jump and advertising to watch.  Login's, 'dont turn off your computer while saving' screens and un-skippable marketing material mean waiting a good 3 minutes before actually driving anything!  Throughout the game there are loads of these tedious video's telling you how to drive, how the driving modes work (of which there are loads) and every time you win a new car (which is almost every race) you have to sit through a 30 sec video of it spinning and flashing!  Everything just takes soooo long...  Even the ill conceived open world landscape is empty and pointless.Once you finally start to race the problems really begin.  I know NFS has never been a driving sim like Gran Tourismo but there have to be limits.  No matter what you drive, all the cars handle the same only with different max speeds and even then it doesn’t really matter.  The balancing for the AI is so severe that even if you crash throughout a race, the opposition is always just around the corner.  The same is true if you have a perfect race, a crash just before the finish will result in a 5th place finish as you CANNOT escape the opposition... ever...  The game play becomes monotonous and boring so fast i'd had enough after an hour of play each session.There are countless other niggles but it all adds up to yet another poor racing arcade game.  Stick to the old ones if simple fun is even slightly important to you.			"

												I can clearly remember the sense of freedom and speed while driving Lamborghini Diablo VT down the Alpine track in original Need For Speed. I've skipped the second one and when Playstation (PSX, appearantly) was the best thing to own in the universe, I've lost countless hours playing the third one in the series, entitled Hot Pursuit - basically, as far as I can remember, the first one introducing the ability to play the game as a copper taking down racers. That game was awesome and it's the main reason why I've bought this one.The concept stayed the same - high tech super cars (licensed one and therefore - not too many bumps can be seen, although the game is delivered by Criterion Games) are racing down the road to the finish line. You're in one of those cars or you're in one of crazy hybrid police super cars taking down opponents by smashing into them, dropping spike belts, asking for road blocks and helicopters. Good amounts of cars and various tracks with shortcuts and traffic that can prove to be a determining factor between losing and winning are offered in this high speed arcade racer that stays true to original one (see I'm comparing it to 16+ years old game - yes, that's the one I've played like crazy). Sense of speed and tense situations are all there and you're gonna love every single second of it if you like adrenaline-pumping arcade racing games.The fact that needs to be mentioned is that you need Origin account to access multiplayer mode and yes, there are people playing this game in multiplayer which is unbelievably awesome.I got it for 3,70 € on the discount. If you're thinking about getting a racer or NFS racer to be exact, get this one. I'm not saying it's the best, I'm saying it completely satisfies me as a player and delivers on multiple levels.			"

I really enjoyed Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit from 1999 and I think Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010) did a great job to catch the old flair.The graphics are really good and the car models are highly detailed, nice damage textures included :PThe maps and locations are awesome! There are beautiful landscapes compared with nice weather effects. I also like the seamless change of climes. For example, you're starting your race in a forest and are driving the way up to mountains where you'll get suprised by snow laying on the ground.In the career mode you can choose between racers and cops. It keeps interesting because there are always different racing tracks and gamemodes. After every race you will earn points where you'll unlock cars which are divided in different tiers (sport series, exotic, ...). You can't tune or upgrade your car, you just choose your car and color.You can use different abilites while driving like spike strips, turbo (racers), emp or blockades (cops). These are limited and well balanced - they're keeping the races interesting and exciting.There is a freeride mode, but I think it's useless and boring, since you can't just challenge other AI drivers for a race or try to stop other racers as a cop. A ""skirmish""-mode where you choose your map, gamemode and faction is also missing. A real shame, since the multiplayer is dead and you can't even drive with a friend against AI opponents.Another point which annoys me is the AI behaviour. Sometimes they are acting realistic and clever, making mistakes, trying to push you aside or are using the special abilities to stop you and sometimes they're just cheating. Even if they crash and felt behind, they somehow manage to get close or even pass you.You are using your nitro or turbo (special ability, more superior than nitro) and they just stick to your back like spiderman...They also manage to get around corners too perfectly, they even pass you in curves :DI know they did this because they tried to keep it challenging until the end, but even if it's an (unrealistic) arcade racer, I really prefer a comprehensible artificial intelligence.Conclusion:Besides those two points above, I recommend Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit to you guys.I had a lot of fun with it and I'm not a real big fan of racing games.In my opinion Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is one of the better Need For Speed games after Underground 2 and it really honours it's ancestors Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit (1999) and Hot Pursuit 2 (2002).

												Okay, don't get mad at me for writing a ""Not Recommended"" review for this game, I personally LOVE it. But, unfortunately, it is heavily outdated.Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a really fun time waster, however; the only mode I was really able to get sucked in was the multiplayer mode. The thrill of playing as a cop chacing the racers was amazing. But it has come to a point where now, you are lucky to find even ONE person within the span of about 20 minutes.There is a single-player mode you can play, it is basically the same thing as multiplayer, but you play against a computer. But I feel like it is not nearly as exciting playing against a computer. If you think you can get into the single-player, go right ahead and get Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. But don't get this game if you want to have a good multiplayer experiance, because you'll mostly get no multiplayer experiance.			"

												I really enjoy NFS and this is almost as good as the older games.  (I'd like to see some HD remakes)  This game type is a complete fun fantasy that would be way too dangerous to enjoy in RL.  I recommend this game for $5 or maybe even $10 if you're an arcade type racing fan.Let's get some of the bad things out of the way first:- You need to make an EA account (Not difficult, but a pain)- No split screen multiplayer- Restarts take you back to the previous screen and reload... Twice...- No Ferarri- No replays after the race- Charging the Nitro is weird like burnout gamesNow for the positives:+ The graphics look good+ Great sense of speed (especially when you go faster than 200 MPH)+ Fun and (almost) realistic enhancements & weapons+ You get to be the police and bust speeders			"

												In short do I recommend this game? Yes I do. However I say this yes with a bit of a weight. You're going to have to like the game quite a bit to stomach the loading screens (and auto log into screen)...Anyway,In somewhat of a glorified version of Need For Speed : Hot Pursuit 2 - this Need for Speed : Hot Pursuit is a big update from the previously mentioned game. The graphics have been significantly upgraded and a lot of appealing cars have been added. Career is essentially overlooking the main map and choosing either police or racer events. Some events are a bit weird I found as I was finding myself in a time trial racing in a cop car. It made sense in a way sure you cut off some suspect at the end but it felt a bit gimmicky to me (I've mostly skipped those races and only done them when I had to progress to new events).As a racer your given abilities just like the police have. Jammer of course sort of stuns the HUD of your police car or disables cops abilities. There is a spike strip also available for racers as well as EMP. Racers also have the ability to have turbo which just sends the car flying.Police are able to use spike strips, call for a helicopter that can deploy a spike strip, call for a road block, or use an EMP as well. To be honest the EMP just locks on a removes some of the racers health... don't really like it. I personally liked back from NFS HP 2 you could call for a single car backup that would help slow down or ram the car. Driving is alright. This is as arcade as it can get. It seems they took Shift's 2 drift mechanism or something along those lines and made it the racing mechanic. Literally every turn you take I guess is mean to be a high speed drift. Again, this is where the original NFS HP 2 on PS2 or xbox was really good. Shift 2 for sure though takes the cake when it comes to driving games. Do I recommend this game? Well... not whole heartidly. I do like it but the loading screens, autolog, and the driving doesn't quite agree with me - so much that I'd rather be playing the game I mentioned earlier. The abilities are cool but I just don't feel the user interface is all the greatest either. No two player? Really? Of course you can play online but playing with a friend doesn't happen in this one. The issue also here is when you collide with a car - it doesn't feel like a collision. I don't feel the angle I hit at (P.I.T manouever doesn't really work) or how hard I hit properly registers. There's also the point where you can't simply play a quick race and adjust how many spike strips or road blocks you get. It's simply career with event races. This is why the game sort of has that gimmick feel to it. I feel a lot more could have been done here but perhaps given time constraints weren't enough. I'll recommend it but can't give it the highest of scores.RATING 7.1/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- "

												There are only five reasonably bad things about this game:- You have to change affinity in the task manager on every startup, because this game has trouble recognizing modern multicore CPU's (this only takes 10 seconds or so to do).- There's an ad for the now defunct ""Need for Speed World"" that appears on every startup.- This game has barely any graphics options (resolution, gamma, shadow quality) and no AA (which is however easy to overcome by using nVidia's Dynamic Super Resolution or AMD's equivalent (this game looks great at 4k).- You can't access the DLC for this game in the PC version (not that I care about that, base game is fun enough)-This game has an in-game photo mode (which is great), but the picture that it stores is a heavily compressed 720p image. I recommend pressing the steam overlay's own screeenshot picture key simultaneously with the photo editor screenshot key, so you get high quality custom screenshots without the game's HUD.What does this game offer?A great ARCADE racing game with fun cars, a beautiful map (however empty in free drive), a good soundtrack and lots and lots of fantastic, unrealistic carnage (Burnout style, as many say). This game reminds me quite a lot of Need for Speed Hot Pursuit II (2002), although this one feels more action packed and nimbler. Overall this is a very enjoyable title that runs well on modern computers (once you adjust CPU affinity). Must buy for anyone who is looking for a great arcade racing game.			"

												Need for speed Hot Pursuit: You could really really like this game If you want to:☑ drive beautiful cars☑ go high speed ☑ crash opponants☑ chase drivers☑ escape the police☑ play online with friends☑ use gadgets☑ have a lot of funNow about the gameplay:What makes need for speed unique are pursuits of course, but also tracks:Here, you drive from a point A. to a point B. Which makes the driving more exciting and gives a great freedom sensation. No looping tracks turning around again and again.It's also one of the rare games where you can play as the police and catch the drivers. For this task, you got a few special ""weapons"" like spike strips, emp, roadblocks and helicopter support.As a driver you also have a few gadgets like Nitro boosts, jammers and spike strips as well...Music is fine and matches the action, especially for the chasing moments where you got dynamic songs.Just a little cons for the rear-view mirror... Which shows the cars behind in a non realistic way :( so, better hitting the rear view button to see who's behind.To conclude:One of the best car games on Steam <3A must have :)			"

												Great game! NFS: Hot Pursuit is one of the few good NFS games out there, like NFS: Mosted Wanted(2005), Carbon and Underground. Very well made game. The steering is very good. Gameplay overall is amazing: you get to play as a cop and as a racer. At first I thought I wouldn't wanna be a cop at all, but it turned out to be quite a lot of fun. Busting other people is just too damn fun, especially if it's with friends and you chase each other. As for the racer... well he's a racer. Escape cops, beat others in races etc. - the usual. Overall the game is amazing, nothing bad can be said about except the fact, you can't custimoze your or choose which cars to be yours(which isn't so bad, but the customizing part is sad). I would rate this 9/10(-1 for no customization). Love it!			"

												I remember when Need for Speed games were good. For me it was about the time the first ""Hot Pursuit"" came out, circa 1998 (High Stakes in 99 was also good- I wish we could get the gameplay of those versions with the graphics and physics available today!). I think some of the others were fun too, but as time goes by they just get more and more bloated with silly EA crap and gimmicks. Hot Pursuit (2010) starts off poorly by demanding that the player sign up via email for EA's useless service (probably was to screw people over who bought the game secondhand). If you want to play multiplayer, better be ready to 'register' for no benefit to you other than making EA happy. Then there's an opening cinematic and long intro explaining the various modes and options, all of which is boring and unskippable. This must have been the time when EA thought it would magically turn into facebook by pushing it's social hub on everyone. It didn't work and gets in the way of the game, which seems like an afterthought given all the bloat that has to be passed through before actually playing anything.The driving feels floaty. It seems like you're either going straight or drifting (which is extremely easy to do) and there's very little in between. Nothing to write home about but passable if everything else worked. Collisions feel like they have impact although the damage modeling, if there is any, seems very oversimplified. The hot pursuit mode is where I really began to get annoyed because it was such a great thing to do with friends in the older games. Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit was simple; you were the cops and used PIT manuevers or pinning to stop the other side. Or you played as the speeders the cops would try to do the same to you and use roadblocks as well. The maps were memorable and I still fondly recall some like 'Empire' and 'Lost Canyons'. High Stakes added a helicopter to outrun in addition to the cops which worked well. But by 2010 that wasn't complicated enough so now we have helicopters that drop explosive barrels on racers (yeah... seriously), EMP pulses, and every cop car is now equipped with nitrous because I guess everyone had a stiffy for Fast and Furious a few years ago and some guy in a focus group wanted that box checked. PIT-style manuevers seem not to work as well as they used to and it's easier to just ram other cars at speed as they now have a 'health bar' instead of taking location-based damage like in High Stakes. The whole thing is just over-the-top arcadey now, much more than before and to the detriment of the gameplay.			"

												Now the rumors are true: NFS games are really getting worse year after year.Well, where do I begin?At first, the whole installation is just a big annoying process, you have to make here an account, make there an account, log in here, log in there, copy this key, copy that key, listen to minute long introductions to the menue - like I've never seen a menu and like I'm not able to understand what ""Carreer mode"" and other words mean.Do the makers of this games think we are dumb? I mean, seriously, just load the game, let us chose a track, a car and we are fine. Spare us everything else and don't even bother making introductions, because we'll manage the rest.After the first race eventually started, I was amazed: This game has some very good and enjoyable graphics / visuals, but the rest - absolutely horrible.The gameplay is, like almost every NFS game, an insult. Like always, all enemies are in one place. Meaning when you're hitting the wall, you're automatically last to finish.There is absolutely NO feel of speed. Your speedometer reaches the 250 kilometers and it looks like you just comfortable cruisin' around the block. This was way better in NFS:UNDERGROUND. And on my bike last time when I drove to the bakery to buy some bread. But I ran a flat so I had to walk. But still way more impressive experience than this game.The cars are absolutely HORRIBLE to drive. It's feeling like you're trying to steer a brick-wall through the corners. Yes, I understand that the cars are even worse to drive in reality, but this is supposed to be an arcade game. I would understand it when it's a simulator, but it's not. Never has and never should be.Also, it's ridiculously hard. You have ALWAYS finish first to get some results. But don't worry, your enemies will do their best to ram you in the wall. And no, of course you can't do the same to them. We're speaking here of a NFS game, this just CAN'T be fun. And well, they really thought a race makes more fun after you tried (and failed) it 25 times, eh?I had this game for the PS3 and I only played as racer (I don't like playing a cop) - after finishing all races as a racer the game was... well, ready to kick the bucket. No reward, no nothing.What a waste of money and time and another awful example, how worse the series got. At least I only paid around 5 bucks for it.			"

												I'll try to keep it short: Though I enjoyed most of my time with it, I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe in a sale for a few bucks. Overall it's a good game, though not the best NFS that was ever made but... there are some mechanics here that can't be turned of that make this game infuriating as hell the further you progress. My biggest issue is the camera-jump that more or less randomly happens while playing certain missions. Let me explain that: You have items in this game that you can use to either sabotage your opponents or the police. Things like Spiketraps and so on. You get the idea. This mechanic wouldn't be the worst thing ever if it wasn't for the random camera jumps that happen, when one of your opponents gets hit by for example your Spiketraps. So you are driving a race, you are barely in the lead, not only dodging the police but also the general traffic, you place down a spiketrap to get yourself a breather, the enemy gets hit and your camera instantly jumps to that event, shows it to you, giving the control over your car to the computer. It's offsetting as hell! It breaks the concentration, the flow of the race and rips the controll of you, sometimes throwing you right back, seconds before you hit a random car that you could have easily avoided otherwise. If it wasn't for this and the brutal AI (the further you progress) and the ludacris police-forces that annoy the hell out of you, this would have been a really good game. Sadly it isn't... TL:DR Good game if you have a very very very high frustration tolerance...			"

												Although I'm not usually a fan of racing games, I've gotten years of fun from this one.  The game captures a huge chunk of California scenery from snowy peaks to seaside carnivals, and every area is a slightly different challenge.  Effectively, there's multiple single player game styles:Cop:-race against the clock with a specific car-bust speeders by smashing them with your car or various devices such as spike strips or roadblocksRacer:-A straight, no-frills street race-Racing, but with ""wreck 'em"" devices-Avoid the cops (sometimes with toys)Overall, the game is a thrill, flying along through beautiful scenery, keeping one eye on civilian traffic, one eye on your competition, and your third eye :) on the map to look for shortcuts.  Didn't enjoy physics in school?  Don't worry, because neither did the the NFS designers...you carom off guard rails and torture your $250,000 cars with no loss of speed or acceleration.  Breakdown:Cons:-Lots of menu screens.  This is partly due to the console nature of the game, with limited key options requiring multiple menus. -Lots of intermissions.  I'm guessing that the game needed to showcase each car in its stable as part of some contract, so you have to watch or skip lots of ""car porn"" shots of the camera lovingly sweeping around some fiberglass extravagance while a sultry female voice talks about ""curves"" and ""power.""  (Hmmm...is this a con?)-Spiky difficulty.  Time tests are by far the hardest modes, whereas it's pretty easy to get gold against five AI cars in street races.  Particularly tetchy are the cop time tests, where even the slightest brush with an obstacle costs you two seconds.  Plus, the cars you are forced to drive often wallow like pigs as you try to take a tight curve or thread some needle.Pros:- Great value for your money.  Get it on sale for less than a movie ticket, and it's an excellent deal.-A true thrill.  Every time a ""Fast & Furious"" movie comes out, I get an overwhelming urge to play this game again.  It really captures the over the top fun of the fantasy street race, where you tear around like a demon in unrealistically light traffic, bashing cars, going offroad to shave a few seconds.-A good family game (for kids over about 8-9).  I wouldn't use this to teach my kids to drive, but there's no cursing, the crashes are cartoony and bloodless, and everyone walks away at the end, even if the car looks like used aluminum foil.  My 8 year old didn't care for the races, but loved to pick a car and just free-drive the countryside.-Beautiful graphics.  Seacrest county is a buffet of Southern/Central California terrain, and there's a lot of little details which really make it shine (tractors, observatories, redwood trees, desert vistas).  [***Caveat*** Without a little tweaking the lack of in-game anti-aliasing and anisotropy will gradually drive you insane.  However, you can fix all that by adjusting your graphics card settings out of game.]-Cool multiplayer.  I never played online against random opponents, but my 12 year old son got a huge kick out of spike-stripping his old man, or forcing my Lamborghini to crash into an oncoming pickup truck.  Summary: Why have an expensive mid-life crisis when you can spend a few bucks on this game to drive ridiculously overpriced cars at absurd speeds in a consequence-free environment?  Sure, by day you're a cubicle farmer, or working check-out at Whole Foods, but in the evening, you're a live-dangerously street racer who thumbs his nose at the cops.  You know you want to  :)			"

												It’s a Need For Speed meets Burnout singularity; every cop polices in an exotic sports car, expensive SUVs roadblock endlessly racing dudebros, and all of humankind wears aviator glasses. The race-by-race, cop vs racer structure is a flavourless drag, but the multi-car wars of boosting, drifting and car crash attrition across the American West are absolutely ace. Still probably the best Outrun and Need for Speed game in years.			"

												This game is like a gorgeous airhead.  It's pretty, but it's also pretty shallow.  Actually, it's like a gorgeous airhead who won't shut up about her favorite reality TV show, but we'll get to that (the cutscenes issue) in a minute.The graphics in the game are undoubtedly beautiful.  I don't think anyone could argue against that point.  However, the gameplay itself is ultimately fairly hollow and weak.Admittedly, I haven't gotten that far into the game, but from the outset, there's really not much differentiation among the cars.  Or at least, given the events I used them in, there didn't feel to be a ton of difference.  The cop side felt like the most fun because you got to smash into other racer cars and take them out.  The racer side was just the typical stuff.  As you progress up both ladders (which you can play simultaneously -- which is weird), you also unlock various gadgets for different events.  Spike traps, roadblocks, EMP blasts, helicopters, turbo boosts, blah blah blah.  It's supposed to spice up the gameplay, but it didn't do a ton for me.Why?  Well, the game just feels...hollow.  For example, there's no storyline at all, so you have nothing compelling you forward.  Now, the other NFS game that I have on Steam is Undercover, and I'll be the first to admit that it's not like the story there was one for the ages.  It featured weak acting, overblown dialogue, etc.  But at least it provided you with...something.  Plus, you could customize your cars.  Yes, that's right. There's no customization in this game.  At all.  Well, not beyond selecting one of a limited number of paint colors for your car when you're a racer.In this game, you unlock vehicles, but unlike most other racing games I've played, you have no ability to tune or otherwise customize them.  You're also limited in your choices based on the event you're in.  You don't buy cars, either.  You just unlock them when you level up...and that's it.  You get some voiceover reading you PR copy about the car that sounds like it was written by the manufacturer's ad department.  The cars themselves handled...so-so.  They don't seem to grip the road particularly effectively.  You slide around a LOT.  Now, it's not as bad as, say, flooring it in a Forza game, but then, this game isn't supposed to be anything like a Forza game.  It's an arcade racer, not a sim.  The end result is that the cars felt kind of annoying to drive much of the time.There are two other really annoying features, though.  First is the game's built-in Facebook-like ""Autolog.""  Some idiot suit probably made the game developers include this, because it reeks of corporate brainstorming coming straight from the C-suite.  ""Put in social media.  Kids are into social media these days.  We need it in our games.""  ""What?  But...it's a racing game.  They play the game to race.  If they want to talk to each other about the game on social media, they'll probably just...go to Facebook or Twitter for that.""  ""We need that, too. We need to keep kids IN our game, instead of logging out to tell their friends about the Bugatti they just unlocked.  They can do it in-game now.  It's genius!!  Plus, we can use it for datamining.""So, you get a five minute cinematic that explains to you how you can connect to other players (which, especially five years after the game launched, is now pointless since I expect nobody is playing).  AND, you have to create an EA account, and log into it when you play.  Not. Cool.  To be fair, you don't have to be logged in to play the game, but the game throws this at you the first time you play, so the implication is that you need to.  It'll also search for the autolog connection for around 10 seconds, if it can't find it, each time you finish a race (because it needs to pust updates to your stupid autolog wall or whatever).Probably the most annoying part is all of the unskippable cinematics both before and during a race.  You can skip some of them at the start, but you're still forced to rewatch them if you want to restart the race.  I got this game for around $10 on a sale.  Maybe a little less, actually.  I'd say it's a so-so buy at that price.			"

The AI is decent, and the level design is superb. But if you dont have agood pc you might no be able to run on max graphics, which is alright, but if you can only play on the lowest graohics it look awful. But just ajust the graphics and youll be good.

												Отличная гонка из моей любимой франшизы Need For Speed. По сравнению со всеми остальными NFS, Hot Pursuit действительно другая, в ней нет тюнинга авто, нет покупки авто, нет занудных копов, но это существенный плюсы к игре, в ней можно действительно расслабится, поездить на хороших, дорогих машинах, при этом, даже не усердствуя в получении их, просто поднялся до нужного уровня (всего из 20), включил гонку или свободный заезд и получаешь удовольствие от хорошей графики и красивых мест. Так же в игре добавили карьеру за полицейского SCPD, полицейские машины также доступны для гонок и свободный заездов, это еще один большей плюс. Много красивой музыки, которую можно самому переключать, это тоже плюс. Мультиплеер же полностью зависит от уровня в компании, и доступу к машинам. Ещё она немаловажная вещь, так это перки или спец. возможности, как хотите, так и называйте, такие как полоса с шипами, эми выстрел, вертолет, и т.д. и т.п., очень помогающие при побеге от полиции. В общем, игра получилась на славу, всем советую, 9,5/10.			"

												With the exclusion to Motor City Online, I played every single NFS piece. While I hated so many of them, and praised with much glory High Stakes, Porsche Unleashed, Hot Pursuit 2 and Most Wanted, I say with confidence that this one is the best NFS I've ever played. Period. Nothing to question about.Visuals of the game are glorious, enough you'll love Seacrest County and will be exploring every scenery of it each race. But while the game isn't all graphics, the gameplay is also beautiful, and while you may find drifting pretty much like a hack and slash game which you press a button to backflip kill someone, you'll need to skill yourself in it and get better lines and better exit speeds as you play it. I guess the biggest fault of the game is the lack of a skill level on single-player, which is natural if you think this game is made to be played online with your friends.The car list is certainly beautiful and pretty wide, ranging from entry-level sports cars such as the beautiful Porsche Boxster and the Mazda RX8, from icons of Japanese and North American automotive industry to the legendary Le Mans racer McLaren F1 (not the GTR though, a pity) and the overrated beast Bugatti Veyron SS, and the best: All of them in a similar playing field. While you'll soon discover Reventón is a monster in it's class, picking a similar Lamborghini will get you covered to match the concept bull aswell.Well, realism, if you want it, go to iRacing. You'll be drifting a Ford GT at 150mph while the turbo is on (don't question how does this turbo works or go mechanical into it, just accept it) avoiding a spike strip that the officer ahead of you on a limited-edition Nissan Skyline just dropped on you. This is an arcade - treat it like as it is, please. It's Need for Speed.Want my final advice? Buy it. It's still a 2010 game, but still pretty much fun.			"

												Great game to play alone or to play with others (online). This is a game where you can see what it is like to be chased down by cops or cops chasing racers. This game has great visuals. If you don't like the controls of this game when you first start out you can just simply change the controls in the settings. Downside to this game is how free drive as cop or racer is limited, you can only drive around the game map and explore, you can't get the police to chase you or you can't find racers to chase in free drive, where as in Need for Speed: Most Wanted you could get the cops to chase you. Overall this is still a great game to play if your into racing or into chasing down racers. Would recommend this game to others. If your looking for someone to play with in this game online add me on Steam.			"

												This game is a amazing, an excellent racing game. I love the graphics and the feel of driving 10/10. My only complaint is that there is no story in the game, because there's nothing wrong with a little bit of a story. But if you're looking for a game to have a fun time with, I would suggest this one. : )			"

												I personally always had a fondness for racing games going back to the times of the first need for speed hot pursuit which i  quite liked and i find this this game to live up to it and in some aspects surpass it. The graphics in this game are great with beautiful landscapes ranging from snowy mountaintops to barren deserts and even a coastline. these great graphics include the  many diverse cars available throughout the game and for me the ability to play both the racer and cop sides adds intrigue to the game. Despite it having autolog and an apparent partial focus on multiplayer i rarely ever use such features but maybe thats just me.Some of the things i most enjoyed about ithe game (pros) is the diversity of amazing cars, playing both cop and racer sides, stunning landscaps and the free roam mode plus drifting is awesome.There are some things i didnt like including a lack of customization options for cars which i like to see on nfs games, lack of free roam related missions or objectives and a few slightly boring race modes.All in all this game's diversity of style of play, great graphics and freedom in play make for a classic and fun racing game that can be played for hours.

												(I mostly play on Origin, so few hours on Steam here.)It's Mario Kart with modern (for 2010) cars. No kidding. You're gonna cuss out your friends as they blast you with EMP (red shells), drop spike strips (triple banana!) and ram your pride and joy into oblivion on pristine Californian roads, be it in a stand-up race or a glorious battle to the death between corrupt cop and wealthy crook.It's a very un-EA like game in some respects. By that I mean Hot Pursuit still has an awful online interface, but it's basically a complete game without DLC and fun offline, too. It has a solid campaign which should at least last a week of sporadic play. It's very very pretty and low intensity and will run on virtually any modern rig.Sadly there's no customization and undercover gameplay. It's terribly unrealistic in terms of handling, vehicle dynamics and speed. Despite that, it's a far better competitive racing game than most of the NFS titles that came after it and offers a lot more refined value for your dollar. It's mostly glitch-free, absolutely gorgeous and a ton of fun to pick up at any time. Also it's absolutely infuriating.You know the game spams visual cues every time your friends beat your lap times? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it.			"

												I'm not a huge fan of racing games and NFS series in particular, but sometimes I buy such games for casual playing.Last time I played NFS around 2004, it was pretty arcade, but with lots of carporn (not talking about streetracing crap, just the way cars look), dynamic gameplay and suitable music. I bought this game because I saw it in Steam after seeing a few dozens of positive reviews by series fans who were talking it's the best game in the whole franchise.What did I get? Disgusting music. Copy-pasted vehicles. Broken game mechanics. This game doesn't fit it's title at all: instead of dynamic races with smart opponents we are getting tons of catch-up, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ opponents who is just cheating all the time (if you are first and driving at 340 kmph it doesn't mean that some random half-broken opponent car can't outrun you, driving at 400 kmhp approximately). Game modes are mostly boring, actual pursuits take 10% of play time, other 90% is boring crap like races against the timer (for cops? really?). 1 cop vs 1 racer (and he will keep driving at impossible speeds easily going through curves without braking) and other kinds of boredom. In-game physics are bad beyond any point, don't even try to bust a racer by braking in front of him, he will just throw you away and won't get any damage), all vehicles have the same handling and differ by top speed and acceleration only (what is most hilarious, some of the cars doesn't have these characteristics in the description, having ""classified"" instead), it's almost impossible to actually crash (so you can forget about braking before turns). Also, the game is suffering from a major case of being overfilled with different opponent-side cheats, of course I understand that it is made just to made gameplay more interesting for a player, but sometimes it just looks idiotic: you, riding the top exotic car, cannot catch a guy who is driving some box-shaped american piece of metal, and even constant crashes can't keep him from winning. Another problem is cars. We got used to have dozens of perfect concept cars in every NFS game, but now we are having just a few of them, mixed with dozens of ugly american crap like dodge, chevrolet and other same-looking metal coffins.And last, but not least, is the gameplay itself. You will not get interesting competitions with different opponents, you will get hundreds of same crappy races on the same highways. By the way, game map seems to be huge, but actually it's pretty small and consists of same highways with different backgrounds. Which are, I must say, very scenic and beautiful, but still not capable of making this game any better.And a few words about music: I was never a fan of music styles and genres that NFS usually had as a soundtrack, but at least it was very good in pair with gameplay. In this game it's just a dozen of generic tracks from hipster bands you can hear on every generic radiostation.			"

												Picked this up for 5 euro's which is about as much i would pay for this game.Goal:So, the goal of the game seems to be to reach the highest ranking as either or both the racer and the cop, unlocking new cars in the progress. You will achieve both by doing races, including a variety of new cars which you then can race with. Well.. which you can sometimes race with I must say, because for some reason the game has its own preferences for cars and in some races you are just left with 1 pick (while the game shows you more unlocked cars, which you can't pick for some reason). Then, there is no customization (sigh). A really big letdown for me, since this was what made the game series unique and was the biggest part of the reward system. This was what kept you playing, unlocking a new car, using your money to put some spoilers, wheels, neon lights etc. on it to make it your personal driving monster. Not being able to do this also made it less rewarding to unlock new cars like the camaro, which is one of my favorite cars.So what about the leveling system, or the ranking system if you will.. well.. you unlock new cars and some new abilities (which you can only use for specific races), but thats pretty much it.. I felt no difference being a level 1 or a level 4 other than maybe difficulty.. Its just not rewarding enough anymore, since we all expect more.. If this game wasn't part of the nfs series, it would've been so much better.Graphics:The graphics look average at best. I guess there went more time in actually letting players drive cars then the actual looks, which saddens me if i look back into the series. Most of the nfs games had pretty damn good graphics for their time, especially for a racing game. This wouldn't have bothered me as much if it were only the landscape, it is also the car models. I've seen way better looking car models in the older nfs's and I don't expect a game series like nfs's size to go worse in graphics.Ok.. so far for the bad stuff.. lets recap a sec: there is (in my opinion) no real goal in the game other than winning races and gaining rank. The rewards are race specific abilities and cars, which are less rewarding since you can't even customize them. The graphics are average at best, the cars being the biggest let down for me (graphics wise).The driving:So what is GOOD about the game, why should you buy it if you dissagree with the above? well..  the racing is pretty good, I love the drifting and the way nitro works in this game. It adds alot of tactic/strategy to the racing, which is cool. You can cut alot of turns or you can try and always get nitro back by driving against traffic, closely passing by cars and drifting (against traffic). Drifiting also is really important. You shouldn't always drift, and when drifting you get the choice of the optimal route or the route where you get the most nitro of.Conclusion:So its up to you. my advice: if you look for a nfs game, just stay with carbon, it had really nice driving, police chases were epic (throwing wood of trucs to cut them off etc.), customization was still in the game and the game had somewhat of a story/sense of progression. If you are just looking for a racing game, don't really care about customization or graphics, but just (unrealistic) racing. Then this is your game. And ofcourse.. if you have 5 bucks spare.. you can look yourself and see if you share my opinion ^^!			"

												If you can get past the car manufacturer's corporate marketing and EA's insufferable obsession with forcing players into online communities and punishing lone wolves for not wanting or not being able to be continually connected, this is a fast, fun, gorgeous-looking arcade-style crash-em-up/time trial game. Regardless of whether you're connected to an EA account, you can't skip the annoying 'Autolog' (the fancy name for the game's ever-present online connectivity feature) tutorial at the start, or stop the game from continually trying to connect to Autolog throughout play, even if it has registered a dozen times that it can't connect. And if you dare try to play an offline campaign, the game will force you to sit and read an advertisment for the feature before it will let you play. I'm not even sure if Autolog is supported any more, but it's as if the game itself is an ad for this feature, rather than the feature supporting the game. See that symbol on the game's picture? That's the Autolog symbol. What the hell.In saying this, apart from being an annoyance, a lack of connectivity doesn't affect the gameplay itself. And the game is fun, if unforgiving at times. You can quite easily be eliminated within seconds of starting a race if you're not careful, however, the AI does allow you to catch up if you crash, and most of the cars handle very similarly, which is less realistic, but easier to pick up and play. Although there are many cool and gorgeous cars to race, there aren't many modes to be seen in the campaign - I've played 4 hours of the police campaign and all you can do is a Time Trial, 'Interceptor' (in which you chase down a single car), and Hot Pursuit (in which you chase down a whole bunch of cars). Chasing down crims is never tedious, and watching them roll through the air when you finally take them out is always satisfying. If you can get this cheap, then it's well worth your time. It's just a shame that no matter how far back you go in the last 10 years, EA shows signs of trying to impliment consistently ineffective and insidious online features into their games, with little concern for the integrity of the title. If the game didn't play so well I'd accuse it of being nothing more than an ad for its community features.			"

												I wrote a ""review"" of this game almost 4 years ago, it was pretty barebones, honestly. I think it's finally time to re-analize this game again, after I recently finished the ""campaign"" again, for the fourth time in my life.Let's get this out of the way: This game is gorgeous. The cars in the game are gorgeous. The locations themselves are gorgeous. 7 years after its release, this game is still pretty amazing to the eye. The level of detail on the cars and locations themselves is pretty impressive. This game ditched what NFS had been doing for a few years, giving the player tons of customization and a story mode to finish. Is that inherently a bad thing? Not exactly. You get no story mode, no plot, no named characters, no car customization, and no car dealers. Just you, your car, and the road. (And a bunch of other racers and sometimes, the police too, of course.) Mindless fun. If you grew up with NFS 1, NFS 2 or even NFS 3: Hot Pursuit or Hot Pursuit 2, this won't bother you at all. Hell, it's pretty much trying to go back to its roots. The cars are pretty awesome without the need for custom paintjobs, different body kits or spoilers. You get to see them straight out of the agency, pretty much. Another thing that changed is, this game focuses a lot on roads, and not streets. There are less sharp corners than in previous games, and most of the map itself is littered with long straight roads and stuff like that, going back to the old NFS games that had tracks pretty much like that, too. Now, if you got used to Carbon or Underground, this game might disappoint you, because you can't pimp your VW Golf anymore. Driving is quite arcade-y, too, because you can go through the whole game without ever needing to use your brakes. You can just drift all the way, sometimes unrealistically. In this game, drifting is king. When it comes to Hot Pursuits, you get a few weapons to use against the police. EMP bursts, Turbo, Spike stripes and Jammers. On the police side, you get the same, except you get roadblocks instead of turbo boosts. This game also uses a few mechanics from the Burnout series, like driving recklessly to fill up your boost bar, or slamming other racers out of the way to win, which is rarely a good idea, you can simply outrace them most of the time. I feel like this change is pretty welcome. Free roam in this game isn't as fleshed out as in, say, Carbon. You do get to pick a car and explore the map, but you can't do anything else out there. Besides taking pictures of your car in different locations, of course. You can't drive manually to races anymore, you just gotta use the menu to pick your next race.Difficulty-wise, I find this game pretty easy. I managed to beat the game getting gold on every single race on the first try, except 2 or 3 that took me more than one try. The AI rubberbands A LOT, which is to be expected from a game like this. If you're falling behind, they slow down to allow you to catch them. If you're driving perfectly and at top speed, they will be poking your♥♥♥♥♥often. Often, but not always. Once you get used to drifting and a few other basic tricks in the game, it's pretty much a piece of cake.Complaints? I've got a few. First of all, you can't skip cutscenes, no matter how many times you've watched them before. It's ♥♥♥♥ing annoying going over the same cutscene explaining you the new weapon you've got even if you already know how to use it, and if you've watched that video dozens of times already. With all the adrenaline inducing races, I feel like this ruins the pace a bit.Second, this seems like a bit of a nitpick, but I'm gonna say it anyways: I really like the soundtrack of this game, it's got a few songs that I hate, but most of the other ones are okay in my book. The problem is, when you're playing as the police and you're chasing somebody, or you're being chased yourself, the soundtrack abruptly stops. Instead of that awesome song you love that would make the chase way more epic, you get cliche Hollywood stock music, pretty much. I find the chase music rather lame, and there's no way you can change it. Lame.And third, all of the DLC cars in the PC version are missing, as far as I know. There's a bunch of awesome cars (Like the Lamborghini Countach and the Lamborghini Diablo) that you  can't use in this game at all, because they just aren't in the game. Screw you EA, you could've drained some extra cash from my pockets, but your store doesn't even work. All in all, I feel like the price of the game is somewhat acceptable. The game's kinda short, you can probably finish the campaign in less than 10 hours, and you can reach max level with both racer and police in about 20 hours or less. Still, if you see it on sale, I'd recommend picking it up. It's mindless fun in lieu of the old Need For Speed games.  "

												I played Need for Speed: Most Wanted, which was one of my favorite racing games. I bought NFS: Hot Pursuit because I wanted more of the same, with a visual upgrade. I got pretty much what I wanted, with a little less and a little more. Being able to play a cop or a racer is most definitely the strong point of the game, and just for this I can highly recommend it. It's fun and challenging.What the game lacks the most however compared to its predecessor are the customization options. The most you can do is choose a different paint color when playing as a racer, so no decals, choice of tires or the like. While this does in no way keep you from enjoying the game, you often wish you had more control over how you car looks, or to finetune your ride of choice.Regarding the available cars, there are plenty. I was a little worried that they might all drive the same, and while many are quite similar there are notable differences that make the choice of car depending on the track and/or adversaries a strategic one. Beyond that, you get to drive some super cars like the Bugatti Veyron, where you can really feel the difference in speed and handling with a run of the mill (so to speak) car model.Nitrous is as effective as ever, and later on the turbo makes for some really wild speeding. But that's where you might get frustrated: even at top speed with turbo, cop cars and your adversaries follow you as if they were glued to you, which spoils the effect quite a bit. I expected them to quickly recede in my rear mirror, but they are unshakeable.All in all, I can recommend the game. It does what it set out to do: entertain you and give you some thrills.			"

												I've made a habit in recent years of staying away from racing games as a general rule of thumb. Since the old days of Gran Turismo and Burnout I'd become a bit sick of them to be honest. NFSHP however is truly a truly absorbing experience. Play through career and online modes unlocking a massive variety of vehicles and extras. NFSHP does actually remind me a bit of Burnout (funny that), another Criterion game and is all the better for it. Lots of fun, looks great, plays smooth and gives you a truly amazing sense of speed. Highly recommended, especially if you can pick it up for under a fiver ;o)			"

I can highly and whole-heartedly recommend this if you like racing games in the style of the Burnout series.			"

												I used to play this game when I was nine, I wouldn't stop trying a race until I got a gold medal. Now, after a few years I play this again and realize how ridiculously hard this game is towards the end of the campaign, the hardest type of events being the Rapid Response ones for the police. This game is immense fun though, even if nobody plays multiplayer. Overall probably the best Black Friday purchase for racing fans.			"

												If you can get past the car manufacturer's corporate marketing and EA's insufferable obsession with forcing players into online communities and punishing lone wolves for not wanting or not being able to be continually connected, this is a fast, fun, gorgeous-looking arcade-style crash-em-up/time trial game. Regardless of whether you're connected to an EA account, you can't skip the annoying 'Autolog' (the fancy name for the game's ever-present online connectivity feature) tutorial at the start, or stop the game from continually trying to connect to Autolog throughout play, even if it has registered a dozen times that it can't connect. And if you dare try to play an offline campaign, the game will force you to sit and read an advertisment for the feature before it will let you play. I'm not even sure if Autolog is supported any more, but it's as if the game itself is an ad for this feature, rather than the feature supporting the game. See that symbol on the game's picture? That's the Autolog symbol. What the hell.In saying this, apart from being an annoyance, a lack of connectivity doesn't affect the gameplay itself. And the game is fun, if unforgiving at times. You can quite easily be eliminated within seconds of starting a race if you're not careful, however, the AI does allow you to catch up if you crash, and most of the cars handle very similarly, which is less realistic, but easier to pick up and play. Although there are many cool and gorgeous cars to race, there aren't many modes to be seen in the campaign - I've played 4 hours of the police campaign and all you can do is a Time Trial, 'Interceptor' (in which you chase down a single car), and Hot Pursuit (in which you chase down a whole bunch of cars). Chasing down crims is never tedious, and watching them roll through the air when you finally take them out is always satisfying. If you can get this cheap, then it's well worth your time. It's just a shame that no matter how far back you go in the last 10 years, EA shows signs of trying to impliment consistently ineffective and insidious online features into their games, with little concern for the integrity of the title. If the game didn't play so well I'd accuse it of being nothing more than an ad for its community features.			"

												It's an enjoyable game with relatively good graphics and improved mechanics. However, EA makes you watch EVERY SINGLE intro video, the amount of cars are limited and the only customization you can do is change it's color. The multiplayer is broken, or at least it takes so long to find a match that you give up.			"

												A great NFS game , that is mainly made for multiplayer. The single player campaign is also quite fun and entertaining,but if you play it 'hardcore' it won't take much to get to the max level.  The AI is ok, even though if you won't make mistakes you'll mostly get the 1st place pretty much everytime. The graphics are awesome , so if you can play this maxed out ( which I can't :c ) it'll make the expecience even better.However, the multiplayer takes the game to a whole 'nother level. Set records, notifications on your friend's wall in-game, and the competitive feeling of beating your friends in a racing game makes this game a great pick. I'd 100% recommend it to get on sale, even if you can't play it multiplayer. If you can play the game maxed out and intend to play it multiplayer then it's totally worth the full price as well!			"

												A perfect makeover of the original except for the whole EA Autolog online BS.  Graphics are good, car control is predictable and the maps are gorgeous.  The only thing that brings this game down is the autolog.It's not Forza or even Grid for that matter.  It's more of an arcade driving experience with a hint of simulation thrown in just to make it exciting.  This was the game that made Atari's Test Drive Unlimited look so awful. Playing online or with friends is made somewhat cumbersome with the Autolog interface but it's far easier than Grid 2's Racenet so there's some redemption there.Don't buy this game to stat boost your rank on some leaderboard.  Rather buy it because you remember Need for speed 3 ( the original version of this game) and wanted an updated and more visually experience with a wider array of tracks.			"

												It is an amazing game, even for its age today! The graphics may not be the best compared to the newest in the NFS franchise, but they are still more than you'll ever need! Also, looking at the recent games, Hot Pursuit is probably one of the last truly great and revolutionary Need For Speed games of its time. I'm not saying Need For Speed: Rivals or Need For Speed (2015) are bad, just that in terms of change and progress, I think that this is the game that moved Need For Speed back into the charts after the successful Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2005). All in all, I totally recommend people to buy this game, even till this day.			"

The gameplay however takes a little getting used to, all the cars feel like they are the same just each is faster or stronger, the over all handling when driving though is almost identical and it's a little clunky. You can tell they tried to combine Burnout and NFS in this game, but it offers some unique gameplay you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else, and when it's on sale, $5-8 is a deal for sure.

So much detail put into the cars and the scenery, and it really pays off. Next, the cars. The cars should be one of the main reason you buys this game, as they are very detailed. As you race, you unlock more and more events, stretching from sports cars, to hyper cars. Obviously as you get farther into the game, it gets harder. And I must say, it was really tough at times.

Getting it on New Years Eve and then playing it ALL NIGHT LONG trying to rank up (and raging a lot because of the difficulty of every single damned race) I can safely say that this game isn't as much as a grindfest as some other games I've played. It's DEFINETLY not Pay2Win, but the points (can't remember what they're called, haven't played it for a while) are pretty hard to earn later in the game. The pursuits, to me, are fairly easy, but the races really just♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Playing this game for 10+ hours (4/10 of them spent raging) really sparked my love AND hatred for the game. I may play it again soon.Not worth 20$, but maybe 15$ would be a good price.How I bought this, you might wonder?:I spent about 8 hours scavenging for loose change around the apartment I live in...Overall, this is a great game.8.4/10.0			"

This is absolute fun, knowing every car on the track is a real live driver. You can choose to observe these races too. You can switch drivers and the view which can prove interesting. The server gets control of which class of cars you can choose ensuring the race is as far as possible. This will offer tons of replay value. While usually lag free it does have its down falls. Even when lag is evident it doesn't affect severely your driving, just displaces the other cars on the track. However, there are some noticeable bugs in the multiplayer mode, for example While trying to catch up to cars ahead of me, I noticed sparks were always flying from the cars. Also when they caught air it seemed like they were launching to the moon then back on the track.			"

												one of the best racer that I've played and I think one of the best games! compared to other games, Hot Pursuit is hard. multiplayer is not bad! on the contrary, very fun. graphically, the game looks good, and the soundtrack is very good.Hot Pursuit, honors the first two games of the series(hp series) games that marked my childhood!I recommend this game, not just lovers of the genre!

												Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit was one on my favorite games back in the old Need For Speed days. When they announced the revive of the Hot Pursuit series back in 2010, I was pretty excited. Driving in a high speed chase from the cops was a fun experince to have. Having to be the cop was a great experince to have if you want to be with the law and wrecking racers. There's a big list of cars ranging from everyday cars to one the most exotic and expensive cars in the world. They all have their unique characteristics of thier driving in Seacrest County. From the bulky Dodge Charger SRT8 to the lightweight Koeningsegg CCXR Edition. The county of Seacrest is a beautiful resemblance of four different enviroments mashed together with one of the most exhilerating roads I've seen in a modern Need For Speed game. The sounds in this game is mindbolowing. Where my head just couldn't handle it and I had to stop and catch myself before I pass out. Ok I'm kidding on that but really the vehicle sounds is really amazing.GraphicsFor a 2010 game, I have to say that this game itself is a pleasuring beauty. All enviroments ranging from the mountains to the desert have a beautiful scenery that keeps the driver in awe while driving in a intense race. The details of each vehicle is really amazing with high tessellation that helps the vehicle look more realistic and more immersive to drive. The carbon fiber on the Koenigsegg CCXR for example is just amazing. The lighting effects is just beautiful from day to night. The weather effects has got to be the best I've seen so far in a Need For Speed game. Seeing the relfection on the wet surface is really fantastic. The textures of the road is just amazing with each road having their own unique style to it. Also since this game is made by Criterion games. It's not surprising that the damage model is just jawdroping from every crash that you witness. The only complaint I do have to say is that theirs no Anti-Aliasing to be found in the game.GameplaySince this game is supposed to bring back the original Hot Pursuit feel, there's obviously not going to be any customization. Which some people would complain but since all of this was based before Underground 1 and 2 it would make sense. Color picking has been reduced to manufatured paint only which is a bit disapointing. For the driving part, it's pretty fun driving every vehicle since they do have their own unique handling and drifting. What I thought was pretty interesting that the devopers added weight to the driving which makes it more realistic. For instance the Bentley Continental Coupe is a pretty heavy vehicle. It's pretty difficult to swerve the vehicle from left to right since it's a heavy car. For the Pangani Zonda Cinque, it's nimble so the car can swerve easily around traffic and the cops. This new pursuit weapon that Criterion Games added is a pretty cool feature. Each side (racer/cop) has some unique features that only one side can use (For instance cops can call in road blocks or a helicoptor whereas the racer can use either a jammer or turbo). In my opinion they'll seem to be balanced in a nice mannor. Freedrive is a decent experince since the player can use freedrive to test drive the car without having to deal with cops/racer or crashing out. The main downside is that since there's no option for a online freedrive, the replayability of that mode is small. This new social feature, Autolog, is a really nice feature that let's the player challenge their freinds, share photos and disscus. The downside to this is that people that has little to no friends will think that this feature is useless to them, but it's a not a flaw by any means. DLC wise..... well there's no DLC here becuase we know that EA doesn't like PC players that much besides Battlefield.ConclusionThis game is a great succesor to the past Hot Pursuit games and I feel like this game is great for any casual or competitive players.PO. Trying this little feature out that Steam released and I thought that it would be cool to do this. :)			"

Intro:Before Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, I hadn't played a racing game since.. Underground 2?I was curious what the racing genre was like nowadays. Unfortunately, my selection was this title.Remember Hot Pursuit 2? That game was pretty cool for the time. It had a good selection of cars, some decent campaign challenges, fair visuals, an awesome soundtrack, and a expansive free mode/ multiplayer. With a bunch of rules and modes to choose and customize, it was a bunch of fun. Yeah, this game is nothing like that.Gameplay:So the singleplayer consists of you going through different maps and completing challenges, much like the original. The vehicle selection is extremely slim, but's alright since we can play free mode for that stuff! Right?...Anyway, there's not much to say about the campaign mode other than its pretty bare. Some levels are normal races, there's cop chases, about everything you'd expect.The problem is its all so damn boring.They tried to add some arcadey elements like dropping spike traps behind your car, but it just felt incredibly dull. I can say something positive - the sense of speed feels pretty good. The racing itself is fine really, but its just a boring game.What about the free play? You know, picking out a car from a huge list, setting up a game mode such as knockout or chase, picking a level, choosing the laps and difficulty, all that good stuff. What's that like in this game?IT ISN'T IN THIS GAME.I'm not even ♥♥♥♥ing joking. Okay, there's a multiplayer mode that likely includes all this stuff, but what the hell? We can't even race offline? If I recall, the multiplayer servers have been offline for ages anyway so what do you have left?An incredibly lacking single player campaign.Story, Visuals, & Music:Story = None. I think. If there was one, it was awful.Visuals = Pretty good.Music = The older NFS games have always delivered on the music. Up-beat tracks that really set the racing feel. Yeah, this game greets you with a title screen that is as dark and depressing as the fact this game exists. The music that plays in-game is decent at best, but nothing memorable at all. Oh wait, I think there was a Skrillex track in there!...PC Version:Game runs fine, but multiplayer is dead.Conclusion:The whole game is incredibly bland. There's no redeeming traits here. It's a terrible game that is an insult to the original Hot Pursuit games.Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance but I found myself sick of playing it.This game just isn't very good and there are much better racing games out there.If you want something cheap, arcadey, and a ton of fun checkout Burnout: Paradise. That game is awesome and still has people playing its multiplayer.If you want something a bit more expansive, I really enjoyed The Crew but there's a ton of good options.If you want your racing fix, pick anything other than this.

												review of the campaign only:you pick a race track, then you pick a car, then pick the color, and you race! looks great! there are no customization options in this game, every car is as powerful as it will ever be right off the bat.loads of different cars to choice from though.play as both the racer and the police trying to bust racers. you might think, why would i want to play as the police? well it is surprisingly fun! give it a try. you can do both the police and the racer campaign on the same save.multiple race types on every track that unlock during the campaign.you can turn off the online features and still do the campaign.no race is stupidly easy, and none are impossible. time trails, try and make crash 1 or more racers, regular race with or without cops, special skills like EMPs, and naturally lots of different cars make this game fun with a lot of variety (for a racing game ofc) most annoying feature:cutscenes at the start of every race, prevent you from jumping right into the action. you can not skip these completely. this is especially frustrating during the time trails.spoiler free tip:learn to pick the right kind of brake (hand or regular) as soon as possible, some time trails can not be done unless you have a basic mastery of this mechanic. bottom line: enjoy racing games, but don't like the (mandatory) customization or limitations (eg having to buy a car/parts before being able use them)? then this game is something for you! the 20 euro price might be a bit much, but if you buy it during a sale you will not be disappointed! (bought my copy for 5 euro recently) also did i mention the DRM can be turned off so you are stuck with just steam? big plus right there, for all the people who do not want EA snooping around.max settings work on my laptop: 8GB ram, 3GB nvidia g-ram, 3.3ghz, windows 7other hardware: plays very well with a xbox 360 controller (i use a corded one)			"

You can even take a break and free roam around the map. All the cars sound, look, and handle pretty good. The graphics aren't the best, but they are pretty good. The selection of cars to choose from are brilliant, yet a classic muscle or two wouldn't hurt. Overall, I give it a 9/10.  If you have the chance to get this game, please do.			"

												The last NFS games I had played before this, were Underground, Underground 2, and Most Wanted (2005)- so my standards for this game may have been a little high.  It's sorely lacking numerous aspects which I LOVED about previous installments in this series.[CONS]- No open world.  Just an overview map which you use to select races.  No sense of immersion at all.  In comparison, Most Wanted and Underground 2 had cut scenes, phone calls/texts from other characters and an open city you could explore which made it feel like you were a part of that world.- No car customization/upgrading.  You have no options to improve the style or performance of your vehicle, aside from choosing the paint color.  But you can't really personalize it or make it unique in any way.  You don't even have to buy new cars...they are given to you each time you reach a certain Warrant level.- 95% of the race is useless.  It doesn't matter how well or poorly you drive for most of the race, as long as you just don't screw up the last 1 - 1.5 miles, you'll win.  I crashed like 5x once, while being chased by the cops (never got arrested for some reason) but still managed to catch up to the NPC racers and win.  On the other hand, I've also ran a perfect race while the NPC racers kept crashing behind me (yet I could never make distance from them), only to mess up in the last mile and lose.  So unless you're doing a Time Attack type race- however you drive the first 95% of the race, whether you take shortcuts or use nitrous or slipstream, it doesn't matter.- Race Locks.  Certain cars can only be used for certain races.  I wouldn't mind SOME races to be vehicle specific, such as a Roadsters Only race for example, but all the races in this game are locked for certain cars only, usually by class (Sport, Performance, Super etc).  We should have the option to use the Super Cars we unlock to beat up on Sport Cars if we want!- No instant replay/race replay.  Sometimes when you have a sweet takedown, you want to be able to rewatch with satisfaction wrecking someone else.  Or sometimes, you just want to watch a replay of the race to see where you messed up and what you could have done better.  Sorry, but you can't do that here.[PROS]- Graphics.  Despite the game being a few years old, the graphics still look pretty good.- Controls.  The controls are simple and easy to learn.  Each car handles a bit differently, but it doesn't take long at all for you to get a feel for each one and adjust your braking/turning accordingly.I hate to say it, but overall this game is pretty shallow.  I would rather play Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit for PS1, than this version.  That game had a lot more depth!			"

												This game is really a lot of fun.I've been a fan of the old Hot Pursuit games and this is a really decent addition to the series. If you liked those games you will like this one as well, it pretty much sticks to the original format, there are races where you're a street racer, and others where you play as a cop.Only major difference is that you can charge up your nitrous through various actions on track, much like Need for Speed Underground 2, and this is necessary, since it helps you out a lot.You also have kind of a level-up system, one for the racer part and one for the cop part.Each race you're arwarded medals, which give you bounty (basically experience) which level you up and unlock cars and other stuff.You have your gadgets like spike trips and others (need to unlock them though I think) to stop cars much like the old games.Other than regular races, where you have to escape from cops / bust racers, there are also some times trials, which might seem boring to some people, but I personally enjoy this kind of challenge.I found it a bit hard to get used to the controls though, braking and drifting just right is a bit hard with my wheel.The only real letdown for me - There's no manual transmission. Why? Some people say the game is to hectic, especially during chases with racers/cops, but that is something I absolutely want in any racing game.			"

												TL;DR an OK game, get while on sale, if you're a fan of classic NFS games, expect non-stop facepalm.some background. i am a long time fan of NFS series. i've spent countless childhood hours playing NFS 2, 3 (aka the original HP), 4 and 5 on PS1. i've been a huge fan of NFS 6 (aka HP2), and still play it regularly to this day.however, unlike most people, i never liked the ""Fast and Furious"" movie franchise, and i was never a fan of this ""street racing"" theme that started popping up in racing games shortly after the movie was released, and so i was never a fan of NFS Underground (and onwards). i felt completely betrayed by the series, so much that i not only didn't play any new NFS games since HP2 was released, but didn't even care to look if there were other NFS games released in the meantime (i stopped caring after the original Most Wanted came out).to be fair, i don't blame other people for liking it, and i certainly don't blame EA for trying to cash in on this newfound commercial success of everything ""street racing"", it just wasn't my thing, so i just quietly walked away when it started to look like i ain't getting any more classic racing games from NFS franchise.but yesterday, i found out about this game. i'm 6 years late to the party, but by the time it was released, 8 years have passed since NFS HP2, so i guess another 6 didn't make much difference. so, let's start with the good parts.the graphics are great. like really, really great - the picture is magnificent, both in terms of cars and in terms of the environment. HDR, wet roads, lights, rain all look impressive and realistic. crashes are spectacular, and the damage to the car actually makes at least some sense (the awkwardness of car damage is just about the only thing i dislike about NFS HP2).the concept of the game is where it's at for classic racing games - no ""story"", no ""progression"", no ""customization"", simple ""win this race to unlock more tracks/cars"". this may seem boring to a lot of younger NFS fans who grew up with NFS:U, but this is what actually makes a great classic racing game. and this is what drew me in to this game in the first place, as i have given up hope on NFS ever returning to their roots of joyriding on supercars, with none of that ""illegal racing"" shtick.(to be fair, most pre-NFS:U games had cops, and the fact that they were chasing you meant that technically, the racing was illegal as well. the difference is, you didn't feel like being an actual criminal, being in a gang or a ""racing crew"" and all that; it just felt like racing scenic routes, but with cops on your tail as a nuisance)technically speaking, execution is flawless - i didn't notice any glitches or bugs, game runs smoothly on highest settings, the controls are pretty responsive (more on that later). so nothing to complain on this front either.good parts end here, and what follows is all bad parts.first of all, soundtrack. i'm more of a classic rock fan, but even through NFS HP2 didn't have any of that, it still had a cool adrenaline-infusing, loud and fast rock soundtrack. at least it lent itself well to driving fast while listening to it. none of that here - music in this game makes me want to sleep, not drive. and to top it off, there is absolutely no way of changing the music, so you have to resort to running a music player in the background. this was an extremely stupid move by EA - i understand that everyone's tastes are different, but can we at least have custom music in-game without resorting to workarounds?next thing, physics. it sucks. it feels completely console-y and arcade-y. and in a bad way. NFS never was a driving simulator, but this is way too far. use handbrake, the car just turns 90 degrees, and you're good to go, the car is perfectly stable again, as if it didn't just go forward at 250+ km/h. that's not what happens in real life, you know. it's called inertia, look it up. and because of that, every car essentially drives the same - there's not much difference between a BMW and a Lamborghini, aside from speed. hit gas, hit handbrake once in a while, hit nitro on long straights. done. no personality to cars whatsoever.aside from that, the braindead NFS Underground et al game mechanics are present here as well, albeit to the lesser extent. you still have nitro, so the game is now down to not ""who drives better"", but ""who knows how to use nitro better"". at least in NFS:U you had to *buy* nitro, and could only use it once in the race. nitro as it is in this game makes no sense whatsoever.also, courtesy of NFS:U, you still have ""drifting"" as well. why?! it's a flashy gimmick! drifting kills your tires, not one proper racer in their right mind would intentionally drift that much on tarmac! but here, not only it's a game mechanic (as opposed to simply being a natural consequence of the game's physics, like in NFS 6), it's actually encouraged.you'd think that at least the cops pursuits would be great, right? being all ""back to the roots"" and stuff. but no, cop chases have their fair share of stupidity as well. first of all, the ""takedowns"". i get it, it looks flashy when you barely scratch a rival's (or cop's) car and it suddenly goes spinning into the side of the road for some reason, but why does this only happen in cop chases? what, laws of physics suddenly change when cops are on the road? try doing a takedown in a regular race - no luck, you'd just hit a rival's car and lose speed.not only that, but why do i have weapons? i am getting away from cops, yet *i* can spike them? i mean, i'm all for role reversal if the partner is willing, but this is too far into the Rollcage territory. this is the stupidest idea i've seen so far in an NFS game.there are other various little bits that are annoying and stupid as well: the constant camera shifting, which is very pace-breaking; the inability to do custom single races and time trials; the stupid commentary that can't be skipped over; this newfangled ""online"" ""social"" thingie that nags you every time; the AI magically catching up to you when you're driving at max speed on a long straight...and the most stupid part: you can't actually get arrested by cops. you drive at 300 km/h, you hit a cop roadblock, you spin away, stop on your roof... and then you happily respawn and drive away again, like nothing ever happened! like you didn't just STOP, surrounded by a bunch of cops, which would've got you arrested in a second if it was NFS:HP2! but no, in order to actually be caught, apparently you have to destroy your car. that's beyond stupid. that destroys the whole purpose of the races with cops.finally, the whole ""open world"" thing. an ""open world"" basically means ""one big track"". and while the scenery can be varied, it can't be compared to the joy of driving around different countries, different continents and different cultures. i don't want to drive around a single US state which, for some reason, comprises just a bunch of highways, i want to visit many different places! you've got this beautiful graphics engine, and you're wasting it all away on one single scenery!so, in conclusion, IMHO NFS:HP2 still remains the undisputed king of classic NFS series. it strikes just the right balance of not being too old (and thus having blocky graphics and wonky physics) and having all the classic gameplay elements of a proper racing game - long varied tracks with beautiful scenery, great cars, and cops. this game fails to dethrone it. it may be a step in the right direction... but no cigar, not by a mile.

												I just can't recommend this one. I actually really (guiltily) enjoy the NFS franchise, but this one misses the mark in a few ways: 1. You can't customize your cars. I know this is a strange gripe (and wasn't a feature in previous MW titles), but after playing racing games with fine tuning and visual customization, this is a big miss for me. Instead you simply unlock cars (which feels oddly like a chore and that's coming from someone that spends HOURS on time trials if need be). 2. Seriously, eff those cut-scenes. 3. If you unlock something, you can't hit ""x"" to replay, it takes you all the way back out. Minor gripe, but annoying when you're GT license style working on a track. 4. It doesn't give me the option to pick from any car NEARLY often enough. Being locked to one or two cars is lame. 5. No story, not even an attempt. It makes me sad.			"

												The gameplay itself is good, BUT:No Anti-aliasing. Seriously. What the f**k?! You need to override AA settings in NVIDIA control panel or AMD CCC.Can't skip intro and cut scenes. There even is an unskippable introduction of AUTOLOG lasting about 3 minutes when you launch the game for the first time. Are you kidding me? Yeah that AUTOLOG thing is a nightmare. The game tries to connect to AUTOLOG every time you launch the game or complete a race, and you can't turn it off. Those attempts will drive you crazy if you've got a bad internet connection. This game seems to cause heavy load on multi-core CPUs. I have to manually disable certain cores for the game process to get rid of freezes. Buy this game if you can accept these things.			"

												NFS:HP is a re-make of a rather bland entry into the NFS collection.  It's likely superior to its predecessor, but still has some glaring flaws.This game has the worst rubber-band AI in the industry.  It's entirely on-rails, and holds no car customization beyond paint color.  When you do get to branch out a bit, getting multiple missions at the same time, they are still quite limited in their scope.  Unlocking new cars is nearly always just a method to go back to old races and set better times.I don't recommend this game.  If you want a good NFS game with modern graphics, wait, or play Most Wanted.			"

												i thought this was going to be a blast like the old NFSMW. boy was i wrong. first, you have to get through the whole voice over monologue explaining all the features the game has, like taking screenines and posting them to your EA wall. just what i want. a none-facebook facebook, but only for people i know who play this game. no way you can skip this, or helpfully only get instructions based on what you've selected. no. you have to suffer every grinding minute - yes minutes, get a stop watch and time it, of gormless yada yadaa yada nonesense.now. once you got through that, oh what a minute, you want to race? ok, lets do this you think. ah, but no. you will spend more time listening to the fake woman radio operator telling you about this is a car, this is how a car works, this is what a car looks like... again, unskippable, than you will actually driving - seriously. the police introduction chase is only about 30 seconds worth. hit bad guys car twice, and woo well done, welcome to the next bit of unskippable monolouge. the monoluge wouldn't be a problem if it wasA:- interestingB:- didn't waffleC:- stayed on point with what you are doing at that section of the gameyeah i'm a rookie police officer, i don't expect to be given the keys to a government funded veyron from the outset. no need to belabour that point, or any of the other points. again. and again.i suppose the graphics are pretty enough. if you crank the resolution you start to notice bits that look unfinished, like tunnels that could do with a texture on the inside for a bit of dirt. real life isn't phong shaded.generic music that i couldn't be bothered to turn off in the game so just turned off the speakers.keyboard input is good and responsive. able to juggle the throttle very quick on the a/z keys for precision cornering.joypad input is also very good. with both type controls you actually feel connected to the car on screen.suggestions.1 - how about learn as you go with what you do in the game? ever play some Forza? that's a ton of monologue, but only in bits and pieces relevent to what you are doing.2 - wind back a bit on the whooshy text screens. i don't need to sit there looking at a screen that says ""you have won"" for ten seconds, then ""a mazda rx8"" for another ten seconds, then spin me round the car i've won pretending to take lots of photos for another five to ten seconds.overall impression. tedious. the opening and intro to the game does not inspire me to play on and see if there is actually a gem of a racer here, or if there is an imersive storyline just waiting to hook me in. I loved the sit down and play of the original NFSMW. maybe i was expecting something light, fun and engaging. what i got was overbearing and frustrating.i think ""not recomending"" this game would be too harsh, but i can't recomend it either. the fact that i probably spent more time listening to more un-needed waffle than spent downloading the game drove me to post this review.screw it. i'm going to 'not recommend' this game. life's too short.

												I remember playing Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit (1998) a major part of my childhood. I had no expectations for this game since most of the Need for Speed releases in the past were pretty bad. I was happily surprised by this game! The arcady mechanics suits the gameplay very well. It is balanced, fun and fast! All you need for a Need for Speed game in my oppinion. For people wondering, the game is not dead at all! It is easy to find and join a match with 5+ players in it. Sometimes you even grab the last slot available in a lobby. Sounds and models are also very,very good. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a real blast to play with friends! Best NFS since the original Most Wanted (2005).			"

												I grew up with the very first Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit, I'd say this was a pretty good attempt at rebooting a popular franchise of the Need for Speed series. The reboot of Hot Pursuit is crazy chaotic fun, which is to be expected from a company like Criterion. I'd say this game is perfect if it weren't for some very obvious choices on EA's part. Some things can annoy the heck out of the player, like EA's account creation and the inability to skip some very annoying scenes. The scenes do later go away after the first playthrough making getting into the actual gameplay much faster. Playing through it feels like unwrapping a present I guess.			"

Posted: December 29, 2014
												This is the first Need For Speed game I've played in years. I might've played one of the older ones on the PS2, and I know I played the original The Need For Speed (yes, ""the"" was part of the title at the time) back in 1994 on the 3DO. My point isn't to say, ""look at what an old gamer I am,"" but instead to illustrate that I have relatively no way to compare this title againt contemporary NFS games. GRAPHICS:The visuals are fantastic! The cars shine and reflect light and other objects, the roads kick up dirt and dust, and there's a day/night cycle. There seems to be a distinct lack of anti-aliasing if you look closely, but given that you'll usually be going 300 KPH (that's 186 MPH) or so, you don't really have time to closely examine this. I imagine they decided to skip AA in favor of having higher framerates, which is more important in a high-speed racing game. Regardless, if you really need AA, you can always enable it through the Nvidia or ATI control panels. CAMERA:There is no cockpit mode, so you won't get to simulate actually being in the car or looking around at the inside of the cabin. The closest thing to this is a camera view that seems like you're looking from on top of the car's hood. You can also drive without any object on the screen except the speedometer, in addition to the standard ""behind-the-car"" view.Personally, I kind of miss the cockpit view. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it would've been nice to have.AUDIO:The game has plenty of engine rumbles and tires squealing. Really, the sound effects aren't anything noteworthy, but they're not bad either. The music annoys me, however. This NFS title has an in-game radio that you can't shut off without muting all music. Your only other options are to choose between ""sequential"" and ""shuffle"" modes for the music. Maybe this isn't an issue if you like the music in the game (I think all the songs are from real bands, but I don't know for sure; my musical tastes are still stuck in the 1980s), but if you don't, prepare to mute it all. It would've been nice if we could add our own MP3 tracks, and there might be a way to do that, but I wouldn't know how.HANDLING:This is a big one and probably the most subjective category. I think the cars handle great, but this is by no means a simulation. You're limited to accelerate, brake/reverse (hold the brake button down and the car shifts into reverse), the emergency brake, and oddly enough, the ignition, so you can actually turn your car on and off. You can also turn your headlights on or off, and if they're off when night rolls around, they switch on automatically. You can still turn them off then and drive around in the dark, but it doesn't really have an effect on the gameworld (i.e. drivers don't honk or flash their headlights at you).There's no way to change from an automatic transmission to a manual one in the game, despite most of the cars present probably have the latter or at least an option between the two. This doesn't really bother me as I always found a manual transmission to be distracting, but I know some people want it. DAMAGE:Your cars can and do take damage, although it's practically all cosmetic. You'll get plenty of nicks, scratches, and even dents, but nothing will break nor will any damage affect your car's ability to function. The one and only time damage actually matters is if you hit an object at a fast enough speed with enough force to cause a fatal crash. Then the game shows a little sequence and then you restart back on the road. CARS:What about the cars themselves? They're all real vehicles, fully licensed by the companies that make them. This is probably why damage is so limited. It's neat to see the real car brands, as opposed to thinly-veiled knockoffs, but other than some information when choosing the car itself or knowing you're driving such-and-such vehicle, it does little to enhance the game. MODIFICATION:This is strictly limited to paint color, and even that varies. Some cars don't even let you change the paint. You can't even change spoilers or headlights or tires, and you can forget about fine-tuning the engine. Again, this is more of an arcade game, not a simulation, so perhaps expecting that level of detail is a bit much. I know I didn't, but I've read some complaints about it before.STORY/CUTSCENES:There is no story. You simply play a speeder or a police officer, and have to complete missions and goals. When you do this successfully, you gain points (your ""wanted level"") which can be used to unlock new cars. The cutscenes are extremely annoying in that you can't skip them. This is particularly aggravating the first time you boot up the game, and each time you access a new area in the game itself. There are also a bunch of voiceovers, many of which occur when you select your vehicle. I think the automakers wanted a sales pitch to gamers and used this game as a way to do it.ACCOUNT:Yes, there's a required account. No, you don't need Origin, but it does want your EA/Origin email and password. Without that, you can't sign into the game's account service (called ""Autolog"") and thus can't play the game. It's slightly annoying, but if you already have an EA or Origin account, it's at least quick and easy to do. If you don't, then you'll have to sign up and that might be a hassle. VERDICT:I really like this game. It's not realistic, but it was never inteded to be either. If you want an arcade-like racing game that doesn't even pretend to have a storyline, and you don't mind using Autolog, I'd strongly recommend this game. On the other hand, if you want a hardcore simulation and detest the idea of signing into anything (except maybe Steam), you might want to pass this game up. It won't do anything for you and there are plenty of simulations available elsewhere.			"

												Need for Speed: Hot Persuit is a refreshing game in the Need for Speed franchise, definitely recreating gameplay that was similar to Need for Speeed: Hot Persuit II which was released for the Playstation 2 in the late 2000s. Stunning graphics and the classic Need for Speed arcade-style feel, if you're looking for an updated Need for Speed that resembles how it once played, this is the closest game I've played that meets the criteria. Has an absolute ridiculous amount of content, too, for an added bonus. If you have friends, the game only gets that much better. Plus, it's usually on sale for ~$10, so how could anyone pass it up?

												NFS:HP is a worthy addition to the NFS family, as it features gorgeous graphics, decent (albeit a bit simplified) car handling, and enough arcade elements like EMP gun and spikes to make for some interesting ""vehicle combat"" without going overboard. Its main problem is the balance of careers, as the odds are stacked against the cops, with less game types and less tolerance for damage. Still online games are a blast as you go after speeders or be a speeder with your friends playing either side, and ""AutoLog"" recommends you and your friends to go after certain records in race types, creating ""offline competition"" as well.

												I really like this NFS game. Is it one of the best?.....no. Is it one of the worst?........no.Positives:It has great graphics and the recycled NFS controls which make it very enjoyable.The racing style is a remake of the original Hot Pursuit (obviously).The racing is great and being the cop is what made the original game so popular.Negatives:When compared to games like Most Wanted and Carbon, it does not have any traces of a story line or story behind your character and the surrounding area. It does not have a free roam that includes chases. The only thing this free roam has is traffic, all you do is drive around and learn the roads. It eventually gets boring once done with the arcade style ""Career"" mode.Graphics: 9/10Controls: 10/10""Story"": 6/10 [if it can be called that?]Racing: 8/10Overall: 7/10(While not as good as its more recent counterparts; HP makes up for it with great controls and graphics.)

												This IS a good racing game if you like mostly arcadey controls, but it seems like people think this is vastly different game from the other 'arcadey' NFS games, it isn't.   Other than the Shift series, they all have same open world feel/layout/etcI see a number of reviews stating that this is 'the best NFS game', to which I strongly disagree.The first NFS Shift game was and still is one of the best as far as the driving/racing experience is concerned.  Granted, it doesn't have missions, open world, rivals, cops/racers, etc, but it IS a 'Need For Speed' game, and I think if they could blend the upgrade system and driving experience from Shift with the open world and polished feel of the Most Wanted, it WOULD be the best.Rivals is the same game, essentially, but more polished.  If you have Rivals already, no point in getting this game, just play more Rivals.			"

												Best of new generation Need for Speeds. Has that good old feeling of Hot Pursuit2.Graphics are beautiful. Scenary is astonishing and very detailed. Races and chases are filled with adrenaline and intense action! But be aware... this game shines in it's multiplayer. Singleplayer gives no freedom... For example you cant go on freeroam chase with the cops. There's only one Buggati Veyron race with other opponents and cops in it... And so on. Multiplayer is all that matters here. But there's some problems too... It runs on basic formula of lobbies and public matches gives no freedom for track selection and daytime. No voting, anything... Everything is automatic. That is why it's dead at the moment! Meanwhile private matches gives you freedom to select your track for races or spawn point for duel chases. If you have a friend that is willing to play this game with you - buy it and have some fun busting each others asses on multiplayer high speed chases... If you're loner - move on. It's a waste of money without multiplayer.Oh and by the way... forgot to mention that there's only sprint races! No circuit or knockouts... And that is kinda sad.			"

												Well, I've been playing the Career mode of the game for a couple of hours and thought I'd share my experience with this game.My ExpectationsI've never actually played one of the Need For Speed games prior to this one. I used to play Burnout Legends on XBOX and was looking for a similar game on Steam. That's when I purchased this one, judging by the review it seemed the closest to Burnout Legends.Career ModeRacing game's Career mode is what I'm after, so I was really looking forward to the one in Need For Speed. No surprise here, it's about climbing the ladder and become a Most Wanted (or the cop version of it, haven't played it much, though). During your career you'll drive faster cars, perform more risky stunts, take more (intelligent) shortcuts and try to keep your opponents behind you.Very Hot PursuitThe game is very, very challenging. Very. If you think Burnout's Career mode is challenging, you've seen nothing yet. And I'm not talking about 80% through, I'm talking about 10-20%. This is both good and bad. With enough patience, you can improve your driving (and eventually beat the game). But it might just as well get you frustrated.Proper Game Controller Support, Anyone?I used to think that driving games would be played best with a computer driving wheel controller, but that was actually more difficult than it was fun. Playing Burnout Legends using the XBOX controller was nice, so I was looking forward to a proper Game Controller Support. Unfortunately, Need For Speed fails to deliver. Although the controller is supported out-of-the-box the button mapping and the overall controller sensitivity feels to fragile. Seriously, when I play a car racing game that's about risky driving maneuvers I don't want the controls to be configured as if I had a think piece of glass in my hand that'd brake anytime soon. Admittedly, that's very subjective, but maybe there are others that are looking for the same thing that I was.Cut The Videos, Please!In my career, all medals have to be gold. I don't know why, but I like to beat the score and finish the level, so to say. That's why I prefer cutscenes to be skip-able, restart the whole race quickly, load up a new level, etc. I've recently upgraded my setup and was expecting Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit to load and respond rather quickly. But the opposite is true: It takes f****ng ages to load, restart or quit a race. Seriously: Why does the game need to load (!) the whole map again when I just want to restart the race on the map that is already in memory?Sorry, but this is one of the biggest annoyances with this game for me.Speedwall? Forever Alone!After every race I'm presented with a Speedwall which I suppose is some kind of highscore. Only problem is: I'm the only one on that list. No one to compete with, not even strangers from the server. Only my score. Yes, I get it, the game is not the newest one available, and propably none of my friends even plays it. But then please let me challenges other players from around the globe and compare to some international ranking.tl;dr: Summary+ Very challenging+ Integrates with Big Picture+ Native XBOX 360 USB Controller support+ Nice graphics+ Great, motivating soundtrack+ Fun to play- Very challenging- XBOX 360 USB Controller configuration/sensitivity doesn't match a racing game- Shortcuts can be well-hidden and often require a good knowledge of the map- Autolog is annoying. Signing up for an account? - I'm logged in to Steam already!- Online leaderboard doesn't work or is not available- Incredible long (and unnecessary) loading processes, even for restarting only a race on that very same map. Seriously?			"

												Criterion's soft embrace shines through this game. By all means, this series needed a fresh start, and it's headed in the right direction now...at least this game is. Pretty hard on its own, the AI WILL make your life harder. Hot Pursuit 2 has one of the hardest careers in the series, so old school FTW. The multiplayer is even better if you find decent people to play with (and not wreck their own team mates).Only downside: NO ♥♥♥♥ING SPLITSCREEN!!!And even though i despise racing games with no split screen, this is better than Most Wanted 2012...and any !arcade! racing game released thus far.

												This is the first Need For Speed game I've played in years. I might've played one of the older ones on the PS2, and I know I played the original The Need For Speed (yes, ""the"" was part of the title at the time) back in 1994 on the 3DO. My point isn't to say, ""look at what an old gamer I am,"" but instead to illustrate that I have relatively no way to compare this title againt contemporary NFS games. GRAPHICS:The visuals are fantastic! The cars shine and reflect light and other objects, the roads kick up dirt and dust, and there's a day/night cycle. There seems to be a distinct lack of anti-aliasing if you look closely, but given that you'll usually be going 300 KPH (that's 186 MPH) or so, you don't really have time to closely examine this. I imagine they decided to skip AA in favor of having higher framerates, which is more important in a high-speed racing game. Regardless, if you really need AA, you can always enable it through the Nvidia or ATI control panels. CAMERA:There is no cockpit mode, so you won't get to simulate actually being in the car or looking around at the inside of the cabin. The closest thing to this is a camera view that seems like you're looking from on top of the car's hood. You can also drive without any object on the screen except the speedometer, in addition to the standard ""behind-the-car"" view.Personally, I kind of miss the cockpit view. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it would've been nice to have.AUDIO:The game has plenty of engine rumbles and tires squealing. Really, the sound effects aren't anything noteworthy, but they're not bad either. The music annoys me, however. This NFS title has an in-game radio that you can't shut off without muting all music. Your only other options are to choose between ""sequential"" and ""shuffle"" modes for the music. Maybe this isn't an issue if you like the music in the game (I think all the songs are from real bands, but I don't know for sure; my musical tastes are still stuck in the 1980s), but if you don't, prepare to mute it all. It would've been nice if we could add our own MP3 tracks, and there might be a way to do that, but I wouldn't know how.HANDLING:This is a big one and probably the most subjective category. I think the cars handle great, but this is by no means a simulation. You're limited to accelerate, brake/reverse (hold the brake button down and the car shifts into reverse), the emergency brake, and oddly enough, the ignition, so you can actually turn your car on and off. You can also turn your headlights on or off, and if they're off when night rolls around, they switch on automatically. You can still turn them off then and drive around in the dark, but it doesn't really have an effect on the gameworld (i.e. drivers don't honk or flash their headlights at you).There's no way to change from an automatic transmission to a manual one in the game, despite most of the cars present probably have the latter or at least an option between the two. This doesn't really bother me as I always found a manual transmission to be distracting, but I know some people want it. DAMAGE:Your cars can and do take damage, although it's practically all cosmetic. You'll get plenty of nicks, scratches, and even dents, but nothing will break nor will any damage affect your car's ability to function. The one and only time damage actually matters is if you hit an object at a fast enough speed with enough force to cause a fatal crash. Then the game shows a little sequence and then you restart back on the road. CARS:What about the cars themselves? They're all real vehicles, fully licensed by the companies that make them. This is probably why damage is so limited. It's neat to see the real car brands, as opposed to thinly-veiled knockoffs, but other than some information when choosing the car itself or knowing you're driving such-and-such vehicle, it does little to enhance the game. MODIFICATION:This is strictly limited to paint color, and even that varies. Some cars don't even let you change the paint. You can't even change spoilers or headlights or tires, and you can forget about fine-tuning the engine. Again, this is more of an arcade game, not a simulation, so perhaps expecting that level of detail is a bit much. I know I didn't, but I've read some complaints about it before.STORY/CUTSCENES:There is no story. You simply play a speeder or a police officer, and have to complete missions and goals. When you do this successfully, you gain points (your ""wanted level"") which can be used to unlock new cars. The cutscenes are extremely annoying in that you can't skip them. This is particularly aggravating the first time you boot up the game, and each time you access a new area in the game itself. There are also a bunch of voiceovers, many of which occur when you select your vehicle. I think the automakers wanted a sales pitch to gamers and used this game as a way to do it.ACCOUNT:Yes, there's a required account. No, you don't need Origin, but it does want your EA/Origin email and password. Without that, you can't sign into the game's account service (called ""Autolog"") and thus can't play the game. It's slightly annoying, but if you already have an EA or Origin account, it's at least quick and easy to do. If you don't, then you'll have to sign up and that might be a hassle. VERDICT:I really like this game. It's not realistic, but it was never inteded to be either. If you want an arcade-like racing game that doesn't even pretend to have a storyline, and you don't mind using Autolog, I'd strongly recommend this game. On the other hand, if you want a hardcore simulation and detest the idea of signing into anything (except maybe Steam), you might want to pass this game up. It won't do anything for you and there are plenty of simulations available elsewhere.			"

												I grew up with the very first Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit, I'd say this was a pretty good attempt at rebooting a popular franchise of the Need for Speed series. The reboot of Hot Pursuit is crazy chaotic fun, which is to be expected from a company like Criterion. I'd say this game is perfect if it weren't for some very obvious choices on EA's part. Some things can annoy the heck out of the player, like EA's account creation and the inability to skip some very annoying scenes. The scenes do later go away after the first playthrough making getting into the actual gameplay much faster. Playing through it feels like unwrapping a present I guess.			"

You get a selection of the finest in sports- and supercars circa 2010, some beautiful scenery to drive them through and, as long as you don't think too much on where everyone actually gets all those precious cars from or how all of Seacrest county is full of great driving roads and not much else, that is plenty to make this game huge fun.

												Among the TOP Racing Games on Steam!Initially, I purchased Need for Speed: Hot Persuit for Xbox 360. As I played the game on console, I realized that it had a great story line, but the graphics were a bit drab. So after about 2 days of having the game, I sold it back to GameStop, purchasing a Steam Card, for the Summer Sale. Without thinking any further, I purchased the game on Steam, as I knew I wasn't feeling the full effect without playing it on PC.After playing the game for an hour or so on PC, I realized how high-detailed this game is, for it's time. Sure it's not the best game out there (comparing it to newer titles like Forza 5), but this game is indeed a graphical wonderland. The physics, the textures, the storyline, the price, are all a crucial factor when it comes to reviewing this game.The graphics, like I previously mentioned, are definitely better than I had anticipated (even on console. Can you believe that?). The shadow effects, textures, reslolution, anti-aliasing, everything seemed to be rather well-produced, compared to other games of it's time (ie: Grand Theft Auto 4).Story. I am not one who typically likes the storyline of Need For Speed titles, being they vary from title to title, but this one was one of the better ones. Rather than having to stick to a specific story, you have an option to merely choose your side; cops or crooks. Regardless which side you choose, it's a a ton of fun. The online experience is pretty good as well. I love playing games online, but I was a bit of a skeptic when it came to playing this game online. But after playing a few rounds, I felt that it was pretty addicting, to be honest. Atleast it didn't make me ragequit like COD games.Furthermore, the game was very well produced, weighing in at one of the top racing games, in my steam account. I have played a large amount of games between those on Xbox and on PC, and I would have to say this game is in the top 3. Cons: I think car customization should be offered, as that is a necessity in having the perfect car. Game gets a bit repetitive after some time, of continually doing the same runs. Online community is a bit dried up, compared to other online games. I would like to see some improvements made to this game for the full 100. For now, I would have to say: 85/100			"

												Best of new generation Need for Speeds. Has that good old feeling of Hot Pursuit2.Graphics are beautiful. Scenary is astonishing and very detailed. Races and chases are filled with adrenaline and intense action! But be aware... this game shines in it's multiplayer. Singleplayer gives no freedom... For example you cant go on freeroam chase with the cops. There's only one Buggati Veyron race with other opponents and cops in it... And so on. Multiplayer is all that matters here. But there's some problems too... It runs on basic formula of lobbies and public matches gives no freedom for track selection and daytime. No voting, anything... Everything is automatic. That is why it's dead at the moment! Meanwhile private matches gives you freedom to select your track for races or spawn point for duel chases. If you have a friend that is willing to play this game with you - buy it and have some fun busting each others asses on multiplayer high speed chases... If you're loner - move on. It's a waste of money without multiplayer.Oh and by the way... forgot to mention that there's only sprint races! No circuit or knockouts... And that is kinda sad.			"

Also has many different race types. It also has good career mode! Only thing that annoys me is that all the cars keep drifting everytime you use the brakes.Things i like: Sense of speeeed!, Career mode, Great cars, Epic Scenery and soundtrack.Things i don't like: Multiplayer, Handling and Cop cars go 500 Km/hRating: 4,5/5			"

												Criterion's soft embrace shines through this game. By all means, this series needed a fresh start, and it's headed in the right direction now...at least this game is. Pretty hard on its own, the AI WILL make your life harder. Hot Pursuit 2 has one of the hardest careers in the series, so old school FTW. The multiplayer is even better if you find decent people to play with (and not wreck their own team mates).Only downside: NO ♥♥♥♥ING SPLITSCREEN!!!And even though i despise racing games with no split screen, this is better than Most Wanted 2012...and any !arcade! racing game released thus far.

												Well, I've been playing the Career mode of the game for a couple of hours and thought I'd share my experience with this game.My ExpectationsI've never actually played one of the Need For Speed games prior to this one. I used to play Burnout Legends on XBOX and was looking for a similar game on Steam. That's when I purchased this one, judging by the review it seemed the closest to Burnout Legends.Career ModeRacing game's Career mode is what I'm after, so I was really looking forward to the one in Need For Speed. No surprise here, it's about climbing the ladder and become a Most Wanted (or the cop version of it, haven't played it much, though). During your career you'll drive faster cars, perform more risky stunts, take more (intelligent) shortcuts and try to keep your opponents behind you.Very Hot PursuitThe game is very, very challenging. Very. If you think Burnout's Career mode is challenging, you've seen nothing yet. And I'm not talking about 80% through, I'm talking about 10-20%. This is both good and bad. With enough patience, you can improve your driving (and eventually beat the game). But it might just as well get you frustrated.Proper Game Controller Support, Anyone?I used to think that driving games would be played best with a computer driving wheel controller, but that was actually more difficult than it was fun. Playing Burnout Legends using the XBOX controller was nice, so I was looking forward to a proper Game Controller Support. Unfortunately, Need For Speed fails to deliver. Although the controller is supported out-of-the-box the button mapping and the overall controller sensitivity feels to fragile. Seriously, when I play a car racing game that's about risky driving maneuvers I don't want the controls to be configured as if I had a think piece of glass in my hand that'd brake anytime soon. Admittedly, that's very subjective, but maybe there are others that are looking for the same thing that I was.Cut The Videos, Please!In my career, all medals have to be gold. I don't know why, but I like to beat the score and finish the level, so to say. That's why I prefer cutscenes to be skip-able, restart the whole race quickly, load up a new level, etc. I've recently upgraded my setup and was expecting Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit to load and respond rather quickly.

												Awesome variety from a game with a simple premise:  the fastest wins.  Whether you play as the police or the speeder, the folks at EA packed enough landscape, weather, common motorist and other variables that makes each ride behind the wheel thrilling and different than the last!  There's a reason why the Need for Speed series is as successful as it is!			"

												i have to give this game a positive since i can play multiplayer finally.im an old fan of NFS game since im a child, i've already played Hot Pursuit on xbox360 in 2010 then bought again.game is fun and simple, 6 buttons(left, right, accelerate, brake, handbreak, nitrogen) you can easily master driving in game whatever you are an old gamer or not, 4 buttons for using item(spike strap, EMP, COMJAM, turbo) while in hot pursuit.so this game do require an origin account, i already have one but banned (i did not figure out why i can still login and buy game on origin but didnt prompt me there is a problem with my account) i cannot login game, after i mailed customer service of EA i can finally login. if you cant login, this may help.

												This is the first Need For Speed game I've played in years. I might've played one of the older ones on the PS2, and I know I played the original The Need For Speed (yes, ""the"" was part of the title at the time) back in 1994 on the 3DO. My point isn't to say, ""look at what an old gamer I am,"" but instead to illustrate that I have relatively no way to compare this title againt contemporary NFS games. GRAPHICS:The visuals are fantastic! The cars shine and reflect light and other objects, the roads kick up dirt and dust, and there's a day/night cycle. There seems to be a distinct lack of anti-aliasing if you look closely, but given that you'll usually be going 300 KPH (that's 186 MPH) or so, you don't really have time to closely examine this. I imagine they decided to skip AA in favor of having higher framerates, which is more important in a high-speed racing game. Regardless, if you really need AA, you can always enable it through the Nvidia or ATI control panels. CAMERA:There is no cockpit mode, so you won't get to simulate actually being in the car or looking around at the inside of the cabin. The closest thing to this is a camera view that seems like you're looking from on top of the car's hood. You can also drive without any object on the screen except the speedometer, in addition to the standard ""behind-the-car"" view.Personally, I kind of miss the cockpit view. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it would've been nice to have.AUDIO:The game has plenty of engine rumbles and tires squealing. Really, the sound effects aren't anything noteworthy, but they're not bad either. The music annoys me, however. This NFS title has an in-game radio that you can't shut off without muting all music. Your only other options are to choose between ""sequential"" and ""shuffle"" modes for the music. Maybe this isn't an issue if you like the music in the game (I think all the songs are from real bands, but I don't know for sure; my musical tastes are still stuck in the 1980s), but if you don't, prepare to mute it all. It would've been nice if we could add our own MP3 tracks, and there might be a way to do that, but I wouldn't know how.HANDLING:This is a big one and probably the most subjective category. I think the cars handle great, but this is by no means a simulation. You're limited to accelerate, brake/reverse (hold the brake button down and the car shifts into reverse), the emergency brake, and oddly enough, the ignition, so you can actually turn your car on and off. You can also turn your headlights on or off, and if they're off when night rolls around, they switch on automatically. You can still turn them off then and drive around in the dark, but it doesn't really have an effect on the gameworld (i.e. drivers don't honk or flash their headlights at you).There's no way to change from an automatic transmission to a manual one in the game, despite most of the cars present probably have the latter or at least an option between the two. This doesn't really bother me as I always found a manual transmission to be distracting, but I know some people want it. DAMAGE:Your cars can and do take damage, although it's practically all cosmetic. You'll get plenty of nicks, scratches, and even dents, but nothing will break nor will any damage affect your car's ability to function. The one and only time damage actually matters is if you hit an object at a fast enough speed with enough force to cause a fatal crash. Then the game shows a little sequence and then you restart back on the road. CARS:What about the cars themselves? They're all real vehicles, fully licensed by the companies that make them. This is probably why damage is so limited. It's neat to see the real car brands, as opposed to thinly-veiled knockoffs, but other than some information when choosing the car itself or knowing you're driving such-and-such vehicle, it does little to enhance the game. MODIFICATION:This is strictly limited to paint color, and even that varies. Some cars don't even let you change the paint. You can't even change spoilers or headlights or tires, and you can forget about fine-tuning the engine. Again, this is more of an arcade game, not a simulation, so perhaps expecting that level of detail is a bit much. I know I didn't, but I've read some complaints about it before.STORY/CUTSCENES:There is no story. You simply play a speeder or a police officer, and have to complete missions and goals. When you do this successfully, you gain points (your ""wanted level"") which can be used to unlock new cars. The cutscenes are extremely annoying in that you can't skip them. This is particularly aggravating the first time you boot up the game, and each time you access a new area in the game itself. There are also a bunch of voiceovers, many of which occur when you select your vehicle. I think the automakers wanted a sales pitch to gamers and used this game as a way to do it.ACCOUNT:Yes, there's a required account. No, you don't need Origin, but it does want your EA/Origin email and password. Without that, you can't sign into the game's account service (called ""Autolog"") and thus can't play the game. It's slightly annoying, but if you already have an EA or Origin account, it's at least quick and easy to do. If you don't, then you'll have to sign up and that might be a hassle. VERDICT:I really like this game. It's not realistic, but it was never inteded to be either. If you want an arcade-like racing game that doesn't even pretend to have a storyline, and you don't mind using Autolog, I'd strongly recommend this game. On the other hand, if you want a hardcore simulation and detest the idea of signing into anything (except maybe Steam), you might want to pass this game up. It won't do anything for you and there are plenty of simulations available elsewhere.			"

												This game is just awesome. If you're like me and get bored of racing games quickly then playing as a SCPD cop is what's worth the sticker price. In this mode all you do is play the spoiler to the racers with spike belts, road blocks, helicopters or the brute force of your fender until you bring them to a spectacular stop. It's ♥♥♥♥ing crazy fun.But if you like racing cars this game has a ton of stunningly  rendered high end cars ranging from the Lancer EVO to the Bugati Veyron all of which can be completely wrecked in awesome detail. The PC version has controller support but if you only have a mouse and keyboard like myself it still controls wonderfully thanks to completely customizable controls.I love this game.			"

												This version of Need for Speed was very different the first few older Need for Speed titles. In this installment they added ""weapons"" to the racer and the cop. This wouldn't be such a problem if they had balanced them in some sort of way. They always seemed to work really well for the racer, but on the other hand, cops didn't have as good weapons. Although they were different, they never worked out well. The racers had weapons that would in a since, ""deal damage"" to the cop or aid in there escape. Cops had weapons that would help stop or slow down a racer. Makes since right? Well it really shouldn't have been a problem besides playing with only 1 person (which I find to be the only way to play it seeing as the multi-player is basically dead.) Playing with only 1 other person would make it have to be cop v. racer. Racer usually has the upper hand, mainly because it starts you off in the lead although the cops can usually catch up pretty quickly. Overall I enjoy playing it. I definitely suggest you buy it.			"

												Need for Speed goes back to it's roots with Hot Pursuit, a throw back to the old style of Need for Speed. Features a simple concept of cops versus speeders. Arcade racing fun.Criterion did a dang good job with Hot Pursuit. Good for them.			"

												In my opinion the best of the latest Need for Speed games.It has nice visuals, solid drifting mechanics and also pretty good multiplayer.And also it's nice that it's not capped at 30 fps like the later titles.Of cours like any other game it has it's flaws, there is no campaign at all (other than random racing) and the friend system seems confusing at first (at least for me) and there is not a lot of content other than the cars, all that you can do to them is change their colour.But if you get it for a lower price than i say go for it.It's a pretty good laugh when playing with friends.

												I don't have almost any other racing games other than this one. But I'm thankful this is the one I have.                                   Pros:- The graphics are very good for being a few years old, and I hear it runs on lower end computers as well. Like, this game could've come out in 2014 and still be great.- Driving feels solid and real. Taking close corners never felt better driving your favorite car. Might want a controller, but my brother uses a keyboard and does fine.- Community? You can't talk ever. I met a Russian online and at the end of the race we just flashed our high-beams at each other. True bliss. 10/10 would race with him again.- No DLC. No more cars. No feelings to fork more money for more stuff.Cons:- Music isn't the absolute best. I've heard better in NFS Carbon. But it's ok because you can just blast your own tunes in your favorite music player.- The online feels kinda clunky sometimes, but once you understand it, it's ok. This is EA after all, the twerps that made Origin. Stop trying to be Steam. Just stop.- There isn't the LARGEST selection of cars, but there are enough to drive each of them for a while. (I have over 700 miles in the Bugatti Veyron right now.) Also, you can't customize your car, which to me was kinda heartbreaking. The gamemakers said something about trying to make the cars look beautiful without customization. And they do look beautiful, but I would've liked customization.In conclusion, the cons are very small, and the pros outshine the small problems. I've logged plenty of hours, and plan to put more into it.This is a good game to just boot up, blast some tunes, let out some fumes, drift some corners, and rev some engines.			"

												This is a fantastic game, but a terrible port.  Everything's great until you decide to hit one of the shortcuts.  The map doesn't draw correctly and you'll be driving blind through glitchy environment pop-ins/rendering that hinder your ability to be competitive.  It's a shame because this is a nice tribute to the original two Hot Pursuits, but it's just broken and given the age, it's not likely to be fixed.			"

												EDIT!!!   So. i made an awkward mistake. A very noob mistake. i may of accidentally underclocked my processor to 800 MHz. oops. (i will buy this game again and come back with an update)This is still true. From what i could see, there is no mouse support and load times take longer than they should. So ignore everything below.This game runs horribly on my PC, even though i can run things like Arma 3, Dayz, F1 2016 and Skyrim (heavly modded) just fine. In terms of graphics, jaggered lines everywhere, can't adjust graphics except to use a 'high definition texture pack' and to adjust shadows. And im rendering this game at 900p. (yes, not even full HD)I'm getting 20-30 FPS and an input lag of about 500 - 1000ms. From what i could see, there is no mouse support and load times take longer than they should.

												This game is fun, immersive and very intense when come to pursuit whether be a racer or cop. But be warn that in singer player mode, although fun...its very hard too and the AI in this game rubberband HARD especially  when AI is the racer enemies (they can perform 180 turn, sometime easily outrun you and went far ahead in short time even when your car at top speed, crush into civilian's cars and push it away like the civilian's car is made of balloon and suffer little to no consequences while you as a cop will be wrecked badly into scrap just by touching civilian car's back)  and would take multiple attempt just to PASS but it still a fun game.

												As a veteran NFS player I'll try to remain as bias as possible with this review.I originally got this game back in 2011 as a christmas gift. I loved it and played for close to a year before the copy of it I had (on the Xbox 360) was stolen from me by some former friends of mine. I enjoyed every moment of the game as I felt it brought NFS back to it's roots from the days of Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2. I have always felt at home with the NFS series as it took racing to levels that most other games can't compete with. NFS has always been Cops versus Racers. However I see people on here writing reviews that they're angry there's no customization for the cars. Of course there isn't any Customization. NFS Underground and Underground 2 plus MW (Original) and MW (Remake) were the experiments of EA wanting to test their limits for NFS. NFS at it's Core has always been Cops versus Racers with exotic cars (Such as the Bugatti) or common cars (Ford Mustang, Dodge Charger, Nissan 370Z, etc.) with no customization. I enjoy this. This game is proof that the roots of a game are more important then appealing this current generation of NFS gamers. I have in total 17 years of NFS gametime. I feel at home here with this game. This is the NFS I've grown up to enjoy as a racing game. Yes some of the games released have no storylines. But NFS isn't about storylines. NFS is about having fun racing other people or your friends. It's about having a good time driving your dream cars. HP3 and HP2 had no storyline either and both were the epitome of NFS. I'll leave any Pros and Cons to those who choose to share them on a review. I'll continue to support EA and Criterion. As long as they continue to bring great NFS games I'll continue to purchase and play them.			"

And the best part for me is the free drive around the map with any car, just put on some music and enjoy the ride, damn its one hell of a fun game indeed.			"

												The multiplayer is very enjoyable and the game has enough players who are still playing live! The gameplay consist of hot pursuit, racing, and reach your destination on time. You can't upgrade your cars; the game rewards you with new cars as you progress. In my opinion the shortcuts are not always rewarding. Most shortcuts are hard to enter especially the yosemite map with rocks and trees in the middle of the road and some of them are not shortcuts at all. Even with its challenges you will enjoy this game.			"

												I recommend this game whole heartedly.  The graphics are decent by today's standards.  As a 2010 game. that's pretty impressive.  They are good enough to be immersive and give you the feel of racing.  Any decent system by today's standards can run it fully maxed no problem.  Unfortunately, it does not have AA option,but there are mods that offer that, at least for Nvidia cards.The action is good. It's an arcade game, and as a GAME, it shines.  It is not a sim, it is not realistic, and that is not the goal.I haven't used online at all.  The career mode is a lot of fun, both as racer and as cop and you can switch back and forth.There are a lot of racing slobs.  it's a genre that invites that sort, and I am sure there are plenty who slag on this game and others of its ilk incessantly.  It's great fun.  Period.I've played 4 different NFS games and this is as fun as any of them.It is absolutely worth $5.  No question about it "

												Evading cops, or chasing racers is always fun; but what I really love about this game is the freedrive mode. Nothing like galavanting at ridiculous speeds, drifting corners, and jamming out to some tunes in the most achronistic county ever (I honestly have no real way to measure what time it must be there, some locations are time-fixed I think. I mean, 12 hours can pass in less than a minute with the correct route.); but you know what? With the right music playing, and a good run, you can care less about those details, and just immerse yourself in the beauty of blazing trails in your dream car (XKR, FTW; Pretty, and fun as hell to drive. My personal dream car, more due to it's fun factor, than it's beauty. Thanks again for re-introducing me to this lovely vehicle NFS. Just like old times, but way better. Except now, we have more driving range, skill and experience, and no cops chasing in freedrive for a truly enjoyable drive for driving's and fun's sake.). Pedal to metal, all the way.Seacrest County is the perfect kind of location to do freedriving/galavanting in. It's just pretty, and fun to haul♥♥♥♥♥across. Have yet to multiplayer, but I'm good with my setup. Probably not much left of it to speak of anyway, I guess.			"

												This is hands down one of the best arcade racers I've played, but it's not without its faults. Let's begin with the down sides to the game:-The Ai is too clingy and elastic, it will shoot right back at you.-The stats of the cars don't matter. No matter if the have the fastest Lambo, a slower Aston will always beat you.-Events can begin to repeate and get boring-There's no satisfaction, only hatred after a race.-Music is hands down the worst I've heard in a game.-It's too linear, weapons are restrictive to certain events- The game forces you to choose from a seclection from only two cars during some events- Unlocks seem pointless, due to the fact that you can't drive these cars until 10 races later, but by then you will have unclocked a faster set of cars.- Game punishes you by not connecting to autologNow onto the plus sides of the game:+ The games is very pretty, both at night and during the day.+ The cars are very individual and throaty+ The handling of the cars are very nice to control+ Scenery is beautiful+ Cops are a nice tocuh to the game.+ Cars seems throaty and heavy.+ The free drive is very relaxing and gives you practice on the tracks. All in all, I'm going to give this game a 7.9/10If the game was less restrictive and linear, I would give it a 8 or even a 9. At the time of rating, the game has decided to delete my game save file, and as a conclusion, I have gathered a complete save file from online and has taken all progression from the game. I would recommed this game, but only slightly. The faults can be overlooked, but can get to you after a while.			"

You bet your♥♥♥♥♥you will. Are you bad enough to race the best? You can be, but you'll need balls. Worth your gaming dollar. I've played this game since release, and it never gets old.			"

Drifting at 400km is a ton of fun.On the negative side, there's not so much that keeps you comming back. No car customizations. You unlock new cars, but to me they all feel a bit the same.Great game.

												This Game is great for a break from the traditional raceing game due to its pvp mario cart esque elements, which was the exact reason I bought it. The one major feature that it lacks is manual transmission for those us that have the stick and wheel set, but it is understandable considering how you really don't have time to drive the stick when you've got the Cops on you.  Maybe a hardmode feature where you could have driven standard at the same time, or if they had allowed it for timed attacks, since you won't be pvping in those during your career modes.Another thing that bug me was how their is no clockpit view the hood view was the best I could get out of this. The minimap and the speedometer where not left at the center of the Screen when running the Game with Nividia Surround or three monitors, it was annoying having to look at the edge of the screen to see how fast I was going to the right , and then look at the edge of the other monitor to my left to see the route.My ratting for the game in this day and age is an 8, It is worth a purchase if it goes on sale for like %10 dollars or less, its not worth $20.00 for a 4 year old game.

												I'm not a huge racing game fan and so I'm not that nitpicky about graphics and cars and whatnot but one day, I decided that I felt like I should play a racing game. And so, I went on the internet and looked for the best racing games available out there and well, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit was on the top of a lot of lists. I bought the game, played the game and well, I can honestly say that NFS:Hot Pursuit is probably the only racing game I'll ever need to have because, to put it simply, it has everything I've wanted in a racing game.When it comes to graphics and presentation, this game is simply...gorgeous. From the details of the cars to the realistic looking environments and weather to the slick and stylistic design of the user interface, everything just looks polished and well-done. Not to mention that the crashes in this game look absolutely stunning. Someone could probably record a bunch of the crashes in this game, compile them into a screensaver and it would be one of the best looking screensavers ever made! The sound is mindblowingly immersive (just listening to your engine roar as you achieve 100+ KPH through your headphones really make you feel as if you're inside that car) and the controls are exceedingly responsive and intuitive. Not to mention, the gameplay is pretty forgiving for those like me who could be considered fairly 'noob' to the genre and it has that fairly 'Arcade' style for the more casual players but it can still be incredibly fun and challenging for veterans and racing game enthusiasts.Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is an incredibly well-made and well-polished game that's great for just about everyone and is the type of game that should be on everyone's steam library.

If you played the original NFS:Hot Pursuit, some parts of the map will make you feel right at home.  It brought back so many memories of the old game.  It really did feel like a newer version of the original.  So I liked this game.  It also doesn't have all the programing flaws that NFS Rivals has.			"

												There's a Wow factor to this game that tops anyother racing game. -8/10Personally, my favorite racing game of all time is Need for Speed MostWanted (Gamecube), funny enough this game is nothing like it. No open world to explore, no car customizations, no more cars that cost ingame money... nothing. But don't let this fool you. Criterion Games has built this to be a realisting, aracde like racing game. The gameplay is built to be fun and nothing else. The cars are free, so once they're unlocked go ahead and use them. The gamplay is easy to learn and is very balanced. The graphics are insane+car crashes are very amusing to watch. This is not what you'd expect from most NFS game but it might just be a whole lot better.Moving on the small issues I have with the game. First off, I have already mentioned the differences to other racing titles, and yes there are a lot of differences, but I really like the change of flavor. So thats not really a problem. Secondly, the game gets repetitive. You learn it quickly and after that, there's nothing else to learn. It's just the same kind of races over and over  again over again (#definitionofinsanityfarcry3). The last problem I have with the game is the time trials. I hate them, understand this.... you have to do perfectly on the course, take all the shortcuts, don't crash once then maybe you will get gold (the amount of bounty you get to level up depends on the medal placement the game uses). Even then it might not happen. I've been off by 0.03 seconds from getting gold, even worse, I've lost gold by 0.01s. Just stay away from the time trials and you will have a great experience.In the end it's your decision on whether you get this game or not, but I'm telling you this... if you buy this game, you will not regret it. Straight up, its fun. I recommend everyone to give this game a try. -8/10			"

												I've had this game for a week and I can already say that I am very impressed with what EA and Criterion Games have created. I've been hooked on NFS for about 4 years now, and I've played Most Wanted 2012 and World (Free MMO) since then. This game never ceases to amaze me with the graphics, the adrenaline, the challenging challenges, and the replay factor. It doesn't get boring and single player is always fun. I found that with Most Wanted 2012, as soon as I finished the game, there wasn't much else to do, and it got boring as the variety wasn't really there with the small map and lack of cop career. That is not the case with Hot Pursuit, and there is little to complain about in this game. One thing that I did find to be irritating at times was that the AI was sometimes unfair. Sometimes as a cop I'd be playing a hot pursuit event, and one of the other racers would crash into a traffic car. It'd then respawn and accelerate insanely quickly and pass by me like a rocket. I found it to be unrealistic and unfair, but it didn't really affect my experience very much because the rest of the game was just so well made that my entertainment was not influenced at all. I wish people would play multiplayer, but I don't really blame anyone seeing as this game is old now, and I should have picked it up earlier in my lifetime. Nevertheless, I can still proudly say that this purchase was worth it. So far, it is my favorite NFS game of the new generation (Criterion Editions) that I have played. I can't speak for Rivals, but I'm assuming the experience I would have playing it would be within the ballpark.Final Verdict: 9/10			"

												Realism has never really been in the vocabulary of the Need for Speed games (which is one of the reasons they are so enjoyable). Even with that in mind the handling of cars in this game seemed very simplified and unrealistic. You just hold down the accelerator and briefly tap the handbrake to throw your car into a very easy to control drift. I initially didn't like this but once I got used to it the driving style feels extremely fast and is a lot of fun. This game has binned any attempt at a story as well as the car tuning and modification which is a shame but the new things brought into this game are playing as the police and weapons. These add a whole new dimension to the game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is something immensely satisfying about the idea of driving a McLaren F1 police car.			"

												Hot Pursuit is one of my favorites in the Need for Speed series.  It's not open world driving but instead, it's simple an all out fun ride while avoiding the cops on your tail.  Sure it's not super realistic driving physics and has a more arcade like feel that's relatively easy to jump into and playing either as a police officer or a racer adds adds to the variety.  The graphics are pretty good but the more modern Need for Speeds like the recent Rivals series definitely has a leg up in the graphics department.  If you're in intent on realistic driving physics and controls, this may not be for you,  but if you enjoy racers, with great arcade style controls, with a little added excitement of completing a course while being chased down by police cars, then this is for you!

												If you like racing games you'd probably like this one. It has the two most important elements for a racing game (imho): super cars and a great sense of speed. There are different kinds of races and you can play as a cop or as a racer. Additionally, there's extra equipment such as turbo or EMP which is available or not depending on the race. And if you are up for a challenge, try to finish first on all races.			"

												Overall: 7.5 out 10	Is NFS Hot Pursuit worth buying, I must say yes, especially if you like racing games, because it has great graphics (for the year 2010), a variety of different race type and an awesome cop career mode. There are over 60 cars included in the game (I'm referring only to different car models, not the actual car number, which is 110). The hot pursuits are not that great like in NFS Most Wanted, but the cop chases are very fun to play. As we are in 2014 and  not in 2010, you should try and buy it during sales (I've paid only 2 EUR for it), because today there are many other great racing games out there that have better graphics and features.

												Very true to the original Hot Pursuit and the best NFS to come out since the first Most Wanted.The car list is varied and except for a few Gallardos there aren't many clones, the entire map has very varied and exotic locations ranging from snowy mountains to a beach town with forests, deserts, plains, cliffs and highways in between, and the graphics are pretty good. The game does not support AA natively though, so you have to force it from the graphics card control panel (and even then it only affects the cars).The soundtrack is nothing special but it isn't bad either, I'd recommend playing your own instead.

												Very true to the original Hot Pursuit and the best NFS to come out since the first Most Wanted.The car list is varied and except for a few Gallardos there aren't many clones, the entire map has very varied and exotic locations ranging from snowy mountains to a beach town with forests, deserts, plains, cliffs and highways in between, and the graphics are pretty good. The game does not support AA natively though, so you have to force it from the graphics card control panel (and even then it only affects the cars).The soundtrack is nothing special but it isn't bad either, I'd recommend playing your own instead.

OVERVIEWNeed for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a multi-award winning racing game, developed by Criterion and published by 	EA. Criterion knows how to make racing games fun. What more do you want?But there is never much to say about racing games, mainly because they’re all the same. Pick a vehicle, pick a stage, go really fast and try to win. The only real differences between racing games are vehicle handling, race types, and the usual features, like “powerups” or rewinds.VEHICLE HANDLINGWhen it comes to vehicle handling, racing games either opt for a more realistic feel, focusing on simulating real life, or they opt for an arcade feel, focusing on actually making the game fun. NFS:HP is nothing more than an arcade racing game, but if it does anything good, is nailing the arcade feeling. Boy does it feel good to drift around every corner at +300km/h using nitrous, while avoiding cars in oncoming traffic.RACE TYPESWhen it comes to race types, more doesn’t always make better. I rather have few but fleshed out race types, than having multiple race types that don’t work or are boring to play. And with that said, most race types in NFS:HP feel just like any other race game, ever. BUT, there’s a twist, because in NFS:HP, not only you play as a racer, but you can also play as a cop. Racer RacesWith racer you have what you expected, you have your normal sprint races, time trials and duels, but where it gets better is when the game throws those normal modes, and makes them even harder. Hot Pursuits, are just like sprint races, but with police force trying to stop every racer, while making you outrun cops by using powerups. [Check out Equipment Section] Previews, which are like time trials, but with end game cars the game forces you to use, where you get penalized for every collision. And, the most fun, Gauntlet racing, which fuses Hot Pursuits and Previews into one time trial mode, with a car the game gives you, and with brutal police force trying to stop you, while you use powerups to help you get rid of the cops. [Check out Equipment Section]Cop RacesAnd with cop, you have Hot Pursuits races, which is about busting between 5-7 cars, by ramming and using powerups. [Check Equipment Section] You have Rapid Response, a cop time trial, with penalties for collisions. And the most fun cop mode, Interceptor, which is like Hot Pursuits, but instead of focusing on busting 5-7 racers, it focuses on busting 1 super hard racer with the use of powerups. [Check Equipment Section]EQUIPMENTEquipment, which is basically powerups, are an easy way to separate arcade racing games from simulator racing games. There are 8 equipment in NFS: HP, 4 for each side.Racer EquipmentJammers, used to prevent cops from using their equipment.Spike Strips, which are used to blow cops or other racers tires, and also causes damage and disables them for a few seconds.EMP, to disable cops or other racers for a few seconds and also causes minor damage.Turbo, to give you a big boost in speed for a few seconds.Cop EquipmentRoadblocks, which can be called to make racers slow down, and cause damage.Spike Strips, which are used to blow racers tires, and also causes minor damage and disables them for a few seconds.EMPs, to disable racers for a few seconds and also cause minor damage.Helicopter Support, which can be called to deploy spike strips and use EMPs against the racers.CARSCars are unlocked for every bounty milestone. [Check out Bounty and Levels, in the Gameplay Section] There are 105 cars to unlock in total. The racers have 55 available cars, and the cops have 50, but most of them are copies from each other side. That means that most cop cars are the cars available for the racers, but with police paintjobs on them. And while there is no real customization in the game, the racers can choose the color they want for the car they pick (if the car allows for color customization). There are five types of car series for each side, SPORTS, PERFORMANCE, SUPER, EXOTIC, and HYPER.GAMEPLAYNFS: HP offers fast racing gameplay with tight controls. The racer/cop differences and the varied race types keep the game exciting to play. And the addition of equipment in some race types, and the strategy use of them, makes for an even better gameplay.Bounty and LevelsThere are 20 levels for each side, and you level up with bounty gained from winning races, completing milestones and completing challenges.WORLDSeacrest County is as gorgeous as it is diversed. You get to drive along beaches, drive through hot deserts, drift along the many corners of Snow Mountains, and drive really fast in highways packed with traffic.Free RoamThere is a free roam mode, where you can choose cars you have unlocked so far, but there is nothing to do in it, other than look at the car. I really, really think criterion missed a huge opportunity to make the free roam fun, like adding chases and stuff. Like if you were free roaming as a racer, and you were speeding, it would be cool if the cops came and tried to stop you, and you would get bounty to outrun or wreck them. And vice-versa, if you were free roaming as a cop, racers would speed by you really fast, and you would choose to chase them and wreck them to get bounty.PROSBeautiful landscapesDiverse worldGreat car unlock paceBig variety of cars Detailed world and car modelsGreat variety of race typesTight controls make for great gameplay MEHPoor vehicle customizationNo story or plotCONSWeak free roamCONCLUSIONI personally don’t find simulators fun, because that’s not why I play video games. I play video games to have fun and do something I can’t do in real life, like drive really fast, crash, and keep going after a few seconds, with no penalties. And that’s what this game is, a fun arcade racing game that throws in the occasional fun powerups. If that’s what you’re looking for, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit  is a must buy.			"

Getting gold in all races is hard as nails but something makes me try again and again.			"

												Hot Pursuit offers wonderful scenery and cars, nice graphics, good soundtrack and good audio sampling of the engines. Hot pursuit modality is funny (using both policeman or racer) and finally cars can be damaged. Gameplay is fast and easy, while car dynamics are completely unreal.But Hot Pursuits lacks in variety. It is very repetitive after the first hour and it is very easy.			"

												Oh how I miss the glory days of Need For Speed. Hot Pursuit stays true to the classic it emulates while giving the series a SUBSTANTIAL face lift. It's closer to an arcade racer than a sim in terms of complexity and difficulty, but the game's metaphorical tires have plenty of traction. Driving feels dangerous and cars feel much meatier than NFS games of recent past (seriously Most Wanted ♥♥♥♥ off). There is plenty to do here content wise, but I can't promise you won't get a couple hours of entertainment out of merely looking at the finely crafted 3D models in the dynamic world of Seacrest County.This is a wonderful game that has aged quite well. The road is waiting for you.			"

												ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE! i can't forget how mindblowing this game was for me when i first got it. and i bought it again after 4 years and it's stil mindblowing. This game aged very well and i honestley think it has better graphics than the new Need For Speed 2015! there were almost no cons whatsoever and the cons of this game didn't hurt the gameplay too much.1. no modification! The first games in the franchise, Test Drive Unlimited and it's sequil and Project cars are masterpieces. but they didn't have the option to modifile your car. i think that's a good thing in Need For Speed because NFS Underground and it's sequil premoted ricers with stupid customization parts. the only mods you have for your car are nitrous and some weapons like EMP, Spike strips and more2. no accual plot. i love games without plots and this is no exception. i'm honestley raging people who♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off with this game by thinking the guy who♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is the guy you have to beat as a racer of bust as a cop. in games like Mario Kart you can't do it. it will be sooo rediculous to think the guy who♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off disguised to Bowser or Wario.3. Interesting gameplay. You have accualy 2 carrers! one as a criminal who likes to go fast on public roads and one as a cop who has to bust the imbecile racers and keep Secrest County safe. it's like something like this: you are a very fast racer who likes to go 170 Mph on the freeways. one cop who accualy likes motorsports found you and instead of busting you he premoted you to be a cop in the Speed Enforcement.the bottom line: -the ♥♥♥♥ing imbeciles who hate this game don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they are talking about. this game is one of the best games of all time no doubt. this is one of the only games i played that have NO CONS WHATSOEVERif i could say what's this game in only one word: MASTERPIECE!

												A great addition to my favourite videogame franchise.I've been playing need for speed games since Need For Speed: Most Wanted in 2005. Hot pursuit offers a lot of enjoyment. I previously played this game on my PS3, and when I saw it on sale for £4, I gave in to the temptation of buying it for PC.The game, one of the newest in the franchise, let's you compete in events around the fictional ""Seacrest County"" as either cop or racer. Each faction has a variety of events. For cops, it's shutting down races, going one-on-one with a racer or rapid deployment. For racers, events included races (obviously), hot pursuits (a race in which cops try to wreck you) and time trials.However, there is no free-roam career mode, as there is in other NFS games (such as most wanted, rivals and carbon), which is a real shame. Also, despite there being 20 levels, you unlock all events by the time you are Level 11-12, which means you are replaying the same events over and over again.The game has good G27 support, if a little loose compared to other games, but you get used to itFor £15 though, you will most likely get a good 10-20h of enjoyment. I will recommend Mostwanted (2005 and 2012) and rivals over this though, considering they are the same price.			"

												I don't know where I stand with this game. There is no story, I bought it because I've always liked the Need For Speed franchise. This game handles more 'realistically' than it's predecessors. You play as either cops or racers. Cops try to stop the racers and the racers try to outrun the cops and win the race. That's it. As you rank up you will gain access to better cars. Not worth full retail price, pick it up on sale or at a discounted price on ♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Don't waste your money on NFS Most wanted 2012 and Rivals, instead buy this one and play it atleast it supports controller and it has a live multiplayer which is really amazing. Graphics are a bit lower than the new ones but still the game is not a console ported so that means no bugs or glitches.Multiplayer is really challenging %100 recommended			"

I wouldn't pay more than that, so sorry europoors that you have to pay 3.74€ - just don't do it, not worth it.			"

												Don't buy it... Don't even think about it. I'm an NFS addicted, and there's nothing like the old ones. This game is absolute §hit. The gameplay is terrible - remember those old NFS Underground, where in the drag races you only had to change the car from lane to lane? this feels like that, the driving sensation is terrible, that's what you will feel, they call 'drift' to turn the max you can to a side, and the car will start to drift, simply like that. It feels so crappy. You can't modifie anything, this is a kind of Most Wanted from 2010's but where you can choose if you want to be a cop or a racer. The handling is so, so, so terrible, I regret completly from buying it. Go for the 2004 Most Wanted, now that's a 11/10 game.			"

Forced login to an EA server I care nothing about, unskippable cinematics that drone on forever, the absolute sin of having rubberbanding AI opponents, and steering that is nearly unplayably detuned have already left a bad taste in my mouth. I'll give this another try on a day when I have more patience for bad design.			"

Indeed my PC is older, but i can run it on lower resolution without shadows, hd graphics and motion blur.The bad part - cracked version seems to work better ?! Negative here .			"

												Rubberband AI will kill your soul, and if it doesn't, the cheaters will. Not even good compared to Carbon or Underground, this is Criterion's worst game by far. Also, smeg off Criterion for never bringing Stunt Island and Cops & Robbers to PC. That's what I get for buying every game you've ever made. Smegheads.ADDENDUM 12/2013:I tried multiple times to get some kind of enjoyment and value out of this garbage again over the last few weeks and I had to permanently throw it in the garbage with extreme postjudice. Unskippable intros, the worst controls ever seen in a driving game (and just as bad with racing wheel and pedals), more cutscenes and menu navigation than actualy racing, ruining up a long event takes a second and is easy with horrible controls but restarting an event takes ages even loaded on an SSD, the cars all have essentially the same handling and are simply different for brand promotion, absolutely farcical AI that slows to a crawl if it gains a solid lead but drives impossibly fast if you get ahead... I could go on for a long time. To hell with this game, smeg off you sellout piece of worthless smeg developer.

												While it says I only have about 3 hours, I have atleast over 200+ on the PS3 alone. There are quite a few good things about the game but multiple bad ones.The Good-The cars look very nice as do the environments.-And that's where it ends.The Bad-Absolutely zero customization. Besides a few colors you get nothin'.-A ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial for the menu. THE MENU!-Unskippable cutscenes. They are long.-Zero definition of speed. You feel the same going 240mph as you do at 100mph.-Lackluster ""abilities"". The only good ability is Spike Strip. Everyone uses it. Online, offline, it's the main move. The only other slighly useful one is Turbo but there's so few places to use it, it's almost a non-entity.-Rubberband A.I. You can be miles ahead one second, but one ♥♥♥♥ up, and you just went into last place and its more difficult than should be to catch back up. Again, no definition of speed.-Cop A.I. The police will never get off your♥♥♥♥♥♥ You and five other people racing? Well, unlucky you, 'cause you're al they're going for. Could it have been that difficult to program the A.I. to go for, say, first place?-Ridiculous Difficulty Curves. Why is it that the Cop levels are so obnoxiously more difficult than the Racer ones? The hardest part of getting the trophy for all golds were the Cop levels, most notably, the Time Trials. These are the most unforgiving levels. Most times you can only just manage to beat the gold by perhaps 5 seconds max, and thats with zero ♥♥♥♥ ups. The worst part is that the Racer ones are a breeze.-Poor physics. Perhaps the most agregious thing in this game is the physics engine. You will swear up and down on your life that you never even touched the car you past, but yet you still get a ""Crashed"" mini cutscene. Other times you slam into a car at 200mph and nothing happens. You just bulldoze 'em out of the way like it was nothing.-Driving. I don't know who did the ""weight"" for the vehicles but I hope you don't program racing games anymore. Your car will more times than not feel like someone trying to slide a brick down a hill. Your car will turn at bare minimum, maybe 5 degrees a second. So you have to brake and drift, but you lose so much speed in that half second you braked you might as well just turn regularly. However the A.I. will always SPEED UP when drifting. What the hell, man.In all, this game is pretty to look at and you'll probably like it for the first few races, but its all downhill after that, sadly.			"

												This game can best be described as ""disrepectful."" It is passably disrespectful that they would even dare remaking the Hot Pursuit series, but to put that title on THIS?? Unacceptable.Here's why it sucks:-Every car is exactly the same in every area except looks and speed: no handling stat, acceleration, etc.-There is no depth: Career mode is a series of repetitive races, time trials, and attempting to ""bust"" speeders as a underwhelming, though superpowered, cop-Cars do not move: all of the cars have the same handling and that handling sucks. Since when was NEED FOR SPEED supposed to have even remotely realistic handling?? Also, taking down cars is 5x harder in this game than in real life. As a die-hard Burnout fan, and classic NFS fan, this game's physics actually sadden me. You can ram a car with all your might and you will get the same result as if you tried to ram a running train 12x heavier than you. The cops somehow are able to magically decimate your car though.-THERE IS NOTHING TO DO: like I said, there are races, cops-and-robbers craps, and a buttload of time trial/""Preview"" bullcrap. It is not fun. I swear this game was made by people who do not play video games. Sure, there's free-roam driving but the world around you sucks. There are sparse bits of nearly invincible traffic, and the game just feels lonely 24/7.-It's not Need For Speed anymore: I know a lot of people actually liked this game and ramble on about how it may actually be just as good or better than classic Need For Speeds, but I would ask you this: what the crap kinda bootleg ""Need For Speed"" did yall used to play???-It's not Burnout: Back in the Gamecube/PS2 era, Burnout and Need For Speed were the two best unrealistic racing series in existence, in my opinion. They were actually rival series and they were both great at different things and equally enjoyable and worth playing. That was then, now it is no longer the case and it's sad. I would say Burnout Paradise is the best racing game I have played, maybe ever; I can't help but compare any racing game I play now to Burnout Paradise. Unfair, I know, but that's how it is. But Burnout Paradise withstanding, I am greatly disappointed by this game. And bored....At least the in-game cars look nice. "

												Between forced video tutorials, video intros, and most of the content being locked by an EA required sign in that has a rather shady policy I hated this game from the moment I booted it up. I loved the original and I was hoping this would be much like it but it came with so much EA crap that it's not worth even looking at.How about the game? Well I played a whole one race. The driving mechanics were so bad that I put it down and walked away never to play it again. When you make a driving game I expect a certain level of driving proficiency. This one handled more like how Halo handles driving and even games where driving is a secondary mechanic do it better. The steering was extremely loose and the car went everywhere. Definitely not what I expect from today's driving games.If you want a great driving game stick to Burnout for intense action and your Forza types for simulation. This was just a sad attempt at a cash grab.			"

												This is an odd entry to me in the NFS franchise. It's a reboot of an old series, the last of which was one of my favorite childhood games, with some of the elements of later games and very little of the fun from the originals. It feels like they tried for realism (more on that in a bit) and sacrificed fun in the processes. Hot Pursuit 2 (2002) had you dodging flaming barrels dropped from helicopters while this one has dramatic crash cams. There is no customization, absolutely no reason to jump into the open world, and zero plot. I'm sure this is an affect of the move to Criterion who seem to think every racing game fan wants nothing more than shiny cars and big crashes.Perhaps the strangest issue is the driving physics. They are just plain wrong. Essentially they are setup to slide around every corner which makes fine control something of an impossibility. This really becomes a problem when the game starts penalizing you for touching walls and traffic in time trials.The games saving grace is the ability to play as a cop and bust up races. In these cases the constantly interrupting crash cams seem justified and are satisfying compared to frustrating when you hit an oncoming car for the n-th time while your car slides instead of turns.In the end I can't recommend this game, even on sale. There is little depth so it quickly becomes bland and repetitive, getting to the end turns into a grind.

I said little because that's the truth here, there is so little to do, almost nothing. I feel like the only thing to do is playing multiplayer races. If you consider buying this, only do so if it is ON SALE. I'm giving this game a downvote because you should not have to pay money for a game this thin and dissappointing.Pros:-The multiplayer. You only have very few mods though, and after two days of playing you know every single racing track (like, every single one of them)-The graphics. Definitely not top-notch but it fits the game and the lighting effects are really cool and seem realistic.-The sounds. Nothing out of the ordinary here, the music tracks are a matter of taste. The intro is way too loud though.-The driving. It feels nice and responsive, nothing bad about it.Cons:-The singleplayer. I don't think EA was sober when they made this. Its an insult.-Stuff besides the racing. No tuning, you may only choose from some colours to spray your car in.-The tracks. Repetitive, but not always lame, cool shortcuts but overall not enough diversity.-(The multiplayer. As I said, its fun, but you've got so few modes that it gets boring pretty quick.)Conclusion:This game could have been so much more. Its a dissappointment. If you want to play a better multiplayer racing game from the NFS series, try the new Most Wanted (Singleplayer sucks here, though). The multiplayer has a whole city, cool modes and is just way more interactive when playing with friends. So, don't buy Hot Pursuit, better get Most Wanted or something else because this here is not what I would call a good game.			"

												The war on Wheels, wanna be a cop and catch the 'racers' or a 'racer' and run from the cops. This is your game. Even though the autolog sucks. The game single player has a  pretty good amount of cars. The big downside is the customization, the NFS series was a big succes  because of  the customization why not on this game :(. Multiplayer is ok! But since there are not alot of people online, i would only buy the game for the single player. Well kind of 'single player' there are only challenges you have to do.... The graphics are nice for a 2010 racing game. And the controlls are not the best for pc. So i recommend you to buy/use a controller. Rating: 7/10 A decent game.			"

												That same revival NFS:HP. I think it should be the last in a series of NSF. New parts are all more similar to die production. Nothing has changed, and nothing, it's a race, and they are created for a fun pastime.The game ends very quickly. After 10 levels players, or breaking record friends, or play in multiplayer.If you choose from all the series that are in the Steam, it is better to choose NFS:HP.			"

												I rarely feel like writing a review for a game wether i like it or not. But this one♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off pretty hard.The last NFS I actually played was Most wanted for gamecube. I loved it, for it was simply amazing. So i thought, since Hot pursuit was on a huge sale, i could just try it out. Might be fun.About 2 hours into the game all I can say is : What a bullsh*t. -Story is like non-existing. You have 2 different lines to go. One with the racers and one with the cops. Drive some races, increasong your Wanted rank / Officer rank. thats all.-Can't customize cars, except for some random colors-Car sounds are horrible. I had to turn their volume down a lot to make them bearable-Music is okay but i feel like listening to the same 5 songs over and over-Controlls are without any depth. Using an Xbox-Controller you need like 3 buttons for driving, breaking and nitro. the rest is without use or u dont need it. On top of that, the drving feels pretty unsatisfying.-Can't even log in to my EA account or create a new one from in game options. When i tried to do that outside of the game i couldnt even access the website-The worst point of this game is actually with the cutscenes during a race. You destroyed a cop car? --> Cutscene, New cop arrived? --> Cutscene, You Hit someone with a spike-trail? --> Cutscene. During those cutscenes your car just automatically drives on and when you regain control of it most of the times you crash into something because youre in the middle of a turn or rush straight into an other car, losing your lead. And you cant even turn them off.-Remember Mia from Most Wanted? Fantastic Character, really likeable. What do we get here? The voice of a woman, talking like she doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game and explains you the same♥♥♥♥♥♥about a car everytime you dont lock it in within 1 second. Cant turn her off either.So, compared to my old favorite NFS Most wanted, they ONLY thing they improved is the graphics. If I didnt buy it for like 2€ I'd refund it immediately.			"

												Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit could have been a fun arcade racing game, but it has a couple of problems. First of they wanted to integrate social media in the game which just sit in the way of you playing the game. But the biggest problems is the horrible control of the car. The steering sensitivity and deadzone are way off and it takes ages for the car to react to your input. There are no options to change this. This is from the same makers of Burnout which has much better controls. I don't get how they could mess this one up so bad.			"

												So many freaking delays, try to load the game up and it spends forever telling you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I was already out of patience with it, when my steering wheel controller did not work (kept acting as if something was pressed when it wasn't - yet I was just using that controller in another game just fine) I did fix that, but then I became aware of the way the game made me feel also.So, you get past all those annoying long intro cutscenes, it tries to make you log into autolog, it tells you every time to play need for speed world, then it lets you finally go to the menu. Then you click start and there's a long cutscene, and at the beginning of every level it does this:     Loading for longer than it probably should     Cutscene with a button on the bottom saying ENTER - skip     Press enter, buttom of screen changes to SKIPPING, cutscene continues to play     Game finally startsBut the problem is - I've only just started playing it and I am TERRIBLE at it, I haven't played a NFS in ages, so I need some practice to do okay at it - but every time I fail and want to retry I have to reload the game, and then watch the cutscene that pretends like it's skipping.If this frustrates you to read it, skip it!

Posted: January 19, 2015
												I must say that I was unpleasantly surprised by this title in the Need For Speed series. Luckily I bought it during a Steam Sale. I've finished the game in a less than 10 hours (probably even a hour or 2 less as I go AFK mid-games sometimes) without any struggling, and I'm not a professional when it comes to racing games. But most importantly: there is no reason to come back and play it again at all after completing the ''campaign''. After finishing the campaign, you unlock every car automatically and there is nothing else you can work towards to (there even aren't any Steam achievements). There is an option to play online against other players, but there aren't enough (if any) other players for this game anymore and therefore the racing against others online option is dead. You can queue for an online game, wait a hour, and still find out that none else will join it. You can also compare your racing-times with other players, but only with friends who also happen to play the game. How ridiculous is that?! You also can't customize the easily-earned cars, except for picking a new full-body color for only some cars, unlike other games in the NFS-series including NFS: Undercover. As for the positive factors, that would mostly be the graphics and crash-scenes. I wouldn't ever buy this game for over € 5,-. Even for a € 5,- price-tag I'd still have my thoughts whether it's worth it. Anyway, here is my list of pros and cons with a bit of extra stuff in it.Pros: - Great graphics- Great crashing-scenes- Great police-chases and escapes (helicopter interceptions, barricades, awesome!)- You can destroy other cars (so can yours be)- Easily learnt how to play itCons:- Every. single. car. is automatically and easily earned by finishing the not-challenging-at-all campaign (only the final 2 missions are a bit challenging, though still easy)- No customization options (only some cars can get a different full-body paint-job, that's all.) (There also isn't even a single customization option for the police cars)- There is a leveling system which has no purpose at all. I think it's only there to make you feel like you still earned something after losing a race (which you will rarely lose). The leveling system offers you slightly upgraded (and no different) weapons for your car. You will earn those ''upgraded'' weapons automatically during the campaign anyway. - Racing-routes are getting used over and over during the campaign, not once, not twice, no, sometimes you're driving the same road for up to like 8 different missions. - Racing-routes all look somewhat the same. No special jumps or whatsoever. Just one route has more curves than the others.- You play as two different roles during the entire game. Sometimes as the police officer, sometimes as the wanted person. But both roles earn the exact same car, except that you get sirens when being the police officer. Worst of all, because of that, you earn every single car in the game twice. So you've finished a mission, and what is your reward? ''Oh hey, it's the Lamborghini again which I've won earlier in this campaign as well, just this time with sirens on its roof''.- Sometimes the weather changes into a thunderstorm, but the amount of lightning during the thunderstorms is ridiculous. Lightning flashes every second. (awful if you're seizure-sensitive)- The online community is completely dead. Barely anyone plays the game online, sometimes you can sit in a queue (room) for up a to a hour and still not see any other player.- There is also no reason to play online, it does not earn you anything and you can't compare your stats with other online players. You can only compare your stats with friends. - There is nothing else to work towards to after finishing the campaign, there even aren't any Steam achievements, and there is no point in trying to set a better racing-time as you can't compare the stats online.- The physics are different (awful?) compared to the other NFS titles. You will (almost) never get off the ground with your car, no matter how big the bump in the road is. There are 2 or 3 bumps in the entire game (which you can even skip) which gets you only slightly off the ground, but you won't even notice that if you blinked. Steering also works awful compared to the other NFS titles. If you steer for a millisecond and tap the brake for a millisecond, you can get through any curve and you can perform a burn-out for the rest of the race. The only way to get out of the burnout is by driving 99% straight forward. If you're steering even slightly (10%) left or right, you'll stay in a burnout. - When you crash, you actually don't crash. A cut-scene with a crash pops up whenever you hit something else hard enough, and once the cut-scene ends you're just somehow driving at full speed and perfectly straight on the road. - Campaign is very repetitive. You'll barely notice any difference between the first mission, the final mission and everything in between. - Every mission uses the exact same cut-scene, both at the start and in the end. - (small con) When you start up the game, you have to sit through some of the credits and wait for them to pass by; you can't skip them. - You can abuse bugs by crashing your car at certain moments. For example, if there is a roadblock up ahead, you can 1 mile beforehand hit the guardrail to trigger a crashing cut-scene; the crashing cut-scene lets you completely bypass the roadblock.- The game can be finished within a few hours, even if you're entirely new to racing games. There is no reason to come back unless you'd like to start the campaign over againOut of 10, I'd rate it 5,5. The awesome police-chases and escapes is what compensates it just enough to be able to say that ''it's an ok game''. But I'm excluding the price for that rating. If I'd include the price, I'd definitely not recommend it to others. The amount of hours you can/will spend on this game simply isn't worth € 15,-. It'd be € 5,- max. But if you ''just want to try'' this game out, I wouldn't even pay € 5,-. Do it if you're a NFS-fan who's truly interested or otherwise get any of the other (even older) NFS titles. And if you really want police-chases, get the older, better, and cheaper NFS Undercover instead.			"

												Unenjoyable game, dull tracks where you basically hold the accelerator all the time, and simetimes makes a ""drift"" through corner using handbrake in 300kph ... right. Also AUTOLOG servers are broken and keep disconnecting, thus MP is imposible to play. I know it is an arcade racing, but for arcade racing it is not really fun, I would rather recommend Sega Sonic All Stars Racing, that is a fun arcade racing/flying/whatever game.			"

												When I was a wee little kid one of my first racing games was Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit. It was fun. The way the title was written I always thought it was Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 3, and so I wondered why Hot Pursuit 2 was better in every way, but it was fun. Then I got Hot Pursuit 2 on PC AND PS2 because it was that freaking good. I played the crap out of that game, and it was always fun to return home from school to race while avoiding the police.What seperates Hot Pursuit from other racing games? The cops. In Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, not only are you racing other cars, but you also have to worry about the police who will do everything in their power to shut the race down. This includes slamming your car all over the road, pinning it into corners, setting up roadblocks ahead, dropping spikestrips to flatten your tires, and calling a helicopter to find ways to ensure that even in the air they can ruin your day. It's not just a racing game, but an action survival game as you wreck cop cars and escape from the police like it's Fast and Furious. Which like the movies, Need for Speed is all about the rule of cool trope. Why is that cop chasing you in a Lamborghini? Because it's awesome, that's why.At the time this game came out I thought Need for Speed was a dead franchise. I had no idea this game and others existed. I only recently found out about this some months ago, and waited for a sale to pick this up. Now I was hesitant to get this reboot of the series considering what happened when Red Alert 3 was made (to make a long story short, it wasn't very good, and Red Alert 2 was one of my favorite games from my childhood as well), so I came in with low expectations. But holy cow was I ever surprised that they didn't mess this game up.It's still Hot Pursuit. But, it's Hot Pursuit on crack! Let me go over some of the differences between Hot Pursuit 2 and this game.1) In Hot Pursuit 2, the police had no way to bust you other than to be within a certain distance for a certain amount of time while you are below a certain speed. Once they do this three times, you're out of the race. In this reboot, rather than having strikes you have a health bar. All the cops (as well as other racers, pedestrians, and the enviroment) have to do is destroy your car. Granted your health is fairly beefy, but it IS possible to take down to zero, and in later parts of the game this happened quite frequently. This is a welcome change as it makes good driving skills much more important, as well as easing the OP'ness of the racers.2) In Hot Pursuit 2, spikestrips were static. A cop would request permission to place it, get approved, and then one would spawn ahead in a set location. The police would then announce on the radio where it was and what side of the road it was on. It was essentially a less visible roadblock. In Hot Pursuit 2010 the racers AND police have spikestrips, and they are deployables. When playing offline, I never noticed other racers using spikestrips, but that was fine by me as the police did more than fill that gap. What a cop will do is drive ahead of you, pull out in front, and then drop a strip. So if you see a cop pass you by, try to get as far away from the back of his car as possible. This makes spikestrips much more interesting as they can be anywhere at anytime, and you have to be able to adapt. It's never impossible to dodge them, but it does get trickier as you progress, because all ""gadgets"" have upgrades. So that means a cop may drop multiple strips.3) Gadgets. Hot Pursuit 2 had you and the cars. This game, as you play and unlock them, has upgradable gadgets and a ""nitro"" system. At first I thought it was completely unneccesary, but they sure do make things a lot more interesting. Especially in the longer courses. You have a nitro that fills up as you do risky stuff. Using the nitro will give you a burst of speed as long as you have the nitro to do it. You have a turbo that's nitro on crack, though it doesn't have a bar. You have a set number of uses, it makes you go extremely fast, and its length is out of your control. You'll be stuck in turbo until it's over. EMP allows police and racers to disable your car for a second. As you improve in the game you'll be able to jam EMP, dodge the lock-on, and correct your car while it's trying to spin out so that little-to-no-damage is done. So there's a degree of skill and conserving resources. I mentioned how you can drop spike strips already. Finally there's the jammer, which will block EMPs and allow you to see incoming roadblocks.4) The courses in Hot Pursuit 2 were seperate tracks with laps, like in every other racing game. In this reboot, you have a world map, but unlike Burnout Paradise where you never know where to go unless you painstakenly memorize EVERYTHING, the courses will be constructed for you out of this map. Also, instead of laps, you have a start and end point. This means that during a race you won't be seeing the same sights over and over again as you do laps. It keeps the race feeling fresh each time, with any degree of recognition being from an alternate route you took in another race.5) Takedowns and crashes. In Hot Pursuit 2, if you hit a wall or another car, then you just stop, reverse, and continue going. Here though it's like my two favorite racing games (Burnout 3 and NFS: Hot Pursuit 2) had a love child. If you've played Burnout, then you know what happens when you crash into something. Your car gets wrecked, massive damage is taken from your health, and you're put back on the road ready to go. But by then the other racers are past you. As with point number 1, this encourages better driving. It also makes races without cops much more exciting. In old Need for Speed, I could never understood why people would play with the cops turned off. It's just a run of the mill racing game then. But now, it becomes classic Burnout, and that's not a bad thing. I wasn't a fan of Paradise City, so something more like the older games where I could focus on racing rather than opening the map screen every couple of seconds to check where I should turn is more than welcome.Now I see in other reviews there are unskippable cutscenes. I have no idea what they are talking about. I skip them all the time. The only unskippable thing that occurs is the brief (like, 1-2 seconds maximum) scenes where it introduces a new cop car coming for you that you haven't seen before in previous races, when you total another racer or cop, or when your EMP/Spike Strip hits someone. Which, once again, is very brief. And Hot Pursuit 2 had the same thing. In fact, it was worse in HP2 because you would lose control of your car and there was no redirection. So if you were coming up to a turn or about to hit a strip or something and a camera snippit was shown, then you'd hit what was in front of you, no questions asked. At least here the game will steer your car for you while this is happening. And it does a great job at that too. Making turns better than I could, avoiding cars and police blockades and stuff by itself, etc. It has never screwed me over to give up control for 2 seconds, unlike in Hot Pursuit 2.Now, what complaints do I have? The soundtrack isn't as good as HP2, but with Steam Music I fixed that problem easily. That thing works great for racing games.The only other thing I find dissapointing is that there is no custom race mode. I can't create a path or even pick one to race on how I want. I can't pick a path, set whether I want cops to be there or not, set gadgets on or off (a lot of races don't even have the gadgets, but most of the ones with the cops chasing you do), set time of day, etc. I have to pick from premade ""events"", and level up my bounty (which isn't hard at all. Very anti-grindy actually. But it's still there) to unlock the events that I want to do. A custom race mode would have made this perfect. Otherwise, solid 8/10.			"

												so i consider myself a fan for need for speed all the way since underground 2 which in my vision is still the best of them all sinds then the series only went down and down (all though most wanted was still kinda awesome). however this time they've reached a new low for me i kinda liked the cops and robbers idea but wth... so before anything i haven't played the ""robbers side yet"" ill edit as i have but for now this are my findings:CONS:- NO custimize ability at all, you cars are practically costmetic (especially since your enemy drives based on your speed but thats like every nfs game)- Pretty much no story at all (but wth wasnt really necessarily)- you unlock cars in completely random sequence (for example newly unlocked cars are slightly slower and worse at handlig how amazing is that and you even unlock cars you wont be using or have no use to you anymore (outprogressed))- COPS: taking down cars only counts when you are near or the one doing the damage but only when you hit them in the rear anything else well actually do you more damage then them... (flying cars all over by bad ai but dont get damaged even though they are summersaulting all over the place)- COPS: A FREAKING SIRENE THAT DOES NOTHING!!! (i mean really the siren doesnt do anything npc civillian cars are competely ignoring it and even FREAKINGLY HONKING when you get near them, ITS YOUR OWN FAULT IF YOU GET HIT STUPID NPCS YOU SHOULD MOOOOOOVVVEEE!! out of the way!! i hope its not really like this is USA cause then i can understand cops get nowhere..)- COPS: whenever you enter a bust an racer race you enter with like 2 -3 vehicles as support wish magicaly vanish whenever you finally get control of your car and reappear when victorious (beside potentially haven crappy ai they would have come really handy whenever one of them racers decide to simple turn around in them middle of freaking chase, which now somehow is one of the smartest things they can do..)- Time trails (always hated them, guess there must be people that love them or something apparently cant have a race game without them)- .. will update as i continue playingPROS:- cops and robbers powerups (kinda cool mario kart style weaponry although, barely allowed, use only sometimes and in few numbers. But they lvlup and become more powerful was a nice suprise)so in short:- as a cop you'll be screaming alot gtf out of my way, its your own fault!			"

												Pros: amazing sound system(music and environment) really inmersive details and play. The cars experience is well design. Amazing scenarios. Cons: eventhough the cinematics are good, you waste a lot of time on them, even when trying to skip them, and , if you are looking to get achievements trust me on this, it gest horrible to see waste of time before you can start racing. You get cars but you cannot use it whenever you like, it depends on the race. In pursuit the damage system for the suspect is not realistic and can bother a lot. I never check the online mode, but in general I did not like the experience, i still use it for some races but when a try to complete an objective it gets me angry and regret the playtime due to the a lot of waste of time in loading and cinematics plus some gameplay that seens unrealistic to me.

												fair game, all cars are free... but not are usable in certain races, but what made me depressed was the fact that there was no option for manual Transmitionim a very negitive person so...  CONS-multiplayer is dead, but i didn't buy it for any other reson than freeplay..-there is no manual transmition, the only way to rev, is holding e-break- no crew, i cri i wanted the fun of carbon + the cars of well... this game- even with a controller, your gonna spin your tires.... unless of course, your very good with triggers, - even if you mute radio a hud still pops, (telling you the song, that you can't listen to)Pros (only the important- you can play both sides till the end! :D (many games have this oportunity)- there are more, real cars than anyother game i've played (aka Ford = vespid in watchdogs and Vapid in gta)- you can turn of teh car...one more thing, who ever used my email, totaljonah98 i think you lost your account noob :3 next time don't use somebody else's email, registration isn't that hard...

												This game has the worst (rubber band) AI I have ever seen in a racing game. I came very close to throwing my controller through my window in one of the races because I kept getting beaten\overtaken right at the end of one of the races. If you want to play this, and I would argue it's a decent game overall, prepare for a lot of frustration because there is no difficulty option for this game. It's all over the place.			"

												Fun driving game, but at the same time there are so many things wrong that make it relly frusterating and un-realistic. For ex: >the cop cars & helicopter suck.. >you can be 200mph in a lambo on a twisty back road or straight away... drifing and tearing it up.. holding in your nitrus the whole time until it empties: Doesn't matter. You can't outrun cops or other cars you are racing. They are alway in your rear view. No matter what. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There's almost no point in using a nitrus aside from a time trial, cause in an actual race, it really doesn't give you any advantage. Its not like the old need for speed where you could master the course and end up a full lap ahead of another racer. Here, there is always a racer or cop like a second or two behind you. >The physics are kinda meh. The cars handle really mushy. So as a result, you are forced constantly into a drift around it seems every corner. Like every corner, even little ones. >no option for automatic/manual. Its all automatic. >the time trials are a joke. Like cut way too close.  You can't go to the next map until you finish the first a lot of times, and I have to redo a time trial map over & over & over cause I miss a half a second or a 10th of a second on a map that takes overall 5 or 6 minutes.  >the cops suck>You can't scip cutscenes. Why? Most of them aren't really all that important anyway. >A lot of the corses are related to evading cops or being the cops, so if you don't like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a cop in a regular cop sedan drifing 200mph perfectly through backroads 2"" from your bumper, then you probably wont like this. >the cops are super unrealistic, cant be outrun in their piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥cars even at 220mmp with your turbo button held down.. they still fly past you. Bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ >Did I mention the unrealistic cops suck and ruin the game? I dunno, its fun as a driving game and I'm not done with it. But its more frusterating than it is rewarding. Makes you feel like you are working really hard for nothing a lot of the time the way they did things.			"

												Great game for how old it is, graphics are great and I love the fact that you can be a racer AND a cop, not just one. Lots of cars but tehre should be more options of mission you can do because I am stuck with only one racer mission to do and I can't finish it. The freeroam is great and I love all of the scenery and how everything in the background actually moves instead of just looking like a wallpaper. As of now, in the winter steam sale, it would be a great time to buy this game, since it only costs $5 and for that price this game is a no-brainer, if you like cars and racing and whatnot, BUY THIS GAME NOW WHILE IT'S ON SALE!!! You won't regret it, UNLESS you like multiplayer. I've heard that the community is practically dead, but I haven't even tried going on since I don't feel like making a EA account. Overall though, for the current price along with everything else, you should definetly buy this game!			"

												This is probably one of the best recent Need for Speed games, of not, the best of the series. With a wide variety of real world cars, instead of being realistic simulation, Hot Pursuit takes a very arcade-y route. Cars in this game are encouraged to demolish each on the race track, by shear force or its absurd weaponry of EMPs and spike strip deployers.I could talk about the cons of this game like no interactive open world, no customizability, dozens of camera/sound/visual glitches, limited gameplay, no slit screen , repeativeness, dead multiplayer, EA Autolog, lack of soul but the pros outweigh these cons. The graphics in this game still holds up, I can't believe this game was made 6 years ago. The cars all handle the same but that just adds to playability for newer players. The sound design (although buggy sometimes) is great, the engines sound so good and the turbo sound effect is so cool. Music is good but it's not a long playlist. There's a lot of cars (no Ferrari though). You can play both campaigns as a cop or racer. And if you ever get friends with this game, the online is fun as hell.It's not a perfect game but it is one of my favorites. It's almost a guilty pleasure, except this game is actually great. Just turn off your brain when you play this game it's literally a Michael bay film. Arcade-y, comically absurd, action packed and extremely enjoyable.			"

												Absolutely amazing. If you play at high settings, it can look very good and even like it was made recently. The game controls very well, the sounds and music are amazing, it has a smooth UI, and in my opinion, it's the best game in the entire NFS franchise.The only problem is that since it was made in 2010, NOBODY plays multiplayer anymore. Seriously.But, if singleplayer-only gameplay is fine for you, then go for it. You can play both extensive racer and cop careers, it looks and plays great. It's just a little hard. That's all.			"

PROS:+ great soundtrack+ fun arcade racing+ two different career modes - cop & racer+ lots of unlockables and rewards+ plenty of race tracks+ lots of cool cars+ partial gamepad supportCONS:- occasional drop in FPS or stutter  - requires EA account for multiplayer- online multiplayer is dead- no wheel supportComment:Need For Speed 3 - Hot Pursuit came out in 1998 and is a BIG part of why I got into PC gaming. Later they released Need For Speed (6) - Hot Pursuit 2 but that wasn't as great as the first one. Then the series branched out into various ways in the yearly releases. Until this reboot came back to the roots of silly arcade gameplay without the hassle of forcing in a story campaign. Back to funky shortcuts. For me it was the most fun NFS after a long while. Racer and cop careers are sepparate from each other. And you can rise in rank for both modes. You get experience for cool stuff you did even if you fail a mission/race. This feels good because it gives you a sense of progression every time play. You unlock new cars and items for every milestone you hit. Freedrive in each of the tracks is a nice option too - to try out the terrain or just casually drive around to relax. Social aspects were more of an experiment and while not needed at all they do have some quirks. Like why is it not possible to set an avatar but the only way to have a profile picture is to have a webcam connected. Online multiplayer is basically dead but then again I never played much of it, the singleplayer was all I really needed in this game. Played a lot of it back in the day and actually finished both modes. My favourite time to play was during long train trips where I would play on my laptop. That being said, this game is MUCH better with a gamepad. But gotta give it credit that both careers are doable on keyboard. Graphics are kind of clunky compared to the racing games of today but it personally doesn't bother me. Overall a cool and fun racing game that is worth a try but due to how old it is I recommend grabbing it on a sale.P.S.: I played waaay more than half an hour of this game, I just tried if it works here on Steam			"

												Overall this game fails due to the cheating rubber band AI. Why have faster cars when the AI will cheat and fly past you with a slower car? Despite all the cheating to AI fails to provide much of a challenge. Sometimes the AI will even get so high speed boost into a corner, that they have no chance of making the turn and instead wall ride / bounce of the walls to make the turn.Some of the negative things I faced in this game:The way takedowns of opponents and cops can cause some really annoying and confusing situations. Sometimes I'd bust racers as a cop, when after a previous cutscene spawned me directly on a crash course with another racer. Coming out of a crash cutscene can also cause you to be heading towards a wall with almost no time to recover. The way these crashes get triggered also seems quite random at times. Sometimes you'll be crashing with traffic almost head on at 200km/h only to have your speed reduced. Other times hitting something at much lower speed will trigger a crash.Taking down cops as a racer also seems to be quite pointless. In many cases the game will simply spawn more and more cops to chase you, thus turning the takedowns into nothing more but some extra points for advancing your rank.The handling differences of the cars within a certain series are basically nonexistent. Sure, this isn't meant to be a simulation, but it would be nice if your car selection would have any impact on the handling at all. Now they all feel basically the same.I also randomly experienced some odd performance slowdowns  that fixed themselves after a couple of seconds.Positive things about the game:Unlike many other modern NFS games, this does actually have a bonnet  camera. Thus you aren't forced to use the back camera like in many other games in the series. Yes, those games do have the bumper camera, but I consider that to be useless as it's so low that you cannot see anything even if there's a slighthest hill on the road.You can turn of the damn siren, even during a chase event. There's no point in having it on IMHO since it has no effect on the traffic anyway. For example some events in Rivals force you to have the siren on.The soundtrack is decent enough. It does have some really good tracks like Watercolour by Pendulum.There aren't long unskippable cutscenes, I wish though that those that are in the game could be skipped.			"

												Coming to this game with no Nostalgia factor, this game is mediocre at best. Graphically, it looks pretty poor for even 2010, especially because there is no way to turn on Anti-aliasing in game. Gameplay wise, the largest problem is that while it definitely feels fast and the drifting can be Ridge Racer style snappy, most cars handle like boats otherwise. The handling is completly at odds with how arcadey every other mechanic feels. Nitrous is quick, Drifting is snappy but a gentle turn feels like your driving a tugboat. If only there was a way to change the steering sensitivity, this game wouldn't feel so bad to play. Also this game is LOUD AS BUTTS. I had to turn down the music and everything else to 20%.I can't easily recommend this to anyone looking for a simple arcade game, even on sale. I say to get the older NFS games over this one if you want to have some quick racing fun.			"

												Coming to this game with no Nostalgia factor, this game is mediocre at best. Graphically, it looks pretty poor for even 2010, especially because there is no way to turn on Anti-aliasing in game. Gameplay wise, the largest problem is that while it definitely feels fast and the drifting can be Ridge Racer style snappy, most cars handle like boats otherwise. The handling is completly at odds with how arcadey every other mechanic feels. Nitrous is quick, Drifting is snappy but a gentle turn feels like your driving a tugboat. If only there was a way to change the steering sensitivity, this game wouldn't feel so bad to play. Also this game is LOUD AS BUTTS. I had to turn down the music and everything else to 20%.I can't easily recommend this to anyone looking for a simple arcade game, even on sale. I say to get the older NFS games over this one if you want to have some quick racing fun.			"

												Pros: amazing sound system(music and environment) really inmersive details and play. The cars experience is well design. Amazing scenarios. Cons: eventhough the cinematics are good, you waste a lot of time on them, even when trying to skip them, and , if you are looking to get achievements trust me on this, it gest horrible to see waste of time before you can start racing. You get cars but you cannot use it whenever you like, it depends on the race. In pursuit the damage system for the suspect is not realistic and can bother a lot. I never check the online mode, but in general I did not like the experience, i still use it for some races but when a try to complete an objective it gets me angry and regret the playtime due to the a lot of waste of time in loading and cinematics plus some gameplay that seens unrealistic to me.

												OVERAL VERDICT:                 Got a refund -_-How do I start this?Gameplay was choppy and though im running it on a gtx 1070 and its installed on an ssd with 32gb ram to keep it going behind all that, it still was getting increments of fps drop downs to as 5 fps!! For a game 6 years old that tells me one thing: bad optimisation.Furthermore, the tutorials are too much.. what happened to the good old need for speed styles of actual gameplay doing the talking not some cinematic polished animation and a cheesy sounding voiceover? EA has messsed this up a bitto say the least but the one plus side i would say is the visuals are wonderful, even to todays standards.The car controls are terrible tho.. feels like a console port.. oh and GET RID OF DRM!3/10			"

												Absolutely amazing. If you play at high settings, it can look very good and even like it was made recently. The game controls very well, the sounds and music are amazing, it has a smooth UI, and in my opinion, it's the best game in the entire NFS franchise.The only problem is that since it was made in 2010, NOBODY plays multiplayer anymore. Seriously.But, if singleplayer-only gameplay is fine for you, then go for it. You can play both extensive racer and cop careers, it looks and plays great. It's just a little hard. That's all.			"

The story mode is just what you need it to be, choose being a cop or a racer, crazy chases, wrecks or just good old racing with long tracks spanning miles on end. The physics aren't as realistic but this is an arcade game, a great one at that.			"

												This game has terrific graphics and cars, and, unlike some games, the cars actually have their real life badges. You take a gamble with the price but it's worth it. I've played a totall of 36 hours (so far) and I'm already extremly good at driving. The original controls are a bit strange but it's easy to change them to your liking. Seacrest County is a large county with winding roads that take you through Wintery Mountains, Burning Deserts, Rich Beaches, Beautiful Lakes, and much more. With two careers (SCPD & Racer) avaliable simultaneously it provides hours of fun and some of the world's best cars (Including my favorite, the Nissan GT-R SpecV) from the Ford Crown Victoria to the Bugatti Veyron and more between. Cars are relatively easy to unlock and, instead of buying them, you just unlock them at stages based on the bounty you earn. One of the best racing games with realistic roads where no two sections are the same.			"

												So many freaking delays, try to load the game up and it spends forever telling you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I was already out of patience with it, when my steering wheel controller did not work (kept acting as if something was pressed when it wasn't - yet I was just using that controller in another game just fine) I did fix that, but then I became aware of the way the game made me feel also.So, you get past all those annoying long intro cutscenes, it tries to make you log into autolog, it tells you every time to play need for speed world, then it lets you finally go to the menu. Then you click start and there's a long cutscene, and at the beginning of every level it does this:     Loading for longer than it probably should     Cutscene with a button on the bottom saying ENTER - skip     Press enter, buttom of screen changes to SKIPPING, cutscene continues to play     Game finally startsBut the problem is - I've only just started playing it and I am TERRIBLE at it, I haven't played a NFS in ages, so I need some practice to do okay at it - but every time I fail and want to retry I have to reload the game, and then watch the cutscene that pretends like it's skipping.If this frustrates you to read it, skip it!

												First off, this is a Criterion driving game.  If you've never played any of Criterion's driving games, go buy Burnout Paradise Ultimate Box right flippin' now.  Frankly, it sets the standard for fun, open world driving.This continues the trend.  The graphics are beautiful, the cars are awesomly rendered and the physics are such that they're pretty realistic but not so much that it prevents beginning players from enjoying the game.The cons: Fun single player game, but multiplayer suffers because this game is four years old and everyone has moved on to different games.  Unless you have a group of dedicated friends who will play this with you on the regular, you're going to be pretty lonely.			"

												I mean this game looks great, but there is no storyline or goal, just some arbitraty level system represented by a wanted level, i almost wish it were just called driver level since wanted level doesn't seem to have any effect on anything. The driving mechanics are so bad, basically if you want to garuantee a win you just sit in second place until the very end when you just use nitrous and win. The driving feels very soft and detached from whats actually going on. No matter what car you drive you still end up drifting literally every single corner, Even though its marketed as a racing game I think the older need for speed games and even non racing games like grand theft auto have better racing mechanics. I don't know why Need for Speed decided to get rid of one of the fan favorite selling points of the game which was the customization. This honestly feels like a super watered down and bare bones version of need for speed most wanted, except you can use emps for some reason. Also there's no manual shifting mode, any game marketed as a racing game should have a manual shifting mode. You can win almost every single race just by hold right trigger and essential riding every single corner to avoid having to brake to lose speed. Maybe i'm being too critical because I'm still waiting for Forza to show up on steam, but if i could at least play the 2005 need for speed most wanted or underground i would be happy.But for 4 bucks if it keeps you entertained for an hour i guess its alright deal.

												Is this a really good NFS? Nah, wouldn't say so. But it is enjoyable enough to recommend it for a steep discount.There's not really a lot here when you take a closer look at it.There's the ""career"" modes, in which you either drive as a racer or a cop. Both are linear event after event modes. You can choose which race you wanna tackle next (to an extent), but ultimately it doesn't make a difference, because you regularly get new equipment and cars...I still haven't found much differences there. The cars pretty much all handle similarly. Some are worse than others though, feel like cruise ships, not sports cars. But if you're not taking on a higher ""league"" of races, don't bother. Driving cop cars is exactly the same, but you can't seem to switch off the red/blue lights, so prepare for an epileptic episode or at least severe sight issues. Driving a car at 300 km/h at night while it rains is considerably more difficult as a cop car.The modes: Pretty much all the modes suck hard, apart from the name giving ""Hot Pursuit"", in which you race against 3 to 7 other racers while cops are chasing you (or you try to bust those racers). This mode is fun as a cop and frustrating as a racer (but still the best one). The other modes are simple races, duels, time trials or gauntlets (time trial with cops chasing you) on the racer side and time trials or single vehicle intercepts as a cop. The cop time trials are extremely simple, even if you crash like 10 times (you get a time penalty doing so) and the intercepts are just insanely annoying, ranging from very simple to extremely difficult. Racers changing course while EMPing you, so you have no idea where they are going, racers not taking damage even if you ram them full speed...things like that. Annoying.The game's AI is non existant, it's simply a rubber band drive. You can never be more than a 2 or 3 seconds ahead, they're always coming back. That in turn also means you can mostly catch up, unless the game doesn't want you to. I've been chasing a racer for 2 minutes straight, not getting any closer, despite good driving. Add to that the CONSTANT cut scenes. Most of which you cannot skip, and if you can skip them they still play for several seconds. Getting a new rank, new equipment, new cars, starting a race, meeting a cop unit, wrecking another racer or cop, getting wrecked...*sigh*. Especially annoying is that when you land a spike strip, an EMP or wrecking a car, etc. the game plays a cut scene in the middle of the race and takes control of your car away from you, the race is not paused, however, so you have to rely on the AI to navigate you through the race, which doesn't always works and is just jarring in general. However, you can also cheat the system by forcing a cutscene before you get wrecked.All in all you can get to level 20 as a racer and as a cop. Why you would do that? No idea. I've gotten to level 13 on average until there were no more unlocks or new races, so all you can do is repeat older races I think. But getting to level 20 is just superflous. It's an ok game if you want arcade racing, but it's not a very great title.			"

												this game is pretty cool to play! it has nice cars and has a great area to explore. the challenges seem way too easy to beat and you'll probably get gold everytime. unlocking cars dosent take that long. during my 9+ hours, i got atleast 30+ cars both cops and racers. the action with the gadgets are awesome to use and none are overpowered in any way. there are upgrades to those gadgets but arent that game changing. mp is cool and always fun to play. recommended if u have friends!tbh this isnt worth $20 but you should get it now because i dont think the winter sale will give a discount like it again			"

												Just got it a day ago. I honostly love playing as a cop and ♥♥♥♥ing other ♥♥♥♥♥es up. Best race game ever! I played the other hot pursuit on the gamecube when i was a kid. The other one didn't have a nitro boost, but im glad some changes didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the badass gameplay. The only sidedown about the game is the online lobbies, they don't fill as quick, so you need many friends to play. Though it could be since i can only play the beginner modes. Therefore i rate this game 9/10			"

Get in! SEE, how fast i am! Oh, crap, cops! Take them out! It's been a long time since NFS HOT PURSUIT released. Full of memeries. As a NFS fan, I've finished all the journeys of UNDERGROUND and HOT PURSUIT and MOST WANTED. I have to say appraciate, for years of companion. Actually. I've  played NFS HOT PURSUIT for a really long time. I've got HOT PORSUIT on EA Origin and Valve Steam, and mostly I played the game on Origin. Now you cannot sign in Autulog Hot Porsuit(changing avatar, etc), it's said that only new NFS(Most Wanted, Rivals, etc)'s Autolog is still working. I don't know whether it's a lie.Anyway, HOT PURSUIT is not like simulator mode games, definitely not. But you'll like it, for I've played this game again and again over than hundred hrs(Origin edition).			"

												EA games has crapped a Horse turd here, first let me say beautifual graphics and easy game play, now off to the bad, you need a EA sports account to play online with friends easy? No..., a lot of graphic settings are unavailiable, when you get in the game.. easy fix.. No unavaiable, then it sucks you in as going to be fun Newwwp again.. it is, till you progress, everything you have proquired along the way.. then is taken away from you, the further you go the worse it gets, the more i aquire the worse it gets, its a never ending battle, if i could take back the gift as i sent to a friend and get my money back i would, and spend it somwhere useful			"

												I have a Logitech E-X5D12 PS3/Wireless racing wheel. Not a great wheel by any standard, but this is the first racing game I've come across since I purchased it that I could not get configured with the game. The game itself I found rather boring when compared to the Grid / Dirt / Most Wanted / Flatout and Grand Turismo series and Wreckfest. The cars just seemed sluggish, with unrealistic turning (using my xbox controller of course). I got it on sale, but honestly, after one round, I know I'd never pick it up again. There's just too many alternatives to choose from. Sorry EA/Dice, but you continually disappoint me.			"

												Wow!!! What can I say?  This is one full-on arcade racer.  Need for Speed Hot Pursuit bears all the hallmarks of a Criterion Games racer :  - Eye watering visuals  - Brain melting speed   - Nerve shattering crashesSo far I have found this racer very (very) enjoyable.   It's not the hardest arcade racer out there, but I'm not very far in so maybe I just need to give it more time.  However it is thoroughly enjoyable.  The drift mechanics can feel a little floaty at the beginning, but once you master them they give a very satisfying drift that makes you feel like the proverbial Dominic Toretto.  Most racers punish you if you crash, this game rewards you in spades.  The weighty impact of each crash is so satifying that you keep doing it just to jolt your nerves one more time.I'd forgotten how much I love the 'Cops and Robbers' game play of the Hot Pursuit games and this does not disappoint in this area.  Being the criminal means you get to show those law enforcing numties what proper high speed driving looks like and as a cop you get to bring those cocky lawbreaking scumbags to a sticky end.  If you liked the Burnout, Need for Speed or Flatout games then this racer will hit all your sweet spots.  If your new to arcade racers get it anyway and you'll instantly become a super fan.I'd say that at £14.99 this game represents very good value for money, but at £2.99 (the current sale price Feb 2017) buying this game is a no-brainer.  Do it! You owe it to yourself.  Finally you can release all that road rage that's been building up inside you during the grinding commutes to and from work.			"

												Need for speed - Sellout Edition maybe.  Once upon a time NFS involved a bit of acrade-style racing that was fun.  These cars handle more like hovercraft:  If you see it, you WILL hit it.  They decided to add the popular 'it takes time to turn your steering wheel' mechanic, which, let's face it:  Is completely bonkers for a decent racing game.I only played the police side of it, so maybe the actual 'racing' part is better, but...  I doubt it.  The physics just don't seem to support the ability to actually turn without 'drifing'.  Even at speeds greater than 150 in cars that are built to add down-force, the game designers seemed to think that drifting will still make you turn better.In other words, the game tries too hard to be 'realistic' with it's steering/physics system while ignoring the effects of downforce on cornering, to the point that it becomes pointless to play.  Then they added a drifting mechanic to try to make up for it, which is completely unrealistic.			"

NFS:HP excells in one area and one only: looking pretty. From a gameplay perspective this game is on the same level of most generic f2p online flash games. The cars' behaviour comes across as unrealistic and you can barely notice any difference in the handling of different car models. On top of it all NFS:HP has an annoying rubberband AI that negates any advantage you get by driving well.			"

												I had high hopes for this as I loved the original Hot Pursuit back in the day. As comparisons go to it precursors this doesn't disappoint its grahpically stunning and plays well as a race game. If you're more acustom to the burnout series then you'll be at home with the controls although the game might feel a tad linear by comparison. I've yet to check out the online gaming portion which seems to have been pushed hard in this version (personally I get no fun from competition, eliteism isn't one of my traits). The skill level seems set just right, I just had to resist the temptation to try and ram competitors off the road as all that seems to accomplish is damage to your car, I'm assuming when in pursuit mode this will come into its own. My hat goes off to Criterion who seem to manage good performance without the need for 10 times the spec of the console version, I imagine good coding is the name of the game here, too many games seem to be lazy on this and require next gen pc specs to accomplish what a console already can. In conclusion a good game providing you're not too used to the freedom of Burnout Paradise.			"

The game itself is good with a campaign including various cars, and you can play as a racer and the cops, The cars are the same except for the colours and flashing lights.The best part of this game is the freeroam part, you can do this whenever you like and with any car you have unlocked. It is fun because you can go top speeds along the freeways or just slowly crusie. However there is only civilian cars that drive pretty slowly and there is no competition. It would be nice for a cop car to chase you if were caught speeding.			"

												Can't skip any cutscenes and it took me at least 20 minutes to actually get to play the GAME. If you have a really short attention span like me, this is just going to put you in a bad mood.Gameplay isn't too bad, but not good enough to change my mind.			"

												I enjoy an action-based racing game once in a while, the NFS games were always fulfilling that desire of mine. Until now. Hot Pursuit was really promising, since the last NFS I played was the first Most Wanted. Now you could play as cops as well, which sounded to me that this game would be everything Most Wanted was and more. Sadly, that's not true.The first thing that really bugged me was the whole online-registration thing. My friends don't play this game and I don't want to be forced to be able to use the online-functions. After that you jump right into the game. You choose an event, you race it and so on. Your first car is already a Porsche, you can choose it's color and that's it. Thorughout the first 2 hours of this game you have already unlocked so many cars, it's almost ridiculous. There's no ""career mode"", where you save up to buy a car or to tune your car the way you want it. You just get the cars. And what's the point of taking pictures of your car and sharing them with your friends when you can't make your car look unique?It's sad, the racing part is actually quite fun but without the whole ""open world"", career-thing that makes you value your cars, it just feels like a series of test-drives, since I really don't see how you would do 2 races in a row with the same car, when you unlock a new car every race.I know that you will actually pick your cars carefully later on in the game, it's just that it's more fun imo to have those few cars you bought and specialized to chose from rather than every car that's in the game.I really did expect a lot more from this game and I can't see why they left out the whole car-specializing and open world part. The best thing in Most Wanted was, after finishing a race being chased by cops, that you would have to lose the heat even after the race. Now it just stops when you cross the finish line. Sad.Edit: Of course it feautres the EA-exklusive unskippable ""cutscenes"" and player unfriendly gameplay mechanics as well as the ridiculously overdriven sound ""effects"". But hey, at a Lamborghini exklusive event you can choose between 3 almost identical Lamborghinis! That's something, right?Edit 2: I'm definitely done playing this game for good. I just had a race, where the last part is almost one long straight road, I escaped from a crash site where every other racer-car was standing still, I put on the turbo, continued with 400 km/h and powered the turbo again for the last few meters and suddenly two race-cars dash in front of me and I end up being 2nd. I don't know why but EA seems to be in charge of how a race should develop and result. There's no way another car would have been able to come even close to me when they all just had been in an accident.			"

												The main issue I have with this game is that it is focused on on-line gaming. I suppose that the game was alright durign the few months after its launch at end of 2010. There are not so many players around 2014, I am afraid. The game makes matchmaking even more difficult than what it should: you need to chose between game type and car type before you enter a lobby. There is no indication how lively online gaming is, although I have been able to play a single game. On a saturday afternoon.As far as the single player campaing go, the game is somewhat boring. I played the game with an XBox360 pad and I can tell you I have not let the throttle go. It is an arcade racer. You start with already fast cars, taking many bends at 200 kmh, and cars only get faster, or harder to control. That means that many bends are wide enough, so the challenges end up being the off-road sections. It looks like there is some sort of mechanism to correct your direction too.Campaign setup is devoid of interesting things to do. You play both a lifeless policeman and a lifeless racer, with only a mention that police forces try to stop the racers at Seacrest County. There is no story of any sort, not even the dumbest story you could think of (a la NfS: Underground 2). The reward system also gets into my nerves, as almost any race you run is followed by a 20 to 60 second slideshow showing you your rewards. Rewards that you do not care because there are so many of them, and many are just the ones that you forget of next race. I have been driving a new car each race.On the technical side, I would have expected some sort of antialiasing in the game. The game is OK by being a port from Xbox360/PS3, with graphics matching what you can do on the consoles. That means, graphics show its age if you know where you are looking for.Game requires an Origin account for its online component. The original Autolog website is gone, replaced by a NFS:Rivals only website. I wonder how much life is left for this game, as EA is notorious of turning off the multiplayer servers after a while.So, if you get some friends playing this game, you might enjoy far way better than a solo player than me.

												Controls are very awkward and take A LOT of getting used to. Cars don't respond very well and even on a high end PC, this game runs at a max of maybe 45FPS. This is saying a lot since I can run a current game such as Battlefield 4 at an average of 60FPS whereas a racing game (developed by the same studio in 2010) only runs at 45FPS.

												Need for speed - Sellout Edition maybe.  Once upon a time NFS involved a bit of acrade-style racing that was fun.  These cars handle more like hovercraft:  If you see it, you WILL hit it.  They decided to add the popular 'it takes time to turn your steering wheel' mechanic, which, let's face it:  Is completely bonkers for a decent racing game.I only played the police side of it, so maybe the actual 'racing' part is better, but...  I doubt it.  The physics just don't seem to support the ability to actually turn without 'drifing'.  Even at speeds greater than 150 in cars that are built to add down-force, the game designers seemed to think that drifting will still make you turn better.In other words, the game tries too hard to be 'realistic' with it's steering/physics system while ignoring the effects of downforce on cornering, to the point that it becomes pointless to play.  Then they added a drifting mechanic to try to make up for it, which is completely unrealistic.			"

												It's a fun, well coded game that offers challenge to fit anyone, provided they are good enough at racing.  You may find this game too difficult at times, though not so if you are 'perfect' and never crash (due to the scripted opponents).  The sounds are pretty good (definately OK here), and the music is 'just ok' - unless you're a kid these days, it most likely won't appeal too much to you (there is a song by Black Rebel Motorcycle Band in here though so take what I say with a grain of salt).  Shut the music off an leave your own playlist on Winamp or media player for windows if it bothers you - easy enough fix.  Opponents are scripted to give constant challenge.  There is no 'easy' 'medium' or 'hard' settings - with which brings me my biggest issue.  I *LOVED* playing need for speed III hot pursuit on my old pentium 2/3 computers back in the end of the 90s when I was underage in High School, and I bought this game on sale (so I can't complain that much) to see if it had the same flair.  This game will definately fit the bill if you like racing games, but I Implore to you as a potential customer that it IS NOT the same game.  I don't know what's happened to EA over the last few years, but they don't make the same games they used to.  Seems like the last 10 years, they have been changing the way opponents are scripted to 'race' with you, so that to always provide challenge, they always 'keep up'.  This RUINS the feeling of accomplishment, entirely.  If they're always right behind, you'd think that'd keep me on my toes, NO, that just keeps me crashing :x   This is not the GAMES fault, it's the fault of the human mind (that's also why police chases work, and this is HOT PURSUIT so this could have entirely been planned).  I am not just talking about police chases.  I still recommend this game entirely, wholeheartedly.  Just keep in mind when you buy this that the opponenets will go a set speed when ahead of you, and boost like crazy to keep up to you.  Top Gear 1 and 2 for the SNES *DID THE SAME THING* I am not kidding one bit - and we all loved those games (if we were old enough, I was a pre-teen for those).  There should be more of a difficulty curve, not just one-difficulty-fits-all.  Even easy-medium-hard, with set speeds for the opponents.  Let me disable BOOST if I'd like some non-boost racing.  I'd also whole-heartedly recommend a controller with analog capability not just a digital d-pad thing, as it'll be almost required to do well here.  The keyboard can be very unforgiving, but not so much so that, within an hour or two of play, that I had any trouble getting the Porsche 911 *cough* COMET *cough* around the countryside (NOT A TRACK, REAL ROADS) without an issue at top speed.  The cars handle with fairly adequete realism and also are rather forgiving when going a little 'too fast'.  There is a bit of variety here also, including desert, beaches, mountains, snow, highways (2, 4, and 6 lane highways divided and nondivided) and red-wood forest.  A few real-life vehicles are also added in for AI traffic on top of the real vehicles already present in this game for racing.  Damage is superficial and arcade-ey in nature & as such, you won't be bending your car in half.  Damage is shown by marred body panels and broken lights, and your head lights will randomly cut out while driving at night.  A bad enough head-on-collision or contact with the barrier going fast enough will show a cut-scene of your 'wonderful' ability on the road, and set you back several seconds of racing, though it is not an impossibly long time that you cannot catch up (usually).  If you are looking for a well-polished racer for SINGLEPLAYER racing, this is the game for you.  If you are looking for multiplayer, you'll have to look only to EA's newest offering as multiplayer only lives about 2-3 years AT MOST on EA's newest titles.  This is one of the serious, most deal-breaking cons there is to this game, is that EA's servers are required by the game to do multiplayer (you must log in to save).  I shouldn't have a gimped product so soon after release, especially with these financially hard times today, and that goes for anyone who buys most of their games from the bargain bin like I do.  Let us atleast host/join user-servers after you shut the official ones down.  Don't MAKE me log into ANYTHING (I don't care about cloud-saving, it's a GAME, not my job!) to play singleplayer and save.  I LOATHED GTA IV for this aspect and actually had to mod THAT game to let me save without logging in (even though I purchased it more than once for myself legally) simply because it was an annoyance.  I could go on for hours, but don't let the ranting bit fool you, it's still a fun and well-polished game.  Don't hate me if it becomes obvious that there are flaws and programming gimmicks in this game, however, with the AI always keeping up and the autolog fahl-dee-rahl.  Still way better than Rockstar games DRM-hassled lousy console-ported GTAIV/EFLC with all it's login-required-rubbish.  It's a game, I don't want to have to LOG IN, might as well just say 'anything you do in this game can be used against you in the court of law', to all the customers. I will make it a point, that if you just want to race a Porsche or other supercar around the roads, it allows you to do so without logging in though you'd have to unlock other cars 1st.  That is about all I can do on mine here, as the game is just too hard with my PTSD to get into most times.Pros:Hours of Arcade Racing fun!Fancy GFXFancy SFXAlways stays fairly challenging no matter what your skill level.Real Road Racing, not closed, unrealistic tracks.Cons:No real damage, if that's what you're into.Opponents scripted to always keep up, they're always right behind you no matter what (that's a game-breaker for me).For me this ruins racing, as it also takes away your sense of accomplishment (until the race is over if you win).Menu can be confusing to some or takes atleast some getting used to, and AUTOLOG, or any LOG INs outside of multiplayer is irritating and invasive as a means of copy-protection masquerading as a feature.  Leave this OUT, EA.Unskippable cut scenes, that's a pain.  DON'T EVER FORCE CUT SCENES, that just sucks.Opponents use boost ALL the time, or atleast on a consistent basis.  What if I want to disable BOOSTING on my game, what, I can't shut that off or toggle it out for my game session?  Music is OK if you're a teenager.  I am not into that type of music, nor is anyone that I know.  Where'd they find this stuff anyways?  Any way would could stream a few real-stations in-game (without using our own media player in this OS)?  I am sure some stations would like that publicity/promotion.Good game not free of caveats, still recommend if you like EA's products, just know what you are in for, that is all.Real opponents next time, EA.  This was a game-breaking thing for myself but that's just me.			"

												Pros: Game is so much fun.  You feel the panic when a cop is right behind you.  The graphics are awesome, giving you a true sense of speed.  If you plan on playing alone, I recommend.Cons: No local LAN support.  You need to connect to the EA servers even if you want to compete with someone within your own home.  Connecting to outside servers is difficult with need for firewall exceptions and funky port forwarding.  Poor EA server uptime and speed.  This makes it dead for LAN parites.  Ironically, EA touts ""player connectivity"" as one of hte key features, but tries to reinvent shared gaming by routing them through their hub... requiring you to register an account with them.  Controls are very clunky.  If you're interested in racing against friends, pass on this and look for a better game elsewhere.			"

												Controls are very awkward and take A LOT of getting used to. Cars don't respond very well and even on a high end PC, this game runs at a max of maybe 45FPS. This is saying a lot since I can run a current game such as Battlefield 4 at an average of 60FPS whereas a racing game (developed by the same studio in 2010) only runs at 45FPS. Not to mention that it's a small download from Steam THAT HAS A LAUNCHER. 20GB DOWNLOAD IN THE LAUNCHER. Plus you have to make a NFSWorld account and Final Verdict: WOULD NOT RECCOMEND. Don't buy this unless you a re looking to 1) Take up space on your hard drive. Or 2) Play with friends (even then I wouldn't reccomend this! Buy the Crew for gods sake!).Pro Tip: This game can be found for free on EA's site or on Origin			"

												For people who like a classical game, this game is good, but for me isn't because there is no customization, no story and I can't buy cars, only unlocking them after races and I don't like the graphics too much, I mean other old nfs games have better effects...			"

												So, what's wrong with this game? Well a good number of things really. While the driving physics aren't as bad as Shift's failure at creating a Gran Turismo clone, it feels like you're driving a dump-truck with all the cars I've tried so far. Also, EA care to explain why I have to unlock five cars before I get one that's even marginally better in any of its stats than the starting Boxster? While we're on the topic of game mechanics, I'm not entirely sure why exp summaries are skippable, but the ""unlocked new car"" spash screen hangs around for almost ten seconds. Not to mention that basically none of the cutscenes are skippable. This said, if this were all that was wrong with the game, I might not be writing this review right now. My main problem with the game is the fact that it often feels more like a sales brochure than a game. It lists not only the cars irl price (while the game doesn't use any sort of in game currency. This is strictly letting you know how much the car costs ""should you want to buy a real one"") but also the car's ♥♥♥♥ING MARKETING TAGLINE. You might as well subtitle the game with ""EA Sells Out (again)"" in some flashy font. Don't get me wrong, I love the Need for Speed games to death. I've logged countless hours in many games old and new from the series, and honestly, maybe that's why I can't stand this incarnation of Hot Pursuit. It's because, save for a few exception, Need for Speed is a great franchise and I know for a fact that EA and certainly Criterion can do better (look no further than Most Wanted 2012, which at this point I feel may be their apology for making Hot Pursuit 2010). Look. I won't slam EA and Criterion any more than I have to here. I'm writing this to let you know that there are better Need for Speed games out there. If you were thinking of buying this on sale like I did (and yes, it wasn't even worth the sale price of $3.99 CAD) go download NFS No Limits on your phone. It's free and even being a mobile game still manages to be better than this installment in the franchise. Just as a side note: I'm not the kind of person who writes reviews slamming games just for kicks. I would love to be writing a review right now saying that this is my new favourite game and I'll surely be getting hundreds of hours out of it, but sadly, I can't. This is my first ever review simply because I bought a game from a series that has so often delighted me only to see that series butchered and abused in a way that just makes me angry. I frequently go out of my way to defend the Need for Speed games from people who hate on EA as a whole, saying that it's the series that they so often do right. Well not this time. If you're looking for a greating driving game, it won't be found here.			"

												I have nothing better to do with my time, so here is a review for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.I'm not gonna lie, but the gameplay is actually pretty decent, you play as a cop driving in your Lamborghini cop car at 200 km/h smashing other cars until they get ""busted"", (which is an overstatement as their wreck of a car rolls over 5 times and off a cliff seems pretty much like murder to me) or as a racer, trying to avoid getting wrecked by the police or other cars and getting across the finish line.The graphics are pretty nice for a 2010 game, the cars look nicely detailed and the shadows and reflections look superb too, the only thing lacking is the anti-aliasing, which kinda ruins some details of the game. The driving in this game feels a bit weighted, and the handling feels like you are trying to steer a bathtub with wheels. The drifting is pretty bad, as tapping the handbrake sends you in a slight drift that sometimes can be hard to get out and send you into a car, or tapping too much or holding the handbrake sends your car spinning out. The driving only missions where you have to do nothing but drive your car to the finish are way too long and tedious, and you will probably spend most of your time doing these, as they take 4-5 minutes, and you have to do them anyway to unlock more missions. After you complete these missions, you may feel like you don't want to play anymore as you spent 5 minutes of your life just driving a god damn car like you would in real life (unless you drive into other cars and into walls), in a video game.Speaking of missions, once you play more than an hour, you have experienced pretty much all what the game offers, except if you keep playing you just earn new cars and equipment upgrades. As of right now, I have not finished the game and I probably plan on not doing so. Also another annoying feature is the rubber banding of the police and racers. You can be as far ahead as you want, but the police seem like they have quad turbos with boost installed and will always catch up to you.The crashes in this game are pretty spectacular, as the game is made by the Burnout developers, Criterion Games and I feel like this is probably the best selling point of the game right here. If you are like me and enjoy watching cars crash in video games, then you can consider buying this game. There is nothing more satisfying than sending a car roll down the road and seeing the heap of metal stop dead, especially if the car costs more than your house.I have only played one game of multiplayer and I have probably experienced half of it. I only found one person (I am from Australia) and I was convinced that he was a hacker. I played as police, and he ignored all my roadblocks and spike strips and literally passed through them like a ghost. I also think that he was using speed hacks and was pretty much untouchable as he zoomed by me. This part is probably why I am going to not recommend this game.  In the start of the game, it asks you to sign up or login into an existing EA account. Me being stupid, I put in the wrong email associated to the account and it made me an entirely new account with an extremely generic name that I cannot change the name of. So every time I want to play this game, it always asks me to sign up or sign in and I cannot get around that other than putting in a fake username and password to ask if it wants to start me offline and it bugs the hell out of me. Also I found out that it  FORCES  you to use a microphone and webcam, so they basically breach your privacy while you play. The only way around this is, is to disable them if you dont want them to be used.I alt+tab out of games alot, and for me, I found out that my fps drops significantly to about 10-20 fps if I alt+tab in any part of the game, even the unskippable intro scene (which is also annoying). I don't know if other people have these problems, but this is a heads up.Overall, the game is pretty decent, good graphics for a 2010 game, one of the best crash physics, sub-par steering and handling and if you find people in multiplayer, (which i doubt) then I hope you have a better experience than mine. This game gets really stale if you play for too long, so I recommend to play it once in a while to get your racing fix. I would probably recommend this game, but shame that these problems had to occur during my playtime.I give this game 6/10			"

												I recommend this game, but I wouldn't pay for it as of 2017.-No multiplayer.-Not as good as the older Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit(s).-It's EA, who really wants to support them these days?But-For a 2010 game, the graphics are very sharp and detailed, like, better than most newer games.  The cars literally look real. -There is a lot of basic sports cars that you can see everyday (Maybe you own one?), and then you have your super rare exotic ones.-Real Cars with great sound effects.-An awesome fast paced driving experience! A game with unrealistic, slow, boring driving, such as Grand Theft Auto V (2015), seriously could learn from this.Oh, and did I mention that this game will properly support ultrawide 21:9 during the races, even though it was released back in 2010? Yeah it does, and its pretty immersive making the experience that much better.			"

												Runs like♥♥♥♥♥on a computer that is well within the tecnical specs specified in the description (even on lowest settings). There are massive lag spikes, it's fps in generally terrible and the forced 'bs' walkthroughs of every feature under the sun is ridiculous. The UI is badly designed and the sticks (on a crontroller) don't opperate it. The driveing is unintuitive and boring, with ridiculous handeling (even for an arcade-style racer) and the handbrake is unusable.			"
