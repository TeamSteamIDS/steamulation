												A cheap and cheerful arcade racing game based on an old iteration of the chrome engine (Call of Juarez etc.) The graphics are not the best by today's standards but the game doesn't cost much these days either. The cars are all Volkswagons, from the early eighties Golf GTi to late 90's concept, old and new Beetles are included and even the VW Camper. You can customise most of the parts, by winning races and spending your prize money, but this is not a sim. Most customisations make very little difference to performance unless they boost the BHP. It takes some practice to consistently win events and opponents are challenging but a bit stupidly rough, bashing you off the track if they can. A real bonus in a game like this is the availabilty of a cockpit view, making it more realistic and challenging. It's fun, works with a Logitech wheel, and it took me 25 hours to complete so the value can't be questioned. Worth a try if you're stuck for some racing action.			"

												GTI is a hidden gem, mostly overlooked due to is age, but don't let that age fool you, for a 10 year old game, GTI holds up extremely well. The graphics are dated but still perfectly serviceable and with some tinkering it runs flawlessly at 1080p. I was able to map all the keys to the usual racing layout on my Xbox One controller, so control wise, it felt and played great. It has a really nice array of VW cars, in  different classes, that all have a ton of upgrade options that greatly effect performance. And best of all it has awesome tracks. I really miss this era of arcade racing games when it comes to track design. Worth it at full price IMO, and during a Steam sale, this one is an absolute steal.			"

												I recently completed all of the events in this game, and I would highly recommend it. The graphics and physics are decent for the age of the game, there are many different types of events, and lots of VW's to be had. I don't remember if I got this on sale or for full price (I had it for a while before I played it), but regardless of the price it is well worth it.  Playing this on LAN works fine, we played for about an hour the other night with no problems. When you play on LAN the downside is only the stock models are available, not what you have built in the Racing Series, and I noticed the Bus is missing. In spite of this the LAN gameplay is rather fun.			"

												VOLKSWAG, VOLKSWAG EVERYWHERE.Okay, as you may seen on the teaser pictures or that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ headline of my review, this game is all about Volkswagen cars. You might think: ""ayy lamo B0R1NG!!!!111"", predjudgices aside (hope I spelt that right), This ain´t that boring at all.Let´s start with the pros:Yes, it´s only Volkswagens, but its quite a load of many different VWs. Standard cars (unfortunately no Diesels), Crazy cars no one really knows and quite a few interesting Concepts, including (my fav car of all time) the Volkswagen Nardo, both the roadster and coupé.Standard cars and no TDI Power? Standard VWs without TDI (except GTIs/Rs) are slow. But then there comes this function called Tuning.Yes, you can tune Volkswagens in their official game, in both visual and performance. Eat that, Ford Racing.Also there are some different Sceneries, e.g. My Motherland Germany (Bavaria), France, England, Sicily, Texas and an unnamed Racetrack in GB.The graphics for 2006... ehh let´s take a year off, cause the game bases on Xpand Rally from 2005, the graphics for 2005 aren´t bad at all. The textures are mostly sharp, the shader looks good and Antialiasing works. The Models aresomething between nice and meh. Most of them are pretty solid, but also have a few edges.K, now the part of things I´m not really sure about, how to rate them:The Handling model, It is a sim-cady like handling, tendency to either simulation or arcade, I´m not really sure.The handling itself is solid, but a few physic things ruin the fun a bit.E.G. Don´t jump or go Offroad. EVER. Offroad driving is.... playable, but could really be better. Jumps are the weirdest things since Goat Simulator. Both is kinda strange given that it´s base is a rally sim, In which you can jump and drive offroad without any problem.Alright, now the cons:Techland. Why did you use wrong specs for the cars? I mean, Volkswagen gives you the license and most likely wants you to display the cars like IRL. So Why? I mean, the Beetle has like 34 hp, ingame it has like double the amount stock.Or the Nardo, 600 hp IRL, ingame 350 hp. Why?The Tuning. The performance tuning is nice, better than in the latest Need for Greed. But the visual tuning is stupid.Bodykits do look quite nice on some cars, on others ugly af. I mean, okay thats standard for tuning in games.But you couldn´t let us decide what color we want on our cars? You only get pre-made Vinyls and paintings, you can´t change the color yourself, except you mess around with the template. Also the aftermarket rims. Ugly. Just. Ugly.The Cars in the Classes. So, the cars and races are sorted in classes, not like Forza in the complete Alphabet, but in weird titles no one really gets. No probl€em for me there, the problem for me are the cars in the later classes. In the last 3 or 4 classes some of the previous classes´ cars are in again, just a bit tuned up and with a painting already preinstalled.You can get some insane power out of these, but there are more than enough VWs in the World to fill every class with 5original cars.Long talk, short story. dis gaem ez kool and 4 only 5 bux tooooo. buy dis shet.

												This game deserves to be re-looked at for a  modern day seguel. I am freshly surprised  at how well controller support was done and my ability to map 3 seperate input devices a G27/CSP v1/CSS SQ all connected through USB and then be able to adjust max range and deadzones as well as linearity and FFB. The cars are quite drivable due to the great support for input devices and tons of options for replays. I am quite happy to have purchased this game and is a must buy at the $1.24 sale price. It's even more than worth the non-sale price			"

												This is the first ""racking"" game I ever bought.  Despite now owning DiRT RALLY, Assetto Corsa and Project CARS, I still come back to GTI racing.  Yes... it's an emotional attachment because it's my first ""racing"" game ever, and... I used to race VW Beetles in a couple of different disciplines, but aside from that, it really is just a good, fun, casual game.  IMO:  Worth every penny of the few dollars it (now) costs.			"

												This is a five dollar game.I'm going to begin with that.If you expect fantastic graphics and super realistic physics, you aren't going to find them here.If you expect to be able to drift a VW Bus at 150 kph like you're in Initial D, you've come to the right place.There are tons of races that you can do in career mode. You can modify and upgrade your cars to a surprising degree. The gameplay is addicting. The cars handle more like go-karts than actual cars, so feel free to slide through a corner at nearly top speed with minimal braking. Yes, the physics do get weird at times, and the visual customization kinda sucks, and you do occasionally get stuck in the barriers at times, but remember, it's a five dollar game made to advertise Volkswagen. This wasn't meant to be a super amazing game, but that's the amazing thing. It is. I've spent more time on this game than I ever thought I would. I keep playing it even after I've beaten it.Please, give this game a chance. It's worth it. "

												I am very impressed with this game.  If you're looking for a low-cost, old school, arcade-type racer that has steering wheel support, look no further.  I have a generic steering wheel (an old TSW2) that hasn't been directly supported for years, now.  But it works great with this game, so I'm sure it will work with about any wheel.I'm a firm believer that racing games should be played using a steering wheel, even arcade racers.  Never understood when those in the game community say that arcade racing games should be played with a gamepad controller.  Arcade racing games started in the arcades and they all had steering wheels.  Bottom line: Great fun for minimum cost.			"

Need For FahrvergnügenFun, straight racing game.  All of the cars are all Volkswagons.  The drifting feels arcade-perfect.You can purchase parts to upgrade your cars.  Very Gand Turismo-esque.  Your car can get damaged and you can pay for repairs between races.  So far to me it seems that the damage only effects the look of your car.  Pity it doesn't effect performance.The music is very Euro-techno.  If you have ever used an Amiga computer and enjoyed tracker mod music, this game's music is very much like that; but 16-bit in stead of 8-bit.  Nice, but I have not heard a large number of music tracks so far.I've only played it for a few hours so far but I am really enjoying it.  When you get into the 2nd racing tier the challenge really kicks in.  For the price it was a no-regret / no-brainer.Pros:+ Decent (previous-gen) visuals.  Crank up all the graphics settings+ Great euro-techno music+ Arcade Handling+ Behind the wheel camera view option+ Challenging tracks with some sharp turns+ Upgrade your car's performance and appearance with money earned from races+ Inexpensive+ Herbie the Love Bug is an AI opponent (unofficially)+ It's fun!Cons:- Does not use XInput - use analog emulation on your Steam Controller- Only on tracks.  No street racing or cops- Upgrade options could be deeper.  No tires to buy.  Paint jobs limited set number of presets.- No rear-view mirror or look-back button- Damage model does not affect performance or handling- AI racers are kinda stupid.			"

												GTI Racing is a game where you race variants of the VW vehicles that's GTI, from the Bettle to Golf, and more. There are variety of courses, but some are simply running the same course in reverse, or have a slightly variant route. You can also spend some of your earnings to improve your vehicle in various ways, from improved ECM to racing tires, from improved exhaust to turbocharger. This is an arcade racer, where the idea is not to make mistakes and still go fast. Graphics are decent, but that's all. It's an arcade racer, and a budget title. You can find better racing games cheaper.			"

												All around fun little racing game. Has around 70 single player races (which can take around 6 or 7 hours), and has around 30 or so volkswagon cars. The cars are in different catregories by how powerful they are, so if you want a nice fast car, it will take a while.There are some little glitches I found, not game breaking but they are still annoying at times when they do happen. First glitch, is when you drive fast into a barrier. If you do so, you will get stuck in the wall, but good thing there is a reset button (R) on the keyboard. Next one, is kind of a glitch, or maybe it is just really weird. When you try to cut corners on some of the tracks, your car will jump up and spin around, but luckily most of the time you will just end up facing the way you wanted to go.There is multiplayer, I have seen a few people on it, but don't expect there to be a whole lot of people playing this 10 year old game.Also, there is no controller support, so if you were hoping to use your wheel or controller then you probably shouldn't pick this game up if you do not like using the keyboard for racing games.

												This game is like getting one of the racing giants for cheap. GTI Racing has a realistic experience that is in my opinion just as good as NASCAR,F1,Gran Turismo,Forza,GRID,and other racing sim giants. People tend to call it an arcade racer based on graphics alone,which they aren't the BEST honestly,like their better than the screenshots would make it seem,they have reflections and shadows,decent plant life and city enviroments,good car models,not QUITE as good as like a Gran Turismo game that's $60 or something,but if your like me and couldn't care less if it's ""realistic"" as long as it's not PAINFUL to look at or anything,then you should really appreciate this game. If your willing to suspend disbelief and cut the game some slack since it's only $5,the graphics and in-depth customization as well as physics will be a pleasent surprise.The car selection is pretty good,the cars appear in the dealership every 2 championships or cups or series' or whatever,their in basic levels. Standard being the first,and Extreme being the final level you get right before you finish the game. The cars get better each level,but the stats CAN vary,so i advise looking at the stats of a car before you buy to make sure your getting the biggest bang for your buck. Their always in the same price range,you aren't gonna pay like $3,000 for a car in the $7 level or anything. The game never says $ by the way,it just says ""credits"". Cars can range from the famous 2005 Golf GTI,to several variations of the ""bug"",to the somewhat aggressive Golf 3/4 (my personal favorite),to even some of the most obscure Volkswagen models! The car variety had me thoroughly impressed.As for tuning,i haven't poked around with the other stuff,since with some basic training and a few practice runs in the car test mode,i was able to drive the default setup just fine,but i advise setting car height to ""high"". Having it on Low or Medium never gave me a noticeable stat boost,though it DID stop me dead in my tracks if i even TOUCHED a little piece of grass,but with high you still get the same amount of grip,offroad terrain can't stop you,great top speed and decent acceleration. If you buy the most expensive suspension kit,you also gain access to ""very high"",which is even better.The races take place in a few main locations: Bavaria Germany,Texas USA,""British Race Track"",Paris France,and Italy. Bavaria tends to have a rainy forest enviroment,with an occasional coastal cruise overlooking the ocean. Italy tends to take place mostly on boardwalks and beach roads. Texas is in nothin' but desert,with many races sending you on soaring jumps between the dunes,Paris will have you going through small towns,winding country mountain roads,and most of all,cobblestone paths for some reason. And finally ""British Race Track"",by far my favorite,can range from a dirt ring for you to drift around to an actual speedway with winding turns,resembling a road track like in NASCAR and other motorsports.Races are usually just that,races. Then there are Drift Events. if i can reccomend anything about GTI Racing,it is STAY AWAY from the drift events. I made one slip up,-20,000 points! It was IMPOSSIBLE to make that up in the short track and time given. Legal race events is ""Life in Idiot Town Simulator"" as people sillouhettes will walk out in front of your speeding vehicle blindly to brutally take away 5 seconds of time for each one you hit. Oddly enough,these are enjoyable. Cross-country event is where you go to texas and hop over the hills in a car (preferably a highly tuned one) to collect lights before your opposition get to them. Finally,drag races. Just press A when your speed meter won't go any farther. You gotta do it fast though,or else your opponent can go SOARING past. These are by far the most common later on in the career mode.Customization varies from paint jobs to wheels to body kits and wings for visual upgrades,to Engine and Suspension packages,transmission upgrades (by far the most effective),and brakes for performance. Once you buy a performance part,you can tweak it's stat boost in tuning to suit your driving style. Again,i mostly leave everything but suspension height default for best results and just make my car the highest possible. Buying the highest possible engine package will come with a lovely bonus - turbo boost! And while you might not NEED it as long as you've got one of the faster cars from the level your racing,turbo makes a MASSIVE difference. I wouldn't reccomend spending that much money on an engine package though unless there's just one car you MUST make fast to keep as long as possible. Paint jobs and rims have no real difference,though they do look great compared to the stock. Wings are rarely on any cars once you get to the higher levels,but if there's a car you like that has a decent wing,it's so satisfying to see it during a race,and it looks awesome.In the end the only issues i have had with this game is walls glitching holding my car to them where i had to press R to reset my position (though when it happens to enemy cars who can't press R,it makes the race way easier),flipping over when turning (probably something i did wrong when tuning though),and the keyboard sometimes locking up,though it's only happened twice in the 2 months i have owned this game,and i think that was mostly the keyboard's fault. So if you want a nostalgia trip to games like NFS Most Wanted,Underground,and others from that era,yet still want to be able to tune your car for the most realistic experience possible,then this is the game for you. It's like having an ENTIRE COLLECTION of racing titles for only $5! The lack of cars besides volkswagens rarely bothered me,and i was too caught up in the gameplay and thrills to notice that it's pretty much an interactive volkswagen advertisement.Another thing to keep in mind is at times the AI racers can be a bit aggressive,like trying to spin you or run you off the road,but their easy to take care of in a decently fast/powerful car,and the tiny cost of repairs FAR outweighs the satisfying SMACK their cars make when i force them into the edge of an incoming fence or building.i give this game a 5/5,even my least favorite parts of this game are funner than my favorite parts of some other games such as CS:GO. Like i said,your basically getting every possible racing game ever for $5 if you can get decent at tuning in this game. Who can beat that!? Offroad,Race Track,Demoltion Derby,Drift,this game has it all!~IsaacTheSpinosaur			"

												Set difficult to hard. Hit F1 until you're in 'cockpit view'.Enjoy. Great game, driving is so much fun and even though the grapics are bad the gameplay easily makes up for it.			"
