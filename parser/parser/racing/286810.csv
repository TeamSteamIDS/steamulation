												This open-world, third-person, post-apocalyptic driving shooter is kind of odd. It's also kind of old. This game is from the mid-'00s, and there are some issues getting it to work reliably on new systems [like it failing to save video settings after restarting, occasional crashes]. The translation from Russian is a bit rough, but overall the gameplay of driving about and shooting all sorts of things is compelling. Especially because you get to customize your rig, not just with different chassies, but within chassises. You tend to have three or so different models of cab and/or trailer to swap out, equip, and possibly even load up with cargo.Just driving along blasting hostiles is a good way to make money, also.One complaint I'd have is in a mid-late game mission you're dropped into a stationary turret to defend a base from a wave of robots. It feels mostly luck-based, and I had to mash my head against it many a time.			"

												Cheesy as hell, but a classic game that is still fun, if you don't mind driving around a lot. Very similar to the first game, Rise of Clans features more twists in the story than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. Quests usually are not more than go here, deliver thing, go there kill bad guys, or find this, but it works. Half the fun is the glitchy mess that HTA is, with terrible ai and bugged missions, but it works often enough that it's not detracting from the game.Also dosn't hurt that it's impossible to find retail.Easily worth the $6.

												Imagine a game that mix Twisted Metal and a open world game like Fallout...Is this game.You start as a vagabond that has to do missions to earn some cash and at the same time,killing enemies. The fun thing is that you can purchase parts to your dune buggy or truck,making he faster and stronger.This game has a cool soundtrack. The only problem is the cutscenes,the characters continue moving after they have talked .-.Anyway,it's recommended for Mad Max fans, Vehicular Combat games fan and even Fallout fans because this game has a bit of everything :D8/10			"

												For my opinion on Ex Machina as a whole,  check out my review for the original game as my opinion on this installment is essentially the same. It is just as fun as the original and still has its quirks. Just like the original, this game has an in-depth storyline with lots of optional side-quests to participate in, you're also filling the shoes of the charismatic protagonist Vagrant, so the story doesn't directly continue after where the first Ex Machina left off, but rather continues from a different perspective. While Meridian 113 isn't as lengthy as the original, it brings some new additions to the table and some small improvements here and there too; It also feels very fast paced when compared to the original too.New additions consist of new weapons, utilities, loot mechanics, and new vehicles to choose from during your missions, all of which add a nice refreshing touch to the game. Some of the improvements are a nice touch too such as the improved map previews and the ability to repair your vehicle on the go with scrap you acquired from the enemy you just destroyed. As already mentioned, the game still has it's quirks such as the grammatical and spelling errors caused by bad translation to English from Russian, the physics still leave something to be desired and the voice acting is still questionable, though this is only the case for a handful of characters in the game, the voice acting for Sam for example is excellent whereas One-Eyed is classic Ex-Machina voice acting. This doesn't bother me though, it's just something that gives the Ex Machina series it's charm.So all in all, if you liked the original, you will also like this. These games are worth every penny be they on sale or not, but as stated in my review for the first game, this is not a franchise for everybody, I'd still suggest giving it a try though if you're looking for something different to play. Here's hoping Targem Games are planning to develop another installment to this great franchise!			"

												Ok. This game is the worst of the two Hard Truck Apocalypse games. Granted, for $1.50 (on sale) you get what you pay for.Pros:Trucks with gunsTruck models are niceMore customizable colors for trucks and the ability to add decals (when available).Like the previous HT:A, you have easy to use driving/aiming using keyboard and mousePerks system: This is kind of a WTF. You have them, but I didn't see any way that they helped or hindered. It was never obvious.Cons:Voice acting: ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! Weird language, lack of inflection, etc.Story: Disjointed. Nonsensical. Your character is the most naive, trusting, moronic human being in the freaking planet. You are looking for some place called ""Edmonton"" for no other reason than it is there. Along the way you join forces with the obviously badguy ""Sam"" (who looks like Uncle sam). You also meet someone named ""One-Eyed"" who sounds like they are your friend, but (spoiler alert) you end up killing her because she won't give you a box of old filmstrips and she decides to attack you because you bothered to ask. So you kill her. But you seem to think that Sam is an OK guy despite threatening to kill you and wanting to find an ultimate weapon. Also, bad guys are super tough for no reason and they are ALL OVER THE PLACE. You can't even leave a town without getting blown up (seriously, it happened multiple times).Money: In the first HT:A you could actually make money trading. It made sense. Not in this one. It's cheaper to go out and kill bad guys and sell their stuff.Side quests: Like the first HT:A, they are essentially ""go here, kill this"", ""guard this slow guy"" (p.s. if you let the cargo truck die, you get a LOT more money fromt heir death drop), or ""go here, deliver this package."" After a while, I stopped doing those as there was no point.Video issues: There were options to improve the graphics, but the game would refuse to load after I upped them from ""medium"" (the default). Had to go and reverify the game files before it would load with the default graphics.If you can look past the bad voice acting, horrible story, and just random goofiness, it's an ok game. It is fun driving around blowing things up and running over pedestrians (which apparently is ok, but bumping into another vehicle will ♥♥♥♥ them off).			"

												Hard Truck is a rather old game but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. As a matter of fact it gets a lot of thing right, where other modern games fail.To get the game running you might have to run it in Compat. Mode and or delete the video directory withing the game installation directory.The gameplay is okay and the controls fluid. The quest system is a bit off and the the rather strange dialogs make sure that you don't forget about this being an east-block production.Still, Hard Truck is a game that delivers a lot of fun, especially for this price.

												Not as good as Apocalypse, but still nice. Not much maps and quests (which aren't so interesting and demanding) and overall, plot is too short in my opinion. It's very easy to die, because vehcicles have too low hp... Although, there are some new guns, cars upgrades; you can drive this small cars, which you couldn't before and there is money from destroyed enemies - that improve this game a little. Eventually, every fan of HT Apocalypse rather should play Rise Of Clans and call post-apocalyptic world of Hard Tuck to his mind!			"

												It's a trade/combat game like Freelancer, but with trucks! It is unironically one of my favorite games. A fair improvement on the gameplay of the original, although the cutscenes are still awful. In this version, you can make a respectable amount of money just blowing up other vehicles as opposed to trading, you can carry around repair parts, and you get to equip the sleeker, faster raider chasies from the otiginal. Paint and decoration give stat bonuses, etc. It's also really short, which is unfortunate. I kind of hate spending hours upgrading to the most deadly truck possible and then just smashing up against the end. This one was more abrupt than the original.As with the other one, Windows 7+ compatibility without extensive digging on a Russian forum would be really great.			"

												I have finally beat the Hard Truck Apocalypse: Rise of Clans (aka HTA: RoC and Ex Machina: Meridian 113).The impression it left me is... mixed. I'll try to keep this review spoiler-free for those who didn't have a chance to finish the game yet.In general, it retains almost all the pros of the original game (you can find the review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/themugbearer/recommended/285500), except for exploration. Here's a short version:* Truck variety and customization. Even more so with the addition of the ""light"" playable vehicles: the Scout and the Fighter.* Weapons of all sorts.* Sountrack and visuals.Now in my Hard Truck Apocalypse review I also mention the lore. I didn't have a chance to actually experience it due to me rushing towards the end of the main questline. A few reasons for that will be described further in Cons section.Before we can move on to the Cons, I must address an issue of performance. Since we all use different rigs and different configs, I do not feel like putting it into a Con section.You may just not experience what I experienced! Overall the performance of the game was great, and it runs smoothly. But then there are areas (mostly in the Jungle regions) where FPS was dropping significantly, and an attempt to change the resolution or tweak the options caused some atrocious glitches that forced me to kill the game and load it anew.Sometimes after loading a level I've been experiencing the models in the world, as well as parts of my truck, blinking in and out of existence.Another thing a HTA: RoC player should be weary of: changing the settings is not a healthy decision and may cause all kinds of problems, from FPS drops to crashing. Also the game refused to remember my preferable screen resolution so I had to go and specify it in a config file.The Cons this time around are plenty, and I will try to communicate what is wrong in my opinion:* Compared to the first game, there is less regions, and they feel smaller. All that contributes to almost any lack of exploration. The addition of treasure detector did not encourange it either.* A few additions to the arsenal, as well as the truck roster, compared to the original.* The balance issues. Compared to the first game, the trucks are easier to kill, but in return, you are also easier to kill! So many times I had to reload my last save just because I encountered a group of bandits that one-shotted me. You can call it a challenge, I call it BS. And, as a result, the boss fights, as few as there are, are infuriating.* Case in point, another disappointing last boss battle. Albeit interesting idea, still disappointing in performance.* The addition of consumables. On one hand, it's a post-apoc, so salvageable materials are a must have. On the other, in the late game the Spares consumables become obsolete due to how underwhelming their ""healing power"" is. It's easier to sell those Spares and repair your truck with the profit money than to repair yourself on the go.* Something I don't remember mentioning in the Hard Truck Apocalypse review: The English localization. It's horrible. I am Russian myself, so it pains me how the translation just butchers the language. The wording is awful. The translation is very literal, in most cases more than the others. Like this one Plasma gun that is called ""One"" in English, but ""Óдин"" (Odin, the Norse one-eyed god) in Russian. It gives me an impression that whoever did the translation, did not particularly care for the end result, to my greatest sadness.* As the result of the previous point, awkward voice-overs. I like the cuss phrases Vagrant uses in his speech, though.* Also, random errors during the loading time made me close the game and run it again so many times, it's ridiculous.Conclusion: This game feels like a ""smaller brother"" to Hard Truck Apocalypse; the tighter package reveals less exploration, quicker player progression and frustrating balance changes. It's still a good time for the fans of the series (if we ignore the possible performance issues), so if you bought HTA already, why not buy this one too? It has all the same features, and a bit more on the top.			"

												It only took me 2 days to finish the storyline which I found actually short(Half the time I was actually trading and buying and doing side quests). I haven't finished HTA since I don't want to end the game too soon. Anyways just like HTA its the same vehicle combat game rpg with trading and quests. The trucks are the same in addition to adding the scout and the fighter that you can actually drive. The paint jobs got a bit more of an upgrade giving some personality to your truck. Same weapons return just like the previous. I did enjoyed this one but like I said I was bummed that I finished it too early. The boss fights were a bit fustrating and your character tends to kill anything on his path. But hey we got a new region now in North America. But I found em a bit smaller in towns. There were some cities but they were that enough. I still recommend it if you were a fan of HTA.			"

												Hard truck apl. have a special place in my heart 4ever. Reason?Well its because it was the only game i was able to paly on my 1st PC 516mbRAM memory.When i was a kid i didnt know about internet at all. I was playing single player games and grow up with them.So... i have both Hard Truck Apocalypse and H.T.A. Rise of Clans.-Compared to 1st HTA Apocalypse wich is awesome game. I have 19 hourse in it for single player game of that time. Done all side quests and killed over 500 enemy tucks. But here in rise of clans, #1 SOTRY.... is.... hugeee trash i ever seen in single player games history!!! -_-There are only 4 MAPS in whole game! compared to 1st HTApocalypse wich is 10x bigger. Quests are all same...kill bandits,kill that,that. bah... 0 for missions.Heres a tip how to get fast money that you cant get in original HTA and in wich you had to TRADE,SELL goods for money and drive around the map for better loot and trucks.-Just take careless driver ! in statisticks! and paint your truck with MILITARY paint. and buy -2 stickrs! with -3 in total, killing enemys will drop you cash instead of goods! and trust me you dont need goods here because of 4 maps there are 4/5 small towns. In late game you will get from 20.000-80.000 credit PER 1 CHEST enemy! and most money you will get from BUGS! they will drop around 50.000-60.000 every time!So with that i finished my game with last truck and 2.000.000+ credits.And ,,final boss,, OMFG.Crash Bash have BETTER BOSSes !!!! than this trash -_OI will stop now because i am getting angry.For it full price Hard Truck Apocalypse: Rise of Clans is garbage. Wait for 85-90% discount and buy it.If i look it that way, for 1$ it is OKish !!! 7-10h game. For full price......hell no.Dear friends, go and buy Hard Truck Apocalypse Original game and then buy this on % when you want to kill some time.Thank you			"

												Fortunately, the 90's are over and that also means that wandering around on a map, cluelessly while digging your way through a lot of menus trying to figure out where exactly you are or where you are meant to go is also mostly over.Hard truck: Rise of Clans / Ex machina (I'll shorten that to HRROCEM) is a game where you drive a car. Unfortunately, the car doesn't follow the mouse (only the turret does) and this feature combined with the already clunky controls means it feels like you're piloting a remotely controlled vehicle.The graphics are nothing to wrote home about, the voice acting is horrendous, the writing is confusing but the game does have some charm. I like the way you can buy new vehicles, mount different types of guns and haul loot all over the place. Like a poor man's Freelancer set in a post-nuclear America.Unfortunately, I drove my car inside a wall and couldn't get it out any more (the 'return to road' button did nothing. In fact, many buttons that you can bind seem to do nothing. Or maybe they have been mistranslated like so many other thingsI also didn't use the quick-save ability at any point (another thing we left behind in the 90's, thankfully) so I doubt I'll be able to revert to an earlier save game.I have to say that I really like the theme but everything about this game is just subpar to the point where it just annoys me. Refund requested.Note that it ran just fine on Windows 7 64-bit for me. At least for the 30-odd minutes that I played it.			"

												Less bugs than the first game, but the story is a lot more linear and shorter.  While the first game had you running everywhere, this one teleports you even when you don't want to, like after a fight and you want to pick up the loot.Again, should keep you busy for a few hours but do not buy it for more than $2.

												Somehow this game ruined the original, despite more content. Rise of Clans is an attempt to move the game to the Americas (or at least, sorta like the Americas) and give more options, like instead of a truck, start with a smaller vehicle (such as the vehicles bandits drive in the first game). There's also more cutscenes and a bit more of a story. Unfortunately, the result is buggy, and somehow, much WORSE than the first game. Rise of Clans have you, ""The Vagrant"", on a quest to reach ""Edmonton"" in ""Le Canada"". You run into towns in your ""Scout"" (one of fast but small vehicles), and you end up fighting a lot of people here and there, as you run into ""Sam"", who then task you for some missions... The cutscenes are horrible, and the translations are just... Oh dear. People swear with expressions like ""Holy Fuel"" and ""Drill my carburetor"" (huh?)  And it's a wonder how did the voice actor actually read the lines with a straight face. It's just completely atrocious translation. Somehow the game got MUCH MUCH harder, as even on ""rookie"" level I died every few minutes, and as there is no autosave, I have to save manually QUITE often. Then my entire save profile was corrupted. Lost HOURS of progress. Also ran into a mission that's virtually impossible and it's widely reported as impossible and depends on LUCK rather than skill. Forget about this game. Play the original.			"

												I liked this game but I found the other title I own; Ex Machina to have a more substantial storyline.This game though, has a few more gameplay features.Minus for its easy-does-it translation although i acknowledge that it may be tricky to translate the original Russian dialogue.Voice acting is also quite half hearted at times but that does make some amusing moments itself.

												Seems to be a pretty wicked motor vehicle based freelancer style game. However it is not really running super well. I recommend it because it is an awesome concept.. But only if you want to stick with it you will need to go in and do a whole bunch of manual patching, which I am no longer willing to do for a game. Will check in with this again at the end of 2016 in the hope that it is patched though.			"

												What can I say about this game but, yeah, that was a game. I played form start to finished and really enjoyed it. It took me back to my Freelancer days when making money was all about trading, killing and doing missions, and there's a lot of that to go round. Once more to add, the scaling of vehicles, not just, ""Here's a new vehicle"" but, swapping out Cabs and Trunks to upgrade was fun, and arming to the teeth is also great.Also boss fights. The game didn't need them but they were in and they're great. Fun patterns to work out insted of just, hit it until it dies.The only places this game flops on is it's user unfriendliness towards modern systems, the dialouge is pretty much B-movie and if you're not a fan of games like Freelancer you're not gonig to enjoy it.Unforutnately to get it running you'll need to find a way of doing it. I found a patch but the links where it was hosted are, dead, and unfortuantely I didn't take them all. Good luck with getting it working if you decide to get it. This mod manager helps though:{LINK REMOVED}http://www.mediafire.com/download/ms2l7zakz8a9a1m/ExMachina+-+Meridian+113.7zJust download that, extract it in and the game should work better.tl;dr This is actually good, get it on sale, apply the fixes and tear up the world.
