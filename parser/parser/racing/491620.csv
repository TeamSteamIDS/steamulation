												Beeftacular is a game that I recommend because:- it has an acceptable price- it has full controller support- it is a good indie & casual- it is classic- it is difficult- it is addictive- it is a funny puzzle- it has a good concept- it has trading cardsEnjoy!			"

What is Beeftacular?Beeftacular is the second game to enter Steam by developer Retrific. Their first game, Just Get Through, was released at the end of January this year. That game was received very positively (I personally enjoyed it) and therefore I entered this game with great hopes. Obviously with its name I was expecting it to have been partially inspired by Super Meat Boy. However, to my great surprise the game was most heavily inspired by 10 Seconds Ninja (it does state this in the game description). The objective for each level is to complete it in ten seconds or less. However, the sense of reward in completing it faster makes it a worthy challenge. Each level of the game has a number of enemies and traps that have been implemented into the game to make each level a challenge.A lot of Content & Potential Future ContentThe game comes jam packed with content. There are over 100 handcrafted levels that will test even the most skilful of platformer fanatics. In addition, there is a solid level editor that is simple and easy to use. I believe that even the most novice of aspiring level designers will be able to create something that is playable. That makes the sheer amount of content available to be played here a highlight of the game. Clever Utilization of Stats and LeaderboardsThe thing that I most love about Beeftacular is the manner in which it has been developed with statistics and leaderboards in mind. Each level has an array of statistics including:•	Your time, your best time, world record, best time between you and your friends•	Global Rank•	Ranged kills (you can shoot your enemies dead which can be faster so that you do not have to go to that piece of the map)•	Ranged recovered•	Ranged combos•	Times level started and completed•	Friends completed•	Melee attack kills•	Melee/Range kill share•	Jumps, doublejumps and walljumps•	Distance travelled (in pixels)For a stathead like me this is a dream. Not only does it encourage me to get the most efficient and fastest time but it inspires me to see how I can improve in a number of different areas. This is exactly the type of statistics system that I’ve been wanting in a game like this. It is very intelligent game design that engages the player beyond the straight up level system.Controls WellOf course, arguably the single most important component of any platformer is whether or not it controls well. When a platformer plays poorly it will instantaneously deter the player from playing the game. This is because it means that the player will rarely be ever to complete the game the way in which it was intended to be. Their results will be slower and far less accurate than desired. This demotivates the player. However, thankfully in the case of both of Retrific’s games to date – including Beeftacular – the game controls so smoothly that it is easy to see where you are improving. It also means that there are no times where deaths and incompletions feel as though you have been cheated. CustomizationOne of the cooler aspects of the game is that there have been game skins incorporated into the game. These can be unlocked as players’ progress. The first skin that I unlocked was ‘sponge.’ These skins, obviously, transforms the way the game looks. If you’re not into blood, then you can change the theme to something different.The colour splatter left throughout each level makes the game worth playing again. Not only will you get an opportunity to get quicker times but the levels themselves can get particularly messy. Painting each level is a lot of fun in and of itself.Is it Steamified?Beeftacular is almost Steamified to the max. The aforementioned level editor is founded on the Steam Workshop feature. There are 35 Steam achievements. The game utilizes the Steam Leaderboards system. The only thing lacking, as of writing, are Steam trading cards and Retrific has promised that they are incoming as well.VerdictRetrific is fast becoming one of my go-to developers when I want great platformer action. Beeftacular is a well-developed game that is worthy of your time and effort. It is silky smooth and has had a lot of thought put into it beyond simple level design. With the significant amount of release content as well as the implemented level editor you’ll be set for hours of enjoyable content.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

												Beeftacular is challenging and polished platformer with puzzle elements, where you have to beat each stage within a limited time (usually 10 seconds, sometimes longer). After completing all basic levels on classic ""experienced"" difficulty I can fully recommend this game, especially for ""fiero"" (hard fun) lovers. If you like 10 Second Ninja gameplay and Super Meat Boy mood, you shoud be more than happy.			"

												even tho i don't know how people get such good times on this game , i really enjoy it and would reccomend to anyone who is competitive .. very good to see which friend can complete the levels fastest . the simplicity of it is what makes it enjoyable , if you haven't got a controller its only half as fun . i'm begining to struggle with the levels about 30 levels in tbh , really challanging - there are user created levels but not many people have made levels but option is there .

												While Beeftacular and Super Meat Boy share a similar theme, they are two completely different games.I am a big fan of this game and really enjoy playing it a lot! It's another thumb destroyer!In Beeftacular, you're a fresh meat cube in what could seem to be a freezer/cooler. Whatever you touch, becomes painted with your fresh blood. Around you are obsticles and platforms to prevent you from destroying the brown spoiled meat. Nobody wants to eat spoiled meat! At your disposal are what appear to be re-usable icicles that you can throw pretty far and pick back up to reach the far away spoiled meat. You can karate chop the other bad meat that's a bit easier to get too.The game was built very well and features some challenging, interesting and fun mechanics in the levels as you progress.You also get to compare your scores with friends and world rankings. So if you're the competitive type, this is the perfect game for you.Not only that, it also features a level creator for you to create your own fun and challenging levels!I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys platformers. I have a hard time putting the controller/gamepad down once I load up the game as it's pretty addicting.			"

												I've barely scratched the surface of this game. But here's my impressions so far....Another great platformer from Retrific!!! (Maker of the amazing Just Get Through)It really is like 10 second ninja (as the dev said), but to me the controls feels a little more forgiving, and the solutions to the levels seem a little more flexible. Also I like the visual style better. I can't wait to unlock the additional visual themes.I like the blood/paint splatter left all over the place, and that it remains after each attempt, so that when you finally complete the level after your 20th try, you look back at the level and see your many failures painted all over the landscape, and you think....""Finally did it!!......just.""I'm up to about level 16 or so, and already there's been a few tricky levels I only just managed to complete in 9.9 seconds. I shudder to think how hard level 100 is going to be.Well done, Retrific.If this game gets updated as much as Just Get Through, it's gonna get even more amazing too.			"

												Describing it as Super Meat Boy X 10 Second Ninja doesn't do this justice. Just play it, you won't regret it.			"

												Fast paced 2d platformer with jumps, double jumps, lazers, arrows, teleports, boosts, spikes and 4k textures. Basically the reason i got my 970..... Warning, may cause wrist cramp, hand cramp, jaw cramp, arm cramp and rage quits.In short it's a great game but you gotta ""GIT GUD""			"

												My mate gave me this game because he knows how much I love platformer type games.  However this one isn't all that great. Also, when doing your keybinds, you have to hold down the escape key to make sure your bind stays or else it will bind to escape. I want to leave a neutral review if I could but I don't think you can.			"
