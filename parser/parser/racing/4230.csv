												This game is, at the very least, passable. It may not be fantastic, but it bears enough resemblance to games like forza and gran turismo to be a nice racing game. The fact that it's 89 cents makes it all the better.			"

												Good game, certainly worth the $3. However I would recomend you don't make the mistake I made and purchace this instead of Race WTCC 07. That game basicly includes everything in this game plus another game, and  also has a wealth of mods on the internet, including the excelent 2012-2013 mod. For only $1 more it's an amazing value, and I ended up just purchacing that one and uninstalling this, because there was nothing more this could offer. As a game though I would recommend it. It's a bit of a hardcore sim, so if you're used to Burnout or Need for Speed you may have some trouble adjusting. However for the money it's a good deal. Not on the level of a new Codemasters or Forza game, but still worth the money.			"

												Great racing game. Both realistic (quite simulator-like, if not an actual simulator), highly enjoyable (with assisting can be played as an sim-arcade) and challenging (AI reacting to your type of driving, learns your tactics on the track and adapts to confront it). Huge bonus - great graphics for a game made in last decade, AND is still fully capable to be played on lower end pcs/laptops (latter being my case). Enjoy the ride.			"

												Great immersion, good graphics and awesome sounds... and absolutely fun to play! In the other hand, not much evolution compared to earlier Simbin games. Still no real-like rain and still too low damage sensitivity and too simple damage model. Two formula cars are welcomed add-on, however their drivability and grip feel should be better. I hope these formula cars are profecy of F1 racing game from Simbin in future. Again great game for sim veterans and normal players.			"

												Yes and No. This game is a cheap and simple time spender which will run on any laptop from the 21st century. However, the AI lack alot of challenge and there are times that'll you'll go off the track in first and rejoin a lap down. But, for £1.50 the caterhams are great fun to slide around when revision is too much to bare. But Race 07 should be better...			"

												This game was once a great game. But now well......... Not so much. The interface or graphics which ever one you want to call it look old compared to my other games. Also the game is kind of limited. First of all there are only about three car brands. All the cars look the same and the only thing that's changed is the paint job and the number. Thee are also only like 10-20 tracks. Also if you have a wheel this game is not for you. I have a wheel my self and in my opinion it just does not feel right compared to my other racing games. There is also the fact that this game has not changed/been updated for about three years. They are many other things that are wrong with this game and I doubt that will change so really don't buy this game.:(			"

												Physics feels good, cars enough -as long as you accept it is WTCC- but, of course it is an old game, graphics are not fancy but it still feels you are in the game. Cars are all tunable but you have to know how to tune, or if you don't know you have to practice about it. Game includes 7-step-beginner tips which is simple about driving. The only problem I think is even dry, tarmac always looks dirty with dirt.Finally, it reduces it's money and it gives a lot more than it's money.""Thumbs up for this game.""			"

												Don't buy this if your after realism. Sliding 50 meters sideways while only doing 15kmph is impossible and if you were going fast enough to slide that far you would flip and roll, because it is on bitumen.Having said that, if your after some quick race fun that is relatively cheap, especially if you can get it in a bundle, go for it!
