												This game is bad, and Nordic should feel bad for releasing it like this even in early access. It feels dated, the controls are bad, the physics are so far off it feels sluggish and sloppy. Before its release, I watched a video where the devs stated the track width was widened to make it easier on new players to the franchise, this is a lie. It was widened because the controls are so sloppy, wonky that pro riders probably couldnt negotiate a tighter track. There are NO features in play for PC, no graphics settings, aside from resolution, and the optimization is worse than ♥♥♥♥ poor, its non existant. This whole game was phoned in, much of the gear is re-hashed straight from earlier titles. The devs on this game didnt fail, in order to fail you have to try. This game shows no improvements over past Mx Vs ATV titles. I feel bad for spending money on this title, I feel bad for getting my hopes up. THIS GAME IS PATHETIC, ITS A BAD JOKE. If there is to be any redemption there is so much work to be done, this title should actually release around 2017.Edit since release:Game now runs at 35-60 fps inconistantly, resolution scaling is obviously locked below 1080. There might be new bikes but they are DLC. Some new gear. Devolper asked that I re-review, so here it is. Game is still a hot mess, graphics are re-hashed and look terrible, physics feel unnatural, there is little to no innovation. So there you go ""♥♥♥♥ on me and call it rain"" and then ask for an award after minimal effort, I stand behind my original review, a piece of ♥♥♥♥ at 60fps is still a piece of ♥♥♥♥.			"

Early Access Review
								It's not my intention to insult anyone,  i'm just being honest and critical.   This game's physics feel like they've been dumbed down for children the ages of 3-5.  Any connection to real-world physics is lost here, unfortunately.   This is a problem in previous titles but here it's gone into turbo mode.   I dare say that this game isn't as fun as the original ExciteBike stand-up arcade game.  At least there you had control and things made sense.  Then there's the speed of this game.  It's mind-numbingly slow movements combined with the way the physics make no sense leaves me feeling a bit sick after just a few minutes of playing.The graphics options...there are none.   I mean NONE.  Not even a screen size resolution option.  Not even a Full Screen option.  It starts (and stays) in 'windowed mode' at what looks like 1280x720.  The only way to get Full Screen is to Maximize the game window in the Task Manager.    The quality of the graphics is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.   It's probably one of the worst looking and worst playing motocross game i've ever played.  Worth $24.00?  Absolutely not!  Real wotrh (using other Steam games and prices as a guide) - $4.  Unless they're considering a full replacement of everything in this game,  don't buy it.There is one thing positive, though... The power the clutch has at low speeds is just right.  If Reflex had that i'd be happy with that game._________________________________________________________________________________________EDIT- Looking on the website i see a fraudulent claim!  http://s29.postimg.org/hdes63d47/Capture.pngThat is definitely NOT true!  Steam should pull this game from its website at least until the time Nordic either remove the lie from their website,  or until they actually comply with the above claim.  This is not acceptable!

								Bought this game to support the franchise, been playing mx vs atv since I was a kid. But WOW...this game is bad. The graphics are fine, the customization is great, but the core of a motocross game is the physics, and the physics this game has are extremely bad.  Wish they wouldve just stuck with thr reflex engine, would have been a decent game... oh well.			"

												At first coming from reflex, I hated this game with a passion. But after having over 2k hours on reflex over the years, it was time to look for something else. 1st impression, no feel for the bike, couldn't turn, coudln't whip, could barely make any of the jumps. And why is the camera panning sideways in 3rd person? This of all things really screwed me over, this panning of the camera sideways in every turn, made it very easy to run off the track in every turn. I felt limited it what I could do. Quit and played reflex some more, but the hours were wearing me down. Started playing Encore again when I heard KTM's were released as DLC. This time I gave it an honest try with an open mind, not allowing the sea of negativity to influence my opinion before I gave the game an real try. I would play to get to a point where I could get some clean laps in and start pushing, because this is where racing games come alive, when you are on the gas! The biggest difference for me between liking and hating this game, (other than the KTM's), was forgetting about 3rd person and playing in 1st person. After I started getting some basic lines down it really felt like Encore was designed to be played in 1st person, not 3rd. The game just felt so much more fluid in this view, much closer to what I've come to expect from an MX vs ATV game. Looked way better and played better as you feel the bike more as you actually have a feel for the front of the bike. 3rd person by comparison feels very, VERY stiff and static.

I came to realize that my initial opinion of the game was compounded by friends saying ""don't play this game it sucks."" It was also influenced by the fact that the supercorss was different from Reflex, which is what I was used to. When I first started reflex I hated it, why? because it didn't play like unleashed. And reflex turned out to be one of my most played games of all time. Also bear in mind that reviews from early access are not seperated. It was a totally different game back then, and a lot of gripes have been addressed.The tracks themselves offer a nice variety of content, though I do wish nordic would release the 2016 AMA supercross tracks which are all out there....somewhere. Not as much a fan of some of the outdoor tracks but they do offer a completly different challenge with those flat turns that require a completly different approach to how you attack the track. I do wish SX tracks would get rutted the same amount as outdoors though, Sounds are pretty well done, feels great when you open up the throttle, go though the whoops and rev the bike in the air.

At it's core this still is an MX vs ATV game. Lots of huge lines to be found, still feels great when you land the rythms clean and you put down a fast lap - Physics are pretty much on par with what you would expect with an Mx vs ATV game, not ultra realistic but not over the top arcadey. Feels like there is much more traction than reflex and the clutch will actually give you a decent boost. Unlike reflex, you actually have to use the clutch and brakes in encore, as you can very easily blow the turns. I do wish, however, that manual shifting was a little more refined so that there would be a real benifit to manually working your way though the gears instead of staying in 5th and using the clutch. That said automatic transmission works just as well and is what you would expect from an mx vs atv game without manual shifting. In the end I feel both are on par with eachother. Preloading can seem over the top in 3rd person as it seem like the bike gets popped up and launched forward, but I find it much more mellow playing in 1st person. In my videos above, I do preload quite a few jumps but you don't see that huge pop up and forward that you see in 3rd person.At this point, after hating encore for so long, I'm playing it a lot more. (but I still hate it's implemention of 3rd person which I think puts a lot of people off). Its not a perfect game, it still has it quirks and still could benifit from some elbow greese, but what game is perfect? So if you're thinking of trying this game, ignore the sea of negativity. Stop by my page and check out some of my videos and see for yourself how much fun this game can be. See you on the track racers!			"

												The game looks nothing like the quality of the images on the store page. Very blurry on a high end PC that I own. After being a huge fan of REFLEX, I was looking forward to this game. early access was pretty poor but that was then, Loaded the game up as of recent as I been playing REFLEX again, this game is still as poor as it was in early access.If you enjoyed REFLEX, you wouldnt like this title, even ALIVE I would say is a better play than this.

												This game can be fun (in a barebones ""encore"" way) but has serious technical issues that make it a pass for now.Regardless of selected resolution, you're getting an upscaled 720 image so everything is blurry.  There are also serious rendering issues with the terrain giving an offset transparent ""3D-ish"" look that can be seen in many screenshots.And for performance, even on a decent i7 w/ 2GB 760 GTX and 8GB RAM it runs terribly.  Any of the outdoor maps with AI racers framerate is mostly in the 20's, sometimes dipping into the teens.  Other races in the Supercross stadiums tend to perform better (mostly in the 40's), but that's still much worse than this game should be running.On the upside, the game seems to control pretty well and might be fun once these technical issues are resolved.I would definitely wait to see if they fix these issues or just abandon the game, though.  They are already closing forum threads for people complaining about these issues.			"

												UPDATE: FULL VERSION RELEASE.Still crap. No optimisation, albiet a tiny bit better. Washed out textures, poor physics. Not worthy to come to PC.EDIT: Months after, still doesnt run, crashes. Worst buy ever.Don't buy yet, will change review when updates and full release comes out, but for now..Cons- Just feels wrong, not like youre riding a bike.- Camera feels wrong as well, camera gos to the side of bike when turning corners or jumping.- Jumping just feels terrible, no auto correction to straigten out bike, if you turn in the air you will land sideways- Somehow you cant crash even with the most awkward of landings.- Terrain deform is almost non existant, THIS IS NEXT GEN ERA !! Let me do 100 laps and make deep ♥♥♥ ruts !!!!!- Stop trying to make the 'Casual everyone can play game', you will lose most of your fan base.Pros- New Game Mx Vs Atv Game.- 50cc are back again.Thats all.Just wait for full release and see what reviews are at that point, but judging from console versions this is going to be a huge miss.

Early Access Review
								You can see that the graphics are not that good but that probably because it's just an early acces version of the game. I think this game really got some potential to be honest. The physics could be less stiff even after the big update and the wheel sliding thing in the corner has to be removed as well but I'm actually pretty happy with this game. Here's a video of the pc version:

												As many have said, poor optimisation, sloppy controls, feels like im looking at a game that was released 10 years ago. Very limited options on graphics, my PC surpasses the minimum by miles, I should be able to play this on high settings with no lag. Played for 15 minutes and figured it wasnt worth my time. (Yes that is long enough when the game has no story) refund requested. This franschise was once great, was.			"

												Just a bad game, Reflex felt soo much better. The controls were much more fluid and natural than they are in this. It felt like u had absolute control of the bike where as in this one it's very rigid and just overall feels like a game form 10 years ago. The graphics are absolutely terrible also and there's no ingame options to improve them so the anti-aliasing remains all jagged and pixelated.. As far as the tracks go I really didn't play long enough to experience them all, I got a refund within the same 30 minutes after installing it. The controls are just the worst.			"

												The latest patch(es) fixed the low resolution, the game now renders at the chosen resolution. However the performance is still bad.The latest patch I think removed some FPS drops, making it feel a bit smoother but at around 19 FPS on outdoor tracks they are still unplayable. Supercross seems to run decent tho, but not at a rate that my gaming rig should be capable of.As stated in my previous review; This game is NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT, it should still be in early access (public beta).

 MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore ... ... is a nice game, that reminds me on the old classic MX-vs-ATV-Games. The biggest Problem of the Game is the Content. Selling a Bike-Modell for like 3€ is way to much!! They probably ruined the Game by selling half its content via DLCs and not giving the Fans a big enoth Game to enjoy. I hope There will be released a Complete-Edition and set to Sale soon. Cause if this does not happen its sadly to say, that it will die faster than you might think. The Game itself isnt worth 30€... but I did buy it 75% off for 7,5€, and for that price you cant go wrong in buying it.			"

Early Access Review
								It is in early access, however it is still a strong game with lots of promise. I started the game up and I instantly was taken back to the memories of playing MX Vs. ATV Unleashed on the PC when I was younger. The physics (especially traction) as well as the animations are rough around the edges, however Nordic seems to be eager for some feedback to make this game into something that can relaunch this franchise. I would recommend this game in this state to anyone who appreciates Nordic's effort to resurrect the game, or a die hard member of the community. I uploaded a video of a race onto my YouTube channel 522MotoFilms for people to see for themselves. (I use a keyboard as of right now)Important***** Wait unil you unlock the upgrades to the bike to write a review! The performance and physics felt greatly enhanced by these upgrades and gave a more accurate picture of what the game is really like.My setup:ASRock Z97 Extreme4Two GTX 770 4GB 4690k i5 (Corsair H100i)8GB Crucial RAM			"

												I think this game has gotten more hate than it deserves.  It is too often compared to Reflex, which was a fantastic game.  In terms of realism, I would agree that Reflex is the best game to this day.  However, this game targets a slightly different audience.  The objective here wasn't to have an ultra-realistic game that offers no forgiveness for messing up in a rhythm section.  The goal was to have a supercross game that gave players the sensation of realistic racing, while still allowing newer players to make small mistakes without throwing their entire race away.  There are more supercross tracks than Reflex, and the poor excuse for an upgrading system has been replaced.  The ""physics"" that everyone complains about are actually pretty good too.Bottom line:  If you're looking for a new supercross game that takes a certain amount of skill and knowledge about sx, but doesn't have simulator-level difficulty, I think you'll enjoy this game.Also, for anyone who says it's impossible to do a whip - it's possible; you just have to learn how.

												OK, after playing it a bit, levelling up my bikes, and getting used to the new controls and physics, I think my previous review was a bit harsh. Its still not as good as relfex or alive, but it is OK. Its better than mud, and more fun than MXGP... Still needs quite a bit of polishing to get it up to scratch though..... I really think they should work on the whip and scrub physics Its just too hard.... the rest is reasonable.			"

												I do not recommend this game for anyone. ANYONE that is a motocross fanatic will hate this game. It was poorly put together, and they left out so much! Some stadiums even have the SAME atmosphere and stadium. They cut corners to put this game on the market. As video games progress they get better, not this company... They just got worse and worse. If you want a better game, get Mx Vs. Atv: Relfex (best as it can get). Also, if a bike lands on a rider it deserves to crash them, not land on them and you wreck as well in the process.Gaame sucks.

												EARLY ACCESS REVIEW OF CURRENT GAME STATE:After several hours playing this installment my verdict is in. Sadly this game gets a massive thumbs down, not so much for the gameplay itself more for the way the new Rainbow studiosNordic games has handled this title as well as their development processes.1.This game came locked originally, allowing us to ride 4 tracks and 2 bikes (not including the 450), was then later hacked by members of the community which unlocked content which in turn forced Rainbow to release a slapdash update to release the content which was already there for us.2.The lack of content being added to this special exclusive PC version (which is now due for console, exclusive eh)TBH its pretty feeble how much is actually being released, 3 Alive nationals and 1 freeride.  (which were the crap tracks) the rate in which things are coming are very slow tbh. WARNING Rainbow announced that PC players would also have to pay for the JS7 Compound, all OEM bikes (except Suzuki) and new gear. When they stated on their official forums months prior to release that ALL alive content including the JS7 tracks would be free.3.They boasted HD Textures and improved graphics, sadly folks this is not the case. There is nothing more than a poor console poor here with some fuzzy filter over the image and what looks like some slight MSAA on some of the tracks.4.The game itself still seems off compared to previous titles, for me personally i've tried my damn near hardest to ride fluid and smooth like other MX games and Reflex but this is still too clunky and very rigid in comparison.Its ok to play for 10 mins here and there but thats about it im afraid. If you are looking at this game as a subsitute for Reflex then tbh i would probably look elsewhere. 5. No deformation that you really noticed, especially physically. I could go on and on about this game and its flaws but sadly i think the thing that makes this game bad is probably the way the Developers have gone about their business. Asking fans for feedback on what we'd like to see in a game and for our ideas, to all blatantly be ignored and pushed aside to accomadate for thier own game. Also im not quite sure who they think their demographic are nowadays as they stated our testers think its the best. Perhaps their testers are several limbless farm animalsPOST EARLY ACCESS REVIEWstill buggy even after leaving early access, pathless AI which just ride straight over berms with no anticpation to stop at turns.. still has the flashing horizon bug and the weird texture rendering bug where you can see strange almost holographic artifacts as a top layer to some textures.. i guess their way to optimize stuff is just to compress already buggy textures and models thus making the game look as the 2009/10 prequel Reflex.Ok for short bursts of fun but if you are looking for a 2015 graphically plesent simcade experience then keep looking cus its not here.

												I was a *major* fan of the original ATV offroad fury, and was thrilled to see that a distant sequel made it to steam.  I picked up a copy immediately, and one for a friend to boot.  I was incredibly disappointed... in fact, my favorite part of the game so far has been recreating the original sound track to listen while playing.  Skip this game because it's glitchy, skip it because the graphics stink, skip it because the muliplayer is a barren wasteland: just skip it.  My friend agrees.			"

												The worst performing PC game i have played in years.Just bought the game and wish i hadn't.Honestly what the hell is going on with this game?. Its hardly a looker in the first place but i'm getting as little as single digits in some of the outside tracks, The indoor tracks run anywhere from 40-80fps.It almost seems like the engine is broken and won't use more than 50% of your gpu and cpu because Afterburner shows that my gpu never goes about 50% and my cpu cores are in the 40-55% range at all times.My Specs - Q9650 Quad @ 4.0ghz8GB RamOverclocked GTX970Oh and before someone says ""thats an old cpu, maybe its bottlenecking your gpu"", i can get 99% gpu usage on almost every game i play, including maxing out games like Witcher 3 (minus hairworks) at 60fps, Battlefront max at 60fps etc.In fact i have not played a game, since i got my 970, that i couldn't max or close to max at 60fps. Not this game though lol.It made me think that maybe my game didn't update because i read about performence updates that had been released, but Steam is set to 'always keep this game up to date', so god knows how the game used to run before these updates!!!.I'd get an refund if i could but i bought the game off Bundle Stars and i'm not sure if you can refund with them sigh.Honestly devs, i know its not an easy job but f""""k me, this game is a joke.

												As someone who was very excited about this game release, I don't think I could be any more dissapointed. I have owned every MX VS ATV game since the first release way back on PS2 as a testimate to my loyalty. As a rider myself and a motocross enthusiast I have to say that the physics are terrible. I wasn't expecting a one to one simulator but to me the physics engine needs a major overhaul.  The graphics are aweful and somewhat blurry looking. I do have what few graphics settings there are maxed out. Performance has not really been an issue for me. After the recent performance update I average about 80 FPS. The DLC model can go burn in H***.... $139.68 for all the DLC !!!! REALLY??????? Good God, NO THANKS NORDIC that is absurd. I would not recommend this game to my Worst Enemy. Also a word of advice to Nordic, take a look at Bohemia Interactive's business model and how they communicate with their gaming community. It is probably the best I have ever seen from a game developers stand point. I am still desperately craving the next great MX game. Every year the Motocross community gets larger and larger. Between Freestyle and Racing the Motocross fan base is larger, right now, than it has ever been in the history of the sport. Yes, there is a demand out there for a triple A motocross game. Unfortunately this was not it.			"

												Lets start with the positives:There are motorcycles.Now for the negatives:Everything else. Poor graphics, poor physics, frame rate issues, texture issues, a billion micro transactions, and no discussion from the developers about patching this mess into anything playable. I own this on PS4 as well, and the graphics look straight off the PS3. With MX vs ATV Reflex, and MX vs ATV Alive, the games were a blast and had some variety, and for Reflex, the PC version looked amazing and ran beautifully. I was hoping that it was just a poorly optimized console game, and that with the extra power available on my PC setup it would make up for the half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at a game. This was not the case. I have played Rainbow Studios games and owned every iteration of the MX vs ATV series(and a few before they started throwing quads in the mix as well) and they all were great games. The older ones(like unleashed) had way more maps, game modes, freestyle, hill climbs, other vehicles, just tons of great content to play and enjoy with friends and family. Through the last three or four games all of this has been cut out a piece at a time, and we are now left with a broken husk of a game. I hope Rainbow Studios and Nordic know how bad they shafted the fan base on this one. It is going to take a ton of effort on thier end to save this franchise. Used to think I knew this family of games inside and out. Now I wish I never knew ya at all. Best advice I can give is skip this poor excuse of a game and pick up MX vs ATV Reflex instead. It may be dated but it is far prettier, better physics, and a hell of alot more fun.			"

												I own 216 games on PC, this is the only game I have gone out of my way to ask for a refund. This game series has not progressed at all since the last two installments. Animations are terrible. People only buy this game because MX and ATV game choices are limited. Buy at your own risk. Also, I bought this game when it was 75% off. Meaning it is so bad I did not feel it was worth $8, let alone $30.			"

												As most have stated this is a downgrade if you have played alive, reflex. I would even recommend MXGP2 or MXGP vs ATV Supercorss Encore. Game looks like crap on a GTX980 @ 1440p, unrealistic characteristics. 0/10This game seemed like it would have been great and waiting for the next MX vs ATV game, and it's a total disappointment. I bought into this game during beta/early access and reviewed it then as a DO NOT BUY and things have not changed DO NOT BUY			"

												If it isn't already painfully obvious from the previous reviews, this game has some serious optimization issues that still have not been addressed. On the national tracks I average about 25 fps and around 40 fps on the supercross tracks (I have a GTX980 btw). While it is technically playable, it's not enjoyable at all. I have motion blur turned off and the graphics are still VERY BLURRY and the game gives me headaches after a while. Which brings me to my next point, not only are the graphics options lacking in my opinion, there's no in-game graphics option menu at all!!! Even assuming the optimization issues get fixed at some point, the game despite just being released a few months ago feels like a dated 5+ year old console port with mediocre graphics. It doesn't really offer anything new other than rhythm racing. This has been by far the most disappointing game in recent years for me. I would avoid this game altogether as there are far better options available now if you're a fan of motocross.			"

												CHECKED BACK ON THIS GAME TO MAKE SURE THIS REVIEW IS STILL VALID, WHIICH IT IS AS OF 7/16/2016Updating this review as I forgot to update it after they put an update out until now when they left a comment.  Still cannot say I would suggest buying this, there were marginal framerate improvements, however, with a GTX 780 a significant portion of the game is still un playable, and the frame rates in the remaining bit are not what I would call enjoyable or acceptable, being that on an indoor supercross track I was lucky to hit 50, and probably averaged around 30 or 40, that is on an indoor track with minimal impact on your system.  Everything except the indoor supercross does not appear to be playable at the moment, at around a 23fps average for what I would say is still a high end video card, running on high with not anti aliasing at 1080p, which should definitely not be any issue for this system, as it maxes pretty much every other game I've found at 1080p just fine.TL;DR: Marginal frame rate improvements with latest update, very significant portion of the game is still not playable, and the portion that can be considered playable is not enjoyable.  Would not suggest buying the game.Keeping this note here: there is $116.99 worth of DLC, for a game that costs $29.99.  Let that sink in.			"

								I like it! I'm still learning the tracks and what the bike can do but it feels at least as good as reflex to me.  I only have two real complaints, I can't find anywhere to turn rumble off on the controller or a way to turn in game chat off.  The in game chat I can ignore, but with a wireless controller having rumble on kills batteries too quickly.  It is different than reflex, being able to go fast on reflex doesn't automatically transfer to going fast on this one - which is a good thing.  Once you get used to the way the controls work the new tracks are a blast!Update:  80+ hours on this one now, and I'm liking it more the more I play.  Learning how the controls work and getting faster takes time...just like reflex did.  Most of the really fast guys have 200+ hours and I anticipate it taking me that long or longer to get really good.  Doing the career with laps set to 10 seems to help in getting to the point where the controls are instinctual, learning the tracks/finding fast lines etc.			"

												First off, before anything.... I KNOW IT""S ON PC BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE A CONTROLLER. Just trust me, the way the game's built it feels so much better that way.Okay now that that's been established... the actual gameplay.The Reflex system IS in this game, but if the last game you played was Reflex, well, it handles a little differently, so be prepared. The rider control influences the bike a lot more in turns, you can easily accidentally 180-360 degree turn your bike if you aren't careful. Other than that, the responsiveness is a lot better and feels a lot more like your rider has weight. It does make the physics system a little wonky if you ignore the rider control though, as the bike feels a lot more like a slippery brick, Rainbow has done a wonderful job of weighting these systems together and the rider and bike feel separate and together at the same time (unlike Reflex where they often felt more separate than anything else).Vehicle customization returns and changing off stock parts does change the performance of the bike/atv, although the fine tuning from Reflex is not there, (I'm very sad about this).The AI still crashes into you, but it won't throw you off your ride. It actually drives like it isn't trying to commit a murder suicide constantly, although the AI doesn't compensate for slipperiness on the ATVs so be prepared to see more than one com flying at you from another track section. Other than that, it's no more easy or difficult, you just won't be forcibly wiped out by the AI every 10 secs if you get stuck in the group.Your Bike is also more sturdy now, or at least it feels more sturdy (I've been told it's slipperry though if you don't pull back on the rider to increase traction), and wiping out isn't quite as easy unless you throw the bike and rider hard in one direction or ram your front wheel into the ground when landing. The actual Reflex (QTE to stay on the bike from Reflex game) is gone making some landings that seem like they should throw you off strange when they would have thrown the QTE to recover in your face before, you now have to recover (or break your riders neck) with your own decisions, the bike will not auto-recover via magical Analog stick flick anymore.And finally we also see the return of the 50cc class. That's random but it's so fun.Overall Score:Pros-  - The Reflex system, after a minor adjustment period, feels a lot better  - The core gameplay is still there, however it leans heavily on the reflex system rather than steering.  - Bike customization affects performance to a degree  - Your placement is still determined more by the lines you picked and your ability to control the bike than your ability to out run the AI with blind speed. In fact, blind speed will  lose the race a lot of the time, even on rookie.  - There are 34 tracks. 17 Supercross, 12 National, and 5 Rhythm   - You can wear a chicken mask as a helmetCons  - The Gameplay is a bit more nuanced and weighted towards the rider than before. As such it feels very clunky if you ignore the rider controls.   - Bike can feel slippery and underperforming to new players. This is fixed with parts which are unlocked during play easily.   - Fine tuning is goneOverall 7.5/10 It's good.			"

												Immediate dissappointment. I have 2 copies of this game for Xbox and I have it on PC. It's almost the same as MX vs ATV Alive but the physics are worse. A lot of the gear and music in the game is exactly the same as Alive, the graphics look just like Alive, but the bikes handle terribly. when you first start the game it takes a very long time to unlock upgrades, tires, gear etc. the bikes slide out very easily until you unlock tires that hook up better. In the air the bikes handle like tanks, it's very difficult to move the bikes in the air. The physics are what make this game so bad, the bikes dont carry hardly any forward momentum when you hit jumps, they get a lot of air and then it's like somebody turned the gravity on and they fall almost straight down. Using the clutch is a must is corners and if tap the clutch repeatedly you go faster in the straits for some reason. Also, if you put your settings on manual transmission, you can keep you're bike in 5th gear all the way around the track and clutch boost like no other, it's incredibly unrealistic. As much as I dislike this game, I did enjoy racing pit bikes! The pit bikes are the only reason I even own the game on PC, they're very agressive, and they somehow clear all the jumps that you can clear on a 250. So if you're looking for a game that you'll play for a long time and captures that real racing feeling, this game isn't the one, but if you're looking for something that might be fun for a week, it might suit you.  **Update Oct 30, 2015**Game is a little bit better. More features and tweaks have been added to the game that've made it a little more playable. Still not that great of a game, but it does look like they're starting to put more effort into it. It needs to be optimized though, I can play GTA V on max settings, but this game doesn't even have as good of graphics and even with the textures turned down and what not, it still plays like it's in slow motion. There currently aren't any brand name bikes to choose from, and none of the bikes in the game actually resemble any brand name bikes, but my face did light up when I saw that they added a graphics kit to the game that I actually have on my bike IRL. I still don't really like this game but maybe you will.			"

												Where do i start with my review?, firstly ill list pc specs:CPU: 5820K @ 4.5ghz on h2oRAM: 16gb Kingston HyperX Fury 2666MHZMOBO: X99A Gaming 7HDD: 120GB Samsung 850Evo + 12TB (across 6 drives).I dont like to leave on a bad note so i will start with the cons.CONS:- Physics: IMO the reflex system was the worst thing to bring to this series, long gone are the fun days of MX vs ATV Unleashed and MX Superfly. But this time around the Reflex physics seem even worse, playing on my XBOX 360 Controller; the bike is never stable on woops or whenever you need to lean, and also it never seems to return to the upright position 100%, i tested this across 2 different controllers to rule out that as an issue.- Rythym Racing: Awesome concept, would have been the best aspect of the game for me except this stupid reflex engine ruins any sort of fast rythym you can get going.- Another Physics Issue: I kept this one seperate because it is another pain in the ♥♥♥ enitrely. When you clutch dump at the start of a down ramp on a jump you get this sudden, VERY UNREALISTIC burst of acceleration, same as when you holeshot off the line; which seems like you get a good start but then your speed is quickly wiped off. Most noticeable when you get a great start, you start off in 1st but are quickly overtaken by half the pack.- Performance: This game for me atleast runs like a bag of ♥♥♥♥. Random FPS Drops from a constant 60fps and it runs alot less fluidly then any other 60fps game i have, not much else to say here other then it plain sucks.PROS:- The graphics certainly seem alot more realistic, although there needs to be more room for finetuning individual details like AA, Texture Detail, Rider Detail etc.- The game COULD be fun if i wasn't so OCD on every aspect of it.- no shortage of content.CONCLUSION: As you can see from above there alot of CON's, heavily outweighing the PRO's. There is ALOT, and i really mean ALOT that needs fixing with this game, which leads to me wonder; WHY DID NORDIC TAKE THIS OUT OF EARLY ACCESS? i cannot fathom why a game with this many problems was ever released as a full game and not held back.4/10: Could have been alot better, but it seems like everything was ""That'll do""			"

I was running this game at 2K resolution and it's that ugly I actually thought that it wasn't saving my graphics settings and the game wasn't at the right resolution. It's unoptomised and lacks a lot of features.Should still be early acess.DO NOT BUY			"

								I've been a player of all Mx vs Atv games and this one is so disappointing. There has been no progrees between Mx vs Atv Alive and this one. The content is very limited and racing only in supercross is getting boring quickly. There not even a possibility to enjoy freeride. The sounds are still nothing like real dirtbikes. Sad I wasted money on this.Go for Mx vs Atv : Reflex it is older but the game is much more fun.			"

								Pros:+ Controls are responsive, and vehicle upgrades actually affect how your vehicle responds+ Has free ride mode (which is most of what I do in these games)+ AI is very balanced in difficulty, and can be very good+ You don't have to unlock tracks in free-play+ Can practice on any Supercross track in free-play mode+ The different sizes of vehicles have a clearly different feel (much more difference than reflex)Cons:- Only one (very small) free roam map, and there is currently no modding comunity for adding more- No cheats to unlock all bikes, so you will be grinding for a LONG time to unlock the 650's or the 50-pit bike- No rebinding controls other than 3 premade controller layouts (although keyboard layout is quite nice)- If you have multiple displays, the game will crash if you click outside of the game window, although alt-tabbing works fine- Still has quite a few crashes- haven't seen many updates since I've started playing the game- Only looks marginally better than other MX vs ATV games, and in some cases actually looks worse.- Menu's look much worse than Reflex (looks like they were from the PS2)- No trucks or UTV's!Other Notes:The new clutch system is very odd, and can get you going much faster than you could in other games, and get you into rhythems that would have otherwise been impossible to get into, but if you don't know about it, then racing will be very hard for you as the AI almost always use it.If there was one thing I would love the Dev's to add, it would be map support from other games in free-ride mode, or just more free-ride maps.Verdict:If you liked the Supercross modes from other MX vs ATV games, you'll like this game, because that is 90% of the game. If you were more like me and only ever played the free-ride from the other games (30+ hours of it on reflex on steam and 50+ hours on disc version of reflex) then you might want to pick up Reflex, as I had much more fun with it. The only redeeming quality of the game for me was the different bikes (didn't touch the ATV's). There is actually a variety of sizes of MX bikes that change how you play the game.			"

												Looks like after the recent update this game seems to be much better with my computer, usually getting a constant 60fps in SX and 30-45 in MX. I really do thank Rainbow for finally fixing the performane issues, so now I shall write a fair review in return. I'm gonna try and keep it short as possible, but looks like there's lots of things to cover here. I'm not trying to bash on Rainbow or Nordic in any way, just reviewing the game in my honest and opinion.First off, the game itself is kinda fun, but doesn't really live up to what i was expecting. I was honestly hoping for a reflex2.0, but it turned out as a washed out Alive2.0. To start here, the physics are honestly what i think are weighing down the rest of the game so much. I would have been fine if the same physics for reflex were used for supercross encore, because it really is the better of the motocross games out there. The new physics engine isn't terrible, but it feels like there was a step backwards from the right direction. The turning is like skating on brown ice simulator amped up a notch, and the whips are more like slightly maneuvering the bike sideways rather than flipping it which ever way you want like a sick pancake. scrubbing is alright but sometimes you'll end up turning sideways and transition into a super lame whip then proceed to land sideways because bringing back a whip is actually hard to do for some reason.Braking seems to be a problem too. i had a few times when i hit the brakes and spun into a 720 noscope as if i were playing mw2 quickscope battles on rust. i know i had the oversized brakes updgrade on but jeez dude i dont think they have that kind of power.Again, unlike reflex this game has your rider as a living tank that holds on to the bike with an absolute death grip and will only wreck if you are completely flatlining or upside down when landing a jump. Same with getting smacked into by other riders, instead of both wrecking, it just goes into bumper cars mode. and for the most part the AI is still dumb as it has been for generations now. most the time you can win a race going half speed as long as the opponents keep crashing into one another.This game also really abuses the use of the clutch and seatbouncing, it's over powered what you can do if you just pop the clutch(which would stall the bike) and then seatbounce off a triple, you'll end up quading into the next section from the super mega ultrasanic speed boost. also it'd be real sweet if there was a manual gear shifting option, because no full sized racing dirtbike i've ever seen is automatic.AND WHERE DID THE TRACK DEFORMATION GO?that was one of  the coolest features for reflex, because you could carve out your out deep ruts and really rail it around berms with em, but in sx encore it seems like you cant even put an indention into the ground, sadly. Also... the rider reflex thing that you can use to save yourself from a crash is absent from this game, it's just an automatic animation. why would you do that?so yeah it's apparent now that i really liked reflex, and lots of other mx vs atv fans can agree it's the best one out there.Now that the biggest problem  is out of the way, i can get onto the little details and stuff i noticed were missing.Ok, so the career mode isnt really much of a career, it's just racing after racing and getting some cool rewards, which is how it's been in pretty much all of the previous mx vs atv games. I'd like to see a career mode done differently, with sponsorships and all that fun stuff. You know another thing that's just completely missing from the supercross experience? where's all the qualifying, heats, semis, and lcq races? the race just starts off in the main event, which is really anticlimatic for me. Where's the 20 man gate drop too? i've been waiting around for that for years. This isnt much of a big deal, but it'd really add to the authenticity that makes this game ""supercross"".Sountrack is good for the most part with some cool fitting music, but there were some songs i felt kinda killed the mood for me. BUT i did hear some of the old reflex songs and i was really excited to hear those again because they are amazing.The customization is still nice with the variety of cool gears there are, but there's always gotta be more. Would be nice if there were even more added for free, or really really.... really cheapMost of the tracks out there are actually great and feel like a SX track. so that's one good thing going for the game if i may say. The addition of the MX tracks from alive is definitely great, and im sure glad it happened, so why not also add tracks from other games too? reflex, untamed, and unleashed all had some good stuff and i'd like to see em again. why not throw in some of the older gears too?also please dont make expensive dlc.  like seriosuly nobody likes that. if a company were to sell me dlc, it better be worth every pennyso im finally gonna wrap up this super long review. i didnt spend too much time organizing but i think i got my point across.best wishes to rainbow and nordic because i want to believe they can bring the series back to life. thanks to the developers again, but come on man you can surely do better, YOU JUST GOTTA BELIEVE!TLDR: game is fun, but it aint no reflex. i wanna recommend this game but i just cant do it.""it's ok""6/10			"

I figured they would have all the bugs worked out by this point but boy was I wrong. Graphics are so bad and the physics are just cheesy. I assumed based off of the simulation tag that the game would at least be up to par with reflex... nope. I have no idea what happened with this game or how it hit the market when it did.

								It pains me to see how poorly this game is doing. There are several things that were done poorly or not at all. The thing that bugs me THE MOST about this game is the turning tf man, Tires do not glide across the air. The tracks are not well sized at all compared to the amount (or lack of) power the bikes have, even the best players of this game I am sure find themselves casing it on a regular basis. One thing I could live with but am still upset about is the fact there is no free riding map (yes you can be the only one on a track) but it is not good enough. The lack of tricks and how hard they are to do them is very frustrating, Wheeling is so hard to get up and so easy to stay up, whips are near impossible on anything smaller than a 250. Lets not even talk about fps if you have a mediocre pc forget about playing this. Moral of the story is I cannot believe they were okay with releacing this half finished game, Reflex is still better and I would highly not recommend spending your money on this.			"

												A horrible horrible attempt at breathing life into a once great series. The performance is awful. stutters, frame drops, the hole shabang.The game looks awful which makes the awful performance all the more awful.Everything as far as I can recollect is recycled from previous games which would have been cool if this game ran any better or looked any better than those games.My fond memories of the mx vs atv series have just been nut punched out of me. There is zero reason for me, a fan of the series, to own this game. It in no way extends the series forward or improves upon previous entries. It's just a lamest hits version with the same craptastic selection of free roam maps and ""the affordable DLC will complete the game"" pricing model.Let's pretend this never happened. and hope that a more talented and with the times studio buys the liscence from nordic and continues the series with a NEW entry, on a made within the last 10 years graphics and physics engine, and then patches any bugs or performance issues that game would have within you know....ever.TLDR simple fix for performance issues - uninstall. (6/25/16)*update* in light of upgrading my GPU since the last time i played  i decided to see what kind of improvements were made. From a R9 270x to a GTX 1070 the game is still shockingly equally unoptimized. on ""high"" settings i tested Anaheim free ride, and a race on Anaheim. Free roam=110-52FPS.Race=88-38FPS. With jarring pop-ins and blurry textures occuring more frequently with each lap.So please anyone with a system that can run this game at a rock solid 60FPS @ 1920 x1080 on ""high"" leave your system in a comment below. I'm not patronizing anyone, i'm simply curious if a device exsist on which this game could be considered well optimized. Check that i'll brb. going to test game in 4k.*update to the update* 3840x2160 performance is mixed bag. free ride stayed at a much healthier 74-79fps from what i could tell, but the texture pop in was even more noticeable so i could only tolerate a few minutes. Parked next to a ramp and watched a distant part of the track flip on/off/black/brown like a light switch.Race performance was about the same considering resolution increase. high  72FPS all the way down into the high 20's in a specific section of the track. Also hitting the hey had a profound effect on frame rate, which i would understand if the physics engine was designed for more cutting edge hardware than a core2duo.......ugh. done.			"

												I have been a huge fan of the mx vs atv games since they first gcame out. Not all the mx vs atv games are available for pc wish makes me upset. When i saw that tjis game was for pc i was very excited and couldnt wait to play. But its not what i expected. ive taken the time to play every aspect of the game to get a good understanding if i like it or not. I hate saying this but this is the worst mx vs atv game ive ever played. It is very choppy and i know i can run the game on max settings no problem. Graphics are meh but it seems like this game was half ♥♥♥♥♥ and slapped together to continue the franchise. I do not recommend this game if you are avid motocross fan or rider, you will be disapointed. Only if it could be as good or better than mx vs atv untaimed for first gen xbox 360, kinda funny actually. Save your pennies and buy a different game.			"

												Best MX vs ATV since Reflex.Wow, didn't expect this, as a motocross rider myself and a player of every mx vs atv game and MXGP, I can safely say this game is excellent.  The physics are awesome, you can whip, scrub, corner, wheelie, everything.  The gear choice is amazing. So many different makes, managed to find my exact RL kit which is pretty cool.Championships, bike customisations and character customisation is back on point like the old games.  The tracks feel good and they flow.  The AI is a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but nothing that cant be fixed with some patches. I run it on full graphics with GTX 660 nVidia and it runs on 120 FPS.The graphics needs patching as is still a bit blury and needs desperately sharpening, other than that, once you get used to the new riding system it is a great game.Definately worth the money.

								I love MX games and bought this one on PC and Xbox just to show support so they keep making them.  This game could be good but...  Bike floats in the corners, dosen't jump right, no scrub, and the track is like a freeway.  They have so many things that they can go back to from the series that was perfect.  They didnt change the way Halo played because it was a great game, they just added more.  No heat races, no team factor like MXGP, No timed practices, LCQs, if you're going to make a supercross game then watch it for 3hrs on Saturday night and recreate it.  I'm very concerned where the game is at this point.  Just go back and play all the old games and and take the best parts and make a game... sounds easy right lol...  Oh yeah back to the point buy it, support mx games or there will be none.  I can't wait to see the demo drop for the new version of this hopefully soon.			"

								It is worth $20 but they still have a lot of work to do.  The new physics start off feeling pretty bad but as you get used to it and unlock upgrades it does get better. If you're after realism go for MX vs ATV Reflex or better yet MX Sim, if you don't care about realism this game is worth adding to the MX game library.			"

												Fun game, I used to play the older MX games one the 360 and this feels the same as it did before. Some of the ATV physics feel a little weird sometimes but other than that its fine. Also the preload mechanic seems a little buggy and it isnt explained very well in the tutorials. I would Definatly reccoment this game if you enjoyed the previous games.			"

												Real TalkIs there anything good about this game ?. Yes its a MX vs ATV game. It hase some tracks from Reflex and from Alive.If you start the game for the first time be warned about the bad bikes. Once you actualy upgrade yure bike they will be better.But srrsly am i the only one who have the feeling that u either ride the 250 what feels like riding on Blank ice and you dont have any Controll mid air. Or the 450 what feels like an actual Rock but a feather in mid air.Speaking of with the Physics and the Driver Reflex there just both bad in this game cant deny that. Mx vs ATV Reflex where they first introduced that Reflex system its amazing it just feels right but here its just awfull.And why they decided to make this game instead of Reflex 2 what i am sure more MX vs ATV fans would love to see why arent they making one ? Idk m8 ask Jesus.I wanted to Rate this game more but i just cant. Its an 5/10 average game. it could have been more but there just to many things what doesnt work right.			"

												For all the players, this is a GOOD game. Not the best, but a good game. Unlike Reflex, MvASE has good graphics, the both games have the same performance (50-60 FPS). There is a better customization for the riders and all the bikes.The physics isn't bad, it's different than Reflex, less realistic, more arcade (like the early MvA's games). The DLC are too much expensive, and too many. From my point of view, it's better to work more on a game than to release a lot of DLC to complete it, even if the game become more expensive.So yeah, I like this game, it is different than Reflex or Alive, but it is a GOOD game, and Nordic will release their next game with all the quality of this one, and they will improve all the defects.

								I bought the PS3 version and then this one and this pc steam version is awesome. First and foremost as the owner of a 2015 KX450F with Rekluse clutch DID 520 Chain (Gold) Boyesen Power cooler, Hinson clutch basket and pressure plate, Evans coolant, XPC Seat, Hammerhead Brake and shifter, TORQ footpegs, Yoshi RS4 Pipe, suspension by Race tech, it is a BEAST of a machine. I wanted to get it out of the way since if you want the real thing you have to go do the real thing, just sayin. This is a great game. in the first person view. Any other view stinks but first person ROCKS. I am running a pretty beastly machine but it handles it fine on the console it was choppy and felt behind my controls at times, not on the PC fast as lightning throwing massive whips albeit over Malcom Stewarts head, (yeah right he stinks) but anyhow it controls with a logitech f510 like a dream. None of those elitist idiots from mx simulator so far either buncha jerks. No this one rocks and is great but remember it is just a game so to compare it to real life is like comparing fact to fiction. I love star wars but have yet to see Darth Vader in the flesh however I am not expecting too either. I love the game here is a hint for you if you want to keep up with me......clutch clutch clutch especially on the 250's but even on the 450 which in real life would get you killed, however a timed perfect clutch fan does more than suspension preload ever does in the game. In the game I said. Now go get it and throw some whips over Malcoms head god knows he aint winning a 450 race for real.  The best supercross game ever made so far in first person now don't get all whiskey throttle and expect to win you have to have some timing on this one.			"

												I would have to say, though initially dissapointed with this game. I am starting to have fun with this one. Ive made some tweaks to my system (disabling crossfire and AMD Gaming App) and the game runs great. Its not a game that will have MX simulator physics, but I do think its fun to play if you want to go fast and jump big. The DLC tracks ans Stewart compound have a good flow and I did get the KTM bikes and those seem fun, too. I would say if you buy this game, don't expect MX simulator, It's different, not better or worse, just different. None the less I still like the game and Im starting to have fun with it.			"

												Do you even care at all? Well doesn't seem like it.Well i've seen many threads where people say they can't open and play the game after the new update. The only response you give is ""Open the settings and turn the graphics down"". And still people (like me) can't even open the settings! And when you tell them that they give you other threads to check out if there is any solutions there. And you have said THE EXACT SAME THINGS ON THOSE THREADS! I've gotten alot more help from other people (that still don't fix the problem) than your ♥♥♥♥ing SUPPORT TEAM!. There is literally NO WAY to fix this problem and you DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CARE! You guys just take our money and don't care anymore. So instead of fixing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you waste time on adding more dlc. Yeah thanks for take my money for a game that is 100% unplayable. And you can't refund the game either because you've played more than 2 hours. I think that this says alot about this company. This problem should be fixed IMMEDITALY! For real, you have a game that is not even playable, and it's been like that for DAYS/WEEKS! And i'm 100% sure that you are the only company that would'n't fix this right away. We have PAYED for a game that it's unplayable. And not only that, when it's working it HAS ♥♥♥♥ING 20 FPS! But yeah you can add more dlc instad of fixing the game so people can ACTUALLY PLAY IT!

Therefore I recommend this game to people to love motocross, well you don't have to love or like motocross but, you get the point. [Edited on 1/8/17.

												I had faith in Nordic Games to deliver a better product than Reflex and Alive, but they managed to release what feels like a poorly optimized, half-baked copy of Mx vs Atv Unleashed with the shoddiest ""rider control"" mechanics ever imagined. Physics seem to be made by someone who's never ridden a bike in their life. To top it off, the game looks like it's upscaled from 480p and runs at 20fps, and I max out Battlefront at 60fps. All in all, a failed attempt at a game and it'll get killed off by the CFO before it finishes development. 0/10Edit: I was asked to revisit the title after a supposed update to the game by the developers, and what I found is much better than the title I had before. However, do keep in mind that this took a good while, and at first my 30 dollars went down the drain. Now, i'd say 20 is a fair price for the game, given that it now has slightly better graphical options though very limited. However, if you can manage to catch this game and the dlc's on sale (50% or so) it's worth picking up and giving a shot. Physics are better although still considered childs play. Framerate has improved and 1440p is a welcome change (may not work for all, I have amd virtual supersampling). However, graphics still remain pretty aged, tracks are quite barren, and two-strokes are DLC only.			"

												UPDATE: In all fairness to Rainbow Studios, I promised to update this review if it changed. The game does seem to be running better now. The SX still drops occasionally, but it is nowhere near as bad as before and not too noticeable.I played one National event, and,  while not as smooth as I'd like, it is now playable and if you can deal with a few drops here and there, not bad. But also, having played the game more now, I do have a few complaints. Let's be honest, the DLC is a money grab here. Sell me the whole game up front. I get adding on new tracks as time goes by, but these were tracks released  on the original XBOX 360 and PS3 games, not brand spanking new. And having to pay for a bike that the competitor offers as standard is getting a little old. However, it is still a fun game. I bring up these issues in hopes that one day the developer will listen and I won't have to keep playing the lottery hoping I can win in order to fund the motocross game I'd like...you know, the tracks from the Lucas Oil Nationals and better physics. I mean, come on, I haven't played Budds Creek since Jeremy McGrath Supercross on the N64. GIVE THE PLAYERS WHAT THEY WANT, but I digress. If you like motocross/supercross, you'll like this game....hopefully they'll come out with a great sequel. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have to say I regret purchashing this game a little. I read the other reviews and said, ""Maybe they're crazy and it runs just fine."" And then I bought it and said ""Nope, I am crazy for thinking it will be different."" I have an NVIDIA GTX 960 with the game installed on a SSD and the frame rate drops are so horrible on the Nationals tracks that I can't stand to play it. The drops aren't too bad on Supercross style tracks, but it is annoying. Having said that, maybe if I upgrade my old AMD A6 processor and added more RAM, it might run better as I've noticed memory and CPU to be very,very high while running this game. Also, dropping some of the settings seems to have improved it a bit. Other newer games run just fine, so maybe this one is just not optimized for PC. I will say that the handling does seem to be improved from the XBOX 360 version. My rider no longer does 360s on the ground a lot and doesn't seem to cross jump like a goon all the time. Is it the same as MX Simulator? No. But honestly, I haven't fallen over in real life as much as my MX Sim guy, so take it as you will.  Is it the same as MXGP? Not really. The turning still doesn't feel as nice. But, you can throw way better whips....in that you can actually control a whip. If you all ready own it on 360 or PS3, it's probably a waste of your time, but I am lazy and don't feel like walking to the other side of the house to turn on my 360, so I have it on here. It's just the same game though, there's not really anything new for you. If you like motocross, well supercross, then it's a decent game, assuming you have an extremely powerful machine, maybe. I don't know, that frame rate thing could be present on all of them. Or I guess you could just wait for the May release of the Xbox One version and stream it to your PC. But I cannot honestly recommend it until it can be played without frame drops on a modest PC instead of a ""Dude, I future-proofed the crap of my system"" PC. I'll update this review if anything changes.			"

When I play it, even in 3rd person, it makes me feel like im actually jumping the bike in real life, which can be quite scary sometimes. I would reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the series and people who want to try something new who are primarily console players.			"

												If you want a MX game, get reflex instead. Somehow it looks better, gets better framerates, and handles way better than this. Plus you get a massive supply of user created content.Choppy framerate, promised fixes for PC but instead paid DLC released. Graphics are a blurred mess for myself and a lot of others.			"

								i do recommend this game but i would hold off for now until some big improvements come.I know that this game has alot of potential but at this point, the main 2 things that I believe need alot of attention/ improvement are:1 - Rider and bike physics. i ride bikes myself and the physics in this game are WAY too stiff. really need to bring back the reflex physics and tweek them a little more. (and maybe even let us do adjustments in the options) you should be able to do a decent whip but you cant do anything close to a real whip with this (at this stage of development) hopefully you guys are working on this.2 - Graphics. i'm really hoping you guys are going to improve on this. they really do need a HUGE improvement (in my opinion) .  the 1080p looks like 480p. this review is not to bad mouth the game, It is EARLY ACCESS after all. its just my input to you guys on the issues that i believe alot of us would really like you to address. i dont really think i will be playing this again until the physics and graphics are improved at the very least. keep up the good work though. will be looking forward to future updates.

												Well having loved Reflexso much I supported this one right from the get go and what a mistake that was. I was hoping for a better Reflex , updated graphics, new tracks, even better deformed terrain ect.What we finally ended up at the finish line was an ATV and bike only game that is incomplete as well. The terrain deformation is worse than Reflex, the handling a slight improvement, less options as far as tracks, vehicles and game modes. The graphics are a slight improvement and sound about the same.Then the coup de gras, micro transactions on bikes and pay for track DLC and even if you buy all that you still have a game that is less than Reflex in most ways, with the ""fun factor"" being the biggest one.Just go buy Reflex and have fun.

												I've been a big fan of the MX vs ATV series since I was a child but this is just an all round dissappointment, not at the gameplay but at the fact the game is one of the poorest performing PC games I've seen in a while. Along the line they released several ""optimisation updates"" which were meant to improve FPS but the reality is it did nothing for me and many other users. even though Nordic still know this is a problem, they have released £78.54 worth of DLC. It's annoying because on consoles this is a fantastic game but the PC support is appauling.			"

												More of a childrens game with no real world feel to it at all.  If you race you will know that bikes don't act like 4-wheelers in the front end sliding.  Bikes don't jump 300 million feet in supercross.  Stadiums, scaling, lane width are all just off the scale .  It's not a game for real racers young or old.  If I had an 8 year old child I'd let him or her play it, but I'm sure they'd think it was just too funny and fake as well.  Hope that nordic will take the genre seriously in the future, but their new track record is more on the cartoon side of racing.  Time will tell.			"

								Before I say anything about this game, keep in mind it is currently in ""Early Access"" and I understand the game ins't fully developed at this point.As someone who loved the MX vs. ATV ip back in the days of THQ (R.I.P.), this game follows up and creates a good experience although the game has changed quite a bit. Just like Reflex, you need to use both sticks to control your rider to completetion and I personally don't like it that much. It seems this game is more mechanics heavy over being just fun. It's much harder to fall off your vehicle though and it just feels so unrealistic as much as other parts of this game feel realistic. The AI isn't too smart and just lands everywhere, even ontop of you (you still don't bail). The game has no graphics options and even on an impressive PC it lags at some points. Speaking of graphics, they look great, but at this point the textures don't really ""pop"", but fade in the closer you get. I'm sad there isn't any outside tracks, and some tracks seem somewhat similar. A decent amount is there, but I really would like outside tracks. Customization is pretty good and vehicles have their own performance stats. You have to unlock quite a bit to play more or dress up with different outfits.Good game overall, but maybe wait until it's more stable...			"

Early Access Review
								I am relieved that there is a Supercross game out finally. Yes i know the old MX ATV titles had a supercross mode, but I was looking for a SX specific game. Yes the controls feel a bit weird and the bikes are slow at first. The physics are off and so far I havent managed falling off the bike yet even though some of the situations would have been catastrophic had the proper physics been in play. But for me at this very moment, could care less. In the future I am sure there will be more graphics options, better physics put into play and just more stuff. This game isn't scheduled to be released until Q4 of the gaming year. Look at this as a BETA and know that the end product will be different than this. If you like Reflex, I'm sure you still have Reflex. Test this game, report to Nordic, and enjoy. If you want a more refined MX game, go purchase MXGP. It's on sale. If you want to finally play another MX ATV game since it has been forever since the PC has seen one, get this game. If you buy an Early Access game, lower your starting standards. $20 isn't much money to test a game for 3-6 months. If it is a lot of money to you, then I suggest waiting for future releases.			"

												UPDATE: UN-OPTIMIZED PILE OF S***I had to re-write all this. I think this is a issue with everyone, But the crashes seem to stop after putting some game time in. Mine completely stopped crashing after completing all 4 tracks. Now when I started I had put in 50 minutes, I never knew how to pre load until I accidently completed a successful pre load. Now I'm having tons of fun! This game has better physics than Reflex IMO. You don't slide every corner as if you was riding ice but you turn in and it feels more fluid. The A.I. are very well made and a decent challenge for anyone on any difficulty, Would like the 450cc, Not sure if it's locked due to Early Access or I have to unlock it but this game is getting more and more fun! Can't wait for full release!			"

								This game is a very weird blend between Unleased and Alive. The game plays fine, nothing over the top or revolutionary. At times it will confuse you on how things actually work but it will smooth out with time. Limited stuff if you are coming from Reflex. Not quite worth the $20 it is listed at but if you are willing to put in the time to learn the game it can be worth it.			"

								It's only an early accsess game, so we can't expect everything is fine. My first impression was good, but the game has huge lags (and I have a good PC). Reflex, for example, is working well without such big framedrops. I hope this will be fixed in later versions, because I want to enjoy the whole game without these lags. The little time I have played (and when it worked well with minimal graphics) was really funny. The design of the tracks is very good. And I wish there will be more soon :D Also the customized character/bike looks good and offers lots of opportunities.Only the controls feels not so nice. They are really slow and kinda motionless. In Relfex it was a lot qiucker and feels much better then in Supercross Encore. I would be great, if you can change that. It would make more fun to play :)I'm wating for more ^^And sorry for my (maybe) bad English, I'm from Germany ;)			"

												if you liked MX vs ATV Reflex you wont like this one because it has physics that make it near impossable to fall off your bike where as in Reflex it felt like if you made a mistake you would fall but it would be only your fault but in this game i have been blindsided by other ""guys"" and i would not even seem to flinch let alone fall off the bike the physics are all wrong and the visual ""fedelity"" is not anything like the last game (reflex) the game seems some what out of focus and some how it runs less smoothly than its predicessor (reflex would stay at or above 60fps and do it well) this game just seems to find it hard to even stay at 60fps  (and i have a GTX 980ti and a intel i5 4590 @ 3.3ghz and i get frame drops really bad) all in all it needs to look at its past incarnation and see where it went wrong but as of now i dont reccomend you get it			"

												The game itself is pretty fun, but to play online is a pain in the ♥♥♥. There should be a much better way to search and find servers. Not this auto bull ♥♥♥♥.

												""Oh no, the game isn't like Reflex! I won't recommend!""Shut the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, nothing will be like it for a while.Although I will say, Nordic did try to bounce this game back from Alive, which I will say, nobody can defend that game. It's just awful. Supercross, on the other hand, is alright. Yes, I wouldn't really describe this game as a simulator, but that's not the point. Supercross has a decent amount of content right off the bat. It fixed many problems Alive had: a Career Mode, starter tracks when you start up the game, and actually a bit more content.I'm not saying this game is perfect, though. They removed the Rider Reflex thing where you crash, you have to flick the stick in the direction of the arrow to save yourself. Now, it's just automatic. This kinda blows, since it dullens your senses to not be on your toes when you are in a race. Also, I've noticed that scrubs and whips are harder to pull off in this game than Reflex. This is probably an issue with the Alive engine as well, but they arn't impossible. They are just tricker to pull off, and they don't feel fluid. The last issue I had with this game is that they reuse all of Alive's free content. Nordic didn't make any new Motocross stages, they just ripped them from Alive, as well as the 2 Free Ride stages. This is kinda lazy on their part. I don't want to be reminded of Alive, because that game is a ♥♥♥♥♥torm.It's also worth mentioning that although this game is the Encore edition, which means that this version has all of the downloadable content, there's still DLC to buy. What? I know that DLC is easy to make money off of, but just add it to the base game and bump the price up a little bit. Good lord.To finish it off, Supercross isn't good, nor bad. On the list of favorite games in the MVA series, this game is right in the middle, between Unleashed on the upper end, and Untamed on the lower end. I don't really thing this game is worth the $30, just get it off of {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com or during the sales, like I did.7/10, good come back from Nordic, but it can use some more polish.			"

												I'm glad I took a chance and bought this (on sale), despite all of the negative reviews.  Basically, it feels like mx vs atv supercross on the 360/ps3, except they cleaned up the handling a bit (feels like I have some traction now) and threw in the motocross tracks from alive.  I love reflex, but the 90mph tracks and doing a forward or back flip off of a tuff block at 10-20mph really got old.  This game has some quirks for sure, but I'm enjoying it.  For example, as with the console version, there are rare phantom inputs that will steer me off course, or throw my rider way forward off a jump.  Also, I can really feel the loss of forward speed (like crazy wind resistance) in the air.  On the other hand, though, I like the tighter tracks (especially the outdoor tracks from alive), the fact that I actually need the brakes, and the handling in the turns.  The clutch is crazy op as others say, but I like that I can goof a turn and make up for it with that.As for the graphics, maybe some people are reviewing the game without launching the graphics settings program first (a seperate thing for some reason, just like reflex)?  I played at 4k and other than the inconsistent framerate and some lod popping, it looked just as good as reflex to me (even better in some places where texture resolution is higher and meshes have more detail).  I think rainbow/nordic REALLY need to force the settings program to launch before the first play, because the default settings look terrible, and leave a bad first impression.As a fan of the series since the first motocross madness, I would have preferred that rainbow just tighten up the tracks and ease up on the crash-if-someone-nudges-me physics in reflex to make a follow-up game (instead of completely changing the engine for alive/supercross), but I'm definitely not in agreement with the chorus of bad reviews this game is getting.  Get it on sale if you have some doubts, but don't even launch the game without changing the graphics settings first (unless you want to get a laugh or something).			"

												Well, I took the time to bend over, and just ♥♥♥♥ all over this game in my intial reivew with about 6 hours.And don't get me wrong, this game isnt near reflex or alive, HOWEVERIt really isnt that bad,Is the aircontrol good? - NoIs the clutch boost OP- Hell YeahAre the tracks super flowy- Not reallyBUT, This game truely isnt that bad. I have had a genuiely good time playing this game. The AI can be somewhat competitive and the NAT tracks are MINTThe Supercross tracks are pretty linear in the sense that there is a set way to hit them and doing it in another way is a bit awkward.The Striaght rythem is also a blast becuase I find them a bit less linear then the actual Supercross tracks.The Gear and bike part selection is awesome, huge selection and always fun to customize the bikes.This game is good.Is it reflex - nois it alive - noBut its supercross. and you have to enjoy it for being a goofy game that you can rip in and have some fun battles. IF you take away the ""Mx vs Atv"" Its a good game. But its not a traditional MVA, its far more arcade like.I can get around all the games little issues, however this game is CASH-♥♥♥♥♥ game.WHEN I HAVE TO PAY FOR 2 SMOKES, THERE IS A PROBELM.NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THESE TRACKS ARE JUST RE-CODED AND COPE/PASTED FROM ALIVEWHY AM I PAYING FOR CONTENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME TO BEGIN WITH I MEAN WTF NORDIC? ARE YOU REALLY GONNA REPACKAGE THE SAME ♥♥♥♥, SLAP A DIFFRENT NAME ON IT AND CALL IT A NEW GAME? AND THEN NOT ONLY THAT, EXPECT US TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE CONTENT YOU ACTUALLY MADE???Other then the money sucking, greedy, microtransaction tom ♥♥♥♥-ery, that makes me hate nordic; I am very please with this gameIts Not and MVA, but it is a arcade blast of bar bashing fun, and a decent all around. + if you work hard enough, you actually can throw down an ok scrub/whip :>. $30 is a bit much espically regarding the fact that you will have quite a few micro-transactions to work through, I would recommend buying on sale. But if you are dead set on buying this game now, and you dont mind an arcade experience, then go for it. Otherwise, wait for the sale, and pick this up, you wont regret it.Note: Graphics are greatly improved and very attractive, and FPS has raised quite a bit for me with recent optimization*I am willing to bet a large sum of money that within the third screenscreen were someone is throwing down a sick-nasty whip, that he most certainly did not land that. He more then likley did an automatic front flip and bashed his face into the floor in true MVA Supercross fashion*			"

								This game is actually pretty fun.  A xbox controller is  highly recommended.  Ive played through the first four courses so far and have actually pulled off a 1st and 2nd place finish.  The game doesn't look bad.  The rider models are pretty good, but could use a little refinement.  Maybe some higher resolution textures (I'm running the game at 2560x1440).  I have experienced one crash so far and I believe it was because I had crossfire enabled even for games without a crossfile profile.  Its a checkbox in the Catalyst settings.  So far so good.  I can't wait to see what improvements are made along the way.  I feel like I'm getting my money's worth so far.			"

												Good looking bikes and tracks. upated review after patch.   I logged back in to give it another go after the patch and I noticed immediately the graphic improvements on the bikes, rider and tracks. Also I can play the straight rythem tracks now without fps issues. The boost is less aggressive. The whips/scrubs are much improved and it is easier to get back to land properly. I have a decent pc I5 with a 670 gtx so I can run full 1080p but havent tried all the filtering. Great work on the update Rainbow. What are the plans for the 2016 SX tracks being released and possibly even doing the nationals? I take back by initial review for those that happen to read this. It is significantly more enjoyable after the update. The amount of tracks is pretty nice considering reflex didn't have a ton.			"

Early Access Review
								If you've played MX vs ATV Reflex or MX vs ATV Alive before, this game (at least this Early Access version only) is far from being a worth playing for more than half an hour. I say Alive or Reflex already had great gameplays. I hope the Encore can prove that its better.UPDATEOn the Encore non-early access, it's running 30-45fps on supercross tracks and 15-20fps on nationals. So slow on nationals that I can see trees popping into existence. Max settings at 1080p.I have 1GB VRAM, 3.4Ghz quad CPU. I'm waiting for the next performance improvement patch			"

												  While this version of the MX vs ATV series is an upgrade from Alive and Reflex it has some serious performance issues that need to be addressed soon.    On a gaming system that dwarfs the recommended specs this game has problems maintaining a framerate over 30 most of the time and can be unplayble both in Multiplayer and the career mode.  No matter what settings are applied you still get the same horrid performance.   Hopfully Nordic/ Rainbow will release a fix for this soon because I doubt people are going to continue to purchase DLC for a game that is clearly broken.   Other than the obvious framerate problems the game is a step up from reflex and an inprovement over Alive.   When running smooth, the gameplay is very fun and the online multiplayer racing is very addictive.    If you're a hardcore motocross / supercross fan...  this is a must have.			"

Early Access Review
								game is very fun. The physics have changed quite a bit, but it did not take long to get used to them (coming from Alive). Not many people play online though and there is usually no more than 4 people on a server. I think this game was released to early. Playing the game feels unfinished. I have problems with it crashing during races and worst of all, what is causing me to qrite this review. I was online when a server crashed, and I LOST EVERYTHING. ALL 10 HOURS OF WORK DOWN THE DRAIN. I was fast too (not to brag)! I wish they would have waited. The game IS fun, but at the end of the day, it isn't finished. As for comparing this game with the previous mx vs atv games, the only other one I have is alive, and all I can say is that they're different. In conclusion, for now, I do not recommend this game because it simply is not finished. If I knew that I  could potentially lose everything I worked for, I would not have bought this game until after the Early Access. When this whole Early Access unfinished game is gone though, I would recommend it. Hope this cleared things up :)			"

								I have been waiting for this game for a very long time, so naturally when I saw this encore verison, I bought it. What a huge dissapointment! The physics are horrible, terrible, there are not enough words for how bad the physics are. Compared to previous mx vs atv and the newer MXGP (which is awesome), this is like playing a 99 cent side scroller on my phone.I will be extremely hesitant in buying the full version now, probably wait until it's twenty bucks a year from release.

								I REALLY like the MX... series. And I really liked Reflex. I even bought this game on Xbox because I wanted to play it and it got delayed. So.... I initially thought they need more time to release it in a playable version.Soooooo what do you get when you buy the game now(8th of March 2015)?It in fact is a version of the game that is ported from console using the same ""program"" that was used for Reflex. You have to start a exernal program to change the settings, if you can call it that. the only thing you can do in the graphics menu is change the resolution and toggle fullscreen, Thats it.Ok could still be not that bad considering that Reflex was playable on PC after Nordic did the last patch. WRONG! I really hate hating the game for this since it is still early-access but they really had enough time. WHAT IS/COULD BE RIGHT WITH THIS GAME:- It didn't stutter/lag, at least not in the breaks between game-crashes (i7 4790k, HD7970)- It felt kinda like the console versionWHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME:-There is no career mode -The bikes have different stats than in the console version-You can only play the first 4 tracks because you have to play career to unlock more-The graphics are WORSE than the console version-I don't really know anything else because it crashed 2 times within 30min(don't ask me why Steam thinks I only played it 5min idk) and I really don't want to play it again before the next patchDo I like this game?MAYBE. I'll tick no first because right now it really is more or less unplayable. But it has a lot of potential.			"

								My honest opinon? I wish I would have torrented it first. Probably would have deleted the torrent or rarely played it. I put in one race and it is utter ♥♥♥♥. Graphics suck, handling is horrendus, etc.. It is really sad the state motorcross and motorcycle racing games are in. The best MX game in my opinion has to be MXGP, which not only has better graphics, handling and I think is more fun, it is almost half the price. I will wait to see what this new content update brings. I understand that this is an early release but cmon devs', make this a good game.EDIT: I'm not saying MXGP is perfect either, but if MX vs ATV could adopt the handling that MXGP has, it would become a very good game.

								Ok - I'm a firm believer in the early access titles.  If something doesn't feel right you can give feedback and most likely the forum of ill repute will agree with you.  I love love love love loved the last MX / ATV -- complete with the crazy trucks and tracks throught he mud and woods and craziness.  I'm not all that much for the inside tracks.  I can move the rider as I need to, the sluggishness mentioned below is because they weren't using the other stick (which controls the pitch of the rider) so you can lean into corners, lean forward in to corners, lean backward in to corners (why?! - cause you can) and it's very responsive.  Something else you'll note (and I loved this about the last game too) is the tracks you make are not just graphic decals.  They're actual impressions in the surface of the track, you can (and will) get bumped by them, get unintended air, and be thrown off by them or even led on rails through them if you hit them right.  I think this is genious and should be a part of any racing game - car or otherwise that has anything remotely to do with DiRT.It's a solid $25 -- I want to see less supercross, more outdoors cross... forget what the menu said... and here I end with dumb.

												I have read through the comments and it appears to me,that many people haven't understood the idea behind an alpha release.Off course it looks as if it came directly out of 2001 and off courseit's buggy as hell, but this is only supposed to get them some money whilestdeveloping it and it enables them to communicate with their community.I have played MX vs ATV Reflex a lot about 60 hours and I have played Untaimedand Alive together with Friends I have also played the MXGP Game for quite a while.I think that this game really shows potential,Reflex has a great System to controll your pilot,but it has major flaws, it is superhard to drive in a straight line and the collissionsare ♥♥♥♥, whenever you even touch an object or another rider you have an instant accident.This is much better in this game,allready at this hopefully early stage.I advise fans of the genre and the series to buy it,since it is pretty cheap at the momentand if they tweak up the grafics and make it run smoothlyit's easily going to become the best instalement of the series.

								Game is alot of fun once you get used to it. Yes it needs some fixes and performance optimization, but I trust they will sort it out. Please suppport Nordic so that they can make us a better game !Will recommend this to anyone who is bored of Reflex and is looking for a new challenge.The only thing that I ask the developers is to alter the physics in the game to be more free and not so stiff. And please use more of the terrain deformation like in Reflex.If you guys can do that this game wil be a hit !			"

First off the game physics sucks and the grafics are ok, the cluch is overpowered and the backflips are way to easy.This game has the ponential to be a #1 motorcross game if they could let the community do their own maps and skins, fix the engine-system so you can run the game without any fps drops and then start to better up the physics.

								To begin, this is early access, so there is a certain level of forgiveness towards the games quality. The graphics are pretty nice but not the best. The music is alright, certainly needs more though. The physics are awkward, and need serious tuning but it is doable, better than Alive on consoles. The framerate however is awful outside of free roam especially on the new nationals tracks, most likely due to lack of optimization that i'm sure will come soon. I do recommend this game however with the outlook that it will improve as it moves out of early access at some point!			"

												So for someone who comes from the background of playing racing titles mainly made by Codemasters, & Milestone I didn't expect much for this game.Was I right? Simply put, no.This game from what it seems is a Remastered Edition of MX vs. ATV Supercross converted to run on Higher End Systems, or just to bring the game to life with a few nifty updates. That, said, this is my first visit with these titles and I'm pleasantly surprised by the game.It definitely fits into a niche crowd with people who just adore arcade style racers, people who wanna blow off time, and for others who are simply looking for an offroad game.It provides, with things like the ever so beloved AI who can never seem to decide what part of the track they wanna take, let alone if they want to be in a straight line they'd rather scope out their own trail for the course.It also maintains itself with an interesting take on outdoors style tracks, something the original version of the game didn't contain. It truly lets you filter your adventuring.Mixed racing, & other sorts to provide you with different style challenges, and learning to share a track with a quad-biker who just wants to try and cut your line off every time you catch him with his pants down.I personally jumped into this game wanting a different experience, and telling myself I'd never actually lay hands on this game.I EAT MY WORDS BIG TIME. I was in search of a game that gave me mixed racing, and just an over all fun time, nothing to be taken seriously.I can slightly copare this game to its younger brother MX vs. ATV Reflex as I bought it and played them side by side just to have more games to jump along and play.I will say the two handle nothing at all like each other, and if you want to grab it just be expecting a more light feeling bike, and looser ATV's that seem to get stuck in one direction when riding through the carved patterns of someone elses bike. Besides that, it doesn't get itself too lost and feels slightly like the MXGP Bikes, both ATV, & MX.Tricks, tracks, jumps, whips, all included. You won't be let down.I really do recommend this game, but I'll add that it is choppy even for higher running rigs, mine being a computer that sits in the middle of every OP machine.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought Reflex for €4.99 during the sale and after playing that all the way through for the first time (have played demos in 2010) I was impressed with the game. I bought Supercross Encore and I like it as much as Reflex, In EA there are no real world bikes and the free roam is limited. I do however love the 1st person view, it makes me feel like I was on my own bike (although I have never ridden a supercross track); it would be nice to draw and render above the elbows. TBH even in rookie I am not as good as I was in Reflex, it would be good to have some tutorials and or ideal line and throttle so that I can get the power and speed right for the jumps and not lose as much.If you’re a fan of MX vs ATV, the EA worth it. If you want an awesome MX game you can spend hours with, play reflex and wait for the full game. If not look up Pure. "

 FIX THE FLAPPING GIRLS  They're lo-res, dressed ugly and move like a fidget alpaca.It's an improvement on the beta, no doubt. Playing for the first few hours I wasn't impressed... After spending some time and getting used to the mechanics I was finally coming around and think the gameplay is easy to learn, hard to perfect. If you go spa-stic on the right stick expect to look spa-stic. Control yourself and the steez will grow strong over time and the flow will come ;) AI  - Fun when you're battling but very slow, even on the hardest setting.  (Once you upgrade your bikes) Vanilla Tracks  - Alternate lines work well, overall good variety and fun, not too wide open and unrealistic, stadiums are brutally bland with no personality, 30sec girls look like trannies and/or shazza's. Downloadable Tracks  - Awesome. Even if you purchase just for that inside line a lot of the tracks have, it's great. Better features and just well made overall (some are lacking). Stadiums are still ♥♥♥♥ and the girls are still androgynous but the added variety is a good thing. JS7 sx tracks work as real race tracks now (ALiVe (N)) and feel great, please add more like this, they're technical and perfect. Downloadable Bikes  - Just get them, they're OEM (KTM & Husky) and the real deal. Career mode has AIDs  ATV's have AIDs  Online has nothing because it's not even a thing.  Modders help. Overall - I enjoy this game but miss the competitive online comps which you really need once the game has been clocked. Oh - take the flapping ATV's out, does anyone actually even use them? thought not...  "

								Mx vs Atv supercross is a good game in its own way. I've always loved the series and i've played reflex the most. The driving mechanics are good but the game has almost only supercross tracks (Yeah the name is supercross) But yeah it would be much more funnier with freemode more national races, More bikes there aint many bikes on the game and the upgrades are hard to get so you'll be stucked with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bike for a while but its a good game :) 7/10			"

								Well so far for the pc version there is no way to program keyboard there is just a picture of a controller and multiple profiles   for controller in controls options.. The traditional : W,S,A,D  work for direction and braking but thats about it.. This works fine in carreer mode, but when racing online against someone who has a controller and clutch with gear controll , you get destroyed at the start gate  as they can keep their revs up with clutch in and then just launch  away in 2nd gear and you can kiss the race good bye!  just like real life!  Hopefuly this gets fixed in a future patch..  Also hope you can use something  different than xbox 360 controller!  Microsoft should not have a monopoly on this game.. Its kind of like EA developers having the brilliance to only allow 3 wireless routers to function properly in BF3..  Anyway please dont allow  ""partial controller support"" to be xbox 360 controller  only !! after game is completed.. I still cant use my saitek controller on MX vs. ATV reflex but it works perfectly in MX GP , please dont let this be the case for ENCORE, this game is to damn fun!			"

												This is a pretty good game.  Its not as bad as people are making it out to be, Ive played the mx series since unleashed and this is not at the bottom of the barrel.  The whips are ok and almost realistic in a sense as they arent like reflex whips where you can throw the bike like its a toy but they are where you have to use some effort to get them out and to bring them back.  In order to have fun with Supercross though you have to put some time into it and get some upgraded bikes and treat the game as its own game, meaning you cant compare it to say reflex or untamed for example.  The only thing I can say about the game that is negative is the fps lag on the outdoor and rythm racing series'. My computer is strong enough to run this game at max settings (I have an AMD fx6300, GTX 960, and 8 gigs of ram) but it tops out at like 25 fps on outdoors and rythm racing.  Other than that this game is very good and I strongly recommend trying it out!			"

												I grew up racing motocross and playing the entire mx vs atv line of games...so, all the bad reviews are people that are still stuck on reflex. Lets just get this out of the way. THE GAME IS NOT LIKE REFLEX AND THERE WONT BE ONE LIKE REFLEX. The simple reason is because, the coding for reflex was done by an outsourced facility by thq and when thq went bankrupt, the coding for reflex was lost. Now fast forward to Nordic buying the franchise...they had to completely re-write the code for this game, To try and match reflex as best as possible, but without the original people that made the reflex code that was going to be almost impossible. This game isn't bad at all...you have to unlock pretty much everything (like how games use to be) and once you unlock everything, the game becomes a lot better. The only bad thing I will say is playing on PC, you have no graphics options whatsoever. Other than that it's a fun game.			"

												I really don't know what I have just seen! And I can't understand why this ""game"" exists! I came from MXGP Series therefore I guess I have some quality standards.I mean the graphics resembles the early 2000 years, the physics is utterly ridiculous, the first person camera view is garbage and overall the controls are nightmare. After playing MXGP Series, FIM Speedway Grand Prix 15 or even Reflex all I can say that this release belongs to the trash bin. Even the arcade FUEL or Nail'd is a way better bargain!I find it unacceptable that companies are allowed to release such junk products for such a high price tag! Absolutely mindblowing!Refunded after like 15 minutes of gameplay. Worst motocross game I've ever played including early browser-based flash games under Internet Explorer 6.			"

								Honestly, as a Reflex fan this game is a let down, but there are things I like about it, and things I absolutely hate! HATE:1.PRELOAD - Remove it from the game, it is like going backwards in the evolution of gaming, and has nothing to do with real life riding, as others have suggested just make it so you pull back to seat bounce. (like in real life!)2.JUMP OFF THE STARTING LINE - Remove it from the game, he has enough boost using the clutch, why did you put such an UNREALISTIC start to the riders right when the gate drops?, it is like the rider is in a sling shot! Totally unrealistic!3.TUFF BLOCKS OBJECT COLLISION - Modify this code, When you hit a TUFF BLOCK the rider just stops, like he has hit an invisible wall and he just stays straight, no angular collision movement and totally unrealistic consequences to running into this object, Reflex was way more believable!4.CONTROLLER SETTINGS, FORCE FEEDBACK IS NOT AN OPTION - Fix it, give us the option to turn off game pad force feedback.5.PHYSICS - THE WHIP - This is the biggest gripe I have about the game, put the REFLEX whip back into this game and you will have a major hit on your hands! The whip in this game is very dumb feeling and totally goes backwards in the evolution of this franchise.Those are the MUST FIX for me, there are more but that would fix your game and would show respect to your future Target Market Fans.LIKE:1.CLUTCH action - Awesome!, at least it works and is more apparent than the reflex clutch which really does not work very well.2.TRACKS - Awesome! 3.TEXTURES - Awesome! Visually, you guys really improved on this, I build tracks for reflex and I can really respect the advance in the texture quality, very real looking!4.OBJECTS - Awesome! Visually very real looking! 5.GRAPHICS - Awesome! Game plays and looks great!			"

								I wanted to like this game to be completely honest, it was a very disappointing buy.Bought this game very skeptically since all the reviews were mixed, plus it was on sale. All I can say is that the developers need to make this game free to play because it is not worth $24.99. I would not recommend this game to anyone with any PC build below high end ($1000+) I have a $900 PC, 0.9 hours was about all i could take of this to be honest. So should you decide to buy this game, just know this:- Keyboard and mouse controls are impossible, you WILL need a controller.- OK Graphics and effects, they try to hide a lot of the texture and effect flaws with motion blur.- Crappy animations.- VERY bad optimization.- Chase camera is very weird at times.- A few noticeable bugs here and there.- Most graphics are locked so good luck with that.- Physics are buggy.- Scale on most objects are off, or so it seems to me.Overall, this is a step back from Reflex; and yes, before you go and comment that, ""Its only early access!!"" I understand that, but its been two months since its own release and it's still one of the buggiest and laziest executed Early Access games that I've ever seen. If you're planning on buying this, I would hold off until the developers fix everything and it starts getting more positive reviews.			"

Framerate issues, my computer has a fx8350 and a gtx 660ti, the game stutters and have fps drops everywhere, the graphics are not as shown in screenshots, they are worst, there´s a weird phantom terrain and Ao is grainy as ♥♥♥♥, you can literally see the dots.2.physics are suppossed to be easyer to newbies and casual gamers, the new physics are reworked from alive, the clutch gives you a super boost forward, no matter how much times you press it, the preload gives you a thruster effect, you are catapulted upwards, both are pretty inconsistent, so the lines in a track are almost never the same ones, no matter how much you try.3-crashes, god, you can land a 60mt triple or quad short with the front wheel and ride away! :OI really hope they fix this, i bought this game hoping the best, now i can tell is crap :(			"

Great for single player, but online is dead. :( Kinda sad. Could be a greater game than it already is with a little work (ex: sometimes you spin right around in corners, AI is kind of wack sometimes.. jumping into your lane, going the other way)Other than that, if you like to braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap I'd recommend it. People say Reflex is the greatest but I'd prefer this one. Get it on sale before the price gets steep again.

								As a long time fan of the mx and mx vs atv games, I really am disappointed in this game. I remember watching a video of a dev talking about how they were using the reflex engine, yet here we are with an alive clone that plays like a crap mx game you'd download for free on your iphone. I really want this game to go somewhere and not waste my 20 bucks, so I'll list things I find to be poorly done.-So far I've played 3 races, after that I can't play more than 2-3 laps without the game shutting off. no crash message, nothing. Just ♥♥♥♥♥ off and goes to desktop.-The AI is inconsistant as hell, theres times I'll easily put 5-10 seconds on the AI, then they randomly come out of nowhere and pass me, when I didn't make a mistake.-The controls are sluggish feeling, it feels like something out of a game I played long ago, Big motha truckers. I don't want to feel like I'm driving a semi when I'm playing an MX game.-When you jump, it feels like you slow down and just fall out of the air, that isn't how it works, and isn't how it should look/feel.-Preloading feels more like a forward boost, using it in the woops section effectively turns you into a superhero. If you fix the problem stated previously of slowing down and falling out of the air, you wouldn't need the forward boost to make the jumps in a preload, just the upward boost.-The wheelies make me sad. If you don't know what I mean, go into the game and try a wheelie.-The WAIT. I was really expecting something good with how much the game was hyped up for a while, especially now that it's been delayed so much. If you want people to remain interested, you have to keep them up to date, at least a little information every few weeks would be cool. You can't expect people to be happy when you make them wait this long, and give them next to no information so there is no feedback from the fans until you are just about ready to launch the game.

												Great game!  Do not be fooled by people rating it down with only like 10 hours on record lol....  These games take time I have always been a fan of the series and this game brought on new tracks and bike tuning so you have to get the feel for it all over again, but once you do its pretty awesome.   I love how they fixed the helmet camera view and made that more stable.   Thats how I play this 24/7.  Whips, scrubs, everything is in FPV.  I love it!			"

								i think this is the worst mx vx atv so far, and yes i know it's an early release but here is some things you need to work on-riding physics are really bad, it doesent feel realistic at all like in mxgp-more graphic settings (now there is only resolution and if you want to play the game in full screen)-make a free roam that you can just ride in  a forest or desert like in reflex ( and make it available for multiplayer too)-change the menu that it doesent look like you play on xbox-when you reverse, you run like 40kmh :D..-make it better for low end computers-add more bikes-enduro races would be a really good experience that hasn't been used in games yet-didn't find much positive things about the game, if you fix the problems listed then it would be perfect :).Thanks.

												Encore is much better than Alive for the consoles. Plenty of sx tracks and all of the nationals from Alive are here. The new rythm racing is cool, even though it's not true one vs one bracket elimination. New hi-res models and updated gear keep the content current. Some users complain if frame rate issues, but this is being worked on. Definitely a game worth having with the dlc coming out soon.			"

												Update: Rainbow released an optimization update, the game now runs at around 60fps most of the time. It could use more but it's definately playable now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:MX vs. ATV is back. The question is, is it good?The answer is, kind of.MvA Supercross Encore (long enough title?) Is an updated version of 2014's Mva Supercross originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3. The game features updated visuals, rider gear, bikes, Nationals tracks from MvA Alive, and a new event called Rhythm Racing. The game also retains the tracks from the 2014 Supercross release. The handling of the bikes was very clearly overhauled since the release of the early access version, and you can actually whip bikes around quite a bit now. Leaning into turns was drastically changed, you're able to slide around a lot more than you could before. The tracks look nice and are fun to play. Now, why is this game 'kind of' good?The optimization is downright horrible. Really. On a GTX 680 and a Core i7, you'd think I could run this game no problem, that is NOT the case. Most tracks run at around 40-50 FPS, often dropping into the low 20s. I just can't get my head around why the optimization is so bad. Reflex had very good optimization and ran like a dream. This game, is sluggish at best, unfortunately. It really is a shame, as the new physics are actually pretty fun to play with.Honestly, with the optimization how bad it is right now, I simply cannot reccomend this game. Yes, the tracks are fun and flow well. Yes, the new features are really nice. But the optimization is really dragging it down and I hope it gets improved within reasonable time.			"

												game is good overall. Physics feel good. Only thing that I feel is lacking is the graphics. A lot of it feels like and probably is a port from the first mx vs atv supercross and mx vs atv alive which is what feels like the graphics is lacking. In the rythem with that being new to this game the graphics in my opinion are better then the rest of the game which is kind of weird.			"

												I have always been a big fan of the Mx Vs. Atv games, along with all the other motocross games made by different companies, and this game was no different. Most people said this game was basically a reskinned version of Alive and I can't really argue with them cause for the most part they are right, however I felt the non-encore edition (back on the last gen consoles) felt more like Alive, but with the newer physics of the Encore edition it doesn't feel so much like Alive did,but it still has that Alive feeling (if that makes any sense). Now, I do wish they would release more gear, that you don't have to pay for, cause I, like most motocross fans, would like to see the new gear implemented into this game. With all that being said, I do believe it's a good game overall but I do not believe it's worth $29.99 due to the fact you can get a better motocross experience on other games such as Mx Sim and Reflex (yes, I do know Sim is $41 and Reflex is $20, I do not believe either of them are worth that but they do give more of a motocross experience, but if Reflex would have had the 250W, 250E, and 450 SX and MX career modes with points rather than just jumping in and having all the bikes after a few races Reflex would have been close to the best MX Vs. ATV game, and Sim is hard to get used to and setup but once you get it all figured out it is super fun.) This was too long of a review and I can never get those few minutes back, but thankfully I am that much closer to death so I have that to look forward to.  And I have played this game more than 1.1hrs on other platforms and other PCs, so please do not say, ""You don't know what you're talking about cause you only have 1.1 hours into the game, retard."" cause I will race you and win, thanks.
