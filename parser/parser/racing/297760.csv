												TL:DR - Its too expensive for what you get. Its not terrible, in fact the first hour or so is fun, but definitely not worth the price. Especially once you realize that when you've seen the two types of track youve pretty much seen everything the game has to offer.So I love ancient Rome. An ancient Rome chariot racing game is an awesome idea. It reminds me of the chariot race missions in Shadow of Rome. (A really really fun PS2 game. If you are a fan of gladiator games, get it!  And enjoy cutting people's arms off, beating them with it, then tossing it into the crowd..) But this review isnt about Shadow of Rome. Its about Qvadriga. Which unfortunately, is no where near as cool as the concept could be. Now, I wouldnt have as much of a problem with it if it wasn't 20 freakin' dollars. So what do you get for 20 dollars? A tiny-graphic boring game. I normally dont really care about graphics if the gameplay is engrossing, but this game unfortunately lacks that quality, so all you keep on thinking were damn, this would be cool if it actually had decent images of the action.So a basic rundown. You start, and pick your faction. Different factions have different abilities that are explained in tooltips. Some are stronger, faster, can handle their chariots better. Then a map appears with different regions. There are many different regions, each with different tracks in them. Lots of tracks to run on with many random events is a giant plus, except for one issue which shall be explained later.When you start, you can pick one region, and each region has 1 track unlocked. Then a screen where you can look at your  charioteers, get vet services, repairs and healing, and upgrade your horses and chariots. Heres the kicker. Once you pick your first track, you cannot leave it until you get your ""fame"" up enough from racing. So if you pick a hard as hell track (as I did my first try), youre pretty much stuck. Pick which charioteer you want to race with, and you are off.The graphics are really simple, a top down view of chariots on a track. Looks like tiny mobile game graphics. There are two modes, one where the action stops every 10 seconds to give a command, one where it doesnt but you still only are give a command every so often. The commands are accelerate (to a certain level, then you can't), brake, crash right/left (slam your chariot into an opponent a la ben hur), lacerate (whip an opponent), small/medium/large move left or right (each one moves you farther across the lanes), watch for attacks (basically a block) and control (basically do nothing, but it makes your control go up), and finally whip (allows your horses to get a burst of speed, but you can hurt them).There are many different tracks to race on, some narrow, some larger. Each track has a brief paragraph about its history. Every time you race there are slighty different variables on the track, described in a simple sentence before the race. Theres lots of these, both bad and good and they provide some variety.Youre going to need it. This game is grindy as hell. See, you get money for racing, more if you win. You use this money to buy better guys, horses and chariots. You also need to pay for vet and repairs from racing damage. Each wheel, horse, and charioteer has a life bar. Take too much damage, and a horse dies, leaving you to pull with 3. Go too fast, and your wheel gets damaged. Go too fast around a corner and you can topple your chariot, leaving your guy to be dragged by his horses. You then have the option of running (and the other guys can hit you, or hanging on till youre in a safe spot to run.There are stats, represented by icons. The different stats ccombine to make the upgrades (say a horse with two speed icons vs a horse with 1 speed and 1 endurance - which one do you want.. The two speed will be faster but weaker than the 1 speed 1 endurance)But theres only 6 guy types (stats: skill - how good of a driver you are, and constitution - how much damage you can take) and 9 horse types (stats: speed - top speed, and endurance - same as con but for the horse) and 9 chariot types( stats: acceleration and size, again same as con but for the chariot). And they are expensive as hell. It also costs money to travel from track to track, and you can't race certain tracks till you get more famous. So you will probably doing the same race over and over just to get enough cash to go somewhere else. Theres two types of track, a tight oval type and a longer wider type. Except for this, there is absolutely nothing to differentiate them.A $20 game this is not. It can be fun for a little bit, and if it had some kind of multiplayer it'd be pretty fun. But as it is, its just boring after the first hour or so.			"

												Okay, Qvadriga doesn't even look old, it looks completely ancient, and the concept of a turn-based top-down simulation of chariot racing isn't exactly mainstream. But don't judge a game on your first impression as you wouldn't judge a book by its cover (I have a feeling you'd like books as much as I do if you've come here). This game delivers unexpected levels of tactical depth and attention to details, and truly deserves its sale price if not its full price.The core gameplay is based on managing your speed and taking the decision to whip your horses to push them over their limits, or whip your opponents to incapacitate them, ram their chariots, cripple their horses, trample your dismounted rivals - playing it brutal is all part of the games, and the capable AI will use every trick in the book.Campaign-wise, racing is rewarded with denarius (the currency of the Roman Empire) to build your team with upgraded chariots, horses and skilled drivers-slaves. Good results also increase your fame which will open up the doors of more prestigious stadiums, several dozens of them available in seven provinces, up to the great Circus Maximus of Rome if you prove worthy. Completing a campaign requires about 10 hours of gameplay, more if you invest time to skill up your team of slaves and acquire the top quality chariots and horses. The little things: random events spice up each race. Cities offer various bonuses and some historical background. A random name generator use the cultural origins of your recruits and your rivals to give them all unique names. Successful drivers get their amount of victories tracked after their name. Last but not least, you'll pick up some Latin vocabulary to impress lesser-educated nerds! Stultorum infinitus est numerus, am I right? ;)			"

												A fun game with an interesting concept. It plays like an old tabletop board game, or perhaps something from the earliest days of pc gaming. It's very well designed in terms of balance and mechanics. The problem is the price for the extremely limited amount of content this game represents. Qvadriga is an excellent $3 to $5 cell phone game, not a $20 pc game. *If* you can get it on sale, for an accurate price, then I highly recommend it, but in a world where indy games with staggering levels of content like Xenonauts and FTL are $25 and $10 respectively, charging $20 for this anemic little game is both insulting and insane.

												Qvadriga is a very fun little game and can even prove to be a bit challenging. However the game play does get a bit repetitive as the racing part of it is really all there is.The price is a bit of a factor, I feel it is quite overpriced for what it is, at best this is a $10 game but realistically a $5 one.The addition of multiplayer with leader boards would have made this game epic fun and more worth the price tag.A bit more depth in the gameplay would have also been helpful too, such as having actual stables to train horses, riders etc. Really any game content outside of the racetrack would have been nice like using money to build your own mansion adding to your prestige level that would in turn attract more skillful riders, chariot builders things of that nature.In the end it is pretty clear this is a tablet game converted to be played on pc, and the tablet version is exactly the same at a lower price so this gets a thumbs down.

What is it?A top-down racing/strategy game based on Roman chariot racing.  The game plays in either dynamic (real-time) where you give your aurigas orders on the move, or static which plays as turn-based control over sections of the course (rather like a board game).You start the game with three men, their chariots and horses belonging to one of 6 factions (each with its own strengths/weaknesses and a couple of extra upgrade points).  You visit the shop for repairs and upgrades, then kit out and send one team into a race at a time, allowing other teams to recover from your last folly (if you can afford the fees and repairs, that is)!  When playing the turn-based variant, each 'turn' lasts for a highlighted section of track around the circus.  Looking at the section and the positions of your opponents, you have a choice of moves you can click (only one action is allowed per turn).  Crucially, these include speeding up or slowing down, switching lanes, taking a defensive stance or whipping, blocking or even crashing into your opponents (no-one said this was a clean fight)!  If you're playing the dynamic version the chariots never stop so you have to think fast and give orders with good timing.  What you choose is pivotal to your survival and your success.  If things go bad (and they will), your man's chariot will break up, leaving him dragging face-first in the dirt.  Do you risk everything by insisting he hangs on until the very end (after all, a finish IS a finish...) or do you tell him to run away while he still has his life?  Your escapee causes the race to be forfeit but at least your man is still alive (if he didn't get trampled...).  New men are expensive to recruit, and no racers means no more game.  You have been warned!To keep things fresh, each circus has its own pros and cons, there are random events that help or hinder you, crowds might lob objects at you, or the debris of other casualties might just finish you off.   While it might seem that luck plays a hand, strategic moves will win the race.GameplayThe game is entirely mouse-driven and is accompanied by a decent PDF manual.  The races are simple and intuitive (all choices are displayed on screen in front of your horses and you simply click the move to be made that turn).  However, the user interface for the shop and upgrades is a little confusing (the game could really use some tooltip text help for its buttons as well as mouse-over feedback to show what can and cannot be clicked) but once you understand how to use it and how to buy the most suitable upgrades, everything is fine.Longevity and value]The game brings that level of addictiveness associated with any game where you upgrade and then progress a bit further each time to earn more upgrades.  Your campaign is lengthy and is retained between sessions so you can pick up where you left off last time.   This is no 10-minute throwaway game.  The idea is genius and it's a unique and original game.  Production quality is best described as 'functional' with no added polish (there is no fun commentary as was advertised in the video, and it lacks any graphic touches like cut-scenes of a win (or a tragedy).  This by no means affects the enjoyment of the game and will mean it can run on any level of kit, but it's sat firmly in the £15 territory where a little bit more polish is usually expected.  This is a minor gripe only as the game is otherwise excellent.  If you have doubts, there is a free demo you can download.  The game can also be bought on Android/iOS (full game with no in-app purchases).			"

												This is neither a massive nor a complex game. Instead, it is simple, elegant, and surprisingly dramatic for a turn-based game.The premise is that you manage a chariot racing team, from humble beginnings on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, through to fame and glory in the Circus Maximus of Rome itself. Races are broken into ten second turns. On each turn you can give a single order to your charioteer, which could be speed management, a positioning manoeuvre, offensive, or devensive action. You need to play to your strengths at any given moment, and maintain a high level of situational awareness. I was particularly impressed by the AI. It's smart, but will still make risky decisions which can make for the kind of bloody and brutal chaos one would expect from any Roman sport.While at its heart, there is a fairly simple press your luck mechanic (i.e. do I push the horses and risk injury, can I take a tight turn or go wide, should I protect myself or go for position, etc.), the systems are well designed to create emergent situations where finding the right balance between risky and safe is a constant learning experience. Between races you spend your winnings on keeping your team in good order, and upgrades when you can afford them. There's not a ton of complexity to this management layer, but it is still nice when a better component to your racing team comes up for sale and you can afford it.Having sunk over 10 hours into Qvadriga, I'm not sure I'll be dedicating a great deal more. But that was more than enough for me. I felt that the game respected my time. There was a progression, but it felt like it was far more about my skill in the game improving than it felt like I was grinding to go forward. When I got over my initial hump early in the learning curve and gained some confidence, then I was able to bet heavily on myself during most races and plough through the mid and late game relatively quickly. Even late in the piece though, random events at the start of a race (annouced before placing bets), a single bad move or dramatically unlucky roll could easily lead to a disastrous outcome in a particular race.This is definitely not a game for everyone. The RNG can feel really harsh while you are learning the game. It's definitely possible to mitigate its effects with skill, but at least for me that skill took several hours to properly cultivate. I came close to giving up, but I'm glad I didn't, because it turned out to be well worth my time. I also felt like I had to be willing to take more lost races than I was used to in a single player game. Early on, just coming out ahead in terms of earnings to expenses is really the order of the day.My one tip for anyone who does end up playing this game, never whip the horses while at the end of a high speed turn. Every time I did it I crashed the chariot. Even if there was just a few degrees before opening up into the straight, whipping my horses just before fully opening out into a straight was invariably a recipe for disaster. Most of the time in this game any advice will be based on relative positions between you and other racers, as well as the exact condition and abilities of your Quadriga. But in this one case though, it's a 100% bad call to attempt this kind of manoeuvre. Many a race was lost stubbornly confirming the futulity of this move.			"

												Totally fun game.  If you like the idea of racing chariots and managing a team then this is the game for you.  Basically you buy and sell chariots, horses, drivers as you travel around the ancient world trying to win races to gain earnings.  You can bet on the races.  During the races you have options of shaking the reigns, whipping your horses, crashing your chariot into other players, whipping other players,  moving the horses from lane to lane and must avoid obstacles as well.  Be sure to keep your driver and horses alive as if you can no longer maintain a team you lose.  So far I am great at losing...			"

												I am kind of surprised about how i enjoyed this game... I took some time to read some of the reviews and all those negative reviews are about the pricing and i personally it shouldn't be mentioned in a review at all especially on steam where the price tag of a game vary very often...Anyway let's just talk about this game...I never even thought that it could be possible for me to enjoy a turn based racing strategy game, but the devs from Turnopia proved me wrong...I actually put more hours on this game that i even expected to and those were quality hours i enjoyed playing this game. The game is kind of difficult since you can't really have a viable strategy that work 100% because there is many factor in consideration, some random events, the probability to hurt your horses so they lose some of their maxmum speed, your chariot can broke and sometime get totally destroyed and the actual skills of the pilot are all things that can influence the game result...I personally like that kind of game that are challenging and sometime even if you plan all the way a perfect strategy, anything can go wrong from one turn to the other...There is differents race tracks that change the play style i use, some have more chariots than others and the numbers of oponent can vary from differents race on the same exact track.You can manage your team and have up to 4 pilots, 4 chariots and 4 pack of horses that can have differents stats that influence the outcome of a race.The options are quite limited for the management, but it's a simple game with some twist in it that make it fun to play in my opinion. If you want to play an easy game where you can win everytime without much difficulty, then i guess you should avoid this genre since the game can be frustrating some time.The game can become repetitive after some time, but what game don't get repetitive after spending some time in it anyway?I recomend this game if you like the turn based slow paced strategy game, there is another mode called dynamic races , that is pretty much the same thing, but more fast paced and can be hard to hit the right button in the right time. There is probablly some people that may like this, but i personally don't so i won't spend too much time on this mode since i did not tested it alot...			"

												That's a great mobile or office game, one of the very best of them, but sadly it totally lacks any endgame content or storyline, or characters so it's not the best choice for PC gaming, still I've had enough of fun with it to recommend it to every turn-based strategy fan at least to try it out. Good realistic AI & carrieges' physics model along with 10 second real-time turns with pauses between them make it an ultimate gambling entertainment where you can simultaneously identify thyself with a brave rider, wealthy horse owner & an affectionate rooter. The gameplay is simple yet effective. You get gear: horses (speed & endurance), carriage (acceleration & endurance) & rider (turning skill & endurance), when they lose health their quality lowers so you want to get leading the race without losing too much of those resources. Every 10 seconds you have to make one decision - speed up or down, change lanes (1, 2 or 3 to each side), bash or whiplash rival moving at your side. You also get a random condition either good or bad which significantly changes your strategy. You can also bet on yourself. The whole point is to make money & become a prominent stabling. The Mediterranean region with lots of towns is at your service, every town has it's own hippodrome, their configurations & sizes are different, so you have to change your habits. When you become a champion at smaller arenas you can go to Rome, Constantinople or Alexandria to compete with the best & earn even more money - that's all, no logical game ending here. Still if you are fond of things like 'King of Dragon Pass' where your decisions are regularly put to the test of random outcomes & you can follow the mechanics of your triumphs & catastrophies in detail - you should by all means try out this small game with perfectly balanced risk-reward gameplay!

TL;DR SUMMARYOne of the most enjoyable strategy race games in many years. The worst part is the non-sensical pricing strategy of the publisher ($19.99 on PC, $9.99 on Android, $4.99 on iOS - all for the same game). Put it on your wishlist and wait for the price to hit $9.99 or less on Steam. Most negatives about this game center on the price, not the game itself. This is mispriced gem.DETAILED REVIEWThis game was so enjoyable, I spent dozens of hours experimenting with factions, upgrading my drivers, chariots, and horses, developing racing strategies and collecting game data about different cities, just so I could successfully manage teams to the Circus Maximus at Rome.The game is deceptively simple - each ""turn"" of play you pick one order for your driver. The trick is dealing with the other drivers while positioning your team for the next corner. Drive too close inside, especially with an inexperienced driver, and you might suffer a costly crash. Horses, chariots and even your driver can suffer damage. Flipped or wrecked chariots result in the driver being dragged by the horses until he escapes, crosses the finish line, or dies.Each individual race takes 5 to 10 minutes to play. However, it takes multiple races to get the ""feel"" of the hidden variables and probabilities, so you can race intelligently and make money - instead of losing your toga (like I did the first few times). But the real game starts when you play the campaign.The campaign starts in your choice of a (probably distant) Imperial province, in a small city, with a few drivers, horse sets and chariots. It's your job to make enough money racing that you can cover the inevitable damage costs, upgrade your team and build your fame. With fame comes access to higher status cities with better rewards and better equipment. Eventually you'll want to travel to new provinces with more cities, on your way to the ultimate racing venue: the Circus Maximus in Rome.The game's user interface and graphics are indie in spirit. The track and chariots are in top-down view. Gentle tints on the driver, chariot (wheels) and horses show exhaustion and/or damage. Despite this, the game oozes atmosphere, from the type fronts, to the crisp clear icons, to the blood smear on the sandy-tan track marking the death of a charioteer. Everything about the game reminds you of Imperial Rome.From a game design standpoint, the inner workings are excellently balanced. Chances of damage or disaster change with multiple variable. Even a risk-averse manager will find rare, random event can set back the best laid plans, or provide an unexpected success. Incautious, wild racers are heavily punished - you cannot rely on ""good luck"" or constant aggression to win this game. The AI drivers are intelligent, and occasionally unpredictable. If they have no hope of winning themselves, they may even block your chances out of pure malice or spite! The temptation to bash them off the track is strong, even though it won't profit you.This game reminds me of chariot race boardgames from 30 to 40 years ago. However, Qvadriga is vastlymore playable than those clunky endeavors. Those old boardgames had fewer variables, took 1-3 hours per race to play, and had no AI players! Besides, Qvadriga's campaign game is infinitely more interesting and playable than anything available in those old boardgames.Yes, it would be nice if the game had beautifully animated isometric or 3D racing graphics. We all dream about drivers that animate appropriately in response to your orders, or when victims of attacks, not to mention chariot wheels coming off, chariots flipping, horses dying in collisions, and chariots bouncing over the wreckage of other chariots and dead horses, plus drivers being dragged or running away, sometimes to a gruesome death. However, the chances of that game being made is infinitely small, given the current state of strategy games, publisher investment resources, and the technical limitations of building games for mobile as well as the PC. Yes, it would also be nice if the game allowed for human opponents. But do I want to wait hours until another human player is available? Am I expected to run a private serve? Do I expect the poor, cash-strapped developer (or publisher) to maintain a multi-player server for me and the nineteen other English speakers in the world who just might want to play each other? Do I expect an online chat system as well? For a niche game like this, it is quite understandable that we're limited to offline play only.The only REAL fault with this game is publisher's (Slitherine's) inane pricing strategy. Today (July 21, 2016), the very same game costs $19.99 for the PC (on Steam), $9.99 for Android (at the Google Play Store), and $4.99 for iOS (in the iTunes store). Yes, the game is priced lowest on the platform that has the richest customer base! If I were the developer, I'd be outraged by this inconsistent pricing. As other reviewers have noted, the $19.99 price needlessly discourages PC purchases. Personally, I believe the publisher has simly lost track of any rational pricing strategy for this two-year-old title.  It's really a shame. This is a timeless, great, little racing game. Put it on your wishlist and wait for $9.99 or less.			"

												Such a simple and fun game.  I like to play this in a side screen while doing something else. The mechanics are exceptionally simple and surpassing the AI is not that hard with a little patience.  Once you learn the ropes (curves, the commands, what upgrades to what in game), then the game becomes one of patience as you grind your teams.Really simple... I paid only a few bucks.  Easily worth $5 on special.  Not worth the list price of $20.If you like simple games like Desktop Dungeons (although that is more puzzle solver than this), or enjoy grinding skills and a simple structured game, then this is worth a try/buy.If you want complexity or really nice graphics, move along.

												OK, first, I have a lot more hours on this game, but they were in the non-Steam version as originally published by Matrix Games. As related in other reviews, this is a turn-based (with optional real time) top down chariot racing simulator. Conceptually it goes back to a board game origin, but it has been quite successfully brought to the PC. The rules aren't too complex, but there is strategy in the development of the drivers, the horses and the chariot. And there is likewise a lot of tactical decision making during a race. The inclusion of random events keeps the game from getting stale. There is also a business aspect in that doing well in races (and making smart bets!) will give you more money which allows for chariot upgrades, better horses and more qualified drivers. Also money is needed to care for injured horses and drivers and repair damaged chariots. One of the great aspects of the game is that it can be played in small blocks of time, a race not taking more than ten minutes at a time. So you can do a race or two, or really dive into the campaign mode if desired. Post if you have questions!			"

												I'm not sure where the video attached to the store page comes from, but that makes it seem like the game has way better presentation than it actually does.  However, the game itself is fun for both turn based strategy fans and fans of sports games.  The game is slow, but that's because it's turn based.  The subject matter makes a turn based approach believable.  There are also RPG elements, although simple, that gives the player a sense of progression throughout the game.  And while it's not terribly hard to beat, winning the Circus Maximus three times feels like a tremendous accomplishment.Don't be overly aggressive.  I think the AI is overly aggressive, so being more conservative is a pretty good strategy.  Prioritize your speed around the track (take turns as close to the middle as possible) before attacking other racers.  Whipping your horses will wear them out quickly and you may regret doing it at the end of the race.  Finally, learn to block.  Blocking is easy to do, but difficult to master.  The AI is really good at blocking which explains several of my second  and third place finishes.  Grumble.			"

The graphis are super simplistic, but there is a lot of thinking that goes into winning at the turn-based races, and a variety of ways to build your chariot teams, allowing you to approach races in different ways. Overall a good game.			"

												So, let's get the bad stuff out of the way:  This acts like a converted boardgame.  The graphics are from the 90s if not late 80s.  The game will not hold your hand - if you act stupidly, the game has no issue with punishing you.That said, this is the best racing game I've played in a very long time.In Qvadriga you control a team of charioteers (aurigas).  You're responsible for selecting them, buying and upgrading horses and chariots, and paying for medical care/repairs when things don't go well.  Your sponsor will give you certain advantages:  Perhaps your aurigas are tougher than average, or your horses faster.Once you've taken care of maintenance and the like, it's time to race.  Simply put it's three times (usually) around an oval track, with rewards for finishing first, second, third, or even simply finishing.The commands are intuitive enough once you've played a few games:  You can accelerate by shaking the reins, whip the horses (which might hurt them and lower their overall speed), pull back on the reins, change lanes, whip to the left or right to try and injure enemy drivers and horses, or ram your cart left and right for the same reason.  Action by default is turn based.  There is an option where the turns run together, simulating an RTS, but I feel it's not worth it.Since the commands are simple enough you can focus on strategy.  Whipping the horses is a great way to surge past the enemy ... but if you hurt them too badly it'll hurt their base speed and you'll be paying for a vet later.  Sometimes beating the crap out of your enemy is the answer, but that tends to slow you down.  Do you take the turns at full speed and hope you don't crack a wheel?  Or do you focus on stabilizing your chariot or even slowing down to make sure everything you make it?  Having your chariot shatter under you and being dragged is no fun.   Letting go of the reins and getting run over by an opponent is even worse.Strategies are affected by random events.  For example in a recent race my auriga was so mad at the world 'he' decided that accelerating by shaking the reins wasn't an open, and if I wanted to win I'd have to rely on the whip much more than I like.  In another event drunken spectators thought throwing trash on the outer lane of the track was great fun and several drivers got hit in the head.Don't let the graphics scare you off.  This is an intuitive racing game with good strategic potential.  Enjoy!			"

												The genre of ""turn based chariot racing game"" should however have been my first hint of how this was going to go.The truth is that neither the management side of the game, nor the actual racing is that great.On the management side of the game there is no training. You effectively just need to pay for repairs as appropriate and select the squad that has the highest health. There is nothing on this side of the game that is even noteworth. Every skill is reduced to a three point scale, where you either have zero, one or two of each stat. With the racer, chariot and horses each having some skills.Because there is no variance in the types of races there is no question between whether you put in the horses with higher endurance or not. You race your healthiest and highest scoring squad every single time, no question.Also, the time played on this game is screwed up because there's a start menu that counts as the game. So that was open after I stopped playing and added way a good amount of time to my playtime.So the game doesn't offer much on this side of the game, what does it offer in terms of racing?Unfortunately there isn't much here either.Each turn you choose between accelerating, whipping (""advance acceleration""), lane changes, stability for turning corners or some form of attack on your opposition.That doesn't sound like an issue until you start to see how much of a grind that actually is. There is always a clear best decision, I think the only time there's debate of which decision is best is when choosing which attack. Unfortunately the attacks are too strong. One bad attack against you and you've almost certainly lost the race and might as well give up.I don't know what you should pay for this game. But I'd certainly be waiting for at least 70% off.			"

												This game is simply great.  It is a casual game that is quite addictive.  The game design is brilliant, but the UI design is absolutely abysmal.  You have to wonder what the devs were smoking when they designed the UI.The game is easy to play, but hard to master.  It will take many many hours of play to win the game.  It hasn't been updated in quite some time, so I don't think there will be any more updates.  You have to manage your drivers (Qvadrigas), your chariots, your horses, and your medical treatments.  The early part of the game is the most difficult, because your qvadrigas are just starting out, and they are not very good.   'Das24680' has published a very good LP series on YouTube.This game is definitely worth playing as long as you're not too focused on the UI - especially with a 1920x1080 monitor.			"

												What a fun and addicting game. This is by far my favorite guilty pleassure game. It is very challenging with a smatter of luck involved. It can be frustrating but for the most part the frustration is do to my own aggressivness and stupidity. Nothing worse than seeing my favorite jock, ""Crapus Irregulus"" Die a bloody death because I tried to take a turn too fast. Or my up and comer ""Redd Doggybone"" be whiped to death because I failed to put the defensive posture on because I forgot or thought the other jock wouldn't whip me to death.I love the strategy of should I take a chance and go fast arond the curve or swing wide and avoid all the traffic. Whip them early and often and hope to hold on or save your horses stamina for the end. Whip them to go faster and hope the dam jock in front of me to the left dosn't decided to cut me off or change lanes to get away from hims so I can whip them next turn.Great game!			"

												Qvadriga is a brilliantly unique game where you manage a chariot racing team in Rome. The best part of the game is the uniqueness, as no one has really tried this before. The gameplay is great as it is hard but rewarding. You can whip other chariot racers next to you, as well as crash into them, but the same thing can happen to you. The only thing I don't like is that towards the end of races when you have the lead it can get boring. Otherwise its a great game, 9/10 excels in originality and rewarding gameplay. Also multiplayer would be cool but we aren't getting that rip.			"

												If you were a fan of Circus Maximus by Avalon Hill, this is the game you want.  Played in Dynamic mode, its plays like a real time chariot race, and it is brutal.  Very little quarter is given, and in the campaign game you will very soon develop a champion driver that lives on the edge of disaster each race.  When played on Epic mode, this is old school, with no saves, no going back for your body, no fluff.  Like in real life, your champion gets all your best gear to give him that edge, and in flash of hooves and blood, it could all be gone.  If you ever wanted to manage a team of chariots for a faction and race them with the final hope of getting them to Rome and the Maximus, this is the game for you.  The graphics aren't stunning.  The sounds are adequate, but nothing more.  This is a simulation and racing strategy game.  Crash your opponents?  Lash them with your whip into submission?  Go for speed and try to out run the mayhem?  It's up to you.  Well done Turnopia, I look forward to your next release.			"

												First, I love ancient Rome and have studied it's history extensively, I even wrote a paper on the circus factions, so I bought this game the minute I saw it. I honestly really enjoyed it for a couple of hours and liked figuring everything out and getting better.But... then it was over and kind of quickly. There just isn't a lot here. Too little meat on the bone. I want to recommend this game, I really do, because I want to support any game about antiquity especially when it tries to be somewhat realistic. However, at twenty bucks, I just feel let down. There are good things here though, it's a really good idea and it's a lot of fun for the first couple of hours. I just really wish there was more to it to sink your teeth into. Especially the circus factions, which barely make any real difference. I hope to see maybe some DLC or something in the near future that will help me to change my mind.			"

												An enjoyable and unexpected game. I really didn't think I'd play this as long as I did, but there's a fair amount of tactical depth within the seemingly dated graphics and interface. It's a blast racing against as many as 15 other opponents, and while I wish there was some more variation and customization options (late-game races consist of top-tier riders all with basically the same stats), it's fairly challenging experience and it's awesome trying to run a tight corner and watching your biggest rival flip his cart.I'd recommend playing the fluid-mode instead of turn-based- much more satisfying and challenging.

												I've put a few tens of hours in on this before I moved it to Steam, on both the pc version and the iPad.  This is one of my ""Game of the Year"" picks.Qvadriga is a single-player chariot racing set in the Roman Mediterranean. You choose one of seven factions to race for, and your ""stable"" is one of several your faction may operate in each city.  There are many cities to race in across the various provinces.  Each city offers it's own special bonus, like half-price drivers, or cheap chariot repair.Each city has it's own racing stadium, varying from 8 lanes wide to 4 lanes wide, and generally either an oval or a U shape. Your tactics have to change to reflect the number of teams racing and the width of the track - a six-team race on four lanes is very different from 8 teams on 6 lanes, and so forth.You can have up to four teams in your stable; you start with three.  Drivers, chariots and horses each have two skills to be gained, at up to two points for each skill.  For drivers, it's constitution and driving skill; for horses, speed and endurance; and for chariots, acceleration and durability.  So there are 9 combinations for each skill, and three sets of skills, for 729 different driver/horse/chariot combinations.Each race has a special condition, given before the start, which mixes things up.  You might have corrupt Praetors drinking up some of the prize money, or fog making everyone more cautious, or two teams fighting at the start line, or even a track littered with previous race debris for the crowd's amusement.  Add to that the various chariot/driver/horse combinations and the width of the track, and each race is different and unique.Your faction gives you a set of skills to begin with.  For example, the military faction favors skillful drivers and horses with good endurance, along with heavy chariots.  Other factions have different mixes.  This provides the initial differences between teams in a race.  You must learn to adapt to your equipment and drivers - is your team going to win based on fighting other teams, or getting ahead early and holding the lead, or coming from behind in the final lap?  And bear in mind, as your gear and horses and drivers change, your tactics will have to adapt as well.Once you are in a race, you have a number of actions you can take each turn.  You can slow or speed your horses, or really goose them by whipping.  You can change lanes (subject to someone being in the way, or your momentum in a turn) and you can crash into other teams or try to whip their driver.  Most actions, including cornering and even just driving, carry a risk of damage, which increases as you take damage through the race.  So you really have to consider every turn carefully; even if you are far in the lead coming into the last turn, one mistake can see you with a destroyed chariot being pulled along the track by your runaway horses.  Each race has it's tense moments and you can go from being on top to crashing out in an instant.Once the race is over, you get money if you finished; more if you placed in the top three, and then if you win, you can collect your private bet if you placed one.  Your teams will need repair, rest and healing, which cost money; this is why you start with three, to let them come back to full strength over several races.  Your drivers will be ranked by victories, and as your fame climbs, you'll gain access to other cities and regions, and can compete across the empire.  Eventually, the goal is to become the leader of your faction empire-wide, and in Epic game mode, to become the most successful rider in the empire.In short, this is a great racing game with a good deal of bloodshed and heartbreak, and more than a little historical accuracy.  It's well worth it if you like racing games and history at all.  There is nothing else like it out there.  Highly recommended.			"

												Terrible company , Wonderful game.  As with most of Slitherine's game, if you are a warmonger they are excellent for the most part. Some are overblown, intentionally tedious (to make the player and fanbois ""feel"" smarter and deeper than they actually are). Some are restrictive for the sake of, well, stuck up intellectuals who demand a certain formula tailored to their egos as opposed to their actual ""gamer prowess"" and above all SERIOUSLY overpriced in total. You can look for sales though on occasion or consult Robin Hood for further advice. The company's self aborption is only matched by the items listed above in relation to Slithrerine's ""Personality"" as a company making almost any pruchase , no matter how much you enjoy the game itself, come with a bitter aftertaste, and waiting for the ""10% off kings"" to go on a decent sale would leave you on your deathbed. BUT, all that being said. This game itself is a gem for sure, with almost no games of this nature out there it makes the choices...well...nil for the most part. The ""open world"" campaigns if you will/want to call them that, I prefer the term, ""Career mode"".., are excellent, leaving a great deal of room for immersion and personalization...certainly one of those little games you keep on your comp forever and come back to when you wish to get a little playtime in. Worth 20$...absolutely NOT, But then again, not a game in their library is wotth more than 40% of whatever price they ask considering assets vs price.If you can find it on sale though, it IS a very very good and fun game. You can grab it on Humble this week (12/20/2015) for 1$ in their weekly bundle....but again, I do love this little game I just have a dislike for Slitherine that matches their dislike for Steamers which their owner was none to shy about stating.

												Great game, very addictive, and it looks surprisingly good, although very basic. Chariot-racing Ben-Hur style and managing your team of up to 4 drivers with chariots and horses. Travel all over the Roman world to 43 very different race-tracks in search of Dinarii and fame. The end-goal is to become famous enough to be invited to Circus Maximus in Rome and win 3 races there!The theme is very interresting, but I wish it was a full AAA-title that really expanded on the whole racing- and management gameplay. The game could be so much better with more details and stats on the drivers, chariots, horses and the races themselves. Still, each race only takes around 10 minutes so you can always get your Chariot-fix when you need it. The AI is good and the races are always exciting,- well worth your time.If you are European, buy it from Slitherine directly for $18 and save 35%.			"

												It's a good - and I think the only - roman chariot race simulator.The game plays out in turn (or in real time turn) where you choose an action to be performed.In the race you have to manage your horses and negotiate turns: if you take a curve to fast your chariot may be damaged or it may tumble.You can also whip the others aurigas, or you can crash into them.Between races you have to manage your team Buying upgrades or replacements.The game mechanic is simple but there is a good variation provided by different tracks in different cities, and also some sort of special event in each race.AI is good but after a while may become predicibile. Anyway the game have enough mechanics to keep every race unpredictable.Sadly this game lack multiplayer.I think that this is overall a good game: i often play it while listening to music or podcast.

												A pretty simple game, you have up to four chariots, charioteers and groups of horses each, and your goal is to conquer the whole ancient world of charioteering. During the race you pick from many different moves that will make you shift your lane, attack your opponents, accelerate, slow down, or just hold your reins a bit more firmly. What may seem a rather simple idea, shines because of how it is done. There are MANY different race tracks in several of the main regions of the Roman Empire - covergin such main provinces as Italia, Gallia, Hispania, Aegyptus, Syria, Macedonia, Achaea, Africa, and several others. Each of the regions contains many different stadiums, which are not only of different size, but also differ in whether they are Greek or Roman style, as both nations had a different idea about how to start a race. There are many possible combinations of how good your chariot or horses are. Do you prefer stronger ones that can run for a longer time, or faster, but less durable ones? Do you prefer a stronger chariot that will allow you to ram your opponents or a light one that will accelarate well but at the same time will be easier to break? The choices are yours, and together with a random event that happens just before race, such as drugged horses, assaulted auriga (charioteer), or corrupted praetors that stolen some prize money, it makes every race unique. You really need to adjust your strategy often, although the best one (and was in the ancient times) is to block your opponent behind your chariot and try to anticipate his moves so as to keep him trapped, as changing lane takes quite some time. Overall, I can heartily recommend it to anyone who likes either fun sports games and/or ancient history. Spent a lot of time playing it on my iPad and it's just as fun on your PC. The only con is the price - I don't really think that it's worth it. Therefore I must also recommend that you wait for the next sale. If it's at least 33% off, don't hesitate.			"

												As others have said it's probably overpriced at $20 dollars. But at $5 on sale it's a very addictive chariot racing simulator and management game. You start with a team of aurigas, chariots and horses and enter races to make money to upgrade them and gain fame to move to higher rated arenas. There are very few uneventful races as you try to move through the pack avoiding the carnage of chariots crashing into each other and aurigas whipping each other and each other's horses. Sometimes you can go for the victory but other times you'll gain as much satisfaction from nursing your beaten and battered horses home in 3rd after blocking the racer in 4th for a few turns. Sometimes you'll rely on speed whereas others you'll want to focus on damaging your rivals. Two races are seldom the same. You also have different size tracks and even at each track there are 2 or 3 different number of aurigas er race so plenty of variety. You may prefer the shorter races with only 4 aurigas are the marathon slogs where there are 16.for a more in depth review I wrote about it here:http://funnfunnystuff.blogspot.co.za/2016/07/qvadriga.html "

												In rare form, Slitherine has (as of this writing) temporarily slashed the price for this game in half.  While I might normally say go get the mobile tablet version (on which I have countless hours), this is the perfect price point for this time suck of a game and make no mistake, it's unlikely they'll slash it more.  So if you've been on the fence, pick a side now!Like the very best of games out there, it's a mechanically-simple approach to turn-based racing - chariot racing, mind you - that has clearly been inspired by similarly-themed board games of old.  Also like the very best of games out there, its simplicity belies its depth.  While races last about 5-10 minutes of real-time at most - making it the perfect pick-up-and-play game - you only have a handful of actions you can do on each turn, Qvadriga provides a tactical experience that gives you the right 'feel' of racing around in ancient Rome.Unlike the staggered starts of the Olympics, chariots will line up side-by-side or even one behind another with random start positions, leading to seemingly unfair, foregone conclusions.  However, unlike the Olympics, it's perfectly okay to kill your opponents or their horses by whipping them to death or smashing your chariot into them, which might also damage their wheels enough to throw the driver out, only to be dragged to near-certain death.  Not satisfied?  It's also perfectly okay to position yourself to block opponents, often causing them to violently smash into your backside, hurting their horses, and therefore their overall speed.  Just be mindful that what you can do to others can also be done to you.While there are similarities to other racers like Gallop Racer or Derby Owner's Club in that you must manage your horse's stamina during the race (too much damage and they slow down, whip 'em to make 'em go faster at the risk of hurting or killing them), the true depth of the game comes from tactically positioning yourself and upsetting your opponents to get ahead.  This will be difficult at first, but you will soon be able to second-guess the guy behind you with a pretty good degree of accuracy.  Do you try to take the inside lane and make the turn at speed, risking your chariot flipping over?  Do you hang back a little bit so you can whip your opponent from his chariot?  Do you smash your own chariot into his horses, hoping to drop his four-horse team to a three?  Or do you sacrifice the health of your own horses and whip 'em for that extra burst of speed, possibly slowing you down for the remainder of the race if you bleed them?With single races available, the meat of the game is actually its campaign mode where the goal is to gain enough fame for your team to be invited to the Circus Maximus, the most electrifying arena in Roman entertainment where you can race for the millions (AND MILLIONS) of your team's fans.  Essentially you will start off by picking one of the available historical factions which will give you various starting bonuses, but don't worry too much about that as you will eventually replace all of your drivers, horses and chariots over time.  From there, you start racing, hoping to survive those early moments until you can make enough money to afford some good stuff.  Nothing will stop you from winning, mind you, if you've got the wherewithall to do so.  In between races, you will be able to see your team's fame on the local level (with several cities to make your name in) and on the global level.  Then you can manage your team, from pure maintenance to purchasing upgrades with your winnings which includes faster, stronger horses, higher quality and more durable chariots, and tougher and more skilled drivers.  Each stat for each component of your entry plays into your tactics for the upcoming race.  If you front a team of toughness, chances are you'll want to do your best to take out the city's top leaders (who are easily identifiable by their faction color and the number of wins they hold) whereas a faster team will be more dead set on getting a podium finish.  Finally, before each race, should you choose to do so, you can place a bet that your team will win and the payouts are tremendous if you manage to do so.  Keep it going and if you don't manage to kill all of your drivers, eventually new venues will open up to you for more glory and fame and money.Overall this is a wonderful little gem of a title and while it won't necessarily hook you with its bland visuals and minimal sound design, once you figure out its magic, you'll be drawn in wholesale.

												I like the racing. As others have said it can definitely get grindy. My biggest complaint is with some of the implementation.  For instance, when your chariot gets wrecked your driver will be on his belly holding the reins - your choices are to continue to hang on or run for safety. If you run for safety your driver immediately runs towards the outside stands without any regard for his safety. Will he wait until another team goes by to clear the way? Nope - he'll run right into the side of the horses and get killed in the process. Will he run to the center if it happens when he's in an inner lane? Nope.. again, towards the outside, heedless of oncoming chariots.As others have said, there's also very little in the way of management. I *want* to like this game. I love the concept of it, but it's marred by a lack of variety and some lazy coding. "

												This is a fun, but simple strategic chariot racing game.  The graphics and sound are purely functional, but they do serve their purpose.  I always play in turn-based mode, and the fun comes from analyzing your situation during each of your turns and trying to choose the optimal action to improve your situation.  These actions include things like: Do I flog my horses for a brief burst of speed now at the cost of horse endurance?  Do I flog my oponent and risk losing my whip, or crash my chariot into him and risk becoming stunned?  What's the closest lane that I can safely take a turn and set myself up nicely afterwards?  And so on.If you enjoy lite strategy, you will probably find some enjoyment here.  But it is lite and probably best enjoyed in small doses.  Doing pre-race team management and completing a single race probably takes about five to ten minutes.  You will be frustrated when things randomly go wrong, but also elated when you round that last corner a bit too fast, overturn your chariot and grin as your driver is able to endure long enough to be dragged over the finish line, winning you the race.However, the price seems a bit steep.  At $10 I could wholeheartedly recommend buying it, but at $20, you might want to wait for a sale if you're on the fence about it.  Matrixgames has a demo on their website, and you might want to watch a ""Let's Play"" video to see the game in action.			"

												The game really does have the best turn-based racing mechanics in a computer game (and no, it's not the only one). And, what's just as important, there's a clean interface that helps avoid struggling with them. You learn the basics and you're off, and then you have quite a gentle learning curve until becoming a master charioteer.Once you're a bit more accustomed to the game, there's a pleasant semi-trance state that you can fall into during the races. It's good and bad at the same time. While there still are decisions to make, you've probably encountered similar situations before and know a good way out of them. After you've reached this point it is nice to zoom out and see the chariots go, and admire how believable their movements seem. Unfortunately there's not much else to do outside of that. The campaign is very welcome if a bit barebones, but in the end it becomes a comfort game that you can Alt+Tab to and run a race or two to before getting back to work.I do hope the developers use the great design in place for a more ambitious game, be it historical, fantasy or any other kind of racing. It simply needs more content and variety to mix things up a bit. What is there is very well balanced and thought-out, though, and is definitely preferable to a chaotic mixture of bits and pieces that don't really gel together or a feature creep that tends to plague other games. Nevertheless, in the end you are left wanting more.			"

												Game has interesting concept but it is basicly a luck game. If your lucky you have a chance if your unlucky you might as well start the game over. Very limited in options. You have to win (first place) just to pay for the time and materials needed to race the next few races. If you come in 3rd or worse in a 16 team race you basiclly cannot afford to continue racing. So you better win first place every other race or your game will end fast.A $5 or $10 game not worth $20			"

Racers start your engines, well horses?This turned based roman chariot racer does it best to recreate the excitement and peril of the ancient sport, and success rather well.  The campaign mode allows players to build up their racing crew by using price money to upgrade their race teams.Basic gameplay only requires you to select an action a few times each lap but still creates tense and exciting moments.  Sneaking around a competitor or getting trapped and based by a rival.While the concept is great the presentation leaves a lot of room for improvement.  The camera is fixed on your position making it hard to adjust for off screen obstacles.  Selecting turn commands would benefit a lot from giving guidelines for predicted outcomes of each choice.

												I bought this game direct from the publisher before it was made available on Steam and lately I have transferred my license to Steam. This game is based very much on an old Roman chariot racing boardgame called Circus Maximus where you have to design your team and you then do a single race or a series of races. But this game adds more to that premise. For one thing the game introduces factions which all have their own concentrations, some build quality chariots, some have the best drivers other have tha fastest horses, there are quite a few of these traits that are introduced in the game which makes choosing your faction quite intriguing.Another thing the game adds is random events at the start of each race which might affect just you/someone else or everyone equally. For example you miught be prevented from whipping for the whole race which will penalise horse teams where endurance is high but speed is not. Also you might ahve a race where all the old wreackage is still on the track from the previous race making it far more deadly. Or you can be forced to start from a certain lane or have a rival in a race. These add loads of variety to each race.It also introduces faction leaders and leaderboards where each faction leader is ranked. You may make it you strategy to assassinate your faction leader in order to get your own best driver on the leaderboard adding extra strategy to the already packed with excitement races.You get many different authentic Roman and non-Roman race circuits from basic ones where you start off, up to the Circus Maximus, where you have to win three times to complete the game.As for the races themselves these follow the boardgame quite closely in that you can whip horses to make them go faster for a short time but this can damage them, you can try to whip other adjacent drivers or ram them or their horses, you can get damaged travelling over wreckage, you can be dragged and trampled to death etc etc. Its all very very Ben Hur in the most ruthless way possible. Of course though there is also a racing game in here and you can just try to win races through skill and speed.There is loads to enjoy in this game, I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised when I played it as to how much variety, strategy, and fun there is in here. Its probably one of my top twenty most favourite games of all time actually, and definitely one of the best purchases I have made over the last few years of gaming. Definitely recommended.And yes this concept would make a flaming wicked Nascar sort of game if converted! I remember playing  Grand Prix management game with this sort of overhead view and it was great. Someone has to make a modern racing game out of this!			"

												This is a great little game! There is a lot of strategy involved. The learning curve is pretty steep, but as you get the hang of it, you really get sucked in. Usually set backs are not game breaking. On my first play through, I lost my drivers and chariots quickly, and could not recover, but only because I didn't know what I was doing. I went back, looked over the tutorial, started a new game, was more careful this time, and I've been having a great campaign. I've had my set backs still, but always have recovered from them and surged to new levels despite them. A word to the wise: don't imagine this is a game you can easily win on your first race. You will have to work hard for each victory. But they are all the more rewarding when they come.You will also quickly develop rivalries with other teams' charioteers (called auriga in the game). Currently, I've got a very heated rivalry going with a fellow named Alpheaus. After he took out two of my horses and almost killed an auriga at the very start of a race, I've had it out for him ever since. And he likes gunning for me, too. Makes the races very interesting when he's around.In response to critics who say there are only two types of track: first of all, each type has many variations within. Some are longer, some are shorter, some are wider, some are thinner. No two tracks are exactly the same, and each one has unique strategies required to be successful. Second, in ancient Rome this is exactly how it was. Two types of track (Greek style and Roman style), but with variations all over the place. Each race also will have a random event at the start, sometimes good, sometimes bad, to add to the variation. There's also different combinations of auriga skills, chariot types, and horse quality.In total, this is a great game. I think it is worth $20. But if you can pick it up on sale, that's always good, too. I give it a 9/10.			"

Poorly designed: you can't even turn off the music for goodness sake and the interface is unintuitive.			"

Blah, I mean there is a great game hidden somewhere deep inside this clunky bland-looking outdated program, but the asking price and time investment is too steep to bother.Aside from that, I am not sure if there was an English language barrier for the developers, or maybe they tried to keep with the historic (?)Greek nomenclature, but it makes it very inaccessible.Essentially, this is a racing simulator that is definately unique. Its turn-based, which is something I really love and totally think there is a niche market for. The execution and final product leave something to be desired, though.Pros:+A turn-based roguelike racer is an awesome idea.+The historic setting could be cool with the right details and execution.Cons:-The whole program feels clunky, with awkward and bland textures and colors.-The nomenclature is confusing, and can turn new players off.-Overall, its fairly slow - sometimes to the point of being boring.-The asking price is outrageous.-The tutorial is wayyy too text-heavy, when it could just show you instead of having you read single-spaced text blocks. I don't mind reading, but the presentation will give you a headache.Its probably worth a go for less than five bucks. Watch some LetsPlays and you will definately get a feel if this is for you or not.			"

Don't get me wrong there are much more complex games out there but this game is just perfect if you're just looking for something to relax with. The movements as well as ui is very well done I find, I really actually enjoy how everything is not immediately explained to you, if you look around enough you'll find a plethora of information where you least expect it.Overall this game is a bit pricy for what it is.

												If you enjoy sport manager simulators in the vein of Football Manager and its ilk, and have a fascination for Roman sport and spectacle, then buy QVADRIGA now! Be warned however, it's a time sink, this game will grab your interest and won't let go. You manage a stable of up to 4 aurigas (charioteers) and enter them in chariot races around the Roman empire. The campaign mode is great, and ends only once you accomplish 3 wins at the Circus Maximus, which is easier said than done. You are then scored based on how well you've done up to this point. If you want a greater challenge, then tackle the Epic Campaign.You start the game by picking which faction (color) you want to represent. Each has a set of three attributes it values over others, and will determine the way you play the game. Your aurigas (charioteers) have two attributes, Skill and Constitution, your chariots' two attributes are Quality and Size, while the horses are rated by Speed and Endurance. You must pick a faction that fits your play style. If you want to be aggressive, then pick a faction that focuses on Size, while if you prefer to stick to the innermost lane and outpace the other charioteers, then pick a faction that focuses on Skill. Your first several games will definitely be a learning process, and you might end up being defeated by the arena.There's much more to be discovered, but go out and give QVADRIGA a try now!			"

												Qvadriga is a fun simple and yet surprisingly deep top down strategy racing game. If you've ever played the board game Formula D you'll instantly see some similarties but enough diversity to be its own thing. At first it may seem like a luck based game but the more you play and develop your play style the more you see skill plays a factor in 90% of things. Random events keep the game fresh and new and not as repetitive and its just all around polished decently.My only complaints are that $19.99 for this game is asking for more than the game is worth because if you dont like it after your first 20-40 minutes you wont like it at all. Also this thing is BEGGING for a multiplayer component which would make the game much much more replayable.To sum it up short: Great game, lot of fun, probably too high a price for how simple the game is and MULTIPLAYER PLEASE.

												As many other negative reviews note: this is an interesting concept that becomes repetitive all too quickly. I first heard about Qvadriga via Rock, Paper, Shotgun that called it the Best Racing Game of 2014. I find my tastes often align with RPS so I was looking forward to trying this out.Qvadriga is a one-man effort from Daniel Soria at Turnopia games, ""a humble attempt to achieve the ideal of turn based games"". He delivers a relatively unique concept in his chariot-racing game: your charioteer has a pretty decent chance of dying. And there's often not much you can do about it. You're often at the mercy of the RNG. In many ways it feels like a rogue-like. I finished 37 races in my (unfinished) campaign. I came in first on about 33% of them. I had 8 charioteers get killed in the line of duty.If you embrace that, it means you sometimes are rewarded with more interesting stories than most racing games will give you. Let me tell you about the time that my top-ranked charioteer had his chariot disintegrate underneath him rounding the corner on the final stretch; he was in first place and rather than lose, let his horses drag him the last stretch across the finish line. Or the time my rookie charioteer gambled it all on a risky inner-lane turn to take first place. Or the time, just seconds after the race started, my #1 charioteer got whipped, stunned, and then was whipped to death before the first turn!Unfortunately, moments like those -- great as they are -- don't make up for the short comings. There seems to be no relationship between ""famous charioteers"" and their skills in the races. I consistently beat the globally famous guys with 16 wins....and lose out to some no-name guy in the backwaters of Syria. The game seems to level-up your competitors so they are always approximately the same skill as you.Despite playing for hours, I never once had a charioteer level up. The game gives some indications it is possible but I never saw it happen. That lack of progression contributes to the sense of sameness. I went from Hispania to Gaul to Italy to Macedonia to Syria and the races felt the same no matter where I was. There are a few varieties in track (some are narrow with just 4 chariots, some are wide with 12 chariots) but that's about it.The ""sports management sim"" part of the game is pretty thin, as is the campaign. If these were better developed it might make up for the repetition and randomness/lack of skill of the races themselves. I quickly amassed more money than I knew what do with (80,000 denarii and nothing much to spend it on) and often spent it travelling the world just to see if anything was different anywhere.The core racing is fun but just doesn't offer enough variety. You also have to accept that some races are unwinnable through no fault of your own. If you start out in the middle of a pack of 12, and get lashed by a neighbor, you're going to have difficulty placing. Likewise, sometimes you'll get a random event -- like the one where your charioteer gets bribed to brake after the first turn -- that makes it hard to come out on top.Those aren't the end of the world, since the game does give you a kind of rogue-like feeling of failure being okay. But it often made me feel like success and failure wasn't really up to me or my tactics. I won around 1/3 of my races but in 1/4 of my races I didn't place in the top three and I had essentially the same team the whole time. (Sure, I went through various charioteers but their stats were all similar.)There's a lot of potential here but as-is, the novelty wore off for me after a few hours. I'm glad I picked it up on sale and only paid $5, so I feel like I got decent value from the game.			"

												Yes, Romans, this has all the thrilling action and bloodshed you've come to expect from a day at the Circus Maximus! Take control of the Empire's finest auriga and chariots as you compete for glory and denarii! But you will not be alone in your quest for the Maximus, ludes- you'll have to deal with the full might of Rome's military as you deal with the Russata! Jupiter's power drives the Albata, while the well-funded nobles of Veneta seek your defeat! And if that weren't enough, Romans, the Praesina race for the glory of everyday folk! Beware the Senate-backed Purpurata- their chariots are the finest in all the Empire, while the Aurata control the trade of the greatest horses!Will you find fame and glory in the Circus Maximus, Romans? Or will your career end beneath the hooves of the QVADRIGA?			"

												Qvadriga is a fun simple and yet surprisingly deep top down strategy racing game. If you've ever played the board game Formula D you'll instantly see some similarties but enough diversity to be its own thing. At first it may seem like a luck based game but the more you play and develop your play style the more you see skill plays a factor in 90% of things. Random events keep the game fresh and new and not as repetitive and its just all around polished decently.My only complaints are that $19.99 for this game is asking for more than the game is worth because if you dont like it after your first 20-40 minutes you wont like it at all. Also this thing is BEGGING for a multiplayer component which would make the game much much more replayable.To sum it up short: Great game, lot of fun, probably too high a price for how simple the game is and MULTIPLAYER PLEASE.

Стоит ли покупать Qvadriga? | Как я был рабом и рабовладельцем.[dokole.me]Я настоятельно рекомендую игру всем тем, кому нравится представленная в игре эпоха, кто не обращает внимание на графическое несовершенство в угоду интересному, занимательному, азартному геймплею. Я провел около 20 часов в игре и, наверное, проведу еще некоторое время, стараясь достигнуть совершенства в динамической кампании с эпическим уровнем сложности. Меня шутя проклинают те, кого уже удалось подсадить на игру, за потраченное на нее время, пропущенные пленумы и перерывы на обед, ведь она доступна для покупки не только на ПК, но и для планшетов (iPad, Android), а значит прощай время, здравствуй кровавый спорт.

												I bought this game quite some time ago on Slitherine's website and it has finally arrived on Steam (got a key from them w00t) where I'll definitely continue playing this game. It is unique (ancient Roman chariot racing - nuff said ^^), very tactical and contains a LOT of diversity. The game comes with six different factions you can select to play with alongside the upgrades to horses, qvadrigas (chariots) and aurigas (drivers), it has a huge selection of tracks to race on (over 40) you have to unlock by gaining fame and the AI is quite challenging in actual fact. There is little in the way of luck that will determine the outcome of a race but your choices during the three (sometimes four) rounds that will either make or break your guys, steeds and chariots. To me, it's a little gem out there and I really like to see the game out here on Steam finally so it may get the attention it deserves. Don't shy away from the admittably blant 2D graphics, this game is a must-have if you like a unique, tactical challenge. Recently, I have rarely played a game that would deserve this kind of praise, but Qvadriga delivers!			"

												Feels like a boardgame more than a video game... and thats good by my preferences.But oh, there can be some rage-quit times to be had with this one.It's a great racing game and if you like Ben-Hur (the movie) then this is Ben-Hur with all the boring parts cut out of it.You can feel like you have the best team, and suddenly you can be wiped out with some bad ""luck?"" (try 3 chariot spills in a row with 2 deaths)The AI can hemm you in and make things difficult, I once was full in the lead when a chariot in last place pulled an nasty cut-off as I was about to lap him... so nasty that it hemmed me as everyone else flew past making me lose the race (as far as winning money).I don't think anything more could have been added  to make this any better, the graphics are fine, 3D would have been ok but not really important. A lot of your own imagination takes up the slack. I like the random pregame events that add extra interesting situations in the race.There is city travel as you get better, going to better events... but make sure you dominate your current city before making a trip, it's more competitive out there.I'll be playing this a lot. Multiplayer would be awesome tho...			"

												This has got to be one of the most half-♥♥♥♥♥ boardgame ports of all time. This is pretty much exactly the game ""Circus Maximus"", but the interface is garbage, there's no multiplayer support of any kind, and the game is less polished than most game jam games.Here's how much the devs cared:You can go back to the main menu in the middle of a race if it's going badly for you, and there are no repercussions.You can go back to the main menu from the management screen, then back, to re-roll the products in the market until you get what you want.The savegame is stored in the installation directory.Changing the resolution will always re-enable fullscreen.You can't turn off the music, you can only mute the sound. It will sometimes turn itself back on when you change screens.The graphics are functional but very ugly. The ""how to play"" is multiple pages of walls of text that makes the game seem considerably more complicated than it really is. And the font is blurry.The actual game here is excellent. It's very, very fun. I highly recommend playing this game, but don't buy Qvadriga. Play the boardgame, play the DOS game from 1984 that has multiplayer support, but whatever you do, don't give Slitherine money for making off with someone else's game and half assing it.I desperately want somebody to port this boardgame, but to do it properly. This is just a waste.			"

Chariots of fire, handfuls of gold...Qvadriga, developed by Turnopia and published by Slitherine, takes on the topic of Roman Chariot racing, applying Slitherine's usual love and care in bringing out a turn based, tactical approach which makes racing strongly reminiscent of Avalon's Circus Maximus boardgame. I get the distinct feeling that it was inspired by it, and it's taken that as it's base and then developed from there, iterating on it and improving and extending on that for the computer and tablet platforms.You take on the role of a manager of a Chariot stable, home of anything up to four Aurigas (Charioteers) and their associated Chariots and Horses. Before each race you'll get a chance to manage your stables, purchase specialised repairs if necessary for your stable, and make bets on your charioteer if you feel confident enough that he'll win. Additionally in the campaign mode you'll be racing around the empire of Rome, building up reputation in smaller venues at first and buying and selling progressively more skilled and expensive items for your stable, eventually working your way into the Circus Maximus itself. The campaign comes in normal and epic mode, depending on how much of a challenge you're up for.Chariot racing can be a horrible sport!Static turns are the way to go, allowing you plenty of time to assess the field and figure out your next move, you've a slew of options to control speed (Hint, you want to go fast, it's a race you know), to move across the various ""tracks"", the inside tracks are narrower and afford tighter turns but you'll need to take them slower unless you want to wreck the chariot and end up with a dead rider. The outer tracks mean more distance but you can maintain that speed, this means there's a clear risk and reward involved in working out the optimal place to be on each turn, particularly in the early stages when the field is packed, and you really, really don't want to wind up fighting with another charioteer.Whipping boys...Combat happens as well, there's two options, lacerate (which means using your whip to whack at the horses and the rider, it's more frequent, but less damaging) and crash, which will hurt far more, but can only be done once or twice per turn. Needless to say, the better chariots come with wheel blades, making Crash a far more temping option, especially when a well timed crash will either shred the poor horse to pieces or the wheel on the cart, instantly taking out the rider. There is also a ""watch"" option to avoid an attack if you expect one to happen, and a ""control"" option to better ensure stability if you think you're coming into a turn too fast. There's a lot of control here, and turn by turn as the race unfolds, you'll be required to continually think and re-adjust as you're going along. A few tutorial races will help you get into the swing of things.It's a bit dusty to look at though...Whilst the various events can impose weather effects which do show up in game, a nice touch, graphically the best way I can phrase this is as ""Vanilla"", along with the sound and music, it's functional and decent. But it's not exactly going to amaze or thrill. One problem I had was that the unity engine used (4.3) kept failing and crashing until I performed the D3D9.DLL fix (Payday2 vets will know what that implies), if you're getting unity failover errors, this is definitely the first thing to look at. It seems that the Unity engine is a bit finnicky. Worth examining if it's a problem.Quietly addictive...Functional presentation aside, this is a really, really good game. It's one for strategy buffs though, don't expect heart pounding action, but if you like the concept of a thinking Roman's race through the Circuses. And managing your Chariots and building up an excellent stable whilst gambling those coins to help keep you afloat whilst hoping that your Chariot's wheel stays on for this one last lap... well, this one definitely gets the thumbs up.Verdict An easy sell to Strategy buffs, especially fans of Slitherine games. Wishlist it if you're not sure though and ask a friend who has it to discuss during a free evening. "

												I downloaded the demo a long time ago, enjoyed it but didn't think it worth the full asking price. But this weekend it was on sale so I snapped it up.I've run it 3 times since downloading it, and it crashed twice. Crashed so badly that the only way I could regain control of my PC was to power it down.Seriously?I don't know what kind of difference there is between the demo and the full product, but that's not very impressive. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. As for the one time it has worked so far, yes that was great. If only that was a consistent experience I'd be giving the game a thumbs-up.[Edit] Well, it's stopped crashing, and as per my comment above, I'm now changing this to a thumbs-up, because it's now become a fun game again.

												This game is simple, it's an rpg about chariot racing.  It's simple looking, but serviceable.  Having said all that, I loved this game.  Chariot racing is really brought to life here, and playing in the default mode, you have to think about every play, 6 seconds at a time.  Every turn can cost you a cart, sometimes even a career racer.  It's hard to recommend to just anyone though, but if you need a good chariot rpg in your life, this is it!  lol			"

												I got this off the humble bundle, and i was kind of skeptical.  I tried it out, and immediately uninstalled it.Today i got it back on my laptop, properly learned how to play, and discovered that its really a very odd kind of fun.  Difficult, tight, mechanics, and more depth than there appears to be. No bells and whistles, just cuthroat chariot racing.			"

												A really interesting, original strategy game - but not worth the price tag.Turn based Roman chariot racing - good original subject. And a really nice, simple mechanic, easy to understand, quick to get into, but really intriguing to play. That sounds great, right? Well, it is. The apparent simplicity of chariots trundling around the track actually creates a really interesting set of challenges, where the positions of chariots around you mean you have to carefully consider every turn, with different races unfolding to reward different tactics. It's like a really, really good board game.Except...The graphics are super-simple, 2d. That isn't a problem, but it feels more like a five dollar mobile game.The individual races are interesting, but there is no sense of story or progression, no apparent end-game, no rivalries to develop with other teams, and little ability to develop your drivers. Further, there is no Hall of Fame where you can compare your drivers' achievements nor mourn for those who have died. And all of that is a shame.Also, there is no multiplayer. Given that this plays like a boardgame - like the sort of thing you'd want to get out for half an hour to play with your friends around the coffee/dining table - it's a real shame that there is no internet multiplayer option (nor any other multiplayer).So, if you're interested in an unusual little strategy game - one that you can keep coming back to and dipping into for an engaging coffee-break distraction - then this is absolutely worth having. But it's hard to justify much more than $5 for it.Recommendation: add to wishlist; wait for it to be reduced.			"

												A great game that is very enjoyable and interesting.  Could use some more options and levels of equipment et cetera as it all gets a bit samey after a while.  But for the money this is a temendous racing game if a little shallow.			"

												Bought this for $8 on Humble Bundle and that is still probabaly about $3 more than I should have paid. With that said this game was fun! It is simple enough to get into but there is enough there to care. Also the AI is pretty smart and has a pretty good chance of anticipating your next move. The graphics are an issue, as it looks like a free Java game, not super impressed but at least the game runs fast.Buy it on sale, this game should cost about $5.			"
