												What a surprise!This is an extremely fun arcade racer with boost, powerups and unlockable stuff.The graphics are beautiful, the landscape is stunning, the entire game is fantastic!This game is similar to BLUR, but with airplanes.Don't worry, it's not easy at all, it's challenging even at the first few maps!This game is underrated and overlooked by any means.WORTH IT!The only flaw however: no split-screen 2 player mode.

												Skydrift is a fun and fast arcade style combat-racer with planes. It does a lot of things good but also has some problems too.The good: Gameplay is fast even down to the load times. You can finish a race in 3-4 minutes, so it's a perfect pick up and play game. The weapons are basic, but fun to use. Machine guns, homing missiles, mines and Area-Stun shock. Opponents are challenging, but not unfairly so. I'm not sure if the AI has rubber-banding or not - but they do keep up.The tracks are cool with open spaces and small tunnels. Driving through small tricky spaces are awarded with boost. A few different game modes like the basic death race, elimination and speed race. Different planes to unlock and choose from with different stats, not a crazy amount of variation as they basically handle pretty much the same anyway. Every plane has 4 different skins to unlock and choose from. The campaign is lengthy enough, nothing spectacular: No story or real progression, just pick your plane and finish the next race and earn more plane unlocks and skins. Has controller support for Xbox-compatible controllers and Joysticks.The bad: Very few tracks. Fortunately, they are good and look different from one another. They do reverse the tracks in some races to give it a bit of a spin. Also in some races the scenery starts exploding and falling apart and adding hazards to the race. This one is a common problem with flying racing-games. As flying gives you so much freedom in all directions it's a bit difficult to lay out a track. This game handles it fairly well in most places: the tracks are designed to funnel you in a certain direction and arrows guide you in the right direction and creates borders. But sometimes there are obstacles that fall just in the line of that funnel and an invisble wall forcibly guides you in the right direction resulting in annoying crashes. There IS multiplayer. But it's a ghost town. No-one playing. This can't really be faulted on the game itself. But just a heads up for those looking to play online. Has Xbox controller support - but the screen icons do not change from the keyboard layout. You can view the controls from the options however. "

												Extremely fun game, got it on sale and don't regret it, would have payed more.Haven't even tried multiplayer yet and I can say it's one of the most fun games I've played in a while. There's an element of adrenaline, chaos, split-second decisions, not even good racing games are as cool as this. The game looks and sounds good, the planes have a degree of customisation (paint) and you have enough planes to choose from. The combat system is good as well, making it easier for new players to adapt rather than making it difficult to shoot stuff. Arcade is the largest factor of this game, simulation not so much, and good for it.You do need some time to adapt, won't be pro on the first tries, but there's no way you're not gonna enjoy this even a little bit. It might not be addictive, grant it, but that's not a bad thing; this is the sort of game you keep in your library and now and then come back to, because it's gonna be fun anytime.PS: Joystick or at least controller, keyboard won't be as good.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: SkyDrift Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Racing; Arcade; Multiplayer; Action My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Nostalgia chasers; Multiplayer gamers; Casual gamers REVIEWSkydrift is a hidden-gem of an combat-racer game involving what feel like go-kart versions of airplanes.  It reminds me of Diddy Kong Racing from back in the day, (which was like Mario Kart but with planes). The game is a lot of fun, especially in multiplayer. If you’re looking for some simple-pleasure arcade action, you probably want to check this out.At the core it is a racing game, so your objective is always to come in first. As you buzz around, you collect power-ups (like protective shields for your plane or missiles to launch at your enemies) which will help you win the race.  It’s simple and arcade like, and as such don't expect it to feel anything like you’re flying a plane for real.  But it is easy to get the hang of, and is a nice casual experience. That said, I highly recommend using a controller, because it is much more natural than a keyboard & mouse.It is also noticeable that the graphics are pretty nice. They aren’t anything amazing, but for a game that is clearly focused on gameplay as a selling point, I thought the graphics were an excellent bonus. I mean: if you’re going to blow your opponents out of the sky while doing a barrel-roll through a hollow stone circle, it doesn’t hurt if it looks pretty cool too.It’s pretty easy to beat the ""campaign,"" leading to the game feeling somewhat short. You unlock new maps and new planes as you play through, but there is very little noticeable variance to be honest; regardless, the game is short enough that it doesn't really matter much.  By the time you start to become bored, you will have beaten it.The multiplayer is a whole different ballgame. The game is much more exciting to play against other people. When I played I was able to find some games, but it wasn't very populated. If you can find some people who want to meet up, that is probably your best bet. I did it a few times on the weekends and a few random people jumped in too and we wound up with full games. That was fun, but I wouldn’t count on that being the standard.Anyway, Skydrift is definitely a fun game. If you think you would like what it offers, it is worth your consideration. Doubly so if you have a couple of friends to play with.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

Basic InformationTitle:  SkyDriftDeveloper:  Digital RealityPublisher:  Kalypso Media DigitalGenre:  RacerGeneral ImpressionSkyDrift is an aesthetically pleasing 3D aerial racer with enough details and diversity, to recommend it as one of the best games for this subgenre, in recent years. It follows the classic formula of arcade racing but it is also sprinkled with combat elements since overtaking some of your opponents would simply leave you vulnerable to their attacks. So the best defence is as always, offence. You will have to make use of all the power-ups present on the maps, since they will make the game a bit easier. That is something you’re in dire need since the AI is fairly aggressive and if that isn’t enough for you, surely the multiplayer modes will offer an adequate challenge. The main flaw of this title is the fact that it contains two DLC packs that feel like they were cut on purpose from the main game, only to be resold. Even if I’m already used with this greedy practice enforced by Kalypso upon its dev teams, I still cannot accept it.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and sounds.+ Steam Achievements.Weak Points- No Steam Trading Cards.- DLCs should have been present in the retail version.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways and Kool Kids Klub.

The Good:* Pick-up-and-play gameplay works well* Well-balanced combat and plane variety* Entertaining difficulty (not too hard or easy)* Well worth the priceThe Bad:* Bad graphics for its time* Recycled textures* Physics engine is poor* No plane customisation* The power-ups could be rebalancedBottom line:Good for a quick ten-minute gaming session when not in the mood for something more serious. Certainly worth spending 2 or 3 USD on during a sale.			"

												Very addicting arcade flying game with a surprising amount of depth that will reveal itself gradually once you start putting more hours into the game. Early game can be very off putting as gameplay seems so hard. Especially if you are crazy enough to try Normal/Hard difficulties. AI will leave you in the dust as you keep crashing. Speed racing especially can be a big 'nope' moment for many. But as you learn the levels - which there are not that many - then the differences between planes and tactics in levels. not to mention aerial acrobatic/low flying comes into play. Multiplayer games are a blast. You only need 2 players of equal skill and you got yourself very tight races. Every single time.  You will need to learn to master those counter measures and offensive weapons. Game is strong on singleplayer too. Just do the campaign on Easy or normal and then add some difficulty. Good luck trying to 100% all achievements. ps. get the Premium Airplane pack. it is so cheap and adds useful planes to the game.			"

												SkyDrift was a very positive surprise for me.I bought the game for multiplayer with my kids and ended playing through the single player campaign. The game is a bit like the old Mario Racing, only with planes. It is extremely funny to play online with your friends. Additional copies of the game required, there is no split screen mode. I also enjoyed the good graphics and even bought the DLC with the new planes when it was on sale.Highly recommended if you look for a casual racer.			"

												SkyDrift is an alright game. I mean, I got to stage 5 and there's only 7 stages. And of those 7 stages, it's the same 3 or 4 levels that are being raced on, they're just set up differently as you progress. They're either speed races, power races, or reverse races. So the game does get kind of boring as you progress. There isn't much reward for winning besides in-game medals and Steam achievements, if you're into that.I will say that the graphics are gorgeous though. The planes are well designed. The levels have great texturing. But there is an over abundance of particles which I think is the cause of some serious stuttering, which is the main reason why I'm done with this game. The serious stuttering almost makes it unbearable as the frame rate drops far below the already locked 30 fps and the plane becomes uncontrollable, causing you to crash and lose your position. Although it's fairly easy to get your space back.Another thing, this game is best suited to play with a controller. I tried playing with a kb/m, and a 360 controller was just so much more natural.I wouldn't recommend the game though. There are many other racing games that have way more levels to try out. There's only so much you can do with the same 4 levels.6.0/10			"

												The P2P lobby/server system is confusing and annoying. There are very few people playing at any given moment so it would make sense to get them all into the same game. However the only way to join a game is to enter an automatically assigned lobby. If there is already a match going on you have no way of knowing when its over and the players will return to the lobby. This makes it very hard to get a lot of people into the same game. You can use Steam to track other players to a certain degree, but it's hardly convenient. A normal server list would have eliminated this problem.I love the gameplay and also the maps and plane designs but I hate pretty much everything else about this game.			"

												Hello there!Skydrift ... old game, but it is surely fun. First time I have played it, was on my xbox360. The game feels and play exactly the same from back then.Being a fan of fast racing games like Wipeout series on Playstation, I felt home from the first seconds.Gameplay is fast and addictive. You have to develop strategies along with your flying abilities if you want to reach in #1. No whinning will get you there.There are lots of different planes to unlock, each one specializes in some area (armour,speed, maneuverability...) and seven different tracks, which can be played backwards as well) and some gameplay modes like elimination, race against the clock and full race.The powerups are fun, there are guns, missiles, force fields and mines. You will love it.Needless to say, this title is not so popular, so multiplayer isn't populated at all.I play it with a xbox360 gamepad, and it feels perfect. Perhaps it might be harder to play on the keyboard. Will try it someday.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Controls: 8/10Final consideration: for it's price, I think it is quite worth giving it a try.Thanks for reading!			"

												What is it? Its race mixed with air battle. Its really fast game where 4 rackets or some bullets can change the leader on last meters. Of course it doesnt mean that if you are first you cant do anything. You can reapir, use shield to avoid some nasty rackets or left some mines for fallowers. 3 race types, many planes with different stats and challenges, medals make it really good game. But there arent so many maps as it should be (only my opinion) and multiplayer is dead. Anyway if you like races in a different form its something for you.			"

												I only recently got a decent video card, so I'm a geek from way back that needs to catch up on some games. I've also got kiddos, so I can't be too involved on my games... This game is perfect. It's a couple of years old, so no problems running it on newer hardware, but it's FUN. I can play as long or as short a time as I'd like to. I'd love to see additional tracks for this game, but it's unlikely much new is going to come the way of Skydrift. As it stands, with what it is, it's terrific. Not too involved, jump-in-and-play, and stay as long as you like. I'm having so much fun with it; I wish I'd found it sooner.			"

												I think I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale last year and I've played it on occassion when I feel like a crazy racing game. Skydrift reminds me of all the wacky racing games I used to play in the arcades in the late 90's. With it's fast unreal action, loud engines, crazy power-ups (rockets and EMPs), this game gives me the same thrill as Hydro Thunder, even though that's superboats and not super-planes, and Hydro Thunder seems to be the best game to compare this to. The levels are full of vibrant detail and as the race progresses, the environments change too! There's a volcano race that is absolutely insane when it starts erupting, and a canyon level that starts to crumble around you! Also, the graphics of Skydrift are pretty as well! The planes are well-detailed and very colorful and they each have their own style of flying. I play this game with a gamepad (ps3 controller) so it's a little easier to control than if you were playing on a keyboard. I tried it with a keyboard and my hands couldn't take the coordination it required. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves crazy arcade racing games!			"

A Paladin's Review: Skydrift. A Solid and Enjoyable Arcade Racer.Genre: Arcade RacerDeveloped and Published by: Digital Reality & Kalypso Media Digital.Platform: Windows, Xbox 360 and PS3. Business Model: Base Game + DLC For Multiplayer LevelsCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full blog review here[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsSkyDrift is a great looking, fast action, arcade racing game. It's chaotic, intense and skillful. Single player offers plenty of content and planes to choose from. It offers beautiful vistas of places to fly through and the world feels very organic and alive. It reminds me of Mario Kart mixed with Diddy Kong Racing. The three different modes of play, Power, Speed and Survival, keep it interesting if you want to change it up. Power is where you have the ability to use powerups. Speed takes powerups out and survival is about making it the longest. There's a good amount of powerups, all sorts of different planes to choose from and a decent amount of racing tracks to chew on. The various different types of planes vary from flighty and twitchy, to heavy and slow but still remain balanced enough for engaging races everytime. The AI gets lots of help with rubberbanding and teleporting but it's still possible to beat it. It's just really aggravating. The game is definitely best played against others though. There's a good amount of variety for such a small budgeted game. VisualsThe vibrant graphics also make it a feast for the eyes as you fly around in the well crafted planes. From the cold icy tundras, to the Mediterranean waterfalls to the deserts, the game has some really gorgeous places you fly around in. MultiplayerInitially at launch, SkyDrift's multiplayer was broken. It was plagued with lobby issues, lots of lag and desync problems. Fortunately, it seems that multiplayer has been fixed. Not sure when and for how long, but it works again. That being said, it could easily break itself, so, that's something to keep in mind. Getting a lobby with friends going is pretty easy as it ties itself in with Steam. I should note that the game has a ridiculously long wait of 60 seconds to start up a game. Not really sure why and it gets reset everytime someone decides they want to fly something else. So you could be waiting at the lobby for a while. Final ThoughtsSkydrift is one of my favorite racers I've had the pleasure of playing in the past couple of years. The devs shot themselves in the foot by not having multiplayer be up to snuff but that somehow fixed itself. If you need a new arcade racer, SkyDrift is the one to pick up.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												This is a rather obscure little plane-racing game with a few maps, a few planes, and a few powerups.  I don't even recall exactly how it got into my Steam Library -- part of a Humble Bundle, I think.  So my expectations were not set particularly high when I finally tried it out.And I was impressed.The controls are really tight, the action is frantic, and the graphics are pretty.  It's not a flight sim (and not trying to be,) it's more like MarioKart with the addition of vertical steering.  What SkyDrift does, it does very successfully, with a great deal of polish and refinement.  A point can legitimately be made that SkyDrift pretty quickly runs out of variety, in terms of its maps, planes, and powerups, but it is a budget title, so it's a bit unfair to hold the small size of the game against it -- I'm more pleased by a limited but well-done game than a sprawling one that's buggy and barely-playable.

												While the multiplayer is inherently dead due a lack of players the single player portion remains the only reason most people would need to purchase and enjoy this game.Essentially this is an over the top, arcadey aircraft racing game that has for added comedy and randomization reasons a range of weapons and powerups, the game is also not that bad looking considering that it was originally released back in 2011. Finally the relatively low requirements the game demands from the user's system are an added bonus for people who are stuck on lower end systems and wish to experience a video game that has high visual quality production levels without having to go bust and break the bank.

												Essentially Mario Kart w/ Extreme Air Racing, SkyDrift is an airplane racing game with weapons. Fly through tight courses with some wide and narrow areas as you hit powerups and decide when to deploy them, or toss them to gain boost and overtake your opponents, but getting in front means getting shot at! With variety of planes with different amount of acceleration, maneuverability, top speed, boost, etc. as well as different paintjobs to unlock, it's a load of fun to race laps in all the different planes, which can win the race, depending on how you exploit its capabilities to the fullest! Graphics are quite good, not cartoony, and controls are quite crisp, required when racing is as frantic as it is.			"

												A super fun arcade racer (or should that be 'flyer'?) Skydrift is very slick indeed. It handles exceptionally smoothly, moves at a speedy pace, has great courses and is a blast to play.It's a smidge clunky in some ways though, but nothing that's a deal breaker.....1) Despite supporting controllers some of the menu has to be navigated with shortcuts on the keyboard - which is a minor annoyance.2) Most annoyingly - in multiplayer, once all the players are accepted, it then sits there for a minute and this waiting time can't be skipped. So if you're playing with friends, and know that noone else will be joining the game, it can get tedious. Yet there's no option (as far as I know) to avoid this......However, as I said, these are small problems in an otherwise supremely polished game. And it really is a huge amount of fun to play.			"

												Recomended, but not.SkyDrift is interesting game with a good proof of concept. The single player almost as fun as the multiplayer. However, the game really is too small for it's price. There are only six different maps in the game, with some areanas available as dlc. Even with the ability to race the maps backwards it gets old quickly. The multiplayer, while fun, is almost never available due to a distinct lack of players. This is partialy due to the lack of control that the game gives you in selecting a mp game. SkyDrift aoutomaticaly creates lobbys for racers rather then having a server list. There is no chat, in lobby or in game. And, after all plyers have readied, there is a one minute before every race. Also some skins will glitch and make you invisable to other players during races. The arcade controls, while they usualy make it easier on normal races, make it verry hard to fly in arena mode. The game is a bit over priced by itself for it's size. The dlc really should not be dlc but part of the actual game. Dispite these problems, the game is really quite fun. Don't expect to be able to play alot of multiplayer unless you know several people who also own the game. Over all, recomended if you have a lot of friends to play it with.			"

												Great idea, and kinda fun, but really not ready for the real world. The game concept itself is great, a bit like other light-hearted racer/shooters such as Mashed or even Mario Kart. The single player offers a few hours of fun races against AIs. But there are two game-breaking shortcomings.First, it could do with some kind of balance mechanism, like Mario Kart's ""catch up"" bullet bill. If players get separated from each, they'll just never meet again, leading to a really boring race. This is true for the AIs and human players alike.Second, a fun racing game like this really needs to be played against humans, but it's so hard to. There's no single-machine (splitscreen or Micro Machines style) mode, so you can only play against someone else with the same game. There's nobody online at all, because it's such a small game. Even if you can find a friend to invite to play, the inviting-through-steam mechanism is really fiddly to get working. And then there's no humans-plus-AIs mode, so you end up with only two people in a race, and because of the first problem you might only see the other player for the first half a lap.The single-player is reasonable for a quid or two, but the lost promise of what multiplayer might have been spoilt the enjoyment for me. I bought it having read earlier reviews complaining about empty servers, but hoping to play it with friends at LAN parties &c., but even that's no use: no splitscreen, no LAN play, and lack of player interaction in-race.

												Probably one of the best racing games I ever played.Graphics are amazing, everything is fast, and the addition of power-ups to the game only makes it more interesting.The only problem is that on the last Levels the game is too hard. Medium difficult looks like Impossible (I still can't beat the last race in 1st place - got 2nd only), the AI is a pain.Overall it is a good game, kinda short and the replay vallue is good.

												An underrated gem.  I prefer playing campaign/solo, so the lack of multiplayer servers doesn't bother me that much.  As some have mentioned, the DLCs should just have been part of the base game, but besides that little marketing snafu, this is one heckuva fun race (with power-ups ala Mario Kart).

												Meh.  This game is kinda fun but gets real old after about ten minutes.  The ""campaign"" is a series of seven stages with a half dozen races each, except it recycles the same four maps over and over again so you've pretty much seen the whole game by the time you beat the first stage.  The multiplayer deathmatch was a good idea except there's never anybody online to play against.  Worth picking up a few copies for you and some friends if it's on a good steam sale I guess.			"

												This is a hard one to score because I don't entirely want to pick ""No"", but I don't entirely want to pick ""Yes"", either. I'm somewhere in the middle. SkyDrift is not a *bad* game, it's just... not good enough.SkyDrift is a racing game that has the feel of Hydro Thunder but is basically a car combat game with airplanes. The power-up system reminds me a lot of Bizarre Creations' ""Blur"".Having tried the demo for SkyDrift back when it came out, I was eager to get the full game, but now that I have it, it doesn't seem to be holding up to extended singleplayer play. Courses get VERY narrow, and VERY winding, yet your planes do not often feel up to the task of maneuvering through them easily. Presumably this is where the racing game element comes in, and you're expected to slow down around corners... but given the intrinsic nature of flying airplanes, slowing down means losing altitude, and I instinctively never want to slow down for fear of crashing.The controls in general could be a lot better. In a lot of other games, flying planes usually has a ""Easy"" mode (where it auto-levels you out, assists your flight, etc.) and a ""Simulation"" mode (where you have full control over your plane). SkyDrift doesn't give you an option and is stuck in that aforementioned ""Easy"" mode. Sometimes I don't feel entirely in control of my plane, especially when making the namesake ""sky drifts"" - holding the right stick makes my plane drift and sway in ways that don't always make me feel comfortable. It also doesn't actually seem to modify my turning radius very much, or at least, not enough to make some of the sharp turns it asks of you. I'm also just getting bored with the gameplay. I'm about halfway through the fourth tier of tracks (apparently about 50% of the way through the game's singleplayer content), and so far the game has not provided much in the way of diversity. The artificial intelligence is also reaching a point of frustration - in the last race I was in before writing this review, I finished third place as 1st and 2nd were so far ahead of the rest of the pack that it was impossible to catch up to them (even after I broke away from the pack and spammed boost). They are so close to having something special here, but it just falls a little too short. It just needs a little more balance, a little more polish, and a little more content. Maybe it's better in multiplayer, but I think I might be the only person on my friends list who owns it (though to be honest, I haven't exactly checked).			"

												A hard one to review.  I got it because me and friends really enjoyed Blur, this game is very similar to that.  The gameplay is great - I actually usually play hardcore flight sims - and it's cute the way this game uses some analogues to actual flight (rolling your plane to allow sharper manouvers than simply yawing).  Vertical movement also gives it another dimension (literally) than Blur has and they make the most of it too with some great maps.  It's a blast to play and the sensation of speed is excellent.  I thought being locked to 30fps would really offend me but it doesn't actually bother me.  The motion blur is very well done and covers the missing frames.  Graphically it's really nice all together - and the sensation of movement is very visceral.Okay now the problem.  There's no skirmish type mode where you can fly against the AI with human players ""co-op""ing along with you.  Blur or Gas Guzzlers totally wipes the floor with this game here.  Basically I want to play this with my gf and gang up on the AI.  And there is no such game mode :(So you have a fun single player campaign that will give you a few hours fun.  And an empty Online multiplayer.  BUT no ability to play with your pals or on a LAN against the AI - this really is a shame as otherwise I'd heartily recommend this.  What a shame.I barely can still recommend this for a few quid			"

												This game is quite nice to play, at first glance it might seem simple but it does have quite much depth once you understand a bit more. Different game modes require a bit different tactics being in the lead in power races is not always easy as your opponents will shoot you while in the lead. Multiplayer can be played in the base game but bying the DLCs will give you Deathmatch and Team deathmatch plus some additional planes to fly with. The game suffers from lack of players now in the year 2016 but there are some communities and steam groups where you can find players even now. The graphics are perfectly fine and the game runs very well on a bit older hardware. All in all a very balanced game for casual gaming, the in-game achievements are also quite challenging to collect and the AI are quite challenging as well. If you can find it on sales I do recommend you check it out.			"

												SkyDrift may seem a bit tame at first, but don't let it fool you.  Once it stops teaching you the ropes, things ramp up quickly.  The basic mechanics of SkyDrift make it sound like Mario Kart with planes, which is actually pretty accurate, but make no mistake that this game is far more intense and far more beautiful than any Mario Kart game.  You can almost feel the G's as you hug the ground to gain speed or fly knife edge between two pilars to snag a power up.  The controls take a bit of getting used to, but they work really well.  Control over your plane feels nice and tight, even during the more hectic moments.  You'll definitely want to play this one with an x-box game pad.			"

												Fast and crazy arcade action, immediately comparable to Hydro Thunder.  Choose from a number of different planes and hit the skies in three different race modes, and a combat mode.  Shoot at your friends, or shoot at some bots (which are actually pretty decent).  Perform daring stunts and attack opponents to fill your boost gauge, and blast ahead of the competition!The visuals in this game are top-notch; everything is usually going by in a blur, but that didn't stop them from detailing the stages well, and there's always lots to look at (and avoid crashing into).   The gorgeous visuals make you want to explore the entire island, but you're sadly restricted to the track boundaries.If you are a fan of kart racers like Diddy Kong Racing and Mario Kart, Skydrift has what you need.

												The game has a different approach to racing and a very welcomed one. Sadly I cannot recommend this game. Good visuals, imaginative scenes yet on the technical side the game is frame locked to a stuttering 30fps. The game just feels heavy and fails to make you feel like your soaring through the skys at blazing speeds.			"

												Very fun concept, but for a three-dimensional racing game I expect to be able to fully move in three dimensions. Instead, if you stray too far from the ""track"" you're pushed back on it - and crash, because you weren't planning to move like that. Very frustrating.			"

For a Red Bull Air Race game there is surprisingly little advertisement in this gameHave you even seen the Red Bull Air race? A bunch of high powered airplanes try to complete a stunt course in the fastest time possible. The stuff these pilots do is insane. The loop round and under bridges with hundreds of spectators on them. Naturally, this is child's play. So Skydrift makes it more interesting. ""We let all the planes fly at once, give them weapons, and we do it over a volcano. That should do the trick."" Skydrift is fast paced and insanely exploside. Don't come home crying when you keep getting shot to ribbons; this isn't Mario Kart. Skydrift is quite hard because unlike regular race games, you'll also have to worry about your altitude. However, there are few things as awesome as plowing under mining equipment at 500 mp/h while blasting your competition with rockets and lightningbolts.			"

												I love the concept and really wanted to like this game however I just can't.  It simply doesn't live up to my expectations of a flight game.Pros: - Nice Graphics.  What I have seen in game the graphics are fairly well done.  Unfortunately this is only thing that the game has going for it in my opinion.Cons: - Flight mechanics are far too simplified and honestly quite terrible.  You are pretty much driving a flying car, not flying a plane!  You have no independent control of the plane's control surfaces, so forget playing with a HOTAS because it makes absolutely no sense to.  Rolling the plane left or right also turns the plane.  The game needs more realistic flight controls for me to enjoy the game.  I have much better car racing games in my library and would much rather play those, I was looking for a true plane racing game. - Absolutely no way to adjust controller sensitivity in game therefore small movements of the flight controller stick yeilds overwhelming response in game making controlled flight almost impossible. - Weird camera position, it is not quite cockpit view nor is it forward looking or third person view.  Making control of the plane akward. - Game does not support ultrawide resolutions especially when using AMD Eyefinity or Nvidia Surround Gaming. "

												SkyDrift is a fun, slightly non-serious racing/combat game. Unlike most racing titles, where you drive cars, here you're flying airplanes of varying types. The first thing I noted was the graphics, which in my opinion, were fantastic. Admittedly, it's sometimes difficult to notice detail when you're flying at high speeds through caverns, dodging enemy fire and launching missiles their way in return. Regardless, the visuals are impressive.The audio is decent. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. The music is good and the sound effects work nicely. My one gripe (and it's a minor one) is the announcer, whose voice is a bit annoying. Then again, I generally dislike announcers in any game, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.The controls are tight and responsive with a gamepad, which is something you'll want. The keyboard works well too, but there are times you'll wish you had an analogue stick. I don't know if flight sticks are supported.The single player part of the game has practice runs, time trials, and real races. The multiplayer component is supposedly similar. I wouldn't know since I haven't tried it. I imagine that, like any racing game, lag can have a huge impact on racing performance. One last thing I'd like to comment on is the design of the planes you fly. They're often odd and sometimes outlandish. I like that, given the fact the game isn't supposed to be realistic. It also reminds me of an old PC game entitled Crimson Skies, which handled similarly, although the game's content was much different.All in all, I'd recommend SkyDrift if you like racing games (with combat) and you're ltired of driving cars. Just don't mistake this game for a serious simulation, as it's most definitely arcade action all the way.			"

												Skydrift is beautiful, ferocious and above all fun combat racing game. The planes all look bad-♥♥♥, the world is beautiful and there is fun to bad around every corner.If you like Whacky Wheels, Mario Kart or Wipeout - you will love Skydrift.Game play is solid, spot on with a proper gamepad (I use Chillstream) and they game is pretty easy to get into, but like with any decent multiplayer game, can be pretty hard to master.As far as minuses go, the only thing I can think of the lack of split screen. Yes, I could not believe it myself, as this title screams for local mp action but there is none. So sad, so sad. Got a 4 pack myself to get some friends involved.So action racing fans gather as this is the best thing that has happened to the genre in years!9/10E: Now after having tested the mp part of this game on numeral occasion I am sad to inform you that it seems the online multiplayer part is pretty broken. People drop out all the time and if they are in half of the time you see them jumping around on the screen. It is a load of fun when it does work though but it turns out I was really lucky the first few times I tried the game online with buddies. As a result, I will have to lower the game score to 7/10 and I would NOT recommend it to those who want have a fun online experience.			"

												Dont bother if you are without a controllerIf you have a controller, give this game a try, its like fzero with planes.+Fast paced+Including DLC there is quite a selection of game modes+The planes are very pretty to look at+Even the downsides to your planes can be turned into upsides if you're smart, making it easy to tortoise and hare your online matches when facing less clever opponents.-Like Dark Souls, You can play without a controller, but youre going to be in for a significantly poorer experience if you do.-Also like Dark Souls, there arent many options for personal settings, you can really tell between this and the controller issue that its a game for xbox first, and for pc second.-Hard as nails to find online matches, youll probably need your friends to get copies of the game too.-Can become straight up broken when playing online, seemingly due to multiplayer rubberbanding (crashing your plane to get ahead is a viable tactic) -Sometimes stats seem to mean very little. Some planes perform better at some tasks than other planes, despite their stats claiming the complete opposite.If youre into that whole ""OH MY GOD IM ABOUT TO HIT THA- oh, im saf- OH MY GOD IM ABOUT TO HIT THA-"" kind of high speed gameplay, Or if youre into the whole Mario Kart/Wipeout vehicle combat thing, and you also happen to have a controller, Pick this game up the next time its on sale (which is quite often) and dont shy on the dlc, gladiator is good stuff.

												TL;DR This is the most satisfying, visceral arcade racer I've ever played- and in an undercrowded subgenre at that.It's very rare that I re-purchase a game on a different platform.  I was happy to make an exception for Skydrift (PS3->PC)  It's almost strange how little exploration there has been by other developers within the genre that Diddy Kong Racing introduced.  Then again, perhaps the obscurity of this title reveals that there aren't a gaggle of gamers out there clamoring for airplane combat racing.  One thing's for certain- it's not an unknown on account of it's quality.  No siree.Everything just feels right in Skydrift: A variety of planes to choose from with varying stats, an array of weapon pickups (all with an equal role to play), a dramatic soundtrack, satisfying difficulty levels, tight controls.  As is usually the case with a racing game, I do wish there were more than six tracks, but there are also reverse versions of each (bringing the number up to twelve) as well as 3 event types on any given track.  You're getting much more than your money's worth.What I can't capture in a list of features is the thrill the game delivers on a consistent basis.  Tilting your plane (controlled by the right stick) to narrowly squeak through a crevasse and gunning down the guy in front of you to zip across the finish line a split second before him is exhilarating.  There's something about the feel of the game and the way it asks you to brave your enemies and the shifting environments that just really strikes a chord with me.  Good good stuff- now I want a sequel and local multiplayer.			"

												Buy? Yes.I had a great time playing Skydrift, and while I'm not the best pilot for flight games, I have no problem playing arcade titles such as this and Starfox.It's a ""Mario Kart"" style racing game, that is reminescent of Blur, but with planes, and many have compared this to Crimson Skies which I have not had the opportunity to play. Besides your expected steering, acceleration, and power user controls, you use have the ability to twist into the knife edge postion, basically rolling your plane left or right laterally (DO A BARREL ROLL!) which helps you fit into tight openings and turn corners. The game says you need this for some turns, but I think you can brake and readjust if you real careful if you really wanted to (though, that is much slower and a terrible idea for later stages unless you have no other option). You also can ""burn"" power ups to add to your boost, which is a great mechanic requiring the player to use strategy - do you attack a racer, defend yourself, or speed up? You'll generally find it better to speed up more often than not, but you will definitely have to defend yourself in mid-stage races and attack in all races.There's only a few power ups compared to Mario Kart, but each can be stacked to a second level, creating another layer strategy, such as more mines, stronger bullets, or a bigger area of effect for the shockwave. Of course, you can just burn those power ups for a larger than normal boost as well. You can also perform ""stunts"" such as hugging the ground, drafting opponents, going through tight spaces, or damaging enemies to gain boost.The modes available, though limited are rather fun. The standard race are Power Races, as you race a level using power ups to boost and dogfight to slow enemies down, since you can't permanently stop any racer since everybody has unlimited respanws (excluding Elimination). Speed Race involve removing those powerups, and instead, racing through rings that can speed you up like the ones found in a later mission of Retrovirus. As I earlier mentioned, Elimination is much like Power Race, but after a set time frame, the last place racer is eliminated from the race until the last man standing. I had some really fun clutch moments of getting out of last place just in time, which is a shining moment of the game.The game has a pretty good art style and quality - planes look pretty good (especially in the intro sequence) and while level textures are a tad blurry on close angles (crashing, pausing, after race video), but you're often going too fast to notice, and the overall art design is similar to Sine Mora (another game developed by Digital Reality), but a bit brighter and sharper. I've read one person had a problem seeing power ups at times, but I've never had this problem unless I was being destroyed or driving near a mine - the power ups are well distinguished by different colors and clear vector icons. I like the guitar driven soundtrack, though I can't call it metal or hard rock, and honestly, it isn't something you'd feel you have to have in your OST collection - but I like what is there.I feel the AI is fair through the majority of the game, and I don't feel alot of Mario Kart rubberbanding (not to say there isn't, I just can't tell) though I find the later stages feel damn near impossible to get in 1st place. Another problem is a strong repetitiion of the levels - and while I think SkyDrift actually did a good job of spreading the repeated levels out (you often race on tracks that are the same as others, but in reverse or a slightly alternate route), You are only racing on the same 6 or so tracks, compared to other games that might have 16 or more. I think this is excusable due to the price point. Multiplayer community is non-existant, but if you buy this game, that will add another potential player who can be on (and you can also join my Abandoned multiplayer games group).Besides what I listed, There's really no major flaws with the game in my opinion and I'm glad I finally decided to play the game after having it installed for months and having purchased for a year or so, and having it wishlisted since it came out....I just wish I played it when there were more players - the DLC has a deathmatch mode that looks fun, but the Gladiator Multiplayer Pack is nearly impossible to recommend when practically nobody is playing, unless you play with friends (SO GET THE GAME AND PLAY WITH ME!). Regardless if you buy this on sale, or its $10 cheap price tag, it's a solid, fun arcadey racer.			"

												Skydrift: Extreme Fighters is a great and cheap DLC. It includes the 3 best-looking planes in the game plus 4 skins for each of them. Considering that the DLC costs 1.49€ you'll be getting each plane for less than 0.50€ which is a very good price. These planes are very well balanced so if you are struggling in the beggining of the game they can help you a lot. They can be used in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer modes, your game experience will definitely be improved with this DLC.Trywing vintage - Exceptional Boost Power and great Maneuverability which makes it perfect for Speed Races.Vanguard - Great armor and good Boost Power, recommended for Power Races.Sparrow X1 - Tremendous Speed, a fine all-around plane.

												Only just started playing this and although it looks quite reasonable (I got it in a sale for only £1.74, after all) one thing already annoys the heck out of me. The controls. Presumably none of the developers had ever flown a plane, played a flight sim or even tried a flight-based arcade game before. You can put the plane in knife-edge flight not by using the aileron (roll left/right) controls, but a completely different set of inputs. I can sort of live with that. But when you ARE in knife-edge flight, the elevator/aileron controls behave in the same sense as they do in level flight. i.e. moving left will turn your plane horizontally left, not roll it. And pulling back on the stick doesn't put you in a tight turn; it moves the plane vertically upwards.This is so counter-intuitive and WRONG I'm almost reluctant to play it any more, lest I get used to flying like this and find myself incapable of controlling any of the other plane sims/games/RC aircraft I own.I understand this isn't trying to be a sim, but even the most arcady of flight games get these simple inputs right.

												Racing games are inherently a no-brainer buy for stereoscopic 3D gamers and SkyDrift is no exception. Having gotten it working in 3D with Tridef ignition in only a few seconds (it has a built in profile) I was in an aircraft racing opponents in what so far I could call the best implementation of flight in a ""mario kart"" concept type of game.What surprises me the most is the well-vulgarized aviation controls... when  you make a game with planes and you need control to be made easy, it's a huge challenge, and the devs of this game pulled it off incredibly well. I can even use the keyboard with this game!Through a short and sweet first impressions video you can pretty much see I was happy with my purchase:

Strategy, including timing your boosts and power-ups, as well as which route to take and when, are all important in coming out on top. I would recomend playing with a control though, as a keyboard is a bit to slow, at least for myself.			"

A throwback to those arcade classics like Hydro Thunder or Rush, the environments are just beautiful and the classic power-up system is well executed.

Great for a relaxing break between more serious games, and you just might find yourself liking it more than you'd expect...			"

												Skydrift is the type of game I have been waiting for for years , whenever playing games with aeroplanes in them , i longed to be actually racing against each other. Dont get me wrong dogfights in games like hawx and the rest are great fun but never captured the core fun of arcadey style racers. So along comes skydrift a arcadey racing title with great plane physics and beautifully varied environments. Think Blur with planes and your half way there , the power ups are nice and varied and the game always gives you a challenge throughout.Where the game does come to life is in its various multiplayer modes. The thrill of chasing down friends (or enemies) is immensly good fun and i highly recommended this game to anyone who likes to have fun when they game.

												Fast paced, fun especially with friends and more than a little arcadey.If you ever played the Xbox version of crimson skies, this is basically the racing stages from that. You need to do tricks and fly low to gain a boost, getting shot down or crashing only loses you a few seconds and there are an abundance of powerups that you can use against other racers (much like MarioKart and Blur)You can get on someone's tail and gun them down, fire a guided missile or shock them with an electric pulse among other things. -This is both fun to use on others and infuriating when used on you, but it only makes me wanna get them back!Really, this is probably a niche game. You have to like flying, like arcade flying, like racing and like awesome looking aircraft. Assuming you like those, this is a fantastic game.It could use a free fly mode perhaps to practice the tracks but other than that, money well spent (especially if you can grab the bundle on sale)			"

												Freaken awesome!Whenever this goes on sale...buy it! This is what Dogfighter could have been. It is like Wipeout in the air. The powerups are few compared to other games, but you get to use ones you like often enough so you aren't sitting around waiting for the right one to spawn.Track design is well done with a mixture of routes hidden throughout along with some very good visuals. Hook up your 360 controller and go nuts with this!			"

												A solid, good and tight Diddy Kong Racing'ish racing game that's a bit more fast paced and competitive.  The racing is very well balanced and the gameplay is deceivingly simple with many subtleties to master.  If you have any interest in arcade-style plane racing games with combat power pickups, this is the one you're looking for.  Beautiful environments, great plane handling, adrenaline rushes, fierce competition and planning your strategy ahead make this a surprisingly well developed game in every aspect.It's absolutely essential to have some form of analog joystick/gamepad.

												It was my childhood dream to play such type of game... Look, the game exists after all (many classic titles can claim this, but none of them had all of the features I wanted).Race your customized airplane against others with full 3D controls & mind their missiles, bombs... and oh, shockwave plus many other weapons are also available for you to use too (like Mashed & Revolt, but this isn't car racing).And yes, map environments are awesome with decent graphics. You'd certainly drool to go there physically.			"

												SkyDrift is a fast-paced aerial racing game that will feel very familiar to anyone who's been to an arcade in the last decade. The gameplay is basic, but the action is quick and twitchy as one might expect.Flying in SkyDrift is quite simplistic, and again arcadey - with basic arrow keys for pitch and roll and 'W' and ""S' for throttle control by default, the game is quick to learn which is good as the courses can feel challenging but still ultimately forgiving.I played through over half of the game, and found at about the half-way point the game becomes repetitive as you will have played through all of the unique tracks by this point. The game proceeds to increase AI difficulty and increase the number of laps in each circuit to artifically extend gameplay. For an arcade game, keeping the player feel refreshed is usually a requirement, and the game fell a bit flat by that point.The visuals are on par with what i'd expect in an arcade again, but I particularly like the level design and the planes a lot. The level design is really well created, with pinch points, branching paths, and a requirement for a lot of twitch flying to avoid obstacles. Each race truly does feel intense purely by navigational standards. As a huge fan of Crimson Skies, I absolutely love the plane design as it entirely reminds me of that game.Overall this is a pretty fun, and quick arcade game - It's about 2 hours or so of gameplay before things will start feeling like a grind, but to get all of the planes unlocked you'll have to muster on.At the time of this review, Multiplayer no longer exists which isn't entirely surprising, but I bet it would have been pretty fun too.

												Let me get this out of the way: This is one great racing game. It has  good sense of speed, the items are a litle generic but work nicely, the AI is surprisingly fair (though on the hardest difficulty it does seem a little less so) and the challenge seems adequate for what it is. I understand the coplaint about there being too few tracks, but the mirror courses are -to me at least- different enough to count as bonafidenew tracks given  the game's price. The tracks and planes look great considering how old the game is and it should playable on almost any computer worth gaming on. Finally, the single player has leaderboards so you could aim to beat other peoples times on a given track.The game's single player mode has three types of events: there's the Power Race, which plays a lot like the plane parts of Diddy Kong racing where you can collect items and even stack them to use them against an opponent, the there's Survivor, where the last player in the race is knocked out after a certain amount of time until only one racer remains. and finally, there's Speed race, where boost rings  are littered across the ""tracks"" and there are no items. This is where I start having complaints about the game. The first is that there's no time trial, which to me would have extended the longevity of the game and seemed easy enough to implement (though I'll admit I am no programmer and I could be wrong about that). The second complaint is that there is no single race mode, meaning that that if you want t play survivor on a given track you have to first unlock the event on the single player mode and then find it. this one is more perplexing since they could have reused the online play interface for this.Speaking of online play, I actually  bought this game for me and like 5 friends with DLC and everything because basically 90% off. At the time I figured 15 bucks would last me about 5 hours and that would be that. However, you can tell by my time with the game that I ended u enjoying it for a longer time. Buyin multple copies was a god idea though because, truth be told, there's nobody online, besides my friends I only managed to find a full room once during a sale, so ideally you would schedule something in advance with your friends.Knowing this, you can play the game with up to 7 other people on any of the tracks and game modes. the matches I had were a lot of fun but there is a bit of a risk of a runaway leader, meaning that once a person builds a small lead, it can become impossible to recover if other players don't notice this (or if you are just amazing). This is compounded by the fact that mines in this game are very powerful. Having said that, I think the skill ceiling of this game is fairly high and you'll be looking for ways to shave off seconds of your time constantly. as for actual complaints on the MP front, I do have a few. the most important is that you can't easily change game modes or tracks when you host a game. I would have loved to be able to go from power race to speed race and to Deathmatch, but alas, such is life. My next issue is that there are no bots online. This would have made it so that games with two people would be ruined by the runaway leader problem. The DLC adds either new beter planes or new MP modes (DM and TDM) depending in what you buy. the first DLC may feel a little pay to win since the new airplanes are GOOD, but it's very cheap and online is largely dead, so I didn't mind it. The second DLC adds an interesting game mode with new arenas to play it, and while I found it to be fun, I wish they had made more tracks and added time trials too.I final gripe many people had in other reviews was that framerate was locked at 30 fps. I don't mind the game being locked to give everyone a level laying field, since I think that having better hardware is not that different than buying better gear, but if you are playig this for the single player and that bothers you, now you know.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Skydrift, and while I don't expect to play it a whole lot more than I have, I think I easily got my money's worth. I recommend it for the single player alone and also if you have friends that own the game because it's also fun online.			"

												This is like a cross between Crimson Skies and Gas Guzzlers Extreme.  It is fast and has good powerups and maps.  But, the arcade physics make it enjoyable without having to focus too much on the flying controls.  The focus is instead on catching your opponents, shooting them down and making it first through the map.I'm a little disappointed that you have to buy a Multiplayer DLC to get the deathmatch modes, but overall it is a gem of an aerial racing game and worth every penny, especailly if you get it on sale.

												SkyDrift reminds me a lot of Crimson Skies with some Diddy Kong Racing plane racing mixed in.  SkyDrift rewards risky flight paths and gives you bonuses for style.  It's as fun as that sounds.  Controller is HIGHLY recommended for this game.  Keyboard/Mouse just doesn't cut it for flying games.  The game itself is great, but the online community is non-existant.  Buy this game only if you have friends that will play it with you because the single player doesn't last that long, maybe about 3-4 hours, unless you intend to 100% it.A few times I played this game online seemed to have a few problems with the netcode with players not synchronizing properly.  I would appear to finish first by a long shot only to be given third place.  I'm not sure if it was a problem with the player connections or if it's the netcode, but no one plays this game online anymore unfortunately so I have no idea if it was fixed or not.			"

												SkyDrift reminds me strongly of racing games of yore. It rings of everything from Slipstream 5000 to the air combat segments of Jak & Daxter: The Lost Frontier. It delivers tight controls, fast action, beautiful environments and some of the coolest planes I've seen since Crimson Skies. A physics-light combat racing game with plenty of speed, stunts and destruction, SkyDrift would have been right at home on the old home consoles. It should come as no surprise then that I often hear it compared to Plane Crazy, a Playstation game. I've not played it, but if SkyDrift is anything like it, then its of an air racing pedigree and faithful to its roots. A worthy purchase.			"

												SkyDrift is a pretty simple racing game - but it's fun enough. There are some attack items ala Diddy Kong Racing which add to the challenge because the computers use them like it's going out of style. Can't say much for the multiplayer because no one is ever on.			"

												Snagged this during 2015 Summer Sale. Very reasonably priced, plays well on Big Picture, good controller support. Kinda like Mario Kart / Diddy Kong Racing, but with planes. Very easy to get into, and gets harder as stuff progresses, just like how things should be. Do recommend, especially if you find it on sale.			"

												A lot of people can’t stand racing games anymore, although they enjoyed them a whole lot back in the day. And it’s not always their fault. For the most part, racing games have grown stale nowadays, and worst of all, they seem to look all the same! They’re nice looking, no discussion, the graphics are great. But great graphics are not a competent substitute for great gameplay, and most current racing games are proof of that. Now, if you have been looking for some racing game capable of bringing your childhood racing love back, Sky Drift could be a decent solution. Let me describe it as follows, so maybe I can manage to convince. It’s a combat racing game a lot like Mario Kart. You grab power-ups along the way. Some are momentary boosts for your engine, others are devices used to hinder your opponents way. The soundtrack resembles Rock n’ Roll Racing’s style, if that means anything. But, there are no cars in Sky Drift – as the title suggests. It’s an airplane racing game. No cars, just airplanes, which is a refreshing novelty by the way. Well, not exactly a novelty, but you get it. Anyway, this game has been severely overlooked. It’s an outrage, a real shame how the multiplayer is nearly dead for a game that’s so much fun. As always, the game is not perfect. Sky Drift could use a greater number of maps and deeper customization. But nothing a good DLC couldn't solve, had the game received more attention. Nonetheless, the game plays great and feels great. It’s lightning fast and the soundtrack adds a lot to the frenzy. The controls feel quite alright. And, well, the game is quite nice looking too, with wide and beautiful landscapes. When the plane hovers over the water, you can see drops splashing against the screen. Yes, you can fly over the foaming sea. You can fly past canyons and through ice caves. You can touch the tops of pine trees growing on ice cold riverbanks or crash on the tips of stalagmites coming out of hellish lava rivers. Watch out, things are as dangerous as they are beautiful, and you’ll be all the time on a hurry trying to tear your enemies apart with missiles, machineguns and mines, while boosting your shields up and repairing damage you suffered. Indeed, the game is a good challenge. It’s not going to be a walk in the park to master this game. Some races are going to be a real pain on hard difficulty, and you might see yourself retrying dozens of times just to come in 3rd place. Because of that, Sky Drift seems to possess the elements for a great competitive multiplayer. It’s a pity only a few care about it now. So much potential… It would be great if its multiplayer came back to life. The gaming world has been for so long in lack of a fun racing game like this. Now, for whatever reason (maybe bad promotion by the publishers), such a game is not fully appreciated as it deserves.			"

												Aerial Mario Kart. I'm sorry, but that's just f**kin' awesome. Enjoy fragging opponents with a fun (if a little limited) variety of weapons, feel the enviroment whip past your face at ludicrous speeds (note, this game has an excellent sense of speed). perform daring stunts (fly through a narrow gap in a rock on knife's edge! HELL YES).The game is also graphically beutiful, with varied landscapes and an array of pretty colors. you will want to to slow down and take it all in, but you can't. you gotta go fast.Overall an 8.5/10			"

												Another surprisingly fun game I found on Steam I didn't know existed, that while looking for other titles. At first, from the pics, it seemed like a cross between Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge -aesthetic wise- and this great PSX title I loved called N.Gen Racing, all with added weaponry so imagine Gas Guzzlers but with airplanes or just picture the aerial part of of Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed as a full game.Not much depth into the whole package, there a few different events, modes, levels, online play -pretty much dead- but what there is, it's lots of fun. I wish there was more levels tho and maybe some nighttime courses with enviromental hazards thrown in to add to the challenege kinda like Fuel. Game looks and runs great overall. I recommend it for those who are into arcade, kart and combat racing games -there'a DLC that adds an arena type of event so it becomes like Twisted Metal with wings, but it's multiplayer only so...-			"

												I'm not normally a fan of racing games, but SkyDrift is a lot of fun to play. No single racer is overpowered to the point of unfairness including the player. Strategy, including timing your boosts and power-ups, as well as which route to take and when, are all important in coming out on top. I would recomend playing with a control though, as a keyboard is a bit to slow, at least for myself.			"

												Fast paced, fun especially with friends and more than a little arcadey.If you ever played the Xbox version of crimson skies, this is basically the racing stages from that. You need to do tricks and fly low to gain a boost, getting shot down or crashing only loses you a few seconds and there are an abundance of powerups that you can use against other racers (much like MarioKart and Blur)You can get on someone's tail and gun them down, fire a guided missile or shock them with an electric pulse among other things. -This is both fun to use on others and infuriating when used on you, but it only makes me wanna get them back!Really, this is probably a niche game. You have to like flying, like arcade flying, like racing and like awesome looking aircraft. Assuming you like those, this is a fantastic game.It could use a free fly mode perhaps to practice the tracks but other than that, money well spent (especially if you can grab the bundle on sale)			"

												SkyDrift is one of the best racing games I've ever had the change to play. It reminds me of a more fleshed out version of the flying races in Diddy Kong Racing 64. My only real complaint is the lack of race tracks. There is only 5, all of which have can be reversed (to make 10). If there were more tracks this game would have much more play value. I feel the multiplayer is where this game would stride, but with a small community it can be frustrating to find people to play with. Over all this game is definitely worth the $10.			"

												Skydrift is the type of game I have been waiting for for years , whenever playing games with aeroplanes in them , i longed to be actually racing against each other. Dont get me wrong dogfights in games like hawx and the rest are great fun but never captured the core fun of arcadey style racers. So along comes skydrift a arcadey racing title with great plane physics and beautifully varied environments. Think Blur with planes and your half way there , the power ups are nice and varied and the game always gives you a challenge throughout.Where the game does come to life is in its various multiplayer modes. The thrill of chasing down friends (or enemies) is immensly good fun and i highly recommended this game to anyone who likes to have fun when they game.

												It was my childhood dream to play such type of game... Look, the game exists after all (many classic titles can claim this, but none of them had all of the features I wanted).Race your customized airplane against others with full 3D controls & mind their missiles, bombs... and oh, shockwave plus many other weapons are also available for you to use too (like Mashed & Revolt, but this isn't car racing).And yes, map environments are awesome with decent graphics. You'd certainly drool to go there physically.			"

												A more refined approach of the aerial races found in Diddy Kong Racing, coupled with risk-reward boost meter building similar to Burnout's as well as a power-up system akin to that of Blur's. In other words: offering leeway for counter-measures when under attack as there is no randomness, allowing pick-ups to be 'tiered' and being able to 'bank' a power-up for extra boost charge.Overall one of the better current-gen arcadey racing games (with nice graphics) made from the devs who went on to develop Sine Mora and it's a decent enough PC port too. Only real drawback is that it's a little light on content, but it's a good impulse purchase regardless during a sale.(I also hope Sumo Digital looks at this game for a sequel to Sonic Racing: Transformed, to further fine-tune their airplane sections and the way they handle their item drops.)

												I really enjoyed SkyDrift. The best way to describe it is Mario Kart with fighter planes. The single player mode has six tracks (12 if you count reverse mode) and three race types: (1) power (like Mario Kart - race around the track and collect power-ups that allow you to shoot at your competitors); (2) survivor (same as power, but instead of a fixed number of laps the player in last place gets eliminated every 30 seconds or so); and (3) speed (power-ups are replaced by boost rings that increase the speed and difficulty of racing around the course). The game mixes and matches these three play types and the 6/12 tracks with varying levels of AI difficulty to create a single player campaign consisting of about 40 events, and for each event you can choose between about 10 planes with varying specs (some are faster, some are more maneuverable, etc). The tracks are spectacular and the controls and overall gameplay are also great. With respect to single player mode, my only complaints are that there are only 6 tracks and the ""campaign"" is very loosely put together. There's no story, you don't even need to finish first in an event to progress to the next, and by the time you've completed the first 10 or so of the campaign races you've already seen all six tracks.With respect to multiplayer, there doesn't seem to be much of an online community left, but you can play with friends that also have the game.8/10			"

												This is like a cross between Crimson Skies and Gas Guzzlers Extreme.  It is fast and has good powerups and maps.  But, the arcade physics make it enjoyable without having to focus too much on the flying controls.  The focus is instead on catching your opponents, shooting them down and making it first through the map.I'm a little disappointed that you have to buy a Multiplayer DLC to get the deathmatch modes, but overall it is a gem of an aerial racing game and worth every penny, especailly if you get it on sale.

												SkyDrift is a fast-paced aerial racing game that will feel very familiar to anyone who's been to an arcade in the last decade. The gameplay is basic, but the action is quick and twitchy as one might expect.Flying in SkyDrift is quite simplistic, and again arcadey - with basic arrow keys for pitch and roll and 'W' and ""S' for throttle control by default, the game is quick to learn which is good as the courses can feel challenging but still ultimately forgiving.I played through over half of the game, and found at about the half-way point the game becomes repetitive as you will have played through all of the unique tracks by this point. The game proceeds to increase AI difficulty and increase the number of laps in each circuit to artifically extend gameplay. For an arcade game, keeping the player feel refreshed is usually a requirement, and the game fell a bit flat by that point.The visuals are on par with what i'd expect in an arcade again, but I particularly like the level design and the planes a lot. The level design is really well created, with pinch points, branching paths, and a requirement for a lot of twitch flying to avoid obstacles. Each race truly does feel intense purely by navigational standards. As a huge fan of Crimson Skies, I absolutely love the plane design as it entirely reminds me of that game.Overall this is a pretty fun, and quick arcade game - It's about 2 hours or so of gameplay before things will start feeling like a grind, but to get all of the planes unlocked you'll have to muster on.At the time of this review, Multiplayer no longer exists which isn't entirely surprising, but I bet it would have been pretty fun too.

												Let me get this out of the way: This is one great racing game. It has  good sense of speed, the items are a litle generic but work nicely, the AI is surprisingly fair (though on the hardest difficulty it does seem a little less so) and the challenge seems adequate for what it is. I understand the coplaint about there being too few tracks, but the mirror courses are -to me at least- different enough to count as bonafidenew tracks given  the game's price. The tracks and planes look great considering how old the game is and it should playable on almost any computer worth gaming on. Finally, the single player has leaderboards so you could aim to beat other peoples times on a given track.The game's single player mode has three types of events: there's the Power Race, which plays a lot like the plane parts of Diddy Kong racing where you can collect items and even stack them to use them against an opponent, the there's Survivor, where the last player in the race is knocked out after a certain amount of time until only one racer remains. and finally, there's Speed race, where boost rings  are littered across the ""tracks"" and there are no items. This is where I start having complaints about the game. The first is that there's no time trial, which to me would have extended the longevity of the game and seemed easy enough to implement (though I'll admit I am no programmer and I could be wrong about that). The second complaint is that there is no single race mode, meaning that that if you want t play survivor on a given track you have to first unlock the event on the single player mode and then find it. this one is more perplexing since they could have reused the online play interface for this.Speaking of online play, I actually  bought this game for me and like 5 friends with DLC and everything because basically 90% off. At the time I figured 15 bucks would last me about 5 hours and that would be that. However, you can tell by my time with the game that I ended u enjoying it for a longer time. Buyin multple copies was a god idea though because, truth be told, there's nobody online, besides my friends I only managed to find a full room once during a sale, so ideally you would schedule something in advance with your friends.Knowing this, you can play the game with up to 7 other people on any of the tracks and game modes. the matches I had were a lot of fun but there is a bit of a risk of a runaway leader, meaning that once a person builds a small lead, it can become impossible to recover if other players don't notice this (or if you are just amazing). This is compounded by the fact that mines in this game are very powerful. Having said that, I think the skill ceiling of this game is fairly high and you'll be looking for ways to shave off seconds of your time constantly. as for actual complaints on the MP front, I do have a few. the most important is that you can't easily change game modes or tracks when you host a game. I would have loved to be able to go from power race to speed race and to Deathmatch, but alas, such is life. My next issue is that there are no bots online. This would have made it so that games with two people would be ruined by the runaway leader problem. The DLC adds either new beter planes or new MP modes (DM and TDM) depending in what you buy. the first DLC may feel a little pay to win since the new airplanes are GOOD, but it's very cheap and online is largely dead, so I didn't mind it. The second DLC adds an interesting game mode with new arenas to play it, and while I found it to be fun, I wish they had made more tracks and added time trials too.I final gripe many people had in other reviews was that framerate was locked at 30 fps. I don't mind the game being locked to give everyone a level laying field, since I think that having better hardware is not that different than buying better gear, but if you are playig this for the single player and that bothers you, now you know.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Skydrift, and while I don't expect to play it a whole lot more than I have, I think I easily got my money's worth. I recommend it for the single player alone and also if you have friends that own the game because it's also fun online.			"

												It's like Mario Kart, but with planes. Wait, didn't they do this with Diddy Kong Racing? Well, I guess it's Diddy Kong Racing, with only planes, limited content, and clap trap's voice actor. It's graphics are very smooth, and the controls are extremely nice. I hit more walls than I care to count, but it's still a lot of fun. I wish it's community was larger. I think I've played against 2 other people before. The only major downside to this game is, it's limited selection of maps. You can do them forward, or backwards. This feels like one of those arcade games you'd find in a theator with those racing jet-skis', but with planes. I don't think the devs ever expected anyone to actually play this game for as long as I have, so maybe the lack of content is a lack of player base interest? *Slams fist on table,* I demand more maps to race on, and a broader internet community!
