												This game. Oh boy this game. Just don't even bother. Simple as that. Here is why...It is broken. The mouse controls are just down right broken. I could only continue playing this because I have an xbox controller to plug in. Even then this game is barely playable. The physics...who programed these physics, they make no sense. Was no effort put into making this? When you roll down a hill, hit another hill GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, you somehow gain speed and keep going up. This can be level breaking in some levels in which you have to stop or you will fall off. The first chapter has 30 levels and the second chapter has 9. Did they forget how to count? Why the sudden change? I am still trying to finish the game 100% and so I do not know how many levels are in the final third ""Event"" but at this rate it should be around 3. It seems that as the game development progressed the just completely gave up. Speaking of giving up on design, there are a few levels that made me laugh. Some are so badly designed... but 2-8 comes to mind. Which is it devs: slow down the hill OR avoid bolders. You can barely do both. Not to mention that gem at the start of the track makes me laugh. Really a gem under the track? Was there a misclick when level editing? If you slow down to get it (it just randomly gets absorbed up the drivers ♥♥♥ if you are slow enough) or flip over to get it, with your clipping head, you will not make it down the first hill. Which is the first obstacle of the level. Why not shift over that track under the first hill a bit to the right? You can barely land on it. If you slow down to do that you will get hit by the boulders, which are btw REALLY closed together in drop time. Ugh. *Facepalms*The ♥♥♥♥ing gems. Half my playtime is me idling as I rub my temples and breathe in and out slowly, and me redoing levels because the hitbox radius on the vehicle is ♥♥♥♥ing broken.  I have literally passed over collectable gems, they have entered my pixelated body, and then they have quickly shot out of my ♥♥♥ for no apparent reason. This can cause you to redo levels just because a gem decided that this day wasn't its day to be collected.The art. Is it art? I am getting a bit sick of pixelated games on steam. Some are really well done and beautifuly made. Most aren't. And it is starting to get to me. This is 2014 there is no need to pixelate your game to make it seem retro. Specially if you are awful at pixel art. This game looks like mario had too much to drink and then vomited. The devs then took his pixelated puke and used that as art. The colors and contrast are bad. there is no sense of a color palette. Every pixel just blends in together and it is very hard to focus on things. There is no form of siloutte on the player, course, and the background. It looks like a free flash game on Newgrounds that gets maximum 2/5 stars. The UI is pretty funny. When I tell you that a word is greyed out, you would think that means locked or unclickable right? Nope grey words are the main thigns you click on. White words are...I am not even sure. Just info and random words on the side. It took me a while to know what was going on with the UI because there is so much going on in the background that all the pixels just kind of blend together. The MAIN menu is simple but everythign beyond that is laughably bad.Speaking of the main menu, just sit there and watch. The main menu tells you how bad this game is. Watch the drivers. 9/10 don't make it over the fist gap. When they don't even put effort into a simple track in the main menu, you should get an idea of what is to come in the actual levels.Anyway I could honestly go on and on about how awful this game is. And in case you are wondering I am only finishing it and playing it because I enjoy finishing bad games and the achievements are fairly easy. I will say that the amount of customization on the driver IS nice but the pixel art, once again, is so god awful that there is no sense of visual satisfaction when you change your driver and cart gear.The amount of customization and the gem bank mechanic where collectables turn into usable money is pretty good. But everything else sucks. Therefore my final thoughts are: This game is broken, ugly, and not fun. Don't bother.2/10			"

 WARNING:  Swipecart used the ""free code if you vote"" system on greenlight.This game is not correctly set-up for PC, everything is HUGE on the screen, creating your own levels is a chore, and controls are trippy as hell (you have to move your mouse back and forth on the screen to move).I'd give it a 2.5/5, this is not a PC game, I'd recommend it for tablet users. Steam workshop support will not change my mind, it already has the worst editor ever.			"

												Did the first 5 tracks and got 1-0% top scores on all of them so the controls seem to be alright... yeah they are finnicky and imprecise in some ways but they work for me fine at least. Got the game for free so I'm satisfied so far. Give it a go if you can get it cheap or for nothing.EDIT: This game is insane... in both a good and bad way. It's a love or hate it kind of thing and I got to agree with some of the reviews that this type of gameplay is better suited for a touch enabled mobile device but still, for cheap, it can hit that gaming itch on the pc as well.I for one am glad it's on steam.

												First - Ignore the ""Shouldn't be on steam"" hate, steam is a shop - get over it. A games quality shouldn't be a factor on whether it should be available on a store or not. Ignoring that BS... here's the truth;The game itself doesn't really have enough depth or skill factor for me to really enjoy it. I can deal with the shoddy graphics, and horrid pixelisation, but the gameplay just isn't there for me. You basically roll a cart down a hill, and apply the brakes when needed. Not very complex, but not very fun either. Sure, the later levels have an element of balancing, wheelies and maybe even a ""be the right speed at the right time"" element to it. But still... nothing really grabbed me and made me enjoy it. I think its main flaw, is that I was half expecting the camera to zoom out and see the whole track so I can plan a bit more - you're given a preview - but being able to see more than a few meters in front of you would be a much better option.  Basically there are games like LineRider that are similar and, at least to me, are a lot more fun.But a gigantic flaw the game has, is it being unoptimised as hell. Yes, this seems to be a mobile game made for PC (which I have no problem what-so-ever with normally). Kudos for attempting to add controller support, but it's all over the place - menu's are confusing, and don't seem to improve on either mouse/keyboard or joypad. Perhaps customisable option in game would soften the blow a little, but half the time its hard to see what you're supposed to be clicking on, and the other half its awkward ""swipe"" controls. Fullscreen mode seems to match the height of your screen instead of the width, meaning it cuts off the left and right of the screen if you're not on a decent widescreen ratio (Sure, playing in a window prevents some of this, but I prefer fullscreen with black borders if necessary). All in all, its one of the few games where it's been really easy to say that I wouldn't recommend it. Unless the game is given a big overhall via updates, then I think my opinion will stay that way. I wish the devs the best of luck, none the less.			"

You know how when you buy a bad game and overrall you are disappointed, but there is still atleast one redeemable quality about the game? Yeah well, this game doesn't have any.Pros+Trading Cards Just take them and go.Cons-Mouse controls are awkward As suggested by the title of the game, you have to swipe in this game... With a mouse. Sounds like an alright idea for a mobile game.... I'm not going to go any further about the controls are terrible.-Graphics Trust me, pixelated graphics can be done well, but this is just plain disgusting. The character's little pixelated head is rage-inducing and the background looks like someone had sharted and pixelated their excreted substance.-It's just not fun. It just plainly isn't. After 1.1 hrs of searching for some form of entertainment I could not find anything.Overrall:A cancerous game that is not worth your time. I got it for free but I still have strong opinions that this game is as bad as a diseased fish. Not diseased in a metaphorical way but diseased as in, this game actually went and swum into an underwater druggie hangout and took one of the needles and injected it into himself, giving him hepatitus C (or hepatitus Sea for that matter). C is also a better rating than what I will give this game because it is most certainly elementary.2/10			"

												So in general this game is a solid concept. However, there are a few issues with this game.1. There are levels that are very difficult to beat, with a mouse.2. The game is a swipe game that uses the mouse as a controller input.3. As a result of 2, we end up with the problems associated with 1, leading to a very difficult game as it is difficult to accurately control the speed of the cart.Devs, take note this is NOT how you port a game from a touch screen to the PC platform.

												The game’s pretty original and fun, and exactly what most people look for in a mobile game. But, it’s not particularly well optimized for PC, nor does the gameplay translate well.

												This just barely gets a recommendation -- and only if you have a controller to play it with. The game is in my opinion unplayable with mouse controls. If you do not have a controller - skip it.Swipecart is not an action game - it is a physics puzzle game. You control a minecart which you give speed at the start, then strategically slow down on the actual tracks in order to not fall to your death.Each level can be played either for maximum speed, or getting all gems, and these two are tracked separately.Play this windowed as it does not look good in fullscreen on a large monitor. But if you can get past these problems, you're left with a decent game to waste a few idle minutes with, and the presence of online leaderboards keeps you primed to try and do better.			"

												Swipecart a game that came from phones, that should have stayed on phones, because most people don't have a touchscreen (TS for short) option on their monitors.Graphics - Mediocre, not pleasent on the eyes if you are playing for a long period of time. 2/10Music - The only good part about this game, especialy if you have a bass system. Still not worth getting the game only for its music. 4/10Cinematics and Story - NoneContent - A few levels and a level editor, yay (still not worth it) 3/10Controls - Only if you have a TS monitor, and yes I know the game can be beaten without a TS monitor, but be my guest, It is really hard the normal way, bonus note I am a bad player (take whatever you want from that). 0/10Gameplay - Stiff and downright bad. 2/10Do yourself good and don't even think about getting this game, it is not worth it, Be right back, going to check it out on the phone.....yea don't buy it even there, just forget this game even existed.

												I would if I could...totally recommend this game, however it can give me serious rages on some maps. The main reason for this review is to establish that anyone who has a short temper should NOT play this game unless they don't play it on a PC. It has really awful control of the breaks and wheelies...it makes some maps impossible to get with gold medal and perfect gems even though you played it right (unless you do it like 30-50 times until you get it perfect).So...as a conclusion, when they'll update the controls (which after all...are one of the bases for a game), I would totally recommend the game for thrill seekers and stubborn people who like challenges.

 Thank God for Steam Trading CardsThis game has thankfully allowed me to make a profit through the steam trading cards. Other than that, there is no other redeemable quality to this game.

												Basically what you do in this game is you move the mouse cursor back and forth to gain momentum before you cross the start line. As soon as you cross the start line you can no longer increase your speed, you can only break. The objective is to come to a full stop at the finish line.This game was made for smartphone and then ported to PC, so graphics quality is bad. Perhaps this game is fun on a smartphone, I wouldn't know. What I do know is that it's no fun at all on PC. It's boring.			"

												YOU CANNOT GET ALL ACHIEVEMENTS IN THIS GAME LEGITIMATELY. Level 2-8 is impossible to 100% because of a crystal right after the acceleration area that you cannot pick up because it's in the ground. Unless you approach it really slowly (1.5mph) roll over forward just after leaving the start area so that your face picks it up, and then you slowly slide forward if you rolled just far enough onto sloped ramp. But then snowballs will kill you. There's also a bug - if you pause the game, snowballs and boulders will keep spawning. Unpause after a long while and suddenly boulders will be everywhere. You can use this to get pushed forward if you rolled over and got stuck before the slope starts. But.. you'll still die, getting pushed off the cliff by snowballs. Also, Level 3-10 has improperly configured cannons.As far as gameplay goes, it's tedious and repetitive. Only 30 players ever made it to the last level. No doubt because everyone quits after the first few levels. The levels quickly get stupidly hard. Blood, sweat, tears and nerves of steel.. That's what it takes to finish all levels 100%.This game wasn't made for PC.. Porting it to PC, the developer should at least enable the use of larger resolution - so that you see more playfield, instead of scaling pixels. Improperly scaling, at that. I thought it'd be easy achievements, but.. forget about it. 20 hours of my life wasted.			"

Swipecart is a straight mobile-to-PC port. I'm immediately met with spelling errors upon launching the game. All menu text mentions swiping and the controls do not translate well to the mouse, where you must drag back and forth across the screen to build momentum. It's not a reliable or accurate way to play, I'd rather use the directional keys to accelerate (right > left > right > left, etc.) and down to brake. There is so much greyed out text in the menu that makes it difficult to navigate. The entire game itself uses too much grey that the graphics become muddled together and messy. A little bit of effort to optimise the controls, the visuals, and additional audio/video settings for PC would have gone a long way.			"

												Swipecart is loaded with charm and the designer obviously has a wicked sense of humour which absolutely shines through here.

												It's not exactly horrible, but there are some issues with it. It's fun and has a great retro feel for those who want some '80s/'90s gaming experience. The issues is that the controls for the mouse is clunky and awkward, which would irritate a lot of people. I have not used a controller to try and play so if you want a review that covers that, someone else may be able to provide. Overall I give the game a 2.5/5 stars for some pretty good music, retro graphics, and a multitude of in-game upgrades for the driver. If you decide to get the game, make sure you're willing to put up with clunky controls on an otherwise decent game.			"

Swipecart is a mobile game that should have stayed mobile.  As far as I know, the idea's original, and the execution's not bad, but this direct port makes it painfully obvious that the game was designed for a touchscreen device.  Not only do the controls feel awkward with a mouse, I found that scrolling in level selection is outright broken, making it so only the first few levels can be selected.  Having gotten it for free, I don't regret giving it a try, but I wouldn't want to continue with it even if I could, and I can't recommend it (as a PC game).			"

												Just buy Snuggle Truck instead.This isn't necessarily a ""bad"" game, but it's not worth the asking price.  It's a simplistic, both in controls, graphics, and physics, racing game which will likely frustrate you early on either getting stuck on the scenery or racing to your doom off the track.  While some would say this ""challenges"" the player, more often than not it actually just seems like misplacement of world objects -- resulting in a too close overhead that will immediately deaden forward momentum or an unavoidable seesaw that will lower to bar progress.  I'm sure that if playing this on a phone people would continue to play just to beat the frustrating levels once, but I can't see myself doing it on the PC.  It seems like it needs a fair bit more polish.Although the level editor seems clunky, perhaps user-devised levels once Steam Workshop is in place will elevate the game?			"

												First of all, this game is a phone port, or something with a touch screen. It's an indie game, don't expect an over the top product.Anyway, there's quite a few pros and cons with this game, and I actually found it to be a fun little time waster. It isn't a game I would buy at full price, but if you can get it with a discount it's worth the moneyIn total, I'd give about a 6/10 as far as indie games go. Pros: Steam cards (If you grab it in a sale, you make money, everyone loves money)The cards are worth more than I expectedLeaderboard, to try to beat the scores of other playersA level creator, which I always find to be a neat featureThe physics actually work, I've seen those go straight to hell in other gamesThe game is actually enjoyable, if you've got a taste for these type of thingsIt's actually NOT a horrible port, the controls work once you understand them, and if you don't want to use your mouse? BAM we have full controller support, which does complement the game much better than the mouse. (Except the controls went a little haywire but I'll get to that in a moment.)The game increases in difficulty really quickly, this can be a pro or a con depending on what you like in a game, if you're seeking a nice, relaxing physics racer where you don't have to think much, this isn't for you.Cons:The mouse can stop working entirely in the menu, and there's nothing you can do but spam click and hope it works.The game can be a little confusing at times, but that comes with the territory.(This is nitpicking and didn't lose any points in my book) But at times it'll tell you to tap the screen, instead of use the mouse, which I'm sure is left over from the mobile version.English is the only supported language, which makes it difficult for players who speak other languages. (But a lot of games are like that, so again I'm nitpicking)All in all, the pros outweigh the cons in my eyes, making this game not nearly as horrible as people say. If you're up for a physics racer with a high difficulty, this is the game for you.			"

It looks nice at high resolutions, and even has controller support.The gameplay is really simple so you can jump right in and get racing.  The game also lends itself very well to playing in short sessions; you can load up a track or two, then get back to work.If you have a mobile device, it's probably a little better designed for that, but it's definitely playable on PC.

												This game is actually much better than you'd expect. It's essentially a 2D physics game that gives you one opportunity to accelerate, after which you can only break. Using these options you must navigate some rather bizarre track situations while stopping at the end without falling off the track at any point.The only problem with it is that it suffers from the fact that it's obviously a ""port"" (or perhaps just build) of a game designed for mobile touch screen platforms. I feel like it could really use some sort of adaptation for playing it with the mouse (or other non-touchscreen controls).Note: I got this in a game bundle. I'm not sure I'd pay more than $1 for it, even though I'd say it's pretty good for what it is.			"

												As an avid Gamer, I enjoyed the thrills and non-stop frustration brought on by the customize-able cart in Swipecart!Throughout each level I found myself mashing the restart, letting all hope go that my little lady would make it, and not indeed plummet to her untimely death.Seeing the passion put into this game, the fun comes through naturally. There is a full shop of unlock-able items to truly give your rider a personalized feel!My favorite is the very familiar flower-power van! ;) Paired with a sweet flower helmet of course!Overall I have to admit Swipecart will keep me coming back, if not for the vast obstacle range through all three worlds, then it will be just to check in on the shop restock!

There is also garage where you can buy cosmetics like shiny wheels or helmet of different color. And a carrier mode with exciting tournaments and golden cups.	Overall, terrible port of terrible android game.	Oh and yeah, there is a level editor!

												Casual fun game to play from time to time, controls are good, sound is simple but good, no technical problems.The problem is, this is a mobile game with a price that can get you two games that are better. I have nothing agaist this game but I'd rather play it on mobile for a 1$ than 5$ on PC.Still recommend it on a sale.			"

												Fun game, addictive and cute pixel art. If you actually spend the time to play more than a few levels it's surprisingly well done and thought out, and there is a ton to collect and the levels get very challenging. For the low price I would give it a try.			"

												Are You Guys Kidding!  ""Hey this guy was nice enough to give me a free key for his game but now im going to bash on it""....These reviewers are dumb...0.1 hours on record 0.2 wow you sure gave that a shot huh.  I really like this game....yeah the graphics are pixels and at first i was like ahhh another failed pixel attempt at a game but then i played it and the unique gameplay is just awesome,you can also synch this with your mobile device..a great feature. I have spent hours on the editor(still in the work btw and steamworks coming soon) and then can upload and synch them with my mobile platform and play anywhere. So all you negative reviewers(especially the ones that got the game for free) please go back to playing your shiny titles and leave the real games to real gamers thx!			"

												First off, this game is very repetitive and a very obvious mobile port. The controls are pretty awful if I'm being honest. In order to gain speed, you have to slide your mouse back and forth over your minecart, which is very awkward and difficult to do consistently. This may work better with a finger on a touch screen, but not with a mouse.Secondly, the game's menus are confusing. I spent several minutes trying to find out how to get back to the level select. You can't just click on the name of the world that you want to visit; instead, there's this hidden button under the title that looks like it is part of stats. It says something like ""stages cleared: 4/30"", and you can only click on the word ""stages.""This game may have some redemption from the ability to design your own levels, but I did not have the patience or drive to even bother. Maybe buy this for your iPhone or Android, but don't bother with it on Steam.			"

												Swipecart Review - Raymond KTSummary: Swipecart is a physics powered mine cart racing game that rewards patience and skill. It combines vehicle physics with clever and challenging level design. Compete for the fastest times on each track and earn money to customize your avatar.WARNING: Swipecart used the ""free code if you vote"" system on greenlight.This game is not correctly set-up for PC, everything is HUGE on the screen, creating your own levels is a chore, and controls are trippy as hell (you have to move your mouse back and forth on the screen to move). I'd give it a 2.5/5, this is not a PC game, I'd recommend it for tablet users. Steam workshop support will not change my mind, it already has the worst editor ever.  The game itself doesn't really have enough depth or skill factor for me to really enjoy it. I can deal with the shoddy graphics, and horrid pixelisation, but the gameplay just isn't there for me. You basically roll a cart down a hill, and apply the brakes when needed. Not very complex, but not very fun either. Sure, the later levels have an element of balancing, wheelies and maybe even a ""be the right speed at the right time"" element to it. But still... nothing really grabbed me and made me enjoy it. I think its main flaw, is that I was half expecting the camera to zoom out and see the whole track so I can plan a bit more - you're given a preview - but being able to see more than a few meters in front of you would be a much better option. Basically there are games like LineRider that are similar and, at least to me, are a lot more fun. "

												I'm sorry. I really can't see what's good about this game on a pc. Maybe simple on an android, but the resposive time on the cart as well as some of the tracks make this a pretty bad game. I would not spend more than $0 on this game. This is fairly bad quality in both content, graphics, and mechanics even if it were a simple flash game online. Sure it's a neat idea and entertaining, but not for very long. It's not worth the frustration to complete the levels much less the achievements.			"

												A bad game with an even worse port from a mobile version. I played it on XBox pc gamepad cause keyboard/mouse is unplayable. Bad physics, horrible control system, bad navigation in menus, pixels that hurt, twitchy rails and lousy concept. So you accelerate for a small portion of a track and then spend the rest of time braking, doing wheelies and using other boosts - but you either need to try to get the gold medal (speed) or gem (for collecting all the gems). And all of that just to buy/get vanity stuff - helms, carts and wheels. Wow. so.much.nothingI played for 45 mins only cause that is the time that was needed to get my 3 cards, tnx for that.			"

												And this, everyone, is the reason you don't install the games you get for free. I'm not even sure where to begin. Other than of course don't ever part ways with your money for this. Don't even play it if you do get it for free. If you get it for free, don't even gift it to anyone. Don't be that much of a ♥♥♥♥. Just lose this game somewhere. If we pretend it doesn't exist we can surely defeat it.£1.99? I'd rather stick one pound coin, three 20 pence coins, two 5 pence pieces, a 10p and twenty nine 1p coins up my wonderhole.And those ""good"" reviews down there, you see 'em? Yeah.

												I actually enjoyed this game. There isn't a whole lot to it but to me it felt like a really simple Grand Tourismo or Forza Motorsports game. Having the same basic features like completing time trials unlocking items and vehicles, and 1 or 2 other basic concepts...Like I said there isn't a whole lot too this. However the levels are challenging. The soundtrack is pretty good for being 8-bit (seriously bravo on the music). You try to do the tracks in the best time and you can compare your time with other players online (probably one of the best things about this game). Also the game offers Steam trading cards and how can you be upset with picking up a few trading cards? All in all I'd give this game a 7.5 out of 10. Ok I gtg... Writing this review is making me want to play it again.			"

												Been going through games in my library and playing all of them. I almost got to the end of this game until I got to the levels that were in hell, and it's a good location for them because they are hell to play. This has easily been the most frustrating game I have ever played. The controls are awful. It's called swipecart, everything requires you to swipe. Thats great for a touchscreen but not a mouse, especially when two abilities use pretty much the same swipe direction. There's also no need for skill in this game. You pretty much swipe at the beginning of the level and then pray that you're gonna end up in the right place. 2/10 - one of the worst games I have played.			"
