												Eh, I did find this game okay, so I would recommend this to others to just give it a shot. :)Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is just a casual, 2D puzzle game that really reminds me of one of the toys that have similar functionality I used to have. This game contains 100 levels that may seem easy at first, but some of them can be difficult, providing you rather quite a challenge. The way you play is that you move your mouse to the left or right to rotate the screen for the marble to move in order to get from point A to point B.But it's not something as simple as getting from point A to point B, you also have to maneuver through obstacles that comes your way. You would have to avoid hitting spikes that exists in some levels and falling down too far to the point the marble shatters. The levels shouldn't be too difficult, but if you don't succeed, try try again! The graphics and the game interface aren't really the best, but not like it really matters. Oh and there's trading cards too if you want to craft more badges.Should you buy this game? If you're just looking for a casual game, like 2D puzzles, or just wanting to make more badges from trading cards, then yes. Just give it a shot anyways! :)6/10 "

												The concepts for a solid game are all here, but this is very cheaply made, unpolished, and poorly balanced.Controls and physics are extremely sensitive, leading to you spending most of the game overcorrecting the ball's movement. I had to adjust the mouse sensitivity on a per-level basis. The mouse cursor leaves the game boundary when trying to whip the camera around too quickly. It's easy to accidentally click the mouse and restart the level. Everything has really basic textures, simplistic music, and stock sound effects. The game minimizes when you click away from it, which is  pain when trying to stream it.This game is playable in the most technical sense of the word. It could've been a fun experience with more time and attention. You might enjoy it if you're looking to beat an obnoxiously challenging game out of spite. If so, good luck!			"

												Marble Mayhem Fragile Ball on PC 7.5/10Review after 5 hrs and 37 / 100 mazes completed.A little ball rolling around in 2D maze trying to get out by the door in the corner. And yet Marble Mayhem is so much more: Wild mazes with moving plates, gaps, skateboard ramps, spikes, water, and did I mention extreme angles? Sometimes this feels more like soccer. If the ball gets hit too hard - it shatters - start again…. Addictive.Mechanics:Moving your mouse rotates the maze and gravity moves the ball; the controls are tight and the physics are spot on. Mouse rotational sensitivity is adjustable. Patience with trial and error always pay off in games requiring the mastery of physics…. I did not rage quit a single time !Graphics are basic and audio is simple; both need polish.Full price on Steam seems rather extreme, but if you find it on sale you may be pleasantly surprised by this digital version of a childhood classic XDOct 2015			"

												Marble Mayhem Fragile Ball is a simple and intriguing 2d puzzle board game that reminds me of the original toys I used to play as a kid.Here is a link for anyone who is curious to what I'm talking about:  Marble Board Game [i.imgur.com]Pro-tip: if you have a mouse with DPI settings [en.wikipedia.org] then you will be able to fine tune the rate at which you tilt the game board, however depending on the level there is a hard limit to how much you can tilt the board one way or the other.The controls are fairly basic and simple:Moving your mouse left/right will tilt the game board level left or right and make the marble roll a certain direction.Clicking LMB will cause your marble to respawn.Scroll wheel will zoom in/out.Also another thing that took me a while to learn was how there are different types of marbles such as glass and rubber ones.If your marble falls more than a certain distance it may shatter when it lands (I believe this also depends on the type of marble and object it lands on such as brick/wood).At the moment I'm currently “stuck” on level 16 although from my experience so far I rate it a ★★★★ out of ★★★★★ for what it sets out to do, which is to be a simple – easy to pick up and learn marble game.

If you are not into trying over and over again until you become perfect with you movements, you will not succeed in winning a level. However, finishing a level will give the player that rare feeling of accomplishment, of having achieved victory after a long and hard fight!			"

												'Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball' is a nice little physics puzzle game. I recommend it if you like the genre. It won't entertain you for many hours but you can hardly expect that for this price. When the game's on sale it only costs a quarter, so you can count on at least getting your money's worth of fun, and maybe even a bit more than that. The mechanicsThe game is about getting a ball to a target but you don't control the ball directly. Instead, you turn the screen by moving your mouse left and right, which causes the ball to move. This ball, however, is fragile and breaks easily. So you'll have to avoid things like dropping the ball from great heights, dropping it on top of spikes or even touching spikes, leaving it underneath logs that come pounding down, and so on. In some levels, you can rotate the screen completely (360°) but in certain levels you can only rotate the screen e.g. 90°. This angle is clearly shown in the top right corner of the screen.Progressing in the gameWhen you finish a level, more than one of the next levels opens up. Say you just finished level 7. Coming back to the level selection screen, you may see levels 8, 9 and 10 opening up. What this means is that if you're stuck on one of the levels, the game doesn't have to end there for you but you can try one of the other levels and advance through that one instead. And you will find easier levels further on, even in the highest level numbers of this game. That's a bit strange but it doesn't have to be a negative thing. It means you'll be able to explore and try out all the levels of the game, even if you decide to just tackle the easier ones. If you prefer challenging levels, you'll find those, too. All the way up to what I would call 'masochistic difficulty'. Unless I'm missing something, I count a total of 83 levels. Music and graphicsThe music was ok. It fits the game rather nicely. And it's varied enough so it doesn't get on your nerves. If you're easily annoyed with basic background tunes, you can turn down the volume of the music and/or sound effects through the game's menu, or even switch them off completely. The graphics are basic but polished enough for a puzzle game. Check the screenshots to give you an idea. You can adjust the resolution and toggle fullscreen, AA and V-Sync on or off.Steam extras'Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 for running the game.The game does not have Steam Achievements, which is too bad. A game like this could really use them. There are so many games -especially puzzle games- to be played these days, so most people will just finish the levels they can finish and then move on. Achievements would have added some extra motivation to finish more levels.			"

												5.1/10 - Dated; Screen Tilting PuzzlerThis basic puzzler uses the mouse to tilt the screen so you can navigate a ball in places that normally would be impossible. To make things more difficult your poor ball is made of glass or something extremely fragile, so only the correct path will allow you to succeed. This game has a good mix of mazes, puzzles and platform-like obstacles. The graphics are pretty dated and the levels get repetitive so this does detract from the games overall experience. That being said; I did enjoy this title for an hour or so. This isn’t something I will put serious time into since there are much better puzzlers out there. It's worth $1-2 or so;  if you like older puzzlers this may be for you!. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												Although the game only cost me a few pence, I'm afraid I must advise you do not buy this game.The physics are not good at all. Due to some sloppy programming, the ball will shatter even if it has not been moving fast, even if the table is perfectly still.Glitches are everywhere.The music and sound effects are not good. I ended up turning them off and listening to something else.No level editor. We need something like this if it is going to survive in the market.Levels can be either too difficult or too easy, even for the first few levels.And with unreliable physics, the game becomes extremely difficult to control.The only good thing I can say about it, is that it can drop Trading Cards. So at least you'll get some of your money back.Please fix this game. The potential is big, but the performance is lacking.			"

												I am a huge fan of games like the original two Super Monkey Ball titles, so I was really looking forward to a challenge here; What I got instead was purposely annoying and frustrating level structures with surprisingly limited play controls. Every level I found that had an arrow pointing in a direction was leading to death and all levels where it is impossible to die in are obtuse in boring ways. Hell, one level I played was just a bunch of lines seemingly thrown wherever and they called it a maze.It does have some interesting ideas though. Certain levels limit to how much you can tilt the screen while others let you turn it around in a complete circle. The music gets annoying quick but it and the overal visual design has a certain appeal to it that I have not really seen in any games in this past decade.I purchased the game with the anticipation of it being a low budget, but charming throwback to early 90s desktop games. It kind of is, but the immediate bizarre difficulty spikes and awkward design just really suck out all of the enjoyment I had before long. You get what you pay for.			"

												EDIT: I beat Hard Mode. Minor changes in the review for the points for hard mode.Lets start off with the positives.It's an interesting gimmick, and he designed most levels around that pretty well.It's a pretty difficult platformer, and has a wide variety levels, and even a difficulty select, for the masochists and the causals.....I think those are the only good things you can say about this game.Negatives. Where to begin?The level design and choice of gimmicks is terrible. (I know I just complimented the level design. That was only refering to the design and combination of some gimmicks. The level design is not designed for Hard Mode AT ALL, and that itself shows how little effort was put into Hard Mode.) Every level that has 360° rotation on it you can find a way to cheese by abusing the game's physics to no end.The difficulty balance is atrocious. There can be free and easy levels all the way in the 80s, and compared to Level 83 and 84? Those easy levels should belong back in the 20s and 30s.The rotation gimmick is poorly done. It just doesn't work with the physics engine.Oh, the physics engine is sickening, combined with the rotation, you're going to get a headache from playing this game.The physics engine allows you to clip through platforms by going a specific speed. How did nobody find this bug?There's no indicator of where the level end is on some levels. So you basically have to just roll around forever and if possible, abuse the physics engine to find it.Hard Mode is just speeding up the game to no end.Hard Mode took me 3 times longer to beat than the normal mode. Hard Mode unlocks nothing new in the game, in spite of the store page saying it has ""100"" levels, it still only has 85.Hard Mode is not a challenge of skill. It's a challenge of patience and luck.Overall I would definitely not recommend this game to anybody.			"

												Despite the thumbs-down, this is definitely a game a minority of people will enjoy (and I'm still trying to finish some of the final stages), but let me explain.If this title were cut down into about half, maybe two-thirds of the 100* stages, and they cherry-picked only the best, you would have an incredibly solid little puzzle game. The issue comes in that there are sets of levels I would refer to as ""poorly designed"".They're trial and error machines with no hints or ability to solve them short of flinging yourself to death on the course repeatedly. Examples would be multiple which start you at a high point, then give you a left or right direction to fall in. For one thing, the game's title is spot-on: your ball is fragile and tapping ANYTHING over a certain velocity will kill you**, so if you pick the wrong path: bam, dead. Alright, but then what happens when a level is nothing but left/right paths where you have to memorize which is correct and which isn't? Or a single left/right fall but one side has a cushion at the bottom to catch you (which you need to aim for precisely, those ain't big) and the other doesn't. And you have to blind-aim your momentum to land on something that's way off screen.I hope you're beginning to get my point here.But at the other end of the scale, there are stages which create some really fun challenges, where you have a full 360-degree playfield and you're working your momentum in platforming you don't see in anything else, managing momentum and angle of rotation and trying to find the exit before you can even maneuver down to it. When the game gives you the freedom in a stage to approach it however you like, it really takes off for a few minutes at a time.Also, I feel this needs to be stated: this game is ugly as sin, consisting of nothing but stock textures used over and over in eye-searing ways. I think there are under 10 textures in the entire game, and sometimes they will be backgrounds, sometimes foregrounds, and usually in clashing, jarring fashion.* I presume there are 100 levels. Where I'm currently at, around 15 tiles on a 100-tile board refuse to open up, whether I clear things adjacent to them or not.** Except in ""Super Ball"" stages. These are poorly designed for other reasons, because you're invincible to physics damage in them, but basically controlling rubber and a lot of them involve precision-landings above hazard fields and slowing your momentum. It's not fun at all.			"

												Essentially, this game is like bagatelle (a forerunner of pinball). In Fragile Ball you tilt the screen to affect the trajectory of a marble. It sounds simple enough, but this is no ordinary marble... Oh no !... this is a marble that smashes into tiny pieces when it hits anything too hard. Believe me when I say, no game will ever test your patience like Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball.			"

The developer kindly provided a key for review purposes.This has all been done before, in many better ways. You use your mouse to rotate the screen and help a fragile marbile get to the goal. If you fall too far, or touch spikes, etc., you restart the level. The core mechanic is just too simple to merit a full blown game, and everything else about it screams that it was made with stock assets in a game maker program of sorts.Cons: (sadly there are no 'Pros')-Music is utterly generic-Options in general are lacking. I made it full screen and it was so stretched out.-Graphics are poor-Its not really that fun - you can get many, many free mobile games where you rotate the screen/device to get something in a goalNot even worth looking at the trailer.

												Pretty nice game, no idea why people downvoting it only because its look clunky or not well-polished. As a huge fan of 'marble' games where you need to logically move ball from point A to point B and 'labyrinth' games, in which you need to rotate field to bring ball to a final point, while avoiding obstracles, I found 'Marble Mayhem' perfect amusement for a really small price. This game consist of a few modes - common runners, labyrints, physics-based levels, levels which requires good timing for each action and vertical drop-style stages, in which you need to drop rubber ball into small basket without missing or hitting spikes.For a 1€ game everything (gameplay, graphics, music) done quite well, I already finished around 2\3 of the game and totally not regret about time wasted on 'MM:FB'Thats why I recommend not to listen to a useless reviews of people who expected AAA gameplay and graphics from a 1€ game, from people who bought game only for a cards thus never playing it, and of cause, from angry kids who cant handle any other genre than a casual FPS.

												This is the most frustrating game I've ever played! Don't buy this when you easily get angry or you'll need a new mouse or keyboard pretty fast.Skills? Useless! Most Levels just need luck.The ball is fragile like an egg. Sometimes you survive big jumps or falls and the next time you make barely half of it. To control the marble you need to do tiny, little movements. But that‘s almost impossible, because the mouse sensitivity is horrible. Sometimes you barely touch your mouse and make big moves. At other times you rotate the entire mouse and almost nothing happens.Once the ball rolls, it’s almost impossible to stop it. Your playing field is at 2° and the ball becomes fast as a rocket. Next time you have it at 30° and he still rolls uphill.Buy the game while on sale (I got it for 0,14€), get the 3 free Trading cards and delete it.			"

Review - Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball""I never thought that moving a ball into a goal is so frustratingly hard but very rewarding.""Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is a simple minigame where you move the ball into the goal by rotating the screen using mouse movements. As the title says, the ball is very fragile. Falling from a certain height can lead to your utter destruction. The physics of the game is very good. The puzzles are well-designed. There maybe times that the challenges are very easy but there will also be moments that you'll get frustrated on how hard the puzzle is. The graphics are okay but don't judge this game by the way it looks. The gameplay is simple yet challenging. A combination of speed manipulation, timing, patience and focus is needed depending on the given puzzle.If you like difficult and challenging games then this is the game for you. I recommend it that you buy it during a sale because this game is just a casual minigame for me and minigames, in my opinion, should not cost too much.Personal Rating:Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 5/10Music: 5/10Story/Plot: n/aOverall: 5/10			"

												I'm always keen to try out a new marble madness-esque game. Fragile Ball is basic 2D 'marble' game of skill, with one simple goal of using gravity to get your ball to the exit, while avoiding the inevitable traps. Certainly sounds simple, but in practice its one hell of a challenge!Hard is perhaps an understatement. Level design plays a big role in this, with plenty of hazards to avoid, placed in just the right spots to have you pulling out your hair. Some level design reminded me of the old classic, Crazy Machines, where one small incorrect move and it all falls apart in milliseconds, followed by a swift restart while you mumble to yourself that you can do better. There are also other levels though that are more open/scrolling, but regardless of the level type the restarts will be many! It can be brutal .. I found myself swearing & groaning at my screen on more than one occasion. I do enjoy a challenge though; something that takes practice.With the high level of difficulty, I find this game is best suited to short sessions. 5-10mins over a coffee in the morning is good to wake the brain up. If I get stuck for too long, I stop to prevent the frustration building. Along with more 'standard' levels previously mentioned, there are also some maze levels to challenge you. These are generally bigger levels allowing a larger degree rotation. Standard levels generally limit the range of angle you can choose giving more of a fixed direction - but this does vary quite a bit. Graphics are rather bland, along with animations and menus, but they do the job.Although I do like the game overall, there are a few things that bugged me that I think could be improved upon. The mouse sensitivity has a limited range on the slider. With my Logitech mouse & slider all the way down, the movement still was too sensitive for my liking. This restricted the precision over the ball, but on reflection I can't be 100% sure if its just the mouse sensitivity or harsh physics in the game design.Also found the maze levels when run in full screen made me feel nauseous. The spinning speed (and almost constant spinning sometimes), particularly when view full screen gave me some motion sickness. In a smaller screen (you can play in windowed mode) it was ok for me. Something to warn people about if they are sensitive to such things. Most levels were ok, but a few were tough to deal with.Running in window mode was a bit problematic as well, as the mouse didn't lock to the game screen. I would move my mouse too far & it would flick back to windows, killing control over the ball. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone (some will just find it infuriating!). It's not the best example I have seen in the genre with some flaws, but you are a gamer with patience & persistence, who likes a hardcore challenge then this is a good value puzzler to add to your collection.Disclosure: Copy of this game was provide for review purposes.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												Do you want to be tested mentally and emotionally? then this is a game for you, in the form of a quick fix at a very attractive and fitting price. I'm currently half way through having completed 50 levels, and it is what it is in the moment - so not very memorable. The short marble traveling maps will ask for a little of your brain power while simultaneously testing and probably pushing your frustration and rage meter into overload as you hear the sound of an exploding ball ringing in your ears. Luck often brings an end to a level if not some extremely careful mouse control, and there is a feel of wanting more reward for your efforts of completion. There are short won moments of elation until you suddenly fill with dread at the thought of the next marble madness challenge. Recommended to play a short amount of levels in one session else you might lose the enjoyment of it.			"

If you hit the exit you first have to lay still, this is really hard too do with the bouncing ball on a 1 centimeter floor.5. There is a hard mode that is more like a impossible mode because you can't even fall a little bit or your ball is broken.6. You can't buy that ice cream that is more worth it.7.

Many levels you can cheese through it by abusing the phisics, others you are required to use the same mechanics that you shouldn't in other level, but with extremely accuracy and luck. It's just not good for your health.Most of the obstacles you can't predict where to go, like fire and water, you just have to try over and over until you get lucky.And the level design just show you that you can't trust anything, see an arrow? DON'T follow it, never. You have to pass through this corridor at lightining speed? how about some spikes at the end so you need to break precisely.Way to go punishing you for playing the level for the first time, and when i finish a hard level, its not rewarding, i just feel that i traded one burden for another even worse.

												The game is not terrible, but it is not great.  If there was a ""no opinion"" button that would be my vote for this game.The graphics are OK.  I was not a fan of the music.  There are some pretty basic options available.However, to make it through the puzzles requires some very precise controls.  You can set the sensitivity in the options, but I found sometimes I needed to be able to spin the room at different speeds.  At the end of the day the game was more tedious than fun, and I found that I felt more relieved than happy when I beat a level.4/10			"

												Did a blind race of this game with others. Paid only 19 cents for it. I want my 19 cents back; I should have quit before 2 hours and refunded. It has awful stage mechanics, the music gets irritating fast, and the controls don't work properly (I would rotate slowly just to get an extremely slight slant and then I would be 180 degrees turned without moving after that. All the time) making some levels near impossible.  The only reason I kept going was because I was in a call with friends and was having fun with them...I would have quit and uninstalled long before if I hadn't been there. Definitely not worth your time.			"

												Marble mayhem was pretty fun.... for 15 minutes. Some of the levels are unbelievably hard with the sensitive controls, while others are just the right difficulty. I don't remember what I paid for this, or when I got it, but I think its probably worth about 50 cents. If it had  touchscreen controls it might be fun on a surface pro, but for now, not great. -PR0XIDIAN			"

												Disclaimer: Review CopyI enjoy difficult games. Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is a difficult game. Therefore I should enjoy Marble Mayhem. Wait...I enjoy difficult games that are FUN. Games like Super Meat Boy, VVVVVV, even Eryi's Action. Games that have solid mechanics and rely on the skill of the player. Games, that despite playing each level multiple times, remain to keep the player hooked. Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is definatly a hard game, but not a very good one. The controls are bad, the visuals are bad, and even the repeating music and sound effects get annoying after a while. There is no insentive to keep playing the levels, because all that awaits you are more of the same. In conclusion, if all you are looking for is a hard game, then you may like Marble Mayhem. I, however, play games to have fun time.			"

												Fragile Ball is surprisingly fun to play. You might look at the page and see yet another purposely awful $2 Steam game, but make no mistake, you're in for a pleasant surprise.To me, this game has several layers of depth. You can fly around if you know what you're doing. You can manipulate physics by turning your camera in a specific way as you're falling so you won't break from the normally lethal fall. As other people have said, it's a hardcore casual game. Mechanics are surprisingly tight, levels are varied and some skippable, and the game supports 1080p. It also has audio settings that work.Fragile Ball shouldn't be this good, but it is. I highly recommend it.			"

												We've all played games like this before. Rotate a level around to guide a ball to the goal. While the main idea is fine, the game is a sloppy mess. The music is terrible along with the textures, the physics engine, the sound effects and the level design. The mouse controls are ridiculously sensitive, so you have to constantly adjust them depending on the level you're playing. The game requires a lot of precision on the player's part, but it doesn't give you the control to be able to do so. The mouse often leaves the window when you're trying to rotate the level, which freezes the rotation and messes up whatever manuever you were attempting. The button to reset the level is the left mouse button and you can't rebind the keys. I reset the level more than a few times accidentally because I bumped the mouse against something while trying to rotate the stage.I do not recommend this game.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Casual simulation game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can change the video resolution size.You can play the game on fullscreen and window mode.There is a slide bar for sound and music volume.There is a controller rotation speed option.There are multiple save slots.There is a normal and a hard difficulty.There are alot of Levels.You can play the game with the mouse/Keyboard or controller.About the game.You play with a ball and you have to rotate the screen in order to move the ball.You have to bring the ball to the goal to finish the level and you have to do that by moving the screen.Hitting too hard to an object, will break the ball and then you have to restart over.Game is very simplistic to understand and i do recommend to use the mouse.You can reset the level by clicking the left mouse button. You can also zoom out and in with the mouse wheel.Music is alright and calm. It doesn't have alot of variety however.Some of the levels are really lucked based which is a bit meh.Other things.The music on the main menu resets whenever you are going to the Sound options.There are no secrets and no time challenges. :DNo leaderboards and scores. :DIf you like to play with balls then you will like this game too.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10 "

Levels should be ranging from mazes and pachinko machines to cannons that fire your (breakable) glass ball far away into spike traps'And it works like a charm.

												I've played this game for over 2 Hours now and I'm on about Level 60. From what I've played, and seen, this is a pretty cool game. Certain stages pit you with the challenge of having limited use of your mouse, which requires insane precision and steadyness. The game also has levels where you are able to 360 turn with the mouse, meaning that you can control momentum while flying through the air. This game takes patience. It can be frustrating at times, but is none the less a pretty cool game.			"

												In this game, you rotate your screen to move a marble throughout an obstacle course. Obstacles may include spikes, timed traps, and other things. If you hit a wall too hard, you get destroyed. Certain maps have rotation limits. You reach the end of the map and move on to the next of the 85 levels (level selection is not linear)And that is my really simple explanation of how the game works. It is also just as efficient as it needs to be, because it is a really simple game. If you are looking for a good time with a cheap, unique game, this is it. Warning: At some point levels become unreasonably difficult and you may never complete them. I am at a point where these levels are simply ludicrous.			"

												For 21 cents. this game is a steal if you really wanna torture your own mind. It brings back the retro ps1 aspect of the game, simple controls all you need is a mouse and theres like 500000 levels in the game probably. Even the gramphics are the same as those ps1 games, I find myself questioning my existance sometimes when im playing the same level on the same life for over 5 minutes.  I have played this and never in my life have i seen such a fragile ball that explodes on impact with anything. This game is literally high school where every time you screw up, you get punished and you ignore that punishment until you finally finish the level and realize that you should not have ignored everything. But if this game were ever to not be 21 cents, unless you're some nerd who enjoys puzzle games and sits at home jerking it to professor layton's puzzles on the nintendo ds. you are better off spending the full price money on little caesars $5 pizza. now twist my nipples, slide down my asscheeks and call me bessie. please rate comment and subscribe			"

												Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is a simple game about getting the ball to the goal! However as the subtitle would have you believe sometimes you gotta handle your balls with care. Taking too big a drop or going to fast could… bust your balls. Okay I’ll stop the ball thing now for everyone’s sake. Hold on Balls! Balls! Balls! Fragile Balls! There it’s out of my system.This is a simple and fun game that reminds me of a simplified version of Super monkey ball. The courses begin to vary after ten levels with some looking like a pachinko board, or a classic maze of sorts. Tilting the whole level is limited per level sometimes you can go a full 360 other times the rotation is limited to maybe as little as ten degrees.Also you’re not always playing with the fragile ball there are also levels with the bouncy ball. Which may make things seem easier until your realize you can’t clear a level if your bouncing all around the stage goal.All in all the game is fun and simple. If you looking for a small time waster with a more simple gameplay give this a shot.			"

You have a ball and you must tilt the screen using your mouse to make it reach it's destination. All while avoiding spikes, traps, and falling from significant heights. (It is a FRAGILE ball after all).While this sounds casual, it soon becomes clear that it takes more skill (and a bit of luck) to reach your goal. I had to even step away from it a few times to cool down. But I came back and would try again... try again... try again... try again... I MADE IT! WOO HOO!!Seriously, some levels are frustrating but you get a sense of satisfaction when you complete it.I'm only about 1/3 complete at the time of this review and the levels are already daunting, but in a fun way.If you enjoy casual games with a bit more challenge than the norm, give this a try.

												This game is not bad, but everytime i play it i feels more like a task i have to do, rather than just a game to have fun in. It feels forced, like you look forward to complete it and then delete it and never open it again. Games should not be this way. Let me explain why i dont like it. : The controls are terribly bad, which makes alot of games very hard and compleation is nearly based on luck.: The graphics are also disgusting. grainy and old-school looking: Overall the maps are very identical and they look alike 4/10			"

												While I can say I recommend the game for what it is - a simple get the ball from point A to point B by tilting the screen with your mouse or keyboard arrow keys, I can't recommend it for the feeling of nausea I felt while playing it. I gave it about 20 minutes and got through 12 or so levels - while they were challenging and fun - the way the screen tilts with the board made me wish I was near a toilet while playing.Graphics are okay for the genre - pushing towards realism, but in reality the game would have been acceptable with black lines and a white ball instead of going for the full 3D rendered effects.Controls are done with the left and right motion of the mouse, or with the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. I don't know about controller support, but regardless you could probably macro a controller to work with this game no problem.Audio was loud and horrible. Had to mute the audio to play the game.Gameplay itself is simple. Each level has a restriction as to how far you can tilt each ""board"" and you need to navigate the marble/ball from start to finish. An added feature for failure is if the ball falls from too far of a height, it breaks - forcing you to restart the level. As an added bonus, there are various traps in each level to amp up the difficulty of a board. From what I saw, spikes were a common occurance, and jets of flame were another that lay in wait to disrupt your progress.All in all, the game would have been enjoyable if it didn't make me sick trying to play it. Challenging? Yes, but not worth the feeling of wanting to stick my head down a porcelain basin.			"

-Quick Review-Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is a physics game developed by Bimboosoft Co.,Ltd. and released 2015.Okay real talk, do you remember those old wooden maze games with the number holes, and the little steel ball you would navigate through the maze by tilting the maze up down, left or right? After a sequence of google searches I've come up with the title ""Labyrinth marble game"".Take that concept, and make a game out of it. BAM, that's Marble Mayhem Fragile Ball, and depending on your opinion of that retro physical game, that will effect your opinion on this game. Full disclaimer: I'm terrible at the real life version. Do read on!


Kids these days, what would you be without your graphics, your hocky, your playstations, and the donkey kongs?

-Detailed breakdown review-Gameplay: Easiest controls I can describe: Mouse to tilt right and left. BAM! Review done, roll the credits.Okay, I can elaborate more on it. Some people seem to have problems with mouse sensitivity, I did notice you can tilt slightly with the keyboard but I pity you if you need to rely on the right and left arrows; I didn't try any levels with them. Some levels let you tilt the camera more then others.The idea is your moving a ball around a maze, and if your ball hits the ground or spikes it will break and you'll need to restart from the beginning. There are actually two kinds of balls, a blue bouncy ball which won't break from fall damage (but instead you need to worry about spikes, and using bounce physics to your advantage), and the regular brown ball which will break if it builds up too much momentum before running into the wall.


Broken... Just like my dreams for beating this game (jk, no dreams. I don't have the patience to do the harder levels)

There are actually two difficulties for the game, I mainly played Normal because, while I am stupid and do like a good challenge, I'm not a sadist! I played maybe 4 levels on hard difficulty and discovered very quickly I didn't want to play that difficulty (the ball is just significantly less forgiving.Conclusion:  How much entertainment is in this game? I played a few hours legitimately amused an entertained. It would be interesting to see if controllers or motion controls worked with this game (unfortunately I don't have access to either, so I can't tell you if they work).For the asking price, meh. This game is alright... If you're looking for a quick play, or something to distract your kids with, or want some steam trading cards, go ahead and pick this game up.


That's enough for me. I don't want to play anymore.

												- Level design is awful: There's so many unnecessary hard levels, and luck based levels.- Game engine is too sensitive: If you tilt screen half degrees, then ball starts running fast. Not makes any sense. Control is depend on your luck. really.- Difficulty level: 'Normal' is Hard, 'Hard' is Hardest. There's no normal.I can't recommand it, despite the $1 price tag.P.S. I don't think hard games deserves bad reviewes. However, there's clear difference between 'fun hard' and 'annoying hard'. And, this game is one of 'annoying hard' to me.			"

												This is not my normal type of game but it had some fun with it.It is a physics game (think Angry Birds) where you move a ball around on a 2D map you move with your mouse. Sometimes you get a fragile ball that will shatter if it hits anything too hard. Sometimes you get a blue bouncy ball that doesn't shatter but bounces more. Sometimes there are cannons you can enter to be propelled out. Spacebar or left clicking will reset your puzzle for you. There is a normal and hard mode. I tried the normal mode and found some puzzles to be very easy and some very challenging. So far I have done 13 of the 100 levels available. Between each puzzle you are treated to a 10x10 grid where you can select the next puzzle. Each completed puzzle unlocks one or two nearby squares much like the old MicroSoft game, Minesweeper. I have not encountered any bugs, glitches, DRM, or errors.There are three sets of options: Video Options: Fullscreen toggle, Anti-aliasing toggle, Video Resolution 640x480 800x600 1024x768 1280x800, V-sync toggle Sound Options: Background music volume slider bar, Sound Effect volume slider bar Control Options: Rotation Speed slider barHere is a gameplay video of it (sorry about the quality):

												Well, about Marble Mayhem. It is an extremly simple and surpriseless little game which challenges both brain and the reflexes. There is neither background story nor main characters (except rubber and fragile ball pehaps). Player's job is to bring the ball through different areas to the specific place. Areas are 100 and every challenge is different and some are harder than the others.gg. Would purchase from sales again!			"

												This game is for those as kids, that had that little maze toy where you get the marble through it. Thats it here and more. The ball is super fragile like glass and breaks on you, if it hits a side too hard or falls to hard OR the ball is super bouncy like a 25 cents super ball from the grocery store. That makes this game a huge challange when going through mazes and lybrinths and PLATFORMS( witch I hate) spikes, cannons, crushers, slopes and makes this game a very hard challange to complete. A good game for the puzzle lovers out there. Just takes patience, timing and good mouse control. Good Luck, your gonna need it.			"

												Controls and physics are extremely slidey and just don't feel good, which isn't good for a game in which the point is maintaining complete control of your ball. The level design is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I got through a few difficult levels just by waggling the mouse until the wonky physics slingshot the marble around the entirety of the complicated level and right into the goal. Not to mention all the pachinko levels (of which there are at least three) that are entirely luck, and a few more that are trial-and-error because the only way to see the goal is to launch yourself in random directions until you find it. A simple game, but the level design falls flat on its face, and that should be what shines in a game like this.			"

												Simple but absolutely intriguing, with some Marble Madness-ish flavor. Beware: Fragile Ball can be incredibly frustrating and unforgiving, even worse than the old gold Marble Madness, but if you learn to master it, it really can be rewarding. I spent as much as 30 tries to overcome level 84...just sayin' that. There are 85 levels, and the last one hides a surprise, but oddly I found the 84th being the most frustrating one, making me rage-quit more than once. Other than that, it's a really good puzzle game knockin' your head against!			"

												£0.59 in a bundle, it's very hard to complain when you pay so little for a game. I'm going to though.If we accept the fragile mechanic (the ball destroying itself based on collision velocity) as core to the game's design, the levels are the real problem here. Executions like this require several replays per level and this mechanic punishes the player by not allowing them to replay sections they've already been through at a faster pace, this is just frustrating.I, however, don't think the fragility of the ball is a good core mechanic and without fail enjoyed the 'Super Ball' levels in which the ball was indestructable much more. I think I focus on time/execution (maybe scoring harsh collisions instead of forcing a restart whenever you get one) would have been more in line with the design of the levels.Independantly of all of this, you shouldn't have clamped the rotation differently for each level. It's inconsistant. It doesn't allow you to master the only mechanic and often leads to frustration which compounds with the above.Make a sequel, I like these kinds of games.Edit: Oh yeah, and get some decent textures. If you can't afford them just go for block colours or something more prototypey, at least I can distinguish your level elements then.			"

												Sometimes when you hit walls, you bounce, and other times you don't, it was a bit odd. I tried testing using different conditions, but most times it gave a different result, this was apparent with the bouncy and regular marbles.Some mouse tracking issues, sometimes the game just pulled a spazz attack on me when I tried to flick in the other direction, rotating different amounts for the same flick. I also found that the screen would not rotate smoothly when moving the mouse at certain speeds.Some levels felt a bit cheaty - Some required lots of precision, which I feel is unfair due to the tracking issues with the mouse.A large portion of levels were easy to cheat on, most easily completed by spinning the screen in 360s to help guide the ball midair.Interesting design choice to see some levels in the second row unaccessable.The moving platforms were a bit misleading, they don't help the ball move along, you still have to continue rotating your screen in order for the marble to move, which is not how physics works :PI'm really picking out all the negatives, despite all these criticisms, I actually really enjoyed the game. I went in just to collect the steam cards, but ended up coming back because I was genuinely interested in finishing the game.			"

												Each of the cleverly designed levels in this retina-scarring brainteaser provided a suitable challenge, as well as a way to hone my dexterity. The fragile ball, (which I've nicknamed ""Bimboo"", after the game's developer), feels like a tangible element of the game's box-like environment thanks to its incorporation of 3D graphics. There is a rustic-looking meter at the top of the screen, the player's means of gauging their range of movement for that level. The gameplay will last an average user a considerable amount of time to complete, with 85 levels to frantically press your arrow keys to move through. I had to invert my mouse controls via it's software driver in order to get a harder challenge.++sufficiently challenging++price++utilization of 3D graphics++appropriate level of frill+ball bounces a little and has a tangible existence+satisfyingly frustrating-textures and shadows paired with abrupt movement can be hard on the eyes-resolution limited to 1920x1080MAKES A GREAT GIFTThank you Bimboosoft Co.,Ltd. and Epic Quest Games for a fun and challenging time.**you are able to listen to your own music while you play this			"

I have recieved this game for free as part of a promotion for the game. Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews. My reviews reflect my opinion, and my opinion only.As much as I hate to say it, even for as cheap as it is, this game is not fun at all. ""Devilishly difficult"" sounds more like an excuse for terrible game design. It's not challenging gameplay, it's terrible physics. Yeah sure the levels are ""diverse"" I'll give it that, but it's far from ""ingenius"". The music is generic and even annoying at times. The textures are drab, blurry, and just plain hard to look at at times. It's really unfair to compare it to Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness, and Peggle. I love my physics based puzzles as much as the next guy, but unfortunately I will not be reinstalling this one anytime soon. Save your money.			"

												It would be a great little time-waster if you could actually choose HOW you rotate the board.. You can only use your mouse with an inverted setting. So whenever you want to turn the board quickly, you intuitively turn it the wrong way..I guess it's to expect from a 0.22$ game though.			"

I had to open it again to play it for 5 minutes in order to post a review, and it just crashed my Skype, OBS, and made my screen flash for 3 minutes before opening.

												i was very let down by this game, you move the mouse left and right to tilt the universe to get the fragile ball to the end zone.too much speed and itll break on contact with a surface.the graphics and music sound like theyre from an 90s video game. which alone isnt that bad,the success music does not fit with the rest though, i did not like hearing it, despite it meaning victory.the idea is simple and enjoyable, and while not the most visually appealing, thats not what made me stop playing.its the levels, they are very pusishing for mistakes, and even when you know what to do, actually doing it is by no means an easy to perform task. i can enjoy a challenge, but i did not get enjoyment from these levels, i got annoyed. that isnt even mentioning the lack of variety. i admit i did not play past level 12, but every level was ""fall down this series of platforms to the end"". with the exception of the half pipes, which wasnt bad, but the ball broke too easily on even that level. the description describes it as ""Devilishly difficult but insanely rewarding"" and yet i felt no real reward from beating a level. it reminds me alot of mario maker, in that the levels are punishing with no reward. they name drop ""Hirofumi Hattori"" as a japanese game design genius, which gives me doubt. these levels did not feel geniusly designed, and a quick google search yeild no real results as to who exactly  Hirofumi Hattori is. which lessens the credebility in my mindoverall, i would not recommend this game, while some enjoy the ""challenge"" of a difficult and unforgiving game, i do not. and i do not believe this game was very well designed to fit this concept.

												I bought this game because in the description it is compared to Marble Madness. I'm not sure if I'm qualified to write a review after 13 minutes of gameplay but this game is nothing like Marble Madness. It is not a masterpiece. Also it is infuriating and the music is horible.For what it is this game isn't bad. I bought it for roughly only a dollar and though I doubt I'll ever play it again my experience wasn't altogether awful. Will I play it again? Maybe if they change the music. I don't really have anything good to say about it, but at least it isn't awful.			"

												I just tried your Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball game since it was the only one available and I#m really disappointed that it just  feels like regular Marble and nothing like the one from last year!! I asked if it had been made right and I was assured it was but given more marbles anyway only to find that it STILL felt like regular Marbles. The game developer told me that they were using a different type of marble to usual and I think it has completely ruined this game option. I was also upset to be given no bonus levels or secret achievements despite the clear advertising campaign that makes it look rather desirable.			"

												I bought this game for $.16. I thought, ""hey, I haven't bought anything for $.16."" Well, after beating 80 levels fo this game, I now can write a thourough review. It starts off pretty fun. It has some challenge and it makes you think and there are other ways around things. At first, I was glad about the $.16 I spent. Then the last levels came along. Wow. All of the joy of playing this game was sucked out. They are nearly impossible to beat. It is sooo frustrating to get past a very hard part only to be faced with an even more difficult part of the map and have two or three even more difficult parts to come. If you mess up at the very end, you have to start all the way back at the beginning. The music is awefulI, like grade A+ aweful. Some of the maps have this sound like a musical instrument imitating a cow mooing. Bad... I would give this game a 3 of 10. Fun for a little while but you will NEVER beat it. There are still more levels to come and I can't even begin to imagine.			"

												This is an excellent and simple puzzle game where the goal is simple: You control a marble, and you must get it to the end of the level. But your marble is quite fragile..... so you have to be gentle with the marble too, or else it'll break. This game mechanic makes Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball a VERY hard game, but it stays very addictive.The game has Steam cards, which is a GOOD thing. The soundtrack is calm and it fits well with the game. I especially love the level select song myself.Graphics are alright. Who needs great HD extreme graphics in a puzzle game anyways? :3Controls are responsive, and it uses the arrows keys or the mouse to rotate the level. It plays very smooth with the mouse, and smoothness in a marble game is very important.I have one complaint: No level editor. I mean, with how simple the game is, a level editor for it would be very easy to make and to use. And I want to be honest here: I WISH THERE WAS A LEVEL EDITOR. This game is just so good, a level editor would make it PERRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT. A way to share levels by other users (Workshop) would be great too if a level editor feature ever happens.Overall, I highly recommend this game. With a low price and an addictive gameplay, its totally worth it.			"

												Move your mouse to rotate the screen, try to get a ball to the exit, standard traps as well as bouncy and fragile ball.Very barebones game.Pros:-Entertaining level variety-Difficulty (?)Cons:-Overly tight controls makes ball almost uncontrollable in many instances-Annoying carnival-style music-When rotating, tiled wallpapers rotate as well resulting in dizziness-Unstimulating spritesVerdict:3/10-A little bit of time in the graphics/music department would have made this a lot more enjoyable			"

												It's an okay game. Reminds me of those games you carefully balance a ball through a wooden maze and avoid the holes or have to start over, except it's going downward with some little control over gravity depending how fast you turn.More of a time killer game.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												THIS GAME ! it has changed my life in many ways <3I learned in hard sessions of training how the game physiks work and from then on i got addicted. I spent way too much time for the game and this wasnt good for me but it is THE BEST GAME ever made so i had to decide to stop playng this game or just leafe the school. So i made the better choice to stay with the game. Now i earn much money playing this game in livestreams and i am able to buy me everything i want but all i need is just this game something to eat and a littlebit cola to survive my days.Now you maby thing why i like this game soo much and here is the awnser: There are many levels and it doesnt matter how often i play these it still looks differend from the last try. If you have nice aim some reaction and a good knowedge of the level you can easyly play at the ESL and the support of ESL is just awsome just write them that you are a Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball pro and they will take you to many differend tournaments. The prices of this tournaments are awsome and you have many viewers who hope that they can be as good as you one day but the wont because for being as good as you they need to play this game or to cheat.And this is the only problem of the game the CHEATS. There are so many cheaters out there and they are able to fly around and win every tournament and because this game has no VAC the makers of the tournament cant do anything against this :( but it is still the game which made me famous and which is my life forevery.Peace and out my friends			"

												I love this game! If you've ever wanted to appear on ""The Crystal Maze"" but didn't get picked or you were too young when it was on TV then this game is for you. It takes skill and patience and I can totally undertand why the overly-caffeinated tween kids on a sugary high don't like it. Well worth the £0.19 I paid for it.For the people who hate the music: There is an options menu where you can turn it off.			"

												I was writing this review while playing, and I wrote down stuff that impressed me:Didn't expect much until level 7 came up. Gave the game an awesome new dimension! Love the creativity with a simple concept devs! I dunno, but the 3D text was something different from lots of other games! Just reached level 26. And I'm inpressed once again. Raindrops fall with the direction you're pointing at! Ball does break when it comes between a moving platform and a wall, just tested (acidentally)!Some things that annoyed me however are the transitions of music, the sudden stops of the ball when breaking. So, transitions. Oh, and sometimes the ball has a crack, but doesn't break, then the crack dissapears and i can just continue. It's the little things you know...I am overall impressed by the game. Expected it to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie game that I'd play once,but this was way more fun then i expected! So, to all of you reading this game. It might not be the best graphics, but the gameplay is pretty fun!TL;DR: It's like that phone game, Labyrynth 2, but the ball can break.			"

												Well the developers compare this to Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness and Peggle.  I think the only comparison is that there is a marble that rolls around.  If anything its Marble Madness in 2D.  Not to say its a bad game cause it does have some pretty difficult levels.  I haven't fully completed the game but I am pretty close.  For 25 cents or 1 whole dollar its well worth it.  I've been enjoying the game and I think you will to.  Don't let the look of the game decieve you its nifty and fun.  As for the music not much going for it... but hey its a FUN!!! game get it now.			"

												Here's your ball and there's your destination with a lots of annoying obstacles on the way. Pros: + Fun and challenging.Cons: - No reverse mouse/camera option.- Soundtracks are bad to play with it.- Annoying levels can cause hatred. (Don't punch your screen)			"

												Thumbs up...but barely.It is fun and challenging casual game, but it is hard to overlook unpolished mouse control (and buggy rotations) and to impossibilty to determine how actually is fragile ball. Music and visual are average.Just a little bit of polishing and this game would be a casual blast fun. :)			"

												That this game has only mixed reviews is pretty unfair. It's a small, dated-looking, but fun marble-rolling game, and totally worth getting, although I'd wait until it's on sale for like $3 or less. It's tricky, challenging, simple arcade fun.			"

												Starts off easy but gets hard fast. The ""fragile"" ball is truly that. If you mess up just a little, bam the ball is destroyed and you have to start over. For those of you with a lot of patience and enjoy puzzle games, then thumbs up for that. If you don't have much patience or like puzzle games, then this isn't the game for you. So overall I'll give it a thumbs up because it is what it advertises.			"

												Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is simple enough for kids to play but also challenging enough so that a casual gamer can't just fly through all levels in no time. It becomes harder and harder as you go through the levels.My kids likes this game very much. I like it because it reminds me of those pocket marble games I loved when I was a kid.What makes this game good in my opinion, is that it has a simple theme and sticks to it 100% without adding out of place game-play elements just to cram extra content into it. The well implemented physics and simple intuitive controls makes this game effortless to play. You don't have to learn how to play this game, just just jump right in and play from the first second.I would recommend this game as a good game for children as it is easy to learn, fun and a play session can be anything from just a few minutes to longer sittings.

												Eh, I did find this game okay, so I would recommend this to others to just give it a shot. :)Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is just a casual, 2D puzzle game that really reminds me of one of the toys that have similar functionality I used to have. This game contains 100 levels that may seem easy at first, but some of them can be difficult, providing you rather quite a challenge. The way you play is that you move your mouse to the left or right to rotate the screen for the marble to move in order to get from point A to point B.But it's not something as simple as getting from point A to point B, you also have to maneuver through obstacles that comes your way. You would have to avoid hitting spikes that exists in some levels and falling down too far to the point the marble shatters. The levels shouldn't be too difficult, but if you don't succeed, try try again! The graphics and the game interface aren't really the best, but not like it really matters. Oh and there's trading cards too if you want to craft more badges.Should you buy this game?If you're just looking for a casual game, like 2D puzzles, or just wanting to make more badges from trading cards, then yes. Just give it a shot anyways! :)6/10			"

												Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is a small twitch-puzzle game in which you try to maneuver your often fragile ball through a series of obstacles until you settle into the white square that is the goal. Your only method of control is spinning the level. The marble respects gravity.Repeat 100 times. That's the entire game.It's a decent time-waster. You can sit down for 5 minutes and solve a few levels. I've had some good value for the 14 cents I paid.The twitch can be a little annoying at times and the level design is mostly completely uninspired, even late in the game (outside of a few well designed levels, most are just random blocks thrown around a level). Some levels you play as a bouncy ball, and those are very frustrating with the twitch movement. Overall.. worth the cheap price. I got enjoyment out of it, even though I didn't expect to.			"

												I was writing this review while playing, and I wrote down stuff that impressed me:Didn't expect much until level 7 came up. Gave the game an awesome new dimension! Love the creativity with a simple concept devs! I dunno, but the 3D text was something different from lots of other games! Just reached level 26. And I'm inpressed once again. Raindrops fall with the direction you're pointing at! Ball does break when it comes between a moving platform and a wall, just tested (acidentally)!Some things that annoyed me however are the transitions of music, the sudden stops of the ball when breaking. So, transitions. Oh, and sometimes the ball has a crack, but doesn't break, then the crack dissapears and i can just continue. It's the little things you know...I am overall impressed by the game. Expected it to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie game that I'd play once,but this was way more fun then i expected! So, to all of you reading this game. It might not be the best graphics, but the gameplay is pretty fun!TL;DR: It's like that phone game, Labyrynth 2, but the ball can break.			"

												I'm recommending this game because it delivers on what you'd expect from the trailer, screenshots, and other reviews.I stupidly purchased this, knowing I wouldn't like it. I tend to grow frustrated easily with these ball-balancing games (yes, just like the toys I had as a kid), and this was no different. It seemed pretty good, though I couldn't push through my frustration.The atmosphere irritated me even further. I hate the zany typefaces and music so much, and learned to dislike everything else about it. I'm admittedly elitist about the aesthetics I enjoy in games, but I feel bad being so negative about this product that was well-done. Therefore, I recommend this game to people who are not myself.

												I won't say that this game is complete garbage but it's still $hit in my opinion. +Gameplay is poor  *But sometimes you need to think how to complete the level* Sometimes it's kinda fun to play.You move by moving mouse(left and right) I really didn't like that.Sounds are annoying garbage.I don't recommend but only thing why you should try this product is to get experience and knowledge what is bad game.This isn't bad 100% just meh			"

												Fun little casual game that requires a lot of thinking. I would like it if the developers added more resolution options and a inverted mouse for the turnings because im not used to it this way. Really should check this out for its small price its one of the best little games out there.			"

												This game is the epitome of all the greatest PS1 games.  Its high quality graphics with 10/10 sound choices makes it one of the best 21 cent games.  I cannot believe that it was so good because of its sheer exploding ball graphics			"

												As a whole this game could have been better made.The physics control well enough with a mouse, although there is a lot of weirdness without a rotation limiter, but the ""fragile ball"" doesn't really seem fragile at all. There is no reason for the tilesets to look like they do, mechanical and egyptian or otherwise, and the levels aren't even ordered properly. The difficulty is all over the place and the majority of the stages are just random pieces of stone slapped on a canvas with spikes at the bottom.At least the pachinko levels are decent for what they are.3/10, and I'm biased towards Pachinko games.

												First of all, the sound effects make me want to kill myself. Second of all, the game isn't hard because of level design, no, its hard because of bad controls, and the amount you can fall from without dying is stupid. Fall about 1 inch on your monitor, and you die. You want a hard game? Buy Hotline Miami. 100% better.			"

												If it is on sale, get it. A fun little time killer, probably could run on most computers with a pentium 4 or newer CPU, doesn't seem very demanding. The launcher makes the old Uplay look like a gift from the gods however. Once you get the actual game launched, just pin the shortcut, don't use the launcher.			"

												Didn't realize I purchased this game in a puzzle-games bundle, but I still played it to try it out. I was a bit excited to play this when I realized what this game is, because this game reminded me of the wooden boxs where you have to carefully navigate a metalic ball through a maze/obstacles to reach the end. However, when I booted  the game up, I was immediately turned-off by the game's graphics. It was absolutely horrible to the eyes and I had to blink multiple times to read the font on the menu page as the background contstantly changed with different scenes in the game. After getting past configurations and starting the game, the first few levels interested me and kept me going. Allthough, I did notice that the rotation sensitivity does change a bit per level and this is most likely due to the rotation constraint built into the game, which would devalue the game some more as you might end up spending more time calibrating the mouse sensitivity more than attempting the level. (I still dislike the poor graphics used as a background. Please have more ascetically pleasing backgrounds in the future to boost its value :/)In regards to the game design, the design is simple and easy to grasp, but a major deviation is that your degree of rotation is limited. This changes how the game is/can be played and doesn't make it much fun for me. Likewise, having the idea of the ball being fragile makes you want to navigate the game carefully, but then you introduce the super (nearly indestructuble as you cam bounce it hard against a wall, but pops on spikes) ball, which changes the game entirely. Yes, the super ball works to introduce variation, but I think it'll do even better if you have themed levels separated from each other where one theme is fragile ball puzzles and the other is the super ball. About the game's physics, I'm not sure how well-tuned they are. During a maze level where I could actually do 360 rotations, I had the ball rolling very fast and I made the mistake of turning the wrong way. which had the ball free-falling down a pretty long way down. I naturally thought I had to restart the process, because it'll smash. However, it did NOT. I was thoroughly surprised and thought I was lucky. However, when I did the same process again, it smashed as expected. So either the physics isn't consistent or that was a bug that I proc'ed by chance. Overall, I did find some amusement in this game as it brought back memories. However, I didn't exactly enjoy the game that much due to the graphics and mechanics. I say 3/10.			"
