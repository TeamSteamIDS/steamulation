												its kinda like... babys first street racer.its so incredibly average, nothing is done particularly well, but nothing is really bad either. i'd reccomend for anyone who just likes casual racing every now and then but isnt too serious about it, or just has a lower-end PC that cant handle the more modern racers. if you're not either of those, you probably have a better racing game in your collection already. this one is worth picking up on sale, at the very least.

Review re-written 2016.06.15Too lazy to write a proper ""long"" review, so have a short one.Pros:+Vast number of cars+Fun Gameplay+Considerably long story mode+Great graphics for its time+An ""okay"" type of soundtrackCons:-Broken police evade/bust system-Controls can come off as slippery at times-Poorly integrated ""Girlfriend"" mechanicOverall:Fans of pre-Criterion Need for Speed games will definitely feel right at home here with it sharing a lot of similarities to both Underground games and Most Wanted '05. Though the game can definitely have its down moments with the broken evade/bust system agains the police, sometimes terrible controls and the really bad ""Girlfriend"" mechanic which barely gives any advantage to the player.Street Racing Syndicate gets a score of:6.8/10.0			"

												Do you dream of rolling out of bed at eleven at night to join the world of illegal street racing in Los Angeles while betting against competitors and having more than a dozen generic girlfriends to start each race? Street Racing Syndicate has all the fun of a solid, easy to play street racing game with a lot of open world frills to keep it interesting. Its a deep game full of customization, unlockables and still everything feels like an earned reward from winning a bet to unlocking cars, girlfriends and videos of them.You have an open world Los Angeles at night. A big broad area that strays from details like side streets and allies. There is plenty to do here and I'll start with some of the side missions before I go into detail about everything else. You can find street challenges from cars that just sit waiting for you to offer cash in an open circuit challenge one-on-one. On the road there are other vehicles looking for a race. Get up behind them, flash your high beams and its on. Outside of racing there is a garage, a dealership, the warehouse where all of the women are stored and even three cruises that let you soak up the city as your car drives for you. Its a good use of the game's city.For anyone that wants to get to the event rather than drive to it, the game lets you have that option with the map. The sad thing is nothing is on your mini map. You need to hop in the big map and select your next location in a menu and whether you want to jump to it or drive.Since this is an open world, there are cops here and there. Police never interfere with races, but when you're outside a race and you speed by, they'll chase you. These chases have a meter how close you are to escaping or being busted and I say this meter and the game itself is glitched here. I've been in front of police cars and hear over the radio that they can't find me. Other times I've been busted with the cops far behind me. Its a toss up whether this is bad or good, but just take it easy around police. The game will warn you when they're in the area.The bulk of the game is in crew meets where you race in a series of three different races on three tiers. Each race and tier takes place in the same area, so it modifies the course a bit each time. It makes for thirty-two races in four areas from the start. Before each race of the series, you can select to place a side bet with one of the three competitors. If you beat them, you get the money and if you lose, then it costs you.A nice touch is being able to see the stats of the vehicles you can bet against. I say just bet the one offering the most money. As they win or lose through betting, their cash will increase or decrease, so it turns into an issue of beating the same person means others will have more money by the final race. Its incentive to bet against others.To unlock the next tier, you need cars with a minimum horsepower and you need enough respect. This respect is earned by winning races and you can get some bonus respect here and there for slides, near misses, overtaking competition and some air off of a bump. If you knock into anything before your respect is calculated you lose it, but its no big loss since winning races gives far more respect.Women and racing have always gone together, but wow does Street Racing Syndicate plaster them all over the game, its menus and on its streets. It makes the game different in a laughable, offensive or great way depending on your perspective. The women offer a variety of challenges. Everything from checkpoint rallies and big air competition to chasing them in their own street rides. Once they become your girlfriend they then hang out at the warehouse. Your own harem of women that you select one to roll with who will drop the go signal at each race. For those out there into videos there are provocative videos of the real women these girlfriends are based after. Someone had to chose to put these videos into the game. It goes a step beyond and an extra frill to keep you in game.Street Racing Syndicate blurs the line for me between an easy to play arcade game and more of a realistic game. Your car takes damage and after enough damage your car starts to drag a little. You can either instantly repair it at any event or you can take a drive to the only garage in the city. These repairs cost money, so try to stay away from obstacles.Nitrous is a luxury instead of a given, because you need to buy it at the garage. Using the nitro boost is still a challenge, you need to hold it down to see any significant momentum, because when you use it, your opponents will too. Its easy to just forget about it until the top tier races at the crew meets.On the mid tier races, your competitors are like jackals that hang around you, waiting for the proper moment to overtake you either with a mistake or a wide straightaway. This pushes the pace and depends you to avoid making major mistakes. The intelligence of the others feels top notch. They can avoid my reckless driving and compensate for a lot of different factors. Its very subtle and you need to go to great lengths to reveal it.I need to speak up about one crew meet that drives on an abandon racetrack at dusk where the sun is right in your eyes. The flare is giant and as a human I have a difficult time seeing through it. To the game's credit, there's nothing to bump into as you stare at the sun, but you can miss a hairpin turn and slam into a wall. Another thing that the game loves to do is put civilian vehicles in front of you going into turns. I've lost the final few seconds of mid tier races thanks to a well timed taxi.The customization goes to the furthest depths of the deep end. You can get lost looking at all of the ways to customize the look of your car. Spoilers, stickers, paint jobs, body kits, electronics, lights and so on. That's just the look though, you can upgrade each of your fifty unlockable cars with engines, mufflers, exhaust, and everything else that I will never fully understand. All I know is that each thing costs money and tweaks the stats ever so slight.yWith all of these upgrades and even purchasing vehicles, the worst part is the navigation to do so. You look at manufacturers and then you look at the parts. Switching between parts creates a load image so you need to remember which part had what stats. I wish there was just an easy way to see what I needed or even to compare them.On the plus side there are a lot of real world vehicles and companies. So many get stuffed into this game that it almost feels like an advertisement complete with billboards.Outside of the real game is an arcade with a few different modes and races. These are one off events that take place in Miami, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. I'm happy to have Miami, because its the only city that yous race in the daytime. It makes the city feel far different than the other two and lets you see its beauty rather than darkness. You can unlock plenty of new vehicles in the arcade. I'd love to unlock new cities, but with four hours in, I've seen no hint of such a thing.The game allows for controllers and controls easy with them, but the menus are still listed as keys so you need to remember what you have them set as.Street Racing Syndicate is a fun, engaging, immersive and well comical game with its overuse of certain things. Well worth the cheap asking price.			"

												**Please keep in mind that this Review is simply a matter of opinion, based upon certain facts of the game [age/PC requirements/etc.]**SRS, Where to begin on this?.. First and Foremost, If you're looking for a game thats entirely seamless and has top of the line graphics on the vehicles, You may as well stop this review, and head to another page, as this game is nearly 10 years old now (Came out late 2005). With that aside, SRS has many features that even most current games do not give you the luxury of changing anymore. The Pros:1) Get to Customize your car [i.e. weight reduction (for carbon fiber peices), A Body kit (sadly, only 1 for each car i have tried that is... beside the stock body), Underglow (to which you can change between about 8 different colors), Body+Rim paint, etc.]2) You get to choose which parts can go onto the car, they have about a 18 parts from real life authenticated part manufacturer's that you can use to upgrade your car with, turning that 343HP Nissan GT-R, Into a 918HP AWD Road Beast ;)...3) The game is fairly realistic in its driving (except the fact you can obviously keep driving after hitting someone going 120... but hey, its a video game), But on that note. You dont want to go around and wall grind around corners like alot of people do in NFS. It makes for a very costly repair bill after your races.4) ^ In note with that, It honestly makes you a consious driver, As you NEED to avoid obsticicles if you want to start earning money toward that awesome car you're waiting for, Giving it that realistic feel. (Repair bills are a B!@#$.)5) What it adds over the other games, Is the fact you can free roam everywhere without limitations toward the map. (But the map in its own is fairly small and rugged)6) Races are gauged by a 'Respect' system, You earn respect by running races quickly and cleanly, And throwing in a bit of spice to mix the pot.7) [and probably the best/most reason everyone whose played the game prior for] The girls. Yes, As you race, you get the chance to earn yourself a Girlfriend, (18 in total, all unique, their own descriptions and they even went as far as to add comments as to what they like) Each girl has 3 Videos of them dancing as you race with them tagging along with you. (Except for one, which i heard is bugged with only 1 video, unsure as to which one so far)The Cons:1) The graphics are pretty out-dated (but hey... its 2014, and this is a 2005 game, still not the worst..[could always go back to GTA2?.. bahaha])2) The maps are small.3) There is no real story to the game.4) To those of you whom play RPG games, This Racer has a 'Grinding' feel to it. As you end up repeating alot of races in order to get the car/upgrades that you desire.5) The modifications are pretty limited, (both tuning wise and cosmeticly)6) A (decent, but) Small quantity of vehicles to choose from. [If you are into muscle/luxury cars, and dont like racing with anything else, dont bother with this game, as it deals with mainly tuner styled cars (save for the Lexus IS300)]7) The game goes by fairly quickly, I've got just under 9 hours on record currently, and i already have the 2nd most expensive car, and beaten nearly every race perfectly.8) Is meant as a keyboard game, Not fully integrated for PS3/xbox360 controller use.All in all, I would definately recommend this game for those of you who are nostalgic with old racing games (weather it be this one specifically or racing in general) But would definately just add it to your wishlist untill it comes on sale, unless you're die-hard for those videos ;) haha.**As a side note, For anyone who plays/buys the game, keep in mind that upgrading and buying high-end modifications for your vehicle wont always make it the fastest, weather the fact its a bug in the game [which would not suprise me] Or just the way the designed it. As an example. I've got the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VIII ('04 model) [which is unlocked before the '02 Evo VII]. Did a few minor modiciations to it, bringing it from the 200HP or so it started at, up to 814HP. It will go 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, But the top speed maxes out at a measly 160mph (claims 162, but i couldnt pull it off, even downhill).While on the other hand, I have a Mazda RX-7, which has about 740HP, but maxes out at a stunning 190mph.If you have any questions, Please drop me a comment, and i'll do my best to help out.

												Street Racing Syndicate feels and plays like a good old-fashioned Racing Game. It has kind of fancy graphics for its date of release (2005) and still looks ok for a low-priced game today. I enjoyed driving around in tuned cars on set-up areas. The music is really nice, unlike many other games where it gets repetetive quickly. The customization part is pretty good, you have enough variety to tune a lot of cars without using the same stuff more than once.The AI is easy for a racing veteran but defenitly ok for beginners. The game does not feel like its punishing you for every little mistake.I'd recommend this game for everyone who wants to enjoy an old racing game where you can tune cars and enjoy some good music. It's a good game to start your racing career - probably also a very good game for our younger members of the gaming community. 6/10 compared to todays standard due to outdated graphics and slightly sluggish controls. 8/10 as a racing game.

												Its not a bad arcade racer and may have a few simularities to games like Need for Speed Underground.  Like those games it also came with the common 4:3 only resolutions.  Which means no widescreen support.  However I found a fix for that, that allows me and you to play in upscaled 720p, 1080p or higher resolutions.  If you'd like to learn how check the following link and start enjoying this game all over again.Street Racing Syndicate (upscaled widescreen support fix)http://dcericgamingnews.blogspot.ca/2015/03/street-racing-syndicate-widescreen.html "

												Street Racing Syndicate is an arcade racing game, created on the wave of astonishing success of the Need for Speed Underground. There were plenty of them back in the days, but only a few deserves our attention after all those years passed. If you need comparisons, I'd say that SRS is more realistic than NFS Underground 1 & 2, and have some unique features to hold player's interest - the most noticeable, the down-to-earth system of upgrades, and, of course, girls. Girls who encouraging the player with the original driving quests, and awards with private go-go dances, once you achieve something on the streets.As of downsides, the game is quite dated at moment (released in 2005), and it is not a ""living classic"", like NFS games. Sadly, even being more fair with player than NFS, Street Racing Syndicate is not possessing the fleur of the ""legend in flash"". Which is more, it lacks the drive that raised NFS Underground so high. The driving in the open world could be the pain in the back, as the map is not just slightly informative... and gosh, how many coppers there on patrol?! It's really hard to speed there, staying under the radar.Overall, I can't hardly recommend it. Get it on sale, or bundled, if you're up to some arcade racing with open world, where cars not bouncing from the border lines, maintaining speed. Where you have to pay for repairs, which urges you to drive a bit more carefully. Where you have your own club of long-legged female venerators... however low it may sound, it feels alright, try it sometimes.My personal mark will be 6.9/10. It's on the level with Juiced or just slightly not even with NFS Underground 2. But yeah, it's been about 12 years now, and there are plenty of newer open-world racing games, starting with TDU 2 or the Crew. None of them holds so much go-go dancing girls, of course, but I wouldn't buy the game just to look at dancing cuties. Would you?			"

												-While the game advertises to have 40+ licensed cars, most of them are actually just different factory versions of the same car, here's the entire car list:Mitsubishi:2001-2004 Eclipse,1999 Eclipse (FWD),Lancer Evo VII,Toyota:2000s Celica,2000s MR2 (roof doesn't come off),1994-1997 Supra,AE86 (seemingly implemened as an after-thought),Volkswagen:Golf IV,2004 Jetta,Subaru:Impreza (bug-eye),Lexus:IS 300,Mazda:1993-2002 RX-7,RX-8,Nissan:350Z,andSkyline R34That's just 15 actual cars...(At least there's a T-top version of the Supra :p)-The automatic transmission is terrible;-The only way to change the transmission (auto and manual) is to re-buy the car;-The game likes to mess with the steering even more than NFS 2015, it will often put you into a wall by trying to keep you sideways in a RWD car and if not, it will still waste you a lot of time in races. Also, at times, it will steer in the completely opposite direction of where you're trying to go if you're spinning out, making any sort of recovery impossible;-During drifts, it's clearly visible that front wheels are not attached to the cars;-While there are a lot of performance parts to upgrade you car with, they are all shared between cars, even on rotary engines;-Each car only has one aftermarket body kit;-It costs money to remove the rear seats;-There are upgrades that are completely useless due to having better and cheaper alternatives;-Weight of the car isn't displayed anywhere;-Dyno results don't match up with the car stats;-Most cars hit the rev limiter before the top speed from the stats can be actually reached;-No way to adjust the gear ratios, not even a top speed/acceleration slider;-Despite it being natuarally aspirated in the stats, the T-top Supra actually has a turbo, the opposite is true for the police car;-Adding an intercooler to a (actually) naturally aspirated car improves it's performance like it has a turbo;-Some suspension upgrades make the car more stable but understeery like hell;-There are movable, but fully solid carboard boxes that can roll your car;-There's no way to change to a non-outdated system of speed measurement (kanadian miles);-Doing the medium and hard Iron Man challenges will completely ruin the balance in Street Mode (career) by giving you stupidly overpowered cars;-Cars from Iron Man challenges come with an automatic gearbox;-You need to do the Easy Iron Man challenge to unlock the AE86;-The lights on the AE86 never close, even when the lights are off;-AE86 doesn't have any body kits;-A stock AE86 is incapable of going fast enough to ever be able to make use the 6th gear, meaning that Toyota put it there for no reason (it's also not there on the real car);-This 6th gear also gives the AE86 one of the highest top speeds in the game;-The rev counter on the AE86 goes up to 10k, despite redlining at 7k, no other car does this;-The hood on the AE86 opens in the wrong direction and has no visible hinges;-If you damage the edge of the rear bumper on the AE86, a large chunk of the car becomes see-through;-The AE86 doesn't support ""universal"" (any) spoilers;-Other racers never drive the AE86, nor the 1999 Eclipse;-There are two whole seperate cities that only exist for the sake of about 12 courses total;-The main city, Los Angeles isn't a bad place to drive around, but the only real reason to free roam it is to play a game of ""Who can find the most environment pop-ins"" with a friend;-A track named ""Tunnel Z"" doesn't go through the tunnel;-Cars are rated entierly by their horsepower, so you might not be able to enter some of the races even if your power to weight ratio and handling more than make up for lack of power;-Drafting is gives stupid amounts of speed when going slower but becomes useless as you get closer to the car's top speed;-Drafting doesn't work with traffic cars even when they are going much faster than the competition would;-Drafting only has any effect under acceleration;-The entire traffic consists of generic sedans, trucks and gloriously riced cars;-Hitting traffic cars at a certain angle will send them flying but won't cause damage to your car;-Damage on your car is sometimes applied to the side opposite of which you actually crashed;-The games only has about 12 hours of content;-Buying the Subaru at the start of the game makes everything very easy and boring for the first few hours;-The Skyline makes every other car in the game pointless and can be bought too early on;-Despite what the pre-rendered intro shows, there's no big rig with a trailer in traffic, nor cop chases mid-race;-The cop chases are more annoying than fun, cops going kamikaze to stop your car and your car being just instantly stopped if the Busted-Evade bar reaches full Busted. The bar is going down if the cops can see you and are anywhere near you, even when going 140+ mph;-The cops often cause so much damage to you car, it would just be cheaper to pull over and pay the fine, but the cops will still try to damage it even if you stop;-Some of the world is very abusable, making the cops lose you even when you're in plain sight;-After races, the game likes to spawn cops to chase you once you enter freeroam, which would be alright if it also didn't forget to make them go after you most of the time;-The cops can instanly and very obviously change direction by 180 dagrees (happens during nearly every 1-2 minute chase);-The top speed of the police Crown-Vic copy is 213mph, which makes it the fastest car in the game;-The police car has a ""V8 Interceptor"" logo but actually has in i6 engine;-The cops can do a full 360 on the spot while not moving;-Police radio audio is often cut off early;-Engine sounds randomly stop working for about 20 seconds, making you need to look at the rev conter to know when to change gear;-Shadow projection becomes a mess if you go near a wall in the direction of the sun;-There's a girl, who wants you to prove that you're not ""all show"" by asking you to do show-off moves;-Most of the girlfriend stuff is pretty cringy;-The flag girl doesn't react to being driven through;-All but two songs are complete cancer (at least you can turn music off)...""WHY THE HELL DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS??"" The POWER of nostalgia!! ...yeHsFun fact: This game is made by the same company who made Ride to Hell: Retribution2/10: Don't spend more than that on this game			"

												As the highlight of the bundle I got this in, this old racer still packs a lot of punch.  Fun races, using a combination of keyboard and mouse-driven steering, and fairly good graphics to go along with it.  Pretty girls to ogle, too.And don't be afraid to get a little mischievous and go the wrong way and/or take a detour and explore the other areas of the maps.  It's a LOT of fun, as well. Only downside is that there aren't many maps, but I'll overlook that.  Check it out...			"

												Put in short, this is a LESSER version game of Need For Speed, most probably NFS:Underground.Starts with some cash, purchase your 1st car, won races and get money, upgrade your car etc. It's a little bit repetitive gameplay like Gran Turismo. The physics is real enough for me, with REAL DAMAGE on car and you'll need your hard earned money to fix it. But what i like the most about this game it's OPEN WORLD! When i said Open World, it means real open world, with the cop squad chasing you if you speeding right in front of them etc.During the game, there is ""Respect Points"" which is gained by performing great skill(s) like drift and ""two wheelers"" both during free roaming in the city and race. Collects enough points you will unlock new challenges, and get new hot chicks too! lolGraphics is great but don't expect a high end graphics from a game from 2005!Overall, it's not a 100% solid game but it sure worth the money and time. And i got this during the sale! hehe.			"

												This game is a poor mans Need for Speed: Underground 2. That aside, this game doesnt really do anything very well, whether it be the car physics, the story, or even the customization. The game feels somewhat like an arcade game, the kind you would play at a place like Chuck E Cheese or similar places that had the arcade cabinets with built in steering wheels and race seats to sit in. This was a popular title on ps2, however, so if you are looking to relive memories of playing this i suggest you pick it up at its sale price (99 cents) as it is a really good deal for just a dollar. The .99 price tag is the reason why i give this game a thumbs up, as it is definitely a solid game for street racing fans. However, once it goes back to its normal price (10 dollars) i hate to say it but theres plenty of games that will be a better deal. Pick it up on sale only.*EDIT: runs fine on win10, no issues what so ever.*			"

												Well, this was a surprise. Out of nowhere this 2004 multiplatform street racer dropped on Steam in the middle of the week, causing me to throw my hands in the air and wave 'em around (almost like I didn't care) much like one of the short-shorts and high heels wearing fly girlies in this game who mob your car and celebrate your racing wins for some reason. Here's hoping they keep coming, I love these blasts from the both distant and recent past that have been appearing en masse on Steam lately.That said, this game is okay in 2014. Not great, not bad, but unlike many other genres, sports and racing games tend to suffer a little more with age. The game looks fine considering its age and target platforms, and it runs easily at 60fps on modern equipment, but there's just not the greatest sense of speed present. That can be mitigated by switching to the hood camera, but really, that's never been one of my favorite views for driving games.There's a deep career mode with a bare boned open-world element, a quick race mode, and seemingly endless menus of vehicle upgrades and customizations one could partake in. There's also plenty of ""2 Fast, 2 Furious"" type cheesiness if you want some laughs, and lots of weirdly sloped polygonal butts and boobs to ogle if that's your bag. Lots of fun to be had here for people with the proper mindset.			"

												If you are a fan of street racing (especially with Japanese cars), then I highly recommend Street Racing Syndicate, not only for the cars but for the honeys as well. SRS is a very well made game with great graphics, great customizations, great extras, and good sounds. The only reasons I can see someone not wanting to buy SRS is if:a) You hate to see good-looking women dance in front of you, or b) You dislike songs about prison sex and god.The title offers free-roaming cities, which it delivers on with versions of Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami. The wide-open feel is really there, and each gameplay option is available from this mode – you just ride up to people and start burning rubber.Category Description User ScoreActing The quality of the actors' performances in the game (including voice acting). 3 out of 5AI How smart (or dumb) you perceive the game's artificial intelligence to be 3 out of 5Gameplay How well the game mechanics work (player controls, game action, interface, etc.) 3 out of 5Graphics The quality of the art, or the quality/speed of the drawing routines 3 out of 5Personal Slant How much you personally like the game, regardless of other attributes 3 out of 5Sound / Music The quality of the sound effects and/or music composition 3 out of 5Overall User Score Average 3.0 "

Graphics aren't that bad for an older game, though you will need to get a mod online if you want to run the game with a widescreen resolution.			"

												Street Racing Syndicate was originally released back in 2004 on pc and all the major consoles. Considering this pc port was made the same year, it's alright.As a street racing game, it's pretty average, all things considered. Most of the races are pretty straightforward, you buy upgrades for your car between them, and you can drive around the city freely between races to find secrets. However, I greatly appreciated the feature that allowed you to instantly start any race from the map so you don't have to drive all the way there. Why more modern racing games still don't have that as a standard feature is beyond me.If you're going to buy this, remember it's a 10-year-old pc game and they made no effort to update it. The max resolution you can achieve is 1260 x 960, so it won't look great on most modern setups. However, it still has a lot of scaling capabilities, and all the buttons can be freely remapped without any trouble. I managed to get my xbox 360 controller running without much of an issue, though I'd suggest manually setting the keys yourself because the default layout is a little weird.All in all, it's a pretty average game. If you're looking for something fun to play on a really outdated pc, or you just like street racing, you could do a lot worse than this.			"

												Another Memories Game i used to play a lot on my Console since i was in Elementery School known as Street Racing Syndicate!!.This game is really amazing and Good Street Racing game.Its same as Need for Speed Underground 2 with the Free Roam,Map icons and options and stuff,and same as Midnight Club for the Customizations and the Car Styles.This game also Include Great Soundtracks while Racing againts the Opponents and you also can Make Wager deals too with your Opponents which technically i prefer doing that on Racers with the Slowest Cars.This game also Includes Sexy Girls you can meet and Impress in some Respect Races to get a Free Sexy Videos of them Dancing and shaking their Booties/Bodies in front of your Two Eyes!.(Hope you dont get a Boner from that).So anyway This Old Racing Game deserves a lot of Rating from me because its Really Great,I just bought it on a Hugh Sale they made on Steam and yeah i totally took the risks of buying that again.This game is Amazing and fun if you like Street Racing games and Sexy Hot Ladies.Rating:10/10			"

												Just like I remembered it.  The game has very arcadey gameplay and driving mechanics, rudimentary customization, and not a whole lot of car selection.  The Nissan Skyline is king, as was par for the course in early 00's street racing games.  For me though, the two big draws were nostalgia and the model videos.  There's no DLC or other user generated content, which honestly bummed me out after finding this game reissued on Steam.  I'm glad I spent the few bucks on one of the seasonal sales, but I don't think I could justify full price.			"

												Just gonna make a pre-review as I haven't yet finished the game to have a full overview of what the game has to offer, but just wanna make a note here before I forget about it: This game apparently crashes on launch if you have ONE monitor in portrait mode for some reason. Also this game has partial Optimus support, so with my laptop, I am still able to force it to use the GTX 980M card to run it rather than the integrated HD 4000 from Intel......but even with integrated, it still runs relatively smooth, though it won't be consistent 60 fps which I believe this game is v-sync'd to as my laptop's display only up to 60Hz FHD....Also multiplayer is dead because the service for this is down....so no vs. racing unfortunately...I will leave this as a thumbs up until further notice, as I like the game enough to warrant said thumbs up. I'll come back to this review later once I finish the entire game.====================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M(376.33 - WHQL), 128GB and 1TB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display			"

												As an user that has bought this game for 90% discount recently this year, and that finished the game legitimately, and soon onwards to 100% rating, I can safety say, this game is possible to beat, but it almost cockblocks you at the end, just saying. Most of us bought this back in the day including me, for the PS2. the PC re-release is both good and bad for a few reasons. It's good because more people will get this mediocre gem once more, bad because, GameSpy servers are, well, very much dead. However, you can still have LAN Parties, or if you cannot be arsed, use Evolve to play with other people, friends mostly.SRS is your usual cheesing street racing racing game, with not much story. You start out driving Ken's Skyline, only to get your cut and start off the game with a new car and race crews. But something people didn't care so much including me, were the girlfriends, they don't add much to the game, and a few of them challenges, can be pretty harsh.But the way of progression is most definitely odd and ineresting. You don't just race for the ANTE or wagers. No points here like championships, but you gotta earn RESPECT points. That's right, if you have no respect, you don't own the streets, and no one will respect ya! You do that by doing, crazy tricks. Near misses, drifts, clean laps, sounds familiar right? Only that you'll be required to get respect points, if you wanna be with the big boys. And that's the kinda unfun part of the game, it gets to a point, you need to get good.The game also features the arcade mode, such as time trials, quick race, and two other main features of the game, for bonus cars, that are not just arcade mode - they...go towards the street mode of the game. Dope, isn't it? Either way...The physics and customization of this game aren't all that impressive, but you can actually flip cars, if you're risky enough. In freee roam, you also have to worry about cops, if they see you commiting illegal actions, and do hefty fines, that might hurt your financial doings at the garage or showroom. The soundtrack is okay and in other moments, cheesy enough to fit in with the game.Overall, if you have friends that are willing to play the game and try the lan mode for multiplayer, the full price while questionable, might be worth it. Or if you're here for the cards and to finish the game, get it dead cheap. Also for nostalgia, any price does it.			"

												Kind of like NFSU1 and 2, Street Racing Syndicate evokes feelings of the The Fast and the Furious, Car selection isn't bad but each car has only 1 choice of bodykit where the rest of the rims and spoilers are all ""universal"". Graphically the game still looks good and sure the cars don't sound the greatest but if you're nostalgic for a time where ""Rap and Roll"" and the over all Import Tuner scene of the late 90's and early 00's, Try it out! It's a decent racer after all. I do recommend doing the Iron Man challenges in arcade mode with the Skyline before starting the actual story, You'll unlock some sweet cars at the start and can sell them for a good sum of cash.

												Street Racing Syndicate is a street racing game. And that alone says somthing to me.As a racing fan most of my racing game's I would play were Gran Turismo and Forza.But sometime's  I would go out and play other racing game's like Burnout 3 (All time Favorite acrade racing game), and now this one aswell.Some people can complain or like that this looks like a rip off or clone of Need for Speed underground 2. With the fact that this is also a open world street racing game. But that was never on PC.So if your in the mood for Street racing, and can't find a copy of NFS Underground 2. This is the game for you. Pro - Open world- Car customization- Controller Support/Remapping- Great cars- Great soundtrack Con - Lack of stroy- Controlls Feel off putting at times			"

												So far it has been an amazing game, I only have one complaint and it isn't game breaking or ruining it too much for me.The menu music is ear bleedingly loud, but then you get into a race and can't hear anything except for a faint engine noise.No idea if it is just me or not, but that was my experience.Great game if you have a few spare dollars and love JDM cars.

												Played it a few years ago, while the NFSU hype was on. - Graphics are good.- Gameplay is arcade-ish, fun and addictive.- Not much customization compared to NFSU1/2. - Feels like a cheaper Most Wanted; but pretty decent overall. I'd recommend it if you like a good no-brain, night themed racing game, but 10$ sounds like a bit much to me. It has trading cards btw.			"

												Good game. Played it as a kid, was very fun to come back to. To those who enjoyed Underground 2, this is the closest any Steam game will ever get.Although I enjoyed my playthrough, keep note of these downsides:It's not very realistic - the handling is acrade-style. The fact that you can drop $28k on upgrades and get a 900+ hp Skyline that goes from 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds doesn't add much realism either.The progression is generally too fast, the game is beat in 5 to 6 hours. 1 hour into it I already had a 450 hp Impreza, which was heavily overpowered compared to other cars. In general, opponent's cars are way too slow in comparison and time trial events give way too much time, making the game very easy.The soundtrack is not big enough and same songs are heard over and over again. The city is also small and easily remmemberable even after 6 hours playtime.Even with those issues, the game is great to play through. Completely worth the 5 dollars I paid on release (50% off)Make sure to get a widescreen fix if you get this game - playing at 4:3 with black bars is not very enjoyable.			"

												Fun Playstation2-era racer!It has an open world with cops that will give chase if they see you speeding.  Unfortunately the police chases I've had so far have been pretty basic.  Turn a corner and they lose you.The real focus of the game are the races and they feel great.  If you like old-school Need For Speed you will like this.  Unlike Need for Speed, car repair costs money.  Pulling off perfect corner drifts, riding on two wheels or other tricks will replenish a portion of your nitro.  I don't know if car damage is merely superficial or if it effects how your car handles.  I've only played it for an hour so far.In addition to collecting cars you also collect ""girlfriends.""  Once you have won their affections by completing their challenge, you can choose to have them ride with you.  Unfortunately they do not speak to you as you ride.  Maybe she is just sitting there looking at her phone the whole time.  Women.  You can also unlock video clips of the girls dancing or whatever.  Very cheesy.  It doesn't let you stuff dollars in their clothing or anything.  This aspect of the game is unique but only half-cooked.Anyway, I got it on sale for $1 and it was well worth the price.  I would even recommend it at full price.  The racing feels great!			"

												It's actually a decent game, considering how old it is. The physics are weird ( but you get used to it ). There's limited car customization. I bought 3 cars, and each of them had one visual kit. It takes aproximately 6-8 hours to complete.Bought it for 0.99 euro, totally worth it. The funniest thing about this game... It's actually harder than Need for Speed 2015. HARDER!There's no story.It's open world (ish)Map is okay, but smallDecent amount of cars, but most of them are variations of the othersClunky physics, but alright for the time it was madeGame is somewhat hardFew tips. Make sure to change the amount of audio sources to 16+ because sometimes it buggs up if it's on the default 8.Check which tires you're buying, because some are for drifting and makes the racing extremely hard.Lower speed cornering is faster than fast drift cornering.Enjoy!

												Oh boy, this game brings so many memories. I remember when I got it in circa 2008 on a DVD with a computer magazine I used to love.I read the little ""review"" in the magazine and jumped on the game. Since I was a little girl still I was blown away by the game, honestly. All these shiny cars, so many posibilities how to tune up your car, I could even ""own"" girls. It was simply awesome for me. I could say that I played some solid 100 hours on it. I wanted 100% progress no matter what.And here I am after 7 years. I got it with a bundle for 0,99$. Bargain for a game I used to love so much. You know how sometimes people tell you to not expect much from things you used to love so much and you come back to them? Yeah, there is a good reason for that.When I first started the game after so long I already noticed that this game is pretty cringy. The music is simply horrible, let's be honest. I had to turn it off after some while and just play my own music over it. Only listenable track is ""Madhouse"". I mean, yeah I get it there wasn't much cash left for a decent music, but gosh, you could slap some better music over it that wasn't that bad. Nevermind!Also the gameplay is pretty easy. It isn't really hard to get on the top with a car you got as a starter. I am not trying to say you will finish the whole game with just Subaru Impreza but yeah, you will surive with that car untill you save for that Nissan Skyline loved by everyone (This game made me fall in love with that car even tho I know batshit about cars...). Anyways, the graphics are acceptable. Always could be better tho. I don't like comparing two completely different games but look at Half life 2 and graphics of this game! Nevermind, let's keep on rolling. Overall this game is still playable and I must admit I do enjoy it even after all these years but it isn't what it used to be. Even after this all it will still stay in my heart <3A review brought to you by Elle who doesn't even know how to ""review"" games. You're welcome! "

												Not a bad street racing game. Gameplay is solid, perhaps a notch ahead of what the NFS games from this era gave us. The handling model is a bit grippy but the car behaves well, paying for repairs or a new bottle of NOS are nice touches. Even though winning Arcade Mode, something doable if you're not uttery useless at driving, will give you a slightly overpowered car But overall, the game lacks in content. There are 50 unique cars, but the game has the Gran Turismo syndrome, which means you get 6 Eclipses, 6 Skylines, 6 Celicas, 5 Supras, 5 350Z, 4 Imprezas, 4 RX-7s, 3 Jettas, 2 RX-8s, 2 Golfs, 2 IS200s, 2 Evos, 2 MR-2s and a lonely AE86.  The races take place on 3 different maps (LA, Miami and Philadelphia) but not only are the maps tiny, you can only freeroam in LA. Not that you will want to do that, as the cops are always watching you (sometimes engaging pursuit as soon as you leave an event -- or when speeding), you will have to pay for repairs and there's no GPS to guide you to any event. Freeroaming is more annoying than engaging.""Girlfriends"", another selling point of game, are useless. Unless you enjoy heavily dithered low res pictures of not particularly good looking asian women, 240p videos of them dancing at really, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ songs and insultingly low quality models of them doing the start routine thing in street races. Instead of spending budget on paying the girls, paying artists to model them, paying photographs to take all the pictures and paying the music they dance to, the devs should have focused on more actual content. At least the challenges they give you are fun to play through.Which brings us on to graphics and audio. The game is old, and the graphics clearly show their age, but it's not too shocking. You get 2003-like shine on everything, bad sun sprites blocking the view and blank interiors but it's holding up rather nicely. Apart from the character models. They aged like milk. Engines sound like drones, the rolling sound from the tires is a bit too pronounced (unless that was the sound from the engine, I can't really tell) and the music is really, really bad. ""I muted it in less than 5 minutes"" levels of bad.			"

It's one of those videogames where you thought, from your childhood, that customizing your car to the next level was the big car and street-racing scene. Kind of like playing some of those old but fun racing games like Juiced, Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift, Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, Auto Modellista and Need For Speed: Underground and Underground 2.If you ever played any of those videogames above, then this game is definitely for you.

												One of the most fun racing games to come out of the early 2000s. Good physics (usually). Driving is rewarding. Its just a fun experience! It doesnt take itself too seriously and thats what made so many of these old games great. They were just ridiculous! Mad bodykits and neon lights everywhere! Truly a time capsule of a game.Car selection is a bit limited, not that much difference between car trims to justify prices in the dealership (just like real life). Options in tuning seem a bit pointless because the variety doesnt really matter. HKS and Greddy turbos have no real difference in performance. Tires do effect how the car handles in different conditions which is a nice plus but its a pain to have to pay for new tires every time you want to switch. Some cars have oddly low top speeds making them fairly useless pretty quick. The girlfriends mechanic is laughable in every regard and really appeals to the lowest common denominator of heterosexual human male. Really not that bad of negatives. If you want to live your 12 year old fast n furious fantasies all over again look no further.			"

												Pretty much the only reason to play this game is a nostalgia trip. Ten years ago it was rather entertaining; nowadays, its outclassed way too hard by the newer releases. If you're here to relieve your memories (like i was when I purchased it on Steam for a mere buck during sale), then you have already made up your mind - Steam release is stable and works fine, so go ahead. But if you're a person just looking for a good racing game, I won't recommend it to you.SRS feels like a cheap knock-off of NFS, game is really short, cars don't feel fast at all, and there aren't a lot of them (like six variants of Skyline, game's mascot, which are all essentially the same vehicle). One dubious feature is picking up ""girlfriends"" by winning them over with your impressive driving skills - if you then take them to actual races and beat your opponents, you will be rewarded with a video of the girl dancing (in a terrible resolution). Also, soundtrack is lacking, songs are forgettable and there's not a lot of them. All and all, for one dollar it's an okay game to pick up try for an evening, I guess, but save your money if it's not on sale.			"

												Good game. Reminds me of the Illegal street ricing games of yore, mostly because it IS one of those games. Be warned though, the PC port is jankey, and you will need to do wierd stuff to get widescreen to work. Also the in game music is HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. ""Ok, so it's not exactly Halo/GTA IV/NMRIH/Hotline Miami/Sonic levels of quality, so what?"". Well, if you like 10 C-list gangsta rap songs from 13 years ago, then by all means leave your speakers on and enjoy the music. I ran for the music volume in the menu as fast as a I could. Just consider this a ""bring your own music"" game. I recomend Kavinsky, Boards of Canada, Mitch Murder, Aphex Twin, Lazerhawk, Carpenter Brut, M-O-O-N, Perturbator... umm, you get the idea. New Retro Wave Hipster music. NOT THE IN GAME MUSIC. Anyway, what the heck are you doing in this game anyway? Rather simple, You start out in typical fashion winning a bunch of money in a  random race in somone elses car, then you have $30,000 to spend on a car. Bet your money and win more stuff. Win and repeat or lose and die. The end. And earn worthless rep. Oh, and the police in this game are derps. GOTTA GO FAAAAAAST

												For a 2005 pc racing game, I must say that the game looks great. But sadly the game had not aged too well in my opinion and is not worth the ten dollar price tag. The game is often compaired to NFS and sadly I just don't see it. NFS: Underground, which game out around the same time, has aged quite well and is still a blast to play today. It's okay if you have a nostolgic factor with the game, but new players to the game will likely bore of it.Pros:+Looks great for a 2005 PC game.+Has an interesting-ish hub world. +Cutsceens are the best comedy ever.Cons:-Controlls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ -Horrible menu navigation. -AI are either too stupid or too MLG. -The game in general has not aged well. With this being said, I cannot fully and wholeheartly recommend this game. If it seems like a game you would like, I recommend getting this game while it's on sale.			"

Quite honestly I was surprised to see I could get 1280x960 to work, even if a little stretched on my 2560x1440 display, Gamepad works pretty decently too. The graphics arent great, but I am pretty sure they are improved on, the lighting, wet pavement, smoke etc aren't too bad, adds a bit to the game. The game itself runs flawlessly.

 PS: Very good old clássic from the time of NFSU 1&2. It has some sounds issues on some systems and also there is no official 1080p res support. Regardless of that, if you like customization, some good tracks here and there, and the trill of speed and street racing at night (there are some zones on daylight too), this games is four you. Oh, and the girls thing is just and extra no big biggie, the focus of the game it's sill tunning and pimping your ride. I recommend getting it on Sale.			"

												I came back for Angelica Bridges.I came...I came...That aside, SRS Syndicate was a worthy challanger of Underground 2 when that was ""The"" racing game for a generation. Visuals are still enjoyable even after a decade passed (you'll need a cfg for HD resolution support through, from widescreengaming), and while definitly not anywhere close to today's standards, it's still looks really enjoyable, supported by an excellent soundtrack and challanging racing where a mistake usually costs you the whole race later on - the gameplay itself is of course arcade in general, and a really good one. But okay who am I kidding, we all know why everyone liked SRS: Syndicate, don't we?Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be back unlocking more Angelica Bridges videos. That red dress with blue eyes and that smile is mesmerizing.edit: damn, she has only one video. Now I feel like swiching to not recommended.TL,DRCars, Boobs, Badass OST, cheap, can now be considered ""retro"" as one of the ""good old ones"" but still look decent, great arcade racing and good visual customization from those times where if you did not have neon lights under your car, that wasn't a car at all.

Some words first : This was the game of my childhood and the first video game I have ever played so this is from where I've started gaming.Worths the price?Yes, I received it for free anyways.Date I started playing it since : Somewhen in 2007. ( non-DRM )Time played : 4 hours on Steam and over 50 hours on non-Steam version.Score given : 9.5 out of 10.Pros :- Decent graphics for its time.- Only awesome cars used in game from that times.- Multiple game modes.- Good controls.- Total tunning can be done to cars.- Has Steam drops.Neutral :- No Achievements.- Police tracking system is very cheap.- Could have been added other brands like BMW, Audi Alfa Romeo and so many still. Great cars made by these in that time tho.Cons: - No widescreen / high resolution support.- Multiplayer has shut down.			"

												simple kids. do you want an arcade racer somewhere between NFSU1 and 2? this is your game.do you want anything else? Move along citizen....this is just that in a nutshell. its basically NFS Underground 1.5 the graphics are dated but not bad. gameplay physics are dated but not unmasterable or too wildly unpredictablecontroller support is basic but functional for most controllers ( i use a FCS joystick and even that works fine)there isnt a huge selection of cars but there is more then a handful. many models are the same except visuals. the voice acting for the ""girlfriends"" in the game is by far the worst thing in the game. apprently SEGA thought "" not enough teenage boys will buy a game about illgal street racing unless we put badly voiced girls in it with g rated porn videos to watch""  theyd have been better off making more cars and a larger map.all in all if its in the cheap bin or the current price is what you call pocket change AND your nnostolgic for the old NFS underground games. heres a fix to amuse you for a bit..i give this game 7.5 of ten for nostalgia buffs and 5.5 out of 10 for just folks looking for an arcade racer ( mostly because its an old game and looks and feels it)			"

												It's a good street racing game . If you want stuff with local multi-player action, get it . You can go split screen or LAN . The presets for an Xbox 360 controller are a bit goofy, but you can change those . (You'll have to use controller 1 to set up controller 2 in that goofy menu) . Take some personal time with this game to tweek out the goofyness before you bring your laptop over to your buddy's place . I noticed that on the split screen, you can only hear the enjine and tires of car #1, unless car #2 is rather close . Both cars also have to finish a split screen race to end the program . But on the over all, I am Rockin' Hip Hop happy with the action of this game . (Or is it I ""be"" Rockin' Hip Hop happy ?) .			"

												It's actually the only game I paid for, but was available for free in giveaway later.I think I enjoy most of racing games and I had some fun with that, although didn't force myself to complete the game.Game comes from 2004, which makes graphics dated. Kind of a lot. But at least it runs smooth 60 fps.I have very mixed feelings towards this game - some cards handling is so bad... But have girls-videos ;)Stupid unlocking way... some respect system I don't like. A bit not convienient controls.But it's okey overall, if you can get it on huge sale.			"

												It's honestly a great game and I had a blast playing it, I mean I got it for free so why not? Is it worth the $10 USD price tag?! HELL NO but is it worth picking up on sale or even for free? ♥♥♥♥ING YES! I'll be honest something everyone seems to miss which is totally a game breaker is the ♥♥♥♥ing resolution there is no working fix to find... unless you're happy with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolutions that can't even go passed 1280 x 720p then have fun but if you can't then stay away stay far far far away because you will be sad after getting a taste of the game.There is plenty of things right with this game number one thing being is well it's a 2005 era midnight racing game... WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ DOESN'T LIKE THAT! Choc full of tuners and ricer cars... mhm a ricers wet dream! You name a car from those years it's mostly likely in here... RX7, R34, 350Z, WRX (Bug Eye), Eclipse etc. It's corny as♥♥♥♥♥♥in a good way, it has free roam with cop chases and all... I mean the cops actually chase you if you speed passed them! Modifications to cars is great while not as awesome as Need for Speed Underground 1 & 2, it is indeed still awesome it's more in line with the Juiced car racing series than anything else. Full engine tuning, NOS, neons, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vinyls, decals and paint... enough to get a ricer horny. THE GAME IS FULL OF ♥♥♥♥ING PORNSTARS OR SOMESHIT... whether or not you like that♥♥♥♥♥♥is up to you and the music is mostly good but sometimes a hit or miss!I get it it's a 2005 game I gotta except dumb ♥♥♥♥ing problems but seriously come on I wasn't excepting to put up with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor resolutions... theses resolutions make my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ look better. If you are gonna re release a game at least try to up rez things I don't care if the ui/hud is stretched at least I can look at the game properly. OH and instead of adding more ♥♥♥♥ing cars they decided it's a great idea to have 4 versions or the same damn car LIKE WHY... WHY IS THAT A THING? There are ♥♥♥♥ing mod shops for a reason... poor excuse to say it has more ""content"" then it really does.Honestly it's a damn great game and it's fun but I simply cannot recommend it because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor resolutions... unless you can put up with it. I seriously do not recommend it... but for free I can let it slide, I mean hell for that grab a stick and poke it give it a shot but seriously anything over $1 USD just stay the ♥♥♥♥ away!Edit: I ended up fixing the resolution problems and got a steering wheel working and wrote a guide on it... and it's great awesome fun but this game is only worth it on sale anything more than $1 USD is not worth buying. It's not worth the time to fix plus it's very old and for that I'll leave the review as not recommended because its simply not worth full price but for a cheap price it's great fun!			"

												I am sincerely disappointed about this game. It's not a bad game really, especially if it's in your childhood memories from a decade ago. I never owned this game on PS2, but I have played it a couple of times when I was a kid. Yesterday I got a key from Indiegala, and it was worth it, since I didn't have to pay for it. But would I pay for it? Not really. Yes, there is the nostalgic feeling, there is the customisation, but the physics are utter garbage! The way that the cars corner is terrible, They understeer as if they had bicycle wheens installed on the front. At least that was the case with my starter car (Subaru ""Bugeye"" Impreza RS) On the racing series in the storm drain, there were parts of the track where I couldn't see a bloody thing because the sun was blocking my vision and the other drivers passed me every time, and since I couldn't restart the race, losing was the only option, apart from shutting the game down in Task Manager.So, what I have to say about this game is, is it fun? Yes. Does it make you want to play it for some time and progress within the game? Yes. Is it worth the money? Only with discounts or like me, you got it for free in a giveaway.			"

												Ignite was a fairly terrible racing game, with terrible controls, terrible support, and overall terrible terribleness.  I would recommend Ignite over this garbage. No wonder it got mediocre reviews back in the day.-FR cars are too common, and they spin out very easily. Sometimes just turning.-Every single race is a 3 race series instead. Not only do you need to pay cash, you also need to have impressed enough people to get in. 2 forms of currency to race in a racing game. And not enough ways to earn Respect Points.-The final series is locked behind a grand total of 77,000 Respect Points. That's nearly every series done perfectly. 250 points sounds easy, especially when you max out a Skyline... But consider the following: Every single race except for ""Nitro Xtreme"" will only get you to about 75,000 points. With all 18 girlfriends unlocked, too. This means to unlock the final series, you need to have completed the previous 6 races almost flawlessly. Which is damn near impossible.2/10. Tops. And I'm being generous. What a ♥♥♥♥ing waste of my time.			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												As any review that has credibility, I'll point out the pros(+)/cons(-) of this game for the sake of impartiality so it's up to you decide if it's worth. In my view, the pros are greater that the cons, so that's why this is comming with a thumbs up.In summary, SRS is a 2004 race game (this steam version was released in 2005) that features an underground import racing scene, on which the player's main objective is to gain respect on the streets and affection of various females in the city.+ This game has a killer idea of gameplay, in which you have 3 types of racing: 1. Crew Meets, 2. Street Challenges and 3. Random Encounter. In Crew Meets, you have 3 pre-requisites to meet in order to enter a racing series: Respect Amount, Ante Cash (to build the final prize) and the car horsepower. When these are attended, you may enter the series of 3 races. Before each one of these races, you decide whether to place or not a reserved bet on a specific racer to boost your money earnings. These bets are per race and not related to the total prize made by the ante cash of the 4 racers. The others two types are similar and simpler. To compete in them, you need the cash the rival is willing to bet. The higher his car specs are compared to yours, higher is the amount of cash required to race (for instance, if its a skyline versus a skyline, the bet is x thousand, but if it's a skyline versus a celica, the wager would go up to 3x thousand). The difference between 2 and 3 race types is in the way you trigger them. While 2 is in a specific spot within the map, 3 is triggered when you eventually find a racer in free roam and you flash your headlights at the rear of his car. The customization options require effort in tunning because all can be bought and installed in your car since the very beggining; you only need the cash to get it. But that is not probably the best idea bacause equipping your car with all that can be purchased may overpower the car, rendering it uncontrolable, easy to crash and slower than the competition as it burns tires for a quarter mile at the slightest touch on the throttle. A balanced car is needed to raise the win rate and finding the thereshold for power/control in each car is different and very rewarding for those who like motorsports (as myself). ""But where is the killer part in the gameplay until now?"" ""All this I have seen in other racing games blabla..."" Now just imagine all this I have said with these aspects: SRS features a car damage model that forces the player to drive carefully. Heavy damage impacts car performance and heavy repairs cost money to the player. Depending on the price of the car and the amount of destruction, fixing the ride will drain the most (if not all or even more than) of the earnings from their last race. All of this with no restart feature! That's right people NO RESTART! If you lose a race, you will lose the money and your girlfriend - if you had any riding with you - and that is genious. Weaklings don't survive on this hardcore simulation of life game, and I say that because in life you have only 1 shot at pretty much everything, and this games does just that, and it does beautifully, unlike any other from any other genre.- For the weak spots, I will state the lack of polish and a deeper care for the excellent idea the game promotes. The game has a fair amount of cars and customization options (given the limitations of the platforms originally intended to run this game) but the carrer mode is very short and generic. There are only a handful of short cutscenes to give the player a feedback on the overall progress and the story itself is a little out of place. The driving feels different for each car as they have different wheel drive configurations, weight and engineering, but that isn't very convincing in this game. The physics lack trimming to convince the player the car is actually going through the surface, the graphics are dated and the city plays static and dead. In some regions is always night time and in others always day, the police A.I. is abnormally retard and you can count in your fingers the people found on the streets and sidewalks on the hole district.With these comments stated, I finish this review giving a score of 8.5/10 to this game. I know the game looks dull, unfinshed and unpolished, but my score is this high because of the concepts this game offers. The removal of the restart feature makes you enjoy and live trough every corner of the game, and crashing makes you rage just like if you did in a real car. You know it can't be undone and it's going to cost a lot. With 14 hours of gameplay on this steam version and hundreds more in the XBOX version, I can safely assure you, seen that I have experienced countless other racing games from before and after SRS time, that this game is the best at it's genre, and I strongly recommend it to virtual racing and car tuning lovers just like myself.

												Feels pretty dated, and is very cheesy sometimes. It offers an underwhelming amount of customization, but the amount there is good. Graphics are also acceptable. All in all its like a weird version of Need For Speed Underground, but its no alternative. Reccomended if on sale. Only if its on sale.			"

												Originally picked this up on GameCube when i was about 12 because i heard it had títties in it. CUBE magazine made out it was crass as grass, where you could bet pink slips and pink slits in races (you can't). When the videos turned out to be grainy lapdances, the game got thrown to the side, and with it coming out around the time NFS:Most Wanted did, everyone else did the exact same thing.Having given it a proper chance...it's good. There's a great physics engine and some good damage models (which the NFS games didn't have), there's a bit of freedom in that you can drive around the city freely, and most important of all: the AI isn't the rubber band type. There's some minor issues, but they don't stop the game being fun. For a start, there's no real body swapping: cars have just a single pre-made bodykit. There's a bit of other customisation, and a bunch of weeb decals, but there's no swapping out body parts like in NFS. On top of that, plenty of parts don't tell you what they actually do, so good luck figuring things out for yourself.Only other issue is that there's about 8 models for each car, but only about 12 actual cars in total. Who the ♥♥♥♥ is gonna buy a slow, cheapo 350z, when for just a grand more they can buy the speedy touring version?			"

												No. Courses are super boring. No waypoints show up when you pull up map. No easy way to find garage or see where any certain challenges are. Doesn't show/tell you what most of the upgrades you do will do to your car. Doesn't explain respect besides being entry for newer races which seems kind of grindy and not very needed. Also limited controller support and many times while clicking on options with mouse it would not work, such as one time when I clicked ""no"" to race with mouse and it clicked yes for me. Remapping works for some gamepad controllers but not others. Midnight club and NFS underground both more worthwhile. Unless you desperately need a fake videogame girlfriend....this game has those.

												Racing game with extremely simple mechanics and repetitive tracks. At some point you need to grind money to upgrade cars in order to participate and win later tier races at which point the game is not fun anymore. In order to make it easier to get into the game, some tips:The hotkey ""M"" opens up the map from which you can quicktravel to all locations.In Crew races, you can earn 1000 respect points on each track for a Perfect score. Since finishing 1st rewards you 750 points, you only need 250 points on each track. Points do nothing to unlock cars.Nitro is a limited use upgrade; it does not reset with each new race and is hence usually a waste of money. "

												I find it funny. Some people actually call fzero hard to play......this is waaaay worse. The controls are stiff with a keyboard, ai cars are super controlled no matter how fast they go yet if you go to a certain speed you spin out constantly. avoid rear wheel drive cars, they spin out anywhere from 50mph and above. oh and it does not matter how many meets you beat, if your respect is high, street challenges get severely high even if your car is not up for it. In other words another winner from the ps2 with bad controls and a crap setting.....the sound track is like 4 wierdly censored songs. Oh and if you think there is a good variety of vehicles you are dead wrong. most of the ""other"" cars are merely the same damn car with a different kit. Finally I said that rear wheel drive cars spin out too easy? well 90 percent of the cars in the game ARE rear wheel drive cars. and they all happen to be the fastest cars......so unless you can manage driving a fish tail you're screwed.

												I played the retail version of this, so don't be fooled by the ""0 hours played"".This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, sure, if you get it for free here like me, may be worth.. nop, not even then, how do I put this? This is pretty much a clon of Need For Speed Underground except the gameplay it's completely broken compared to the EA game, maybe if you enjoy generic arcades like early Burnout titles or Juice or Outrun, you can find it acceptable, for me the physics just feel wrong, there is practically no challengue, and yes, to a degree physics DO matter in arcade racing games, I'm not too fond of simulators, but I like arcade games that give me some thrill, this gives me none.If you never played NFS Underground 1 or 2, go play them instead of this, and if you did play them, play them again instead of this, no those are not on Steam but you can get a retail copy, much better investment, you have been warned.tl;dr: This game sucks, play NFS Underground instead.

												I wanted to like this game. I got it for 3 reasons. 1. I loved NFS Underground 2 and thought this might be similar. 2.  I want to recreate the anime Initial D, cos this game has a Trueno.3. The girls are hot.My reasons for getting this game might be silly, but its hard for me not to judge it based of merit alone cos i don't play racing games. So heres whats good about it.It takes place at night. Which is awesome. The world is not bad. The racing is decent. The Gf system might be cheesy, but it is nice. Thats ir.What i hate the most about this game are the mechanics that have nothing to do with racing. You cannot quit a race without loosing. If you loose you  cannot restart the match. Most races require an entry fee and you can run out of cash if you have to quit a number of races. No money no real races. Also money is used to fix your car, which gets damaged fast. Damage CANNOT be turned off. The story is also lame for the most part. The music is annoying. Also there is no sense of proper progression which can be argued on whether thats a good thing or not. Also without a test track and just a ton of money, you will end up buyying upgrades you may not have needed. How hard was it really to put a practice track in this game. Seriously, after the first race, you buy your fist car, and upgrade it to start actually playing. So if you are a racing game enthusiast, you might like this. If you are casual, the girls really aren't enough to keep you playing this game, even though they are really attractive.Note - If you are visually impared, you can try this, but cos of the open world nature its really easy to go of the course completey, seeing as how nothing is really walled off. Because it takes place at night it is easier to see the turns, but it really depends on the speed at which your eyes proccess whats going on. Also the motion blur and bloom effects are horrible and distort your vision badly rather than enhance the asthetics. If you are looking for a simple fun racer just go with NFS underground 2. Also the resolution is pretty old school so text is at least easier to read.			"

												0/10  WORST DIFFICULTY SPIKE IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY the game started out fun enough. street races.upgrade and customize cars and win races. the game's story is defeating crews in 3 race tournaments.  so there i am beating races,upgrading my car and trying to finish the game. as long as you buy a fast car most of the game will be easy and fun.MOST. i get to the final crew race with a fully upgraded nissan skyline (fastest and most expensive car in the game). the entire game you play in straight forward tracks that condition you to believing that as long as you have a fast car,your good. the final races take place in a mountain area track that goes uphill and downhill with more curves than a playboy magazine. i get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. okay so the whole game i think its about speed but now suddenly its about control? (also this game has horrible physics so it makes even less sense). ""alright,ill buy a new car designed for these kinds of tracks"". i buy the most expensive rally car in the game,a impreza then fully upgrade it. this car is over 700 hp no way i can lose. car was impossible to control and constantly spun out like it was a FR in the snow.♥♥♥♥♥was handed to me again. okay maybe speed isnt the answer. buy a celica which isnt known for speed but has the best handling out of any othe car.fully uprade. lets try this again. now i can keep control but i cant keep up.rage quit.

												It's basically liked Juiced and NFS underground but with a heck of alot less customization, licensed but extremely limited. If you're wondering  Pretty poor car selection too. You've got different variants of the same car but bottom line is, it's still the same car.Controls are pretty crap. Manual transmission is utter rubbish, it doesn't seem to shift when you want it to. It does up fine, but ask it to shift down and it takes it's own sweet time when if finally decides to accept the command. You also can't change controls in the middle of a race or event, you can change it but the game doesn't register the change. Physics is sorta a mix of Juiced and NFS. It can be tricky at times but is generally easy to use and learn.Gameplay experience is largely ruined by the crap sounds. It seems that the game cannot overlay the sounds properly and just chooses one to play together with the BGM. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you absoloutely had to buy a racing game to play with the keyboard.			"

												I thought, because of the mainly positive reviews that this would be an enjoyable arcade racing game. I expected too much. It just feels, in my opinion, slow and clunky and there are no options to adjust and fix that (because it is a console port). This review probably won't help anyone in their descision whether or not to buy, but I doubt most people really care about the gameplay. Be honest, it was the barely-clothed woman that caught your eye. Well sorry to burst your bubble, but as you would expect, there is no nudity and some of the models seem really awkward as if they've just been picked off the street and payed to dance. So to sum up, even when Namco use the earliest trick in the marketing book (displaying young, attractive half naked women), it still doesn't wor.....k... oh wait.. I bought it....damn!			"

												Street Racing Syndicate. The logo of the game looks really cool. Unfortunately the coolness of this game ends there. I didn't play much of the game, because I couldn't torture myself for so long. The game is filled with awfulness. First thing that ruined the gaming mood was the music. Devs couldn't afford to buy a better music I guess. If somebody would listen to any of the SRS's soundtrack in real life would mean they have absolutely zero music taste. In 30 minutes of game play I heard 1 song about 4 times. Does that mean there's only 5 songs in the game?The other thing is one of the maps was in the water channel. What could possible go wrong? Why are the plastic protective barriers there? Does it mean that it was specifically build not for the water but for cars? And who the hell would put a big TV screen there for nobody to see? Maps and the environment were not thought through properly. The developers went further and actually decided not to check for any reference of car crashes. Ugly as hell damage to cars makes you vomit. If it was so bloody ugly why would they even implement it, because I couldn't see if it was even affecting controls. I was looking at the car, and I am kinda fine with the whole squareness of it. But the triangle wheel arch just put me off so much. Unrealistic glass shader. I actually doubt it has one, as I think all the models were just painted. In the world, there's one light that is coming from underneath the surface and casting a shadow of you car on other objects. That's just... Other lights are baked and don't cast any shadows at all. And worst of all – the Sun. Its so huge and bright that it blinds you. As long as your camera is looking at the direction of the sun you are done for. Of course it makes zero difference for AI.I don't know who thinks that the woman in this game are hot. I find the really... old? One of them looks like my mates mother. That is not to mention that in 2004 the fashion wasn't so ugly. They look like they are straight from 90s. And why are they so skinny? Why cant this game follow NFSU2 and get a good looking porn star? I am sure its not that expensive to do one photo shoot. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. Just spend money on any other old or new racing game.			"

												Can't get it to work without crashing when loading races on Windows 8.1 64 bit.

												The game is hideously creepy.. you have to drive like a moron to impress the girls that hang around alone on car parks in the dark. If you do, they will become your possessions to keep forever.. your 'girlfriends'. Keep the girls in your girlfriend inventory (think of it as your own creepy dungeon) and you can go and visit them for a lap dance (in videos performed by real 'actresses') at any time!Just incase you forget, there are scantily clad girls draped across just about every menu screen to remind you that this game was designed by idiots.Quite fun racing, but the theme and creepiness of it all drag it right down.

												From dancing crack ♥♥♥♥♥s to shout outs to ""my man, Vince Vaughan,"" this is the racing game that has everything. By everything I mean the only play value it has to me is driving the 86 on Mulholland dr in multiplier mode.  There is a glitch that causes P2 to go slower than P1 and P2 is in silent mode.  This makes my Pwnership from the P2 slot all the more glorious.  I love this game and the fact that it still has replay value for me today after ten years is testament to it's core quality.  Bearing in mind I got this on sale at $2.50.  I strangely still have the old disc I used to play this from although the system is long gone..... not so strange.  This game is awesome! I'd only pay ten bucks if I had money to burn though.			"

												Just picked this up on sale today, and have been having a blast with it so far.It reminds me of Metropolis Street Racer for Dreamcast, with the in race points given or deducted based on your driving.The open world aspect is cool too, doing races as you cruise around, going to mod shops, or entering race series.Soundtrack felt a little dated, but hey, its from ten years ago, so go figure.  I just turned it down after hearing the same handul of songs repeat a couple times.Xbox360 controller support works great.  I mapped my buttons similar to that of GTAV, so I was up and winning races without having to learn a new control scheme.Not too shabby for the price of a candy bar!			"

												Loved this game back on my Gamecube. Always wanted to play it on something using my wheel. But the issue with that is  there is quite a dead zone when using a wheel and no options to change it. You have to turn the wheel about 15 degrees  before something happens and this game requires fancy driving tricks to advance that the dead zone can interfere with.Other than that. It's still a  decent quality game for lower end PC's. Just someday like to see it expanded upon.			"

												Pretty decent game, if you want a cheap racing game with no story, then this is the game for you, I sometimes get bored of the game due to having no story whatsoever, the first 10 miniutes of the game has this cutscene where you must race for something something important, then you're left on your own. The ""girlfriends"" in this game are hot, but make me cringe the way they talk, in fact, all the characters in this game talk in a cheesy manner, making me cringe. There are bugs in this game that I found quite crappy, at one point in the game, every time you leave the garage, the game immedietly crashes. The game does save, but this happens very frequently, which pisses me off. The driver's in this game are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, crashing you and making yo get that feeling that you want to tear their ♥♥♥♥ing car apart. The point is, this game is basic, dull, and only entertaining the way you play it, I'm quite impressed that this game wasn't that bad, due to the publisher being the ones who made Ride To Hell Retrobution, which is quite the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game of steam. This game was a classic to the Gamecube to me, so if you played it before, it's a good game to play on the PC. But if this is your first time buying it, this game came out 2005 and your going to be running into some bugs. Anyways, it's an okay game.			"

												This game deserves a good review because it's fun and it's one of the only fun street racers I know that are available on steam.The driving physics are daunting because the drifting is easy to pull off, the cars don't go all over the place when they hit a wall, and they don't slow down that much when they turn too much.The cities are beautiful. unlike most street racers, the cities have more color and light to them compared to Need For Speed (2015). That game was not enjoyable at all.If you want a quick bang for your buck and wanna race in a scenic, fun, and playable street racer, this game is worth buying. I highly recomend you buy this game and try it for yourself.			"

												This was one of my favorite original Xbox games, released during the street racing craze (2004 or so). It's a relatively realistic racing game - very forgiving, but you do have to brake for turns - and features mostly a sandbox style play. You get a car, you drive around LA and do several types of races, from organized street races, to pick-up races against roaming cars. In most cases, you bet money, it doesn't come out of nowhere like in a lot of games, except the prizes at sanctioned races.As a side thing, you can do challenges to pick up girls. It's a bit silly, but it provides an extra interesting touch. You can pick one to ride with you and they will be the starter for street races. The car modding is also fairly realistic, but somewhat limited. It's not Gran Turismo with 100s of options, basically a few for each part of the engine.  And the car selection is also relatively limited to imports (mostly Japan, but also VW for some reason)To a certain extent, you make your own challenge, it's very easy to soup up your first car and completley annihilate 90% of the competition. As an older game, it has some technical quirks. It doesn't run at a high resolution (though there are hacked exes that will do this, the rear view mirror ends up being in the wrong place). It's somewhat finicky, it takes about 2 minutes for it to start after hitting run...just nothing, then eventually it pops up. The interface was designed for a controller, so is a bit quirky. Probably not worth $10, but it goes on sale frequently for 99 cents and is easily worth that.			"

												Street Racing Syndicate is a racing game developed in 2005. That being said, even with the dated graphics and sound, this game was a nostalgic throwback to my childhood. Being one of the first racing games I had ever played, along with Need for Speed Underground 2, this game deserves a place in my heart.Pros:-Responsive controls-Nice blast of the past-Vehicles are customisable-Will run smoothly on most PC's of todayCons:-Graphics and sound is datedOverall, this game gives me a bit of nostalgia everytime I open it up. Worth a look if you are a fan of the genre and don't mind dated graphics and resolutions.8/10			"

												It's er...it's ok I guess but it kinda sucks not really-ish?PROS+The upgrades are really cool. Rather than being laid out as ""ENGINE UPGRADE 2 IS AVAILIBLE AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ENGINE UPGRADE 1 SO IT'S OBJECTIVELY BETTER"" you're presented with real, individual parts from real companies, and they all affect how your car runs. One company's suspension might be more expensive, but is the extra $500 actually worth it? The game makes you feel like you're actually buying real parts for a real car, rather than mindlessly clicking [UPGRADE HANDLING] or whatever. It's nice.+You have to spend money on damage repairs and tanks of nitrous. At first I thought I would hate this game mechanic, but I actually like it. You end up driving your car like you actually care for it, rather than ramming other drivers and pinballing off walls. Nitro isn't just there for you to go faster whenever you want, it's a valuable resource to get you out of bad situations when you need it most. This, combined with the upgrade system, makes you treat your car as though you really own it. It's super fukken kewl.+The car list is a ricer's dream. This is one of the only street racing games I've seen that offers different versions of the same car. Other games offer you a Mitsubishi Eclipse, and that's that...but this game lets you choose the base Eclipse, the RS, the GT, etc. Again, combine this with the previous points; you really feel like you own your car. It's truly a special thing.CONS-The handling is♥♥♥♥♥oh my sweet lord. ""Do you like games where your car has weight to it and doesn't act like somebody's origami art blowing around in the wind? Well FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU!"" -Namco 2004Go find your nearest Hotwheels toy car. Make engine sounds with your mouth and pretend to make 90-degree turns at 100mph. That's exactly what this game feels like.-The sense of speed is also♥♥♥♥♥ oh my sweet merciful lord. One of the things that an arcade racer should excel at is a blistering sense of speed. 150mph in this game feels like 60mph in any other arcade racer. Captain Falcon is laughing at you.-The customization is really sad. If you're mainly into just tinkering under the hood, you can have fun with this game. If you like tricking your car out, move on. The customization options are abysmal. A handful of washed out colors, very few body parts, and sparse vinyls. You can make your car look kinda cool, but it's not going to be unique at all.-Various other little things. The menu music just switches back and forth between two songs: one song where a young gentleman repeatedly ckecks to see if his microphone is working and then proceeds to have a conversation with himself about slowing down, and another song where some other fine young man asks you to contemplate the psychological horrors that accompany one getting their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/i> incarcerated. I'm totally serious. What the hell. The world seems like a total ghost town, the sound design is super weak, the sun in the water canal area is like a constant flashbang, and the game just has an overall cheap vibe to it.tl;dr Parts of it are really interesting and unique while other parts suck gorilla balls. The default price of $9.99 is too much in my opinion, but when it goes on sale it's super cheap ($0.99). If you're really open to trying something different and you want a street racer that's not Need For Speed, give this game a try. But be prepared to take the good with the bad.			"

												This game is fun to play if you are are fan of open world street racing games such as NFSU2. The customization is great as it very detalied i.e the type of gearbox, tyres, ECU etc. Majority of the list of cars are Japanese sports cars but theres also several American muscle cars. The map includes 3 different cities which provide 3 different environments. The handling is not too bad for keyboard but the parts that you add to you car can have an impact on the way your vehicle handles. The graphics dont look that great but thats only because its a 2005 game. The resolution can be changed by using mods online. I had a lot of fun playing this game and I would reccomend that you purchase it but only when theres a steam sale as the price drop down to 1 dollar.			"

												- If you can dig the music you can probably dig this game more easily. Unfortunately I can't, and neither do I like the whole streetwise ghetto and scantly clad babes theme going on. It's pretty shallow, and just not my style yo.- The controls and menu interface are kinda clunky, ugly and don't feel all that right. It's not gamebreaking, but a nuisance nevertheless. The controls in game can be customized, but not for navigating the menu, which is kinda strange.+ But ignore all that and there seems to be a pretty fun and solid arcadey racing game underneath with very decent graphics and most importantly: smooth and fluid gameplay.+ I also like that they choose for a GTA style of open world where you can drive and pick missions from. I need to check that out some more.My recommendation after a first impression: Get it on sale and give it a try. If you like the music better than I do :P			"

												This game is the main rival of Need for Speed Underground 2 in 2004. It has its positive and negative sides, but it has been and still is a good race game from my childhood. When you play it you feel some nostalgy and remember this awesome time of the early 2000-s when street racing reached its peak of popularity.			"

												Loved this game back on my Gamecube. Always wanted to play it on something using my wheel. But the issue with that is  there is quite a dead zone when using a wheel and no options to change it. You have to turn the wheel about 15 degrees  before something happens and this game requires fancy driving tricks to advance that the dead zone can interfere with.Other than that. It's still a  decent quality game for lower end PC's. Just someday like to see it expanded upon.			"

												Ah, SRS, an oldie, and to some, a goodie as well!Street Racing Syndicate has been out for about 11 years now, and taking in perspective of the times since then, in all honestly, this game hasn't aged as well as those who've played the game years ago would hope. But that doesn't mean it's no longer a good game.I first played this game around the time it was new for the PS2, and the main things about this game that I wanted to experience again for the PC, several years later have you, was the feel of being in the import racing scene. It's not as immersive or as replayable as let's say Need for Speed: Undergound 2, but for those who are playing it for the first time, it'll likely keep you occupied for quite some time before you move on to the next game. The only real thing that stood out to me in this game (aside from the women, of course!) was how you can wager money with other racers, and with no restarts, you either win, or lose. And winning is just as beneficial to your career progression as losing is harmful, mostly because you'll be low on cash. But other than wagering and entering race series in the game, the only real use of money is to buy new cars and upgrade them. That's probably the best part of the game: the car customization. Although the car selection isn't bad (some good cars and variations of the cars are nice, but there's not much variety in cars in general to choose from), when you do go to the garage, you're welcomed with performance upgrades, visual (cosmetic) upgrades, the dyno, and repairing your car if it's damaged. Which, of course, costs money as well, but a broken car doesn't hinder your car's performance. You have a good amount of options to choose from, though if car customization is what you're after, you're better off with Need for Speed Underground 2. Taking away the comparison of the two games, it's definitely an aspect of SRS that I enjoy, sometimes more than actually driving the car.Let's not forget to mention, there's cops in the Free Roam of Street Mode (career mode basically)!  The Arcade Mode is fun as well, and you can unlock cars for completing Iron Man and Checkpoint challenges in that mode for Street Mode. And yes, they're customized and ready to be driven as soon as you unlock them! I haven't touched Multiplayer, but I definitely wouldn't recommend getting this game hoping it still works.Here's where the downfalls come in. First off, the game is slow. I'm not talking about the game's progress is slow. No, when you're driving fast, it feels slow. Even with motion blur it feels as if going 180 mph is about the same as going 90 mph. I'm not exaggerating either. It's the main reason why racing feels less exciting than the other racing games of its time. Let's not even compare it to the newer games. Another downfall is the game's graphics. Sure, not bad for its time, but the textures is the only real downside to it. Frame rate is fine, and even View Replays look nice when they're focused on your car most of the time. This is with the highest settings too. There's also the physics of the game, not the best, not the worst, but the tuning options for each car in the game are there to make the physics more bearable. What car customization won't fix is how much respect points you need to move forward into the career mode. Once you get stuck, it a pain to go back and re-do events to get more respect points, even if you have some of the fastest cars and alot of girlfriends in the game. The sounds in this game is a split, for me, at least. The cars and the environment sound nice, when they're not chopped up (that's an issue I had as well as a video I saw, could just be on my end though). The music, however, gets repetitive, and eventually it's best to turn it off, or play your own music on the side. The soundtrack isn't the best either, maybe one or two good tracks, but that's about it. Overall, Street Racing Syndicate is a game to try out for it's price. It definitely won't feel like a waste of $10 (I heard it was 99 cents at one point, but it was $10 when I purchased it). You'll be able to enjoy what the game has to offer, but that's about it, really. The slow pace of the game and the narrow options of cars to choose from is part of what makes this game feel outdated, even for its time it wasn't considered any of the best games out there of the import tuner racing genre. If you've played this game before, it's a nice nostalgia ride.-K9_Rage/DareZeleon			"

												Given that I'm a fan of the series, it was obvious from the onset that I'd be comparing SRS to Need For Speed. SRS feels like a watered-down version of NFS Carbon (in the open world and impromptu races) and Underground (in the hot women starting the races and in the customization). I say ""watered down"" because it fails to accomplish what either of those NFS games did.The graphics are unfortunately a product of the game's time. 2004 doesn't look so good in 2015, and the max resolution (which I can't even remember right now) is too low for today's standards. Thankfully, though, they didn't tax my computer like a lot of old games do for some reason, so at least there's that. And the cars look relatively nice compared to the scenery. Character models and cutscenes are horrible, though.Gameplay shouldn't be too difficult - it's a racing game. Speed up, slow down, switch gears, get the position and win the thing. The nitrous works odd here, though; instead of having a limited supply that replenishes, you have a large supply that doesn't replenish. The handling also seems a little off than typical, cars are really floaty at times. Performance upgrades might change that, but the menu UI isn't exactly intuitive enough for me to tell which upgrades are actually good and which aren't. On the topic of menu UI, the entire game UI is really dated and uses odd keys like spacebar for some selections. Controller support is limited - it works, but you can't rebind all keys, and the UI doesn't show any controller buttons.Music and sound effects are meh. That's all I have to say about them.If you're looking for a good racing game, get a PS2 (or emulator) and one of the older NFS games. Underground, Underground 2, Most Wanted, and Carbon are very good ones, the latter two being much better than SRS in every way.			"

												This game I used to play years ago, and for some inexplicable reason this one just hooks me.There are 2 downfalls for me:1) The girls you need to impress and stuff.. That is slightly awkward, but I do it anyway, since I want to complete the entire game.2) There is a really common issue when you have more than one monitor where the audio remains fine but the video dies.All in all this is a really nice racing game and has a nice level of customization to it, although there is a very evident (as in most car games) best set of stuff for pretty much all cars.If I just didn't have to disable/disconnect my 2nd monitor every time I want to play this game, I would honestly have played it much more frequently.

I just turned it down after hearing the same handul of songs repeat a couple times.Xbox360 controller support works great.  I mapped my buttons similar to that of GTAV, so I was up and winning races without having to learn a new control scheme.Not too shabby for the price of a candy bar!			"

												Poor man's Need for Speed Underground 2, but nothing to scoff at. It hold it's own with a decent physics system for the vehicles and their handling. Lacks a bit in content but has a laid back freeroam story mode, also similar to Underground 2.Also has half naked women and it looks pretty good for it's age. Requires two fixes to get working properly, a widescreen patch and my proper Xbox 360 controller mod.The customization in this game is a little weird BUT you need to know cars to tune your vehicle properly. There are some weird things though, like: a racing clutch kit apparently comes with a new fly wheel but doesn't mention it and you can buy clutches and fly wheels separately sometimes. Then you can buy a header kit but it removes your exhaust upgrade, other things like performance spark plugs, wires and coils can be bought and installed separately which is nice.Online no longer works but you can play LAN with a LAN Over Internet program like Hamachi or Evolve and it has splitscreen.If this game had mod support it would have been even better as the game is virtually dead so the developers wouldn't care if the code was stripped and reworked but sadly, it's locked up tight aside from some texture hack memory injections.

												This is a perfectly fun and generic street racing game in the vein of the old Need for Speed titles. If you have nostalgia for them and you feel like driving around like a ricer this is a perfect game when on offer for only 69p or like a dollar. Worked fine on my Windows 7 PC and with my Xbox 360 controller, though it needs to be selected in the options menu and the pause menu can only be accessed with the keyboard (don't ask me why). Racing is relatively fun, though you can destroy all challenge for the first 3 hours if you slap a turbo and level 3 weight reduction on your first car as soon as you get it with the remaining money, I reccomend you scale your upgrading to the competition!

												Old skool racing game from the PS2 days. One of my old favorites that i've beat probably 2-3 times back then because it was so good. The customization is spot on and this game has some features you would have never found in the NFS series of it's day. The only con is that it don't have 1080p res option.			"

												This is so much better that all of the latest offerings from EA.You ask why?No super noob catch up mode for the AI drivers.Which means if you're kicking their♥♥♥♥♥and lapping them they don't magically catch up to you.			"

												Very nostalgic, nice racing game with good customization and pretty girls!Worth a buy if you're played it on PS2 before... If you never played it, expect medium graphics and pretty girls. But it has a decent gameplay.8/10.			"

												Like other reviewers, it is very similar to Need For Speed Underground 2. It has similar graphics, but improved intesity and stakes. SRS is a great game to reminisc about the old early 2000's racing/tuner scene. It's a simple game, racing can get repetetive, and there isn't a wide selection of cars to choose from. The game does keep you on your toes by forcing you to repair for damages you've caused to your car in free roam or in races. A good chunk of the end game, high tier cars are locked behind single player challenges in Arcade mode, which the game does not tell you.The game doesn't support wide screen. There might be a mod to fix that, but I've searched many times and I havent found a single mod for the game. Would I recommend this over NFSU/NFSU2? The answer is, no. Those games were more developed, and just overall have better and more diverse gameplay. Still, if you have an itch for these style of games, this is a fun arcade racer that you shouldn't sleep on. Racing can get intense and fun mid game, when you cars are maxed out.			"

												LOL.. manwas worth the 99centsbought it because was curious,was better than I expected. its very cheesy, yes. I almost thought this was an arcade game, but it has an open city.. and you can get missions and stuff.. and besides, you can collect hot chicks, and they even dance for you. lol...pretty good gameplay actually.. May not may not play it again.. but even for the one hour I played it. it was worth the 1 dollor...not bad,			"

												Fun game, different than Underground 2.  Worth a dollar when it goes on sale.Pros:Fun handling (drifting)lots a girls with funny lines and videosRepair system for your car (you actually have to pay to repair your car) which is awesomeDay and night parts of the mapPolice that drive around and can chase youController supportCons:Annoying point system (if another racer crashes into you, you lose the points, frustratingBad graphics, comparing to Underground 2 where the graphics are beautiful for even todayAnnoying handling at times where you'd like to drift but instead it goes straight into the wall or oversteers heavily without a way to get out of itNot a good soundtrack, I played three races in a series and the same song came up, the darn lunatic song.  The songs are so bad, there's a few good songs but the mainly only play when you are in the lobby to start the race and stuff like that...Also no ability to skip songsYou can't look back when you are in hood mode, there's a rear view mirror but you can't see anything with itPoor car selection, about 10 cars, they just have multiple models and with a dfferent engine and stuff like thatOkay car engine sounds, some, like the Skyline are SO bad, it's sounds so odd and annoyingWIll update this review a bit once I play more.
