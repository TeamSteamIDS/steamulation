This game has a cool core idea but also feels like some kind of twisted marketing experiment by Disney to see what players would let them get away with. It's shallow, it's buggy and it's full of microtransaction scumminess that would barely be acceptable in a free-to-play game but is in full force in one that costs a minimum of $20.The basic idea is cool. It's a score attack runner game that has two modes, one on foot and one in light cycles. Each mode has their own levels, mechanics and challenges and despite a lacking sense of speed, everything feels fluid, responsive and it's actually quite fun. Though there are only 16 levels for each mode, plus a randomly generated endless mode where you race for time instead of score, you're encouraged to replay levels for better scores and there can be a decent number of hours involved in completing everything if that's your thing.Where this completely breaks down is with the powerups and the microtransactions tied to them. Yes, this is a minimum $20 game that has microtransactions. Now, they're very much optional and grinding out in-game currency to buy powerups actually doesn't take that long. That said, the powerups are single use so you might have to grind a lot. Where this falls apart is YOU CAN BUY POWER! There are powerups that will both double your combo accumulation AND double your score! You can literally buy higher scores on the leaderboards. This completely renders the core competitive loop of this game worthless as it's not a level playing field and those willing to grind or spend money do better by default. For that reason alone, you shouldn't buy this game. This is a business model that deserves to fail.The game looks very good and nails the TRON aesthetic but the PC version is a mess. You can only quit the game by pressing ESC on the title screen, something not documented anywhere. You can't rebind any of the controls. There are UI glitches, especially in the Stream endless mode. Load times are long, even on high-end machines and as of writing, the leaderboards which you can buy your way up on don't even work! Every time I try to bring them up, it sits at Loading and never shows anything.There's a great TRON-inspired idea here but the game is buggy, overpriced for what you get and the microtransaction strategy ruins it. I'd expect this in a free-to-play mobile game, not a $20 PC release. Such potential wasted. DON'T BUY THIS!			"

												Previously recommended during the early access period. This game had a ton of potential during the 2-3 months of early access. The developer picked up on some of the community requested features and tried their best to implement as much as they possibly could. Unfortunately, I now see that a lot of those community ideas were instead used to generate cash grab opportunities for Disney. I won't hold this against Sanzaru Games as they have done an incredible job nailing the look and feel of this universe. Everything else is politics on Disney's end.Positive Impressions-Gameplay is solid. No input delay. Run, jump, glide, slide, wall run, attack, Tony Hawk 360 skatepark and light cycle your way to the finish. Supports keyboard + mouse and controller.-Visually a very beautiful game and manages to capture the neon-glow vibrance of the TRON universe. Colour palette is buffed slightly from TRON: Evolution. -Soundtrack is solid and adds a level of depth and dramatic feel to the whole experience.-Steam achievements for the 100% go-getter.Negative Impressions-No tangible story or anything of substance to back some sort of continuity for the player. I realise this may not be a necessary feature for most runner games, but the desire to progress slowly deteriorates as repetiveness takes over soon after the first few missions (with the exception of boss encounters). The currently available 32 levels becomes a chore rather than an exhilerating journey with a justifiable cause to progress.-Leaderboard is forever loading. This game is far from a 'finished' product.-I previously reported randomly losing health and hero suddenly turning invisible during the running segments whilst under early access. I continue to experience these bugs.-Performance issues continue to persist since day one of early access despite numerous reviewers and members of the community being vocal about stability issues. Some bugs (like those mentioned above) and frame rate issues continue to persist.-Light cycle segments are an absolute drag. The developers should have focused solely on the running segments with newer and more intuitive features. The light cycle portions just don't feel right at all.-Main menu? What main menu. There is no such thing here! No options menu unless you hit escape, and no way to exit the game unless you return to the very top menu and hit escape.-The base game will set you back by £14.99 and an optional £19.00 for the ultimate upgrade. That totals to £33.99. Slightly overzealous, don't you think Disney? I purchased this during early access and splashed £6.99. THAT should be the price for the current content available in the base game alone. Everything else is a perfect opportunity for Disney to slag off the TRON and Steam community. Your money is best invested elsewhere.Had I known this would be the embarrasing route Disney originally intented I would have avoided RUN/r right from the beginning. Yes, I am in love with the TRON universe and yes I did purchase this with little knowledge. However, I had no regrets at the time even with the bare bones content. I wanted to support this project and was satisfied with the content I saw and the expectations bouncing between the community. From here onwards I will be extremely vigilant towards all future entries in this universe, especially anything baring the Disney label.			"

												30 years into video games for the PC, one shouldn't be complaining that they can't reconfigure the keyboard controls. But here I am, complaining that I can't reconfigure the keyboard controls. And while the game is pretty looking, it's completely reptitive. If you like games that are more about memorizing patterns than strategic gameplay, this is good for you. But if you're looking for any kind of variety, you're out of luck. The game also seems to be nothing but a front for a pay-to-win cash store. No difficulty mode, and very hard for a casual gamer. After two hours of play, I didn't manage to complete a single mission, and I'm hardly the worst gamer ever. I knew this wasn't going to be Tron 2.0, but I didn't expect the light-cycle equilivant of bullet hell. Coming out when this did, one assumes the makers were hoping that more Tron content would help revitalize interest in the franchise, but all it really does is represent a final nail in the coffin.

Early Access Review
								This game is in super early access as it is very light on content and I mean very light on content as in there are only 3 short (around 5 min each) levels. With that said it is pretty enjoyable and well done, this is a pretty solid endless runner with your typical endless runner abilities like sliding, wall running and gliding. All in all, It controls well (I used a Xbox controller) and looks fantastic, the art direction really hits the cool neon cyberspace look of the Tron franchise.As you play you can collect the game's ingame currency called light (I think) which can then be used to purchase buffs and powerups which can then be used in each of the game's levels, abilities such as being able to improve your power disc attacks and/or the ability to automatically collect light that is nearby. Most of these are very similar to those found in mobile endless runners. For those interested I would still hold off until more content is available but here is hoping that said content is released in a timely fashion.  "

												Just a quick story. I launched the game and for like 10 minutes tried to find \""options\"" button. Just great menu design, but i finally made it to gameplay, and on first level my thoughts was \""It\'s a runer with just AWESOME graphics, and even thouh theres a microtransactions it\'s not a waste of money\"". And then i launched disk level 2. And i saw glorious 5 fps. From constant 60 it was pretty noticable. So i started to playing around with settings and game files - nothing helped. I google\'d and found couple of threads, some was like 6 months old, so it\'s an old problem, caused by bad optimization for amd cpu\'s, developers just won\'t deal with. I do not recommend this game if you have amd cpu.PS: really glad steam have \""give me my money back\"" button			"

												Buy this game if you like runner games. It\'s pretty polished for what it is, and its current sale price of like 6 bucks is super reasonable. It has great music, controls well, it\'s pretty, and it\'s a good way to get your TRON fix if you\'re a starving fan like I am (GIVE US TRON 3 ALREADY DISNEY. GIVE IT. GIMME GIMME GIMME).			"

												First off , before I go any further into this review I would like to state that the ONLY way to play this game is to :1) Turn off the in game music2) Download the Daft Punk ""Tron Legacy"" OST (preferably the 2 disc one with all the bonus tracks)3) Replace the in game music with said OST4) Get your Tron onOk so I'd like to start by saying that I don't play any types of mobile IOS or Android type games (regardless of the argument of whether they should exist on Steam or not) let alone any type of endless runners. I actually had to go find You Tube footage of numerous endless runner type games so that I could make the same comparison that others (who seemingly have never played this) are making about the game. I can say for certain that this IS NOT LIKE ANY ENDLESS RUNNER AT ALL. The fact that you are running is about the only comparison I could find. Endless runners that I have seen dont have or let you :a) Double jump into a flying modeb) Wall runc) Manilpulate the existance of platformsd) Destroy the enviromente) Engage and destroy enemiesf) Ninja dodgeg) Ride awesome light cycles and do freestyle tricks with themh) etc. etc. etc.I could go on and on about how this IS NOT LIKE ANY ENDLESS RUNNER AT ALL, but if you still want to believe it after what you just read , then I can't help you.To the rest of you, here is an amazing Tron game with a great pricetag! I like games that I can get in and out of and test my reflexes within a matter of minutes, e.g- ""Race the Sun, Spelunky, Nidhog"" and this scratched that itch perfectly. Amazing levels with great artstyle true to the ""TRON"" universe. Great disc upgrading and perk systems and fast and precise platform style running gameplay. When I got into serious sessions with this game (albeit with the Daft Punk blasting) I would finish the levels feeling ultra powerful, highly skilled, and generally vibrating with excitment. Great little game and totally worth of the price!			"

												Get this game!This game is simply awesome, way better than anything I imagined about it, it's way more than a simple runner, there are plenty of features that makes it really diversified, you can jump, slide, fly, run on walls, grinds on rails, fight ennemies, ride your light cycle, plus you are not on a rail that only allow you to move on fixed way with only left, middle and right like in most runners, here you can totally move freely in any direction, it's closer to a sonic game/platformer in term of moves than a runner.The game is beautiful, the art is awesome, there are plenty of levels + an endless mode with international leaderboard, you can choose your character, customise the colors, even your light cycle, and the gameplay is really satisfying, so much fun.I heard that some people are worried about micro-transactions, but you don't have to, they are useless, for example, 5 € is for 5000 credits, and you get around 250 credit ingame doing a 2 min race, so you can definitely play the game without micro-transactions (and credits are only for bonuses, which cost 50 to 250 credits, and you can play without them).It's also a miracle to have this game out of nowhere, since Disney seems to have gave up on the Tron licence and Tron Run/r is probably the only Tron product we will see in a long time, so if you like Tron, I really recommend you to support this game, because it's Tron, and it's great, and I want to see more Tron!I said everything I liked, but I have to be fair, so :A few cons:- I would have liked some faster levels, better sense of speed- I have a glitch that lower the sound effects volume, happens randomly when starting a level- Leaderboards work fine for endless mode, but are super long to load for levels (like 30 seconds)- I'm not a fan of all the songs in the soundtrack, some are great, but many don't feel ""Tron"" enough, heck that makes me think that some music rhythme based levels would be awesome!

												First of all, this game is an absolute BEAUTY to behold! The environments are fantastic and really makes you feel like you are a program trying to get to the portal and escape from the Grid. Also, the effects and lighting that's used is perfect and it makes the Grid come alive!The object of the game is to get to the portal. In the disc mode, this means running along, jumping and sliding, dodging attacks, throwing your disc, wall running, gliding, and even grinding on rails to get to the end in one piece. You have 3 energy (health points). If you lose all your energy, you lose. The controls handle great for this mode and it's easy to get into and learn but tricky to master especially when you're running quickly and trying to deal with everything in front of you.The second mode is the light cycle mode and it's also a lot of fun, but very challenging. The reason it's so challenging and brutal is that you have to get to the end before the time runs out, but the catch is that you have to go through check point gates to keep the time up. The gates will have different second amounts they will add such as 2, 4, and 6 seconds. If you run out of time, you lose. This mode is tough, and it really is a try, try, and try again until beat it sort of mode.The third mode is ""STREAM"" which is basically an endless randomly generated run which can switch between disc and cycle modes to keep you on your toes. It is a lot of fun and is great to come to and play if you need a break from the other two modes because instead of being pre-made like the others, it's all random as it goes. Also worth mentioning, is that this mode has a weekly challenge you can do. For example, it will ask you to survive for 1:50. This will award you for example with a badge (which I still haven't figured out what it does). Overall a lot of fun! I will be playing this mode a lot I think.If you buy the Season Pass, you will be given a TON of new characters to play as, many new light cycles to choose from, and also an Outlands mode will appear. I still haven't been able to play this mode but it might just be a bug that needs to be fixed. The new characters and light cycles you can use include all the cycles and characters (almost) from the original TRON, TRON: Legacy, and even very surprisingly, TRON: Uprising. They are all recreated in fantastic detail and really come to life in the game.Now for some information on how the in-game currency system works and how to get it. When you play a level in either the disc or cycle mode, all of the gold/yellow bits you gathered will be given to you as a reward for completing the level. If you don't finish the level, you don't get any of it. However, the endless mode will give you any bits aquired while in the run and you can use this to get more fairly quickly. It's quite easy to get a reasonable amount of bits by just playing the endless mode. These bits in turn allow you to purchase powerups and companions for a run. Powerups are useable items that can be activated at any time, while the companions are passive abilities like attacking enemies or drawing in nearby bits passively. Each run you can equip one of each of these. The companions are fragile however; if you get hit once, it disappears.Overall, I am having a blast with the game and it's awesome. If you love TRON, runner games, or racing types of games, or even all of the above, you'll love it. Good luck program!Update: It looks like the DLC such as the different cycles and characters along with additional levels have been pulled because it was prematurely released when it was still being tested. It sounds like that content will be released over time like a normal season pass works.			"

												Having played the early access version when it was $10, I can say that this is the best runner game out there right now. Although not too much has changed since early access, it's a very addicting game by itself, especially the Stream mode which is basically the ""endless"" mode in the game. TRON RUN/r takes some inspiration from Temple Run and Subway Surfers and takes it to a whole new level. It's not just a runner clone with a pretty skin. The game seemed to have been made under a very short deadline, but compared to early access games that have never fully released under two months, there is very little bugs and performance wise will work on most computers.As a super TRON fan, taking in consideration that Disney basically canned the upcoming TRON sequel and the very underrated TV show, we were lucky to even get something TRON related, especially a very fun runner game. It may not have been what everyone wanted, but it is something that everyone could try. Multiplayer is being taken into consideration anyway, so hopefully that brings more people to play this game.I've supported the game since it's initial early access release, so overall I give it a 7.5/10.

												I'll make this review as simple and as honest as possible, and help EVERYONE by starting out with this.Press X on your Xbox controller to play the game. Yes, the game has microtransactions, but they're optional. You don't need to purchase the items to play the game. Just look in the bottom right corner before starting the level, and press the button shown to play the game. Now, on to the review.Is it fun? Yes, it is fun, I've had fun playing it. But you should probably consider the idea of wasting money on a game like this before you buy it.It's essentially an endless runner game that you'd find on your tablet. Granted, this one endless runner is one that I enjoy somewhat more compared to most others that I've played, although I got during the sale where it's price dropped from $19.99 to $5.99...I think you should keep that in mind if you wanna buy this.Fans of Tron and neon overhaul visuals will like this game for sure.Endless runner players, you'll most likely enjoy this game.People who have a tendency to waste money on games unknowingly... Take your time when navigating the menus... M'kay?I know, I know... Microtransactions are bad. Period.But you don't have to fall on your knees and sacrifice the contents of your wallet in order to play the base game, and then give the game a bad rating because of the microtransactions.			"

												The game is good, I don`t even like runners but this one is good, they`re just some clunky animations here the there, and the controls caused me to accidently delete my save file, but other than that it`s a pretty awesome game, the graphics are really nice I like the colors as well, and the soundtrack is frickin` great, I would only buy this on a sale though, not worth 15$ for game alone, but totally worth 9$ for deluxe edition if you like TRON.8/10p.s. when i went back to windows 7 (since i had issues with windows 10) it deleted my save file, just a heads up.EDIT: Holy balls, just found out it`s 20$, not 15$, yeah, DEFINITELY wait for a sale.

												As I write this, I have an hour invested into this game, but I have to say it was a damn good hour so far. I really enjoy the runner-type games that require fast reflexes, and this game does not fail to deliver. It has the feel of a classic NES era video game, but with modern graphics. There are two modes: Disc and Cycle. In the disc mode, you run down a long track collecting ""bits"" and avoiding obstacles. Doing this will build your score and increase the score multiplier. A lot like building up a high score in the challenge mode to the Batman Arkham games. Cycle mode has you riding a motorcycle doing mostly the same thing, except you can drift to build your score. You can even attack enemies at your sides in a way that reminds me of the motorcycle minigame in Final Fantasy 7.A game like this is very easy to describe, so there really is not much to say about it. If you want to get a better idea of what it's like, check this video out:

												A very fun game to play, right off the bat.  Though, it may look like just another endless runner, it's really more than that.  It's more like an action/runner with a finish line.The graphics are gorgeous... that part is obvious. The music is pretty awesome as well.  I highly recommend that you play this game with a good surround sound system.The levels start out fairly simple and at boot, it teaches you how to use certain basic moves, to help you maneuver around the obstacles.  As you progress to each new level, things get more challenging, but it's nothing you can't possibly master. The controls are very sharp, so if you goof up, you'll know it was your fault and not the game itself (unless you experience a glitch, which I will discuss later in this review). The later maps do seem to move slightly quicker, as you go along. Especially in the Outlands (DLC pack).The cycle stages are pretty fun, once you get the hang of the turns and drift function. You'll be racing through obstacles as you try to tag each time loop, while collecting as many bits as you possibly can and destroy any enemy programs, who'll try to interefere with your mission.The level designs for this mode, are different from the disc runner challenges, but just as pretty, with many cool elements flying by. (recognizers, etc)I purchased the deluxe package, which in my opinion, is a must. You get all the DLC stuff, which includes the 16 Outlands maps, 9 extra disc levels, 9 extra cycle levels  and a bunch of characters and light cycles skins (from 1982, to the Uprising series).  NOTE: (If you're not amazing with a keyboard, I'd strongly recommend you grab yourself a Microsoft Xbox game pad to play this game).YES, you can use a game pad with this game!  Someone had mention it wasn't possible. That is not true.  I am in fact, using a PS2 Dual Shock gamepad, with a usb adapter, to play this game.  All I had to do was, find the XBOX360 gamepad support files online, download them and place the 3 small input files in the binary folder. (so many tutorials online, to show you how to do it properly. It's very simple). Or, better yet, just get a corded XBOX360 control pad and simply use the usb port to connect your pad and play. (make it extra fancy and find yourself a Tron edition XBox360 pad! :))(Update) It seems I can now exit the game from the custom and map select menu as well as in the middle of a game, as opposed to having to go all the way back to the start screen. All you do is press the Esc key and press the Y button on your pad or as directed on the option menu you pulled up.  MICROTRANSACTIONS:Yes, there are micro transactions available in this game, (called bit packages) but I'll be very honest with you, contrary to some reviews, I did not find thist to be an issue and I'll explain why below.First and foremost, bits are very easily earned, just by playing the game.  The more bits you collect, per map, the more you'll have to aid you with obtaining the upgrades you'll need for some of the harder maps.  If you run out of bits, you can earn them back, by replaying any map you want, as many times you want.  Or, try your hand in the Stream mode, where it's possible to obtain a large amount of bits, depending on a how long you can keep up with the pace. Buying bits, is only an optinon for those who do not want to grind through the maps.  But seriously...not necesarry at all.  My package came with 11k bits and I've still yet to use them, since I've accumulated many more on my own.  So, personally, imho, I don't think the microtransaction feature really damages any part of this game, like some believe.  I mean, whatever... The challenge is still there and even with upgrades at your disposal, you still have to master the game in order to climb up the leaderboards.  NOT easy, let me tell ya.  CONS: (Updated 9/18/16)Yes, there are a few draw backs to this game, I'd like to see fixed. Starting off with the little issues first. There are some innaccuracies to the character skins.  Sark for example, has his antennas pointing out the back of his head, when they should be lowered down to his neck area. It kills the look. Not sure who thought that was a good idea. It's just not accurate.  Beck's hair is exaggerated a bit much. Mara is missing the little neon green lights on her suit. I also would have loved to have seen the flesh tones changed to that of what it looks like in the films and animated show, rather than with actual flesh tones.  I would also love to have seen either Tron or Beck, with helmet on.  Maybe an option to switch one from the other.  Also, what is with the yellow recognizers on the start screen?? Looks like unfinished work guys...At least if they were red, I wouldn't have mind it much.Being able to skip through the beginning intro, (developer logos) would be nice.  It does get annoying, to have to wait nearly a minute, for the developer logos to fade out, before I can proceed to the game itself.Now the big issues.In the Stream mode, there's a problem (a serious one) where a game suddenly glitches and causes you to randomly derezz. It seems to happen at random points, where the maps would transition.  Also, there have been instances when I'd get hurt, or fall in a pit and actually continued to run!  This just happened to me recently when playing  the weekly challenge.  About 4 minutes in, and boom. Just derezzed, when I hit nothing. It happened 5 times now.  I'm assuming it's a problem with server lags, map loads etc. I don't know, but its needs work done, pronto. I think the developers should have considered a different way to handle the random map loads, like maybe have the game collect and prepare the maps before actually starting the run, rather than have it done, while running.  It can be a real pain when you're spending a lot of time running in Stream mode, only to be abruptly stopped, sometimes a few digits away from beating the time/score.It doesn't happen all the time...but still. They need to look into this. RECOMMENDATION: With all that said, after spending over 30 plus hours on this game, I definitely can say with utmost confidence, that this game is worth the price,  if you're a Tron geek, like me and if you enjoy runner style games.I'm having a lot of fun with it.By the way. Important info.I purchased this game in August.  There may have been lots of fixes made to this game since it's release, because I did not find half the issues some of the negative reviews have stated. Which many are dated as far back as February.  That's something to consider here.There have been numerous negative reviews, stemming from their experience with the downloadable demo or the early access release.  Both of which are very incomplete and riddled with issues.  The full copy is much more stable with many bug fixes made.  It's not perfect by any means, but definitely much more enjoyable.The Leaderboards do work although, once in a while, there's a server error that denies it to function properly.  Also, they can take a few seconds to load.My game has never crashed on me yet and I am using Windows 7 64bit, not 10, on a very old machine with a Core 2 Duo 3.33ghz processor, with 8gbs of ram and a GTX 960 4gb video card. The game plays very smoothly with no noticeable frame drops.			"

												Fun game, I recommend playing this game with a controller, and for all the TRON fans, I ***damn hope Disney made this game to collect money to create Tron 3, the movie.A bit sad that there ain't a multiplayer mode, and I don't think they will ever add it, but maybe they will remaster Tron: Evolution and make it Xbox LIVE free.

It's a simply runner game but no stupid unlocks that I can see- from the off you can pick not just colours, but models from the original Tron film, newer styles, recognisable characters, etc, and you can pick from a variety of light-cycle models too- all varied and going back to the original film. This customization and graphical fidelity in a fleshed out game would be absolutely amazing!			"

												This is a fun game with two issues:The camera is angled low so it's difficult to see what's in front of you.The environment sometimes fails to render, causing you to automatically lose the game (walls not rendering when have to wall run to survive)Aside from those two issues it's an enjoyable experience for what I spent, $5. However I cannot recommend the game at a $20 price with the current issues.			"

Early Access Review
								Revision 12/24/15:They have recently added three more playable levels, introducing new ways to play and increasing the level of difficulty. I am loving it thus far and it seems they are taking feedback very seriously. Looking forward to the next update!Original Review:This game has amazing potential. However, it is SUPER light on content. There are only three small levels, or disks, to play which takes about 4 minutes to complete. With that being said, it did a really good job for what it was, a solid endless runner. Once this gets fleshed out and grows, I can see this turning into something beautiful. But my biggest question is... Tron 3?			"

												TRON RUN/r is an endless runner game similar to BIT.TRIP RUNNER, but in 3D. You'll jump, slide, glide, wallride and grind your way to the exit while also battling viruses and enemy soldiers who can also throw identity disks at you. Unlike BTR where you're send backwards at hitting something, you get 3 hits, but you can keep going, until you're gone. There is also a light cycle mode where you have to race the clock to get to the exit while passing through arches that add time and battling other light cyclers. Aside from a generic male or female program, you can play as most of the characters from TRON, TRON: Legacy, and TRON: Uprising, use many different models of light cycles, and have a variety of colors. After completing a level, you are awarded currency which you can spend on identity disk modifiers and buffs. You also have point goals that can result in 1-3 stars for a level.The game does have its problems.1. You cannot play as Sam Flynn, Old Kevin Flynn, or Zuse.2. There's a decent amount of colors, but you can't be orange, despite being able to be red, as well as 3 shades of blue.3. There should be a marker indicating that you've completed a level without having to go to the leaderboards.The soundtrack isn't Daft Punk, but it's a decent electronic set.			"

Early Access Review
								At first I thought it was another mobile runner ported over to PC as I played the first level, but then after playing through the second level I thought that this is more than your average runner with complexities to the controls and actions you must do, which was kind of neat. Then played through the third level and thought that this is really fun!

That's about it though, currently there's only three levels. So to best describe the game since there isn't one, it's a third person runner action platformer that's set in the TRON universe.It's really pretty filled with beautiful neon visuals and effects, with the design and style of TRON. The gameplay is decent to great as you go from the first to third level. Although the controls might need a work / more focus on where stuff should be.The asking price might not be worth it at the moment, but I'm cool with it provided that they're going to add more content and that cool cycle game mode they're talking about.

												It may not be more TRON UPRISING or TRON 3, but it's a holdover until Disney gets over its Star Wars fixation.(Don't fret, we ended up with the comics and TRON 2.0 when the last one took ages.)ANYWAY, this is a Runner title, but seen from behind instead of side on.Various typical moves come into play (jump, slide, move around obstacles) but others add to the genre (fly/glide, wall run, etc.). Adding to this is a few power ups and ""Companions"" (a neat little homage to Bit from the first movie) that have certain special abilities to assist you.The power ups and Companions cost ""bits"", which you can earn running, or pay for them with REAL MONEY if you're daft.Power ups activate for a limited time, and if you're hit once, you lose your Companion.You also have a three-hit life bar before failing the level's run.(Cleverly visible on the back of the avatar - blue bars while doing okay, last one goes RED.)As you get further into Tron City, the harder it gets, more opponents added to the typical disc throwers and tanks.The other two game modes allow for a race using Lightcycles, but sadly no actual Lightcycle challenge like in the movies.(Rather bland bike too. It's like a poor racer with a Tron theme and a slight barrier behind the bikes. Seen better on unofficial dev ANDROID STORE titles.)The final mode is a challenge mode, a randomly generated neverending level called ""Stream"", using ALL the challenges in Tron City and Cycle modes.It's not perfect, but it's okay.And hell, at least this game is keeping TRON on life support!

												I waited until the game was on sale but was very interested in its bright, colorful graphics and thumping soundtrack. As I'm already a fan of Tron, I may be a bit biased in praising the game. However, as far as runners go it offers some of the most variety beyond the simple platforming / dodging of the genre. I am not a fan of the lightcycle / bike segments in the title, as they feel pretty clumsy with the driving. The on-foot segments shine though and have abilities you can equip before going into the levels to amplify your score or wipe out an entire section of obstructions at once. The ability to customize your character / cycle, as well as Interesting platforming variety with rails to grind on, walls to run on, a double jump + glide, slide, and tank fire to dodge while taking out enemies invading the area. The effects, fluidity, and soundtrack all go well together. If you're into the colorful effects and overall digital world of Tron, or just wanting to give the ""Runner"" genre a try, this is a title I'd recommend.			"

This game caught me off guard.  I played the demo and was really surprised at how well the game captures the tron feel.  I have a large backlog on Steam but this game I had to play immediately.  Rarely these days does a game capture my immediate attention. Pros: The running sections are great fun.  You feel like a real tron hero running and evading and shooting obstacles out of the way.  The way the narrator calls out different actions to try to stop you gives the game a really interesting atmosphere as you try to escape before you are destroyed.  The light cycle parts take some getting used to.  It's quite jarring going from the running sections to the light cycle sections.  You will likely struggle at first, however, I have to say, after getting passed about the first 6 or 7 levels in ""whiteout"" you start to pick up the developer's vision for how those levels are supposed to work.  I found myself enjoying it more and more and by the time I finished ""whiteout"" I actually wanted more levels.  Cons:The main complaint I have is that you have to load ""out"" to your loadout screen and then load ""in"" to each level.   On stream mode there's an annoying load time on the loadout screen before you can start the level.  It's a relatively small complaint but on stream mode it is especially annoying if you're getting early mistakes and having to restart.  In addition the game feels a bit content lite.  There's two worlds one for running and one for light cycles with 16 levels each and that's it.  After that it's just endless (stream) mode. Recommendation: If you grew up with Tron and are remotely interested in running games you will like this game.  Pick it up on a sale for sure.  At the full price tag I don't think it's worth it. "

												Being a big fan for the TRON genre I find this game great with slight exceptions....Having played the classic Tron Light-Cycle games, Tron 2.0 (Op game my favourite), Tron Evolution (Both PC (ok) / PSP(fun)), and now this.  Have to say great, but there are some dislikes to this version of this game (and maybe devs can improve on this feature)- My biggest pet hate of this game is that you cannot customise the controls of this game, had the same issue with Evolution (when it first launched) and to play it where the keys were position just became annoying to frustrating, to rage quitting. Seriously devs fix this option. Not everyone can play the same keys.... - This game is moderate to difficult which is similiar to Candy Crush for Freemiums to pass levels and such but .....enough of the complains.The graphics are great and the music to boot, great racing style game. This version of Tron Run/r really reminds me of how it is setup on the PSP Evolution. Although the time frame for the light cycle is annoying... it is simple and doesn't require much to get into, so it is ideal for those who just want to have a quick game before doing something else...

												Y'know, this actually isn't that bad.  I expected it to be bad, but it's really not.It's still quite primitive and you can tell it is in its infancy, but once more content is added such as: lightcycles, endless modes and all that cool stuff, it'll be a really good game.I also hope that the TRON franchise isn't dead and I seriously hope that Disney (and I hope you, Disney, are reading this) will continue the development of TRON 3 and make it for the fans.  I wasn't born when the original TRON came out but I don't want to be waiting for as long as the original fans did for Legacy.Anyhoo, I can't wait for the updates and I really want the next set of updates.EDIT: Full game has now released and it is the bomb.

Early Access Review
								As of this review, TRON RUN/r has six runner Disk levels and six Light Cycle levels. All of them are quite enjoyable and worth a go. Optimization and responsiveness seem good, no issues whatsoever on my system. Only a few minor grpahical quirks have been seen, some of which were recently corrected in the latest patch. A very casual twitch game hus far, with YMMV replayability. I find it quite fun.What this game needs IMNSHO is a DIsk battle arena (Disk Wars) such as we saw in Legacy. Some game mode with a greater control over our character could not hurt either.While the design and layout of the hand-created levels is quite nice, over time they may become stale. I would like to see the building blocks of these levels used for some kind of procedural level generation, or an endless runner mode (or both).The core of this game is there, and quite promising. As of yet we have no idea how much more will be added, but more of the same is certainly not unreasable to expect. The low cost of entry makes this easy to recommend based on the current state and the forthcoming potential.			"

												This is an excellent endless runner set in the TRON universe, with visuals inspired by the last TRON movie, TRON: Evolution, and the TRON: Uprising TV-series, though DLC characters will be made available soon from the original TRON movie. It has everything you would want from an endless runner, including two different ""campaigns"" of sorts consisting of 16 levels each. In the first, Disc mode, you run through a particular track towards the finish, gaining points along the way and trying to get a three-star rating. In Cycle mode, you basically do the same thing, but using a light cycle. A third mode is Stream, which is classic endless running, where you will also switch between walking on foot to driving a light cycle and vice versa. The difficulty ramps up nicely as you play through the various modes. You have to run and jump along the track, slide underneath obstacles, run along walls, grind on rails, and defeat enemies using your disc. Enemies are either other standing programs (sometimes deployed via Recognizer) or moving grid bugs. Sometimes, a light tank will pop up and you have limited time to defeat it before getting damaged yourself. You can buy special abilities and helper programs to make life a little easier, using a currency consisting of bits (you get an ample supply of these when you buy the game and more are earned by simply playing the game). Graphically, the game looks really nice, running on Unreal Engine 4. Everything has an electronic glow like you would expect and the surfaces are hard and reflective. In motion, it looks even more fantastic. Gameplay is solid. I have only played the game using an XBox 360 controller and I think that's probably the preferred way to play it. If there is one problem, it's that the game currently doesn't have a Quit option: you have to hit Escape on the keyboard on the title screen to quit the game, which strikes me as a curious oversight.

								Short, but fun - especially if you're a Tron fan and/or you just want to play a runner for a while. Feels very much like the movie. Definitely worth the $10 on early access.			"

Early Access Review
								A Pleasent suprise!Basics: This is an ""Endless Runner"" style game where you are forced to run without stopping through an obstacle course of walls and barriers as well as ""Grid bugs"" and pick up ""Bits"" and power up cubes. While running you have to do quite a bit of jumping, sliding, wall running and even gliding a bit with what looks like Parafoils which are attached to your back. Review: The game, though in very early access is a lot of fun. I really suck at ""Twitch"" type games in general, but this one is managable and a lot of fun. There are currently only 3 playable levels that introduce the different skills needed to play the game. Level 1 is mostly jumping and throwing your disk.Level 2 introduces wall running.Level 3 introduces sliding and is the most challanging of the levels so far.At the end of the level, you recieve a score that is based on how many ""Bits"" you pick up, how many hits you have remaining as well as other stuff im not sure about. :)I use the keyboard and the mouse and the controls are excellent. (Rare for this type of game) and I have no problem with doing all the functions the game requires.There are power ups you can purchase with points you get from completed levels, but so far with some exceptions I dont know exactly what most of them do. As this is in early beta, I am hoping that they add explanations to them to explain what they do later on down the road.Once you get the hang of things, you can complete whats in the game now in about 15 minutes give or take. I am hoping they add new levels soon as I have already played the 3 missions in the game a lot of times and i am ready for more.Summary: This game is a lot of fun, I have already racked up 3 hours playing it and there really isnt much content yet so the groundwork for an excellent game is definetly there. If you are leary about ""Twitch"" games, (Hey, Im 51 years old and typically suck at twitch style games) give this one a shot and I think you will be pleasently suprised. I am sure the developers will jack up the price of the game as they get closer to completion, so get it while its cheap as I think this game will be a keeper.According to what I am reading, they will have Light cycles soon....so that should be a hoot as well.

Early Access Review
								3 things I love about Tron: Cyberpunk; neon lit cities; orchestral electro with that 8-bit feeling. And Tron has all of that in one! ^-^At the moment, this game has only 3 levels, but each one is very fun to play. I found it quite challenging sometimes actually when I try and get the highest score on each of the levels (which is a good thing, I like having a challenge)! At first I thought this game was an 'endless runner' but knowing that there is a finish to each level is towards my preference. I suppose it would be nice to add in an endless mode for those who want that. The game features currency called BITS you collect on the run and you can spend these on upgrades which will help you achieve a higher score.Pros:-Fluid controls, no delay when quickly dodging away from a close obstacle.-The grind isn't real, so this is friendly to those who don't have enough time to play.-Beautiful looking game. May not compete against BF5 but it still looks nice with everything glowing.-Major satisfaction when dancing around the place throwing your disc at spiders.-It's Tron.Cons:-Settings are a tad limited. No key mapping, no graphics setting etc.Bugs. I know it's an early access there will be bugs - however there aren't many bugs and the ones in the game don't put you off but I'll note them here for the developers to see.-Framerate issue on Discmap02. At some parts of the beginning it began to drop at quite a low level.-Wall run issue. Sometimes when I glide towards a wall and start to run against it I phase through like quick sand... But I pop out again before I have to switch paths so not all hope was lost.Overall this game is really good, if you want to buy it maybe wait until there is more content unless you want that Tron goodness in your veins early. I would also add suggestions to this review but I figured whatever I have in mind the developers have already begun making.Also, here's Discmap01 to give you a taste of what the game is like:

								I own a couple other Tron games, Tron Evolution and Tron 2.0 specifically. The first thing I can state immediately is that this game looks better than both of them.The music and atmosphere is exactly what I would hope for in a Tron game. It draws you in with bright neon and pumping electronica as you race through The Grid and combo up as best you can.Despite the fact that the game is super light on content, what visuals and gameplay are in the game are very promising indeed.Check out my playthrough (short as it is) here:

								The controls were hard to find out on my own but I managed to figure out how to move and fight with my character.  the game still need some improvements, one thing i’m still unhappy about is that I don’t get to customize the character to have a different appearance in the game such as having a different color on the glow design, different helmet designs to chose from, nor any different gear to wear.  then again this game is supposed to be like an arcade like game with no story in it so I can excuse the developer for that even tho I was expecting a bit more from this game besides earning points, money, and upgrades.  What this game Really needs is a config option that will allow all of us PC users to set up how graphic quality you want to use for the game to function better on whatever model PC you use, and for control set up for what keys anyone would like to use to make their gameplay experience more comfortable and enjoyable in the game.  other than that, this is an ok game its not that bad.  I give it a 7/10			"

								*Now with light cycle battles!!!*This title deserves every positive review it gets. It was great even when there were only the regular runner disc levels, but with the addition of 6 cycle levels the game has much more substance and double the fun! This game makes perfect sense in the Tron universe. You collect bits which you can use to purchase various power ups that add some variety to the gameplay and helps you in getting bigger scores.Riding the cycle is everything you'd want it to be and better, visuals are mind-blowing and soundtrack is entrancing. The fun really starts once you get the controls.  Every Tron fan should pick this up and ride one of those epic light cycles.+Positive mention for giving away free copies of Tron 2.0, a timeless classic.			"

								TRON RUN/r so far is a really pretty, fun and fast runner.  It's luckily also not endless, so there's nice level design too.  Highly recommended for fans of the films, fast action games, runners, etc.  Simple to play, but there's definately challenge in a few of the later levels.  Can't wait to try the next update!			"

												So, I am not a big fan of runners on the PC. In my mind they are for mobile devices...until now. TRON RUN/r is simply fantastic! One of the best runners that I have played. This game runs on the Unreal 4 engine, and looks amazing. It is a nice blend of TRON, TRON Legacy, TRON 2.0, and Uprising, with a some nice additions of it's own. In short, the game runs nice and smooth and is a total blast to play. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes runners, and TRON! Welcome back to the Grid!			"

												It feels a lot like those cellphone running games with upped graphics. I can't say it impressed me too much, but I can say it became addicting rather fast. The music and graphics are as true to Tron as they can get, and I can see a lot of potential for this game. If they were to add some type of 1v1 multiplayer it could definitely become a winner. I'd recommend it for sure, but I would also rather like this thing to be released on a cellphone since it's kind of hard to play it on the toilet with the computer on my lap.			"

								This should probably be considered VERY Early Access, as what's here is basically a demo/tutorial. After 55 minutes of play time, I feel I've seen all there is to offer at the moment. That being said, there is a strong foundation here, and I look forward to seeing what will be added. An endless mode would do wonders for replayability, as the three courses provided have set finish lines. If you're into the Tron franchise, I would say go ahead and support the devs with a purchase. Everyone  else may want to hold off until there is more meat here.			"

												A great game for fans of Tron. Honestly, when I first saw this game, I had my doubts. Why make a runner for PC and Console, and charge money for it (instead of going the Temple Run route)? I even thought there were too many colors for a Tron game. But, I ended up buying this game, seeing as I absolutely love Tron. Let me tell you, this is probably my favorite purchase yet. It is so simple, yet they made the game unique. It has good game modes, awesome controls, very good scenery, the colors pop. It is a pretty great Tron game.			"

												First off let's be clear: this is a runner ~ obviously that's in the title but make no mistake, there is nothing else here but running (either on foot or cycle). I've seen some negative reviews of people who get the game expecting more. There's no story, there's no other modes.Having said that, it is a decent running game. It's graphics and sounds are superior to most running games (which are often just phone app ports). And overall it captures the Tron asthetics well. The difficulty is on the higher side for running games which gives it some replayability as you master the dozens of levels.The biggest con is the game is setup with a cash shop. You can get bits just from playing but the game will try to sell you bits for real money. Honestly I would suggest getting the Deluxe Edition; not only do you get all the DLC levels with it but you get 11,000 bits. (the deluxe is cheaper than buying the game + DLC and then the 11,000 bits on top of that is essentially free). With 11,000 bits + what you can earn in game you will be able to avoid the cash shop entirely.I picked the deluxe edition up on sale for under $20 and I feel like the game is worth around that. Not sure I would pay for it when it's not on sale. "

												I bought this game in Early Access because I've always been a huge fan of TRON. I would recommend this game to any fan of TRON just for the sake of it being a TRON game. Pros We got a new TRON game. Yay!Wicked awesome soundtrack.The gameplay is fun and pretty easy to learn for being a fast-paced game.Achievements!Did I mention we GOT A NEW TRON GAME?! Cons $20, plus another 15 for the season pass or 25 for the Ultimate Upgrade.Has a ""pay-to-win"" feel to it with microtransactions to buy bits to buy the upgrades.No story as far as I can tell. The Grid voice says things like ""The MCP has lost the target,"" when you finish a level, so it sounds kind of like early ideas of what TRON 3 might have been, the renewal of the MCP from the 1982 movie, but in the updated Legacy Grid. Personal Opinions The Light Cycle levels are tough. I could do the first one completely fine but any level after I HAD to buy the companion upgrade to get more time for each hoop.Lots of promising DLC with characters from the entire canon TRON universe.All in all, I bought this to support my favourite Disney franchise in hopes that if it gets enough support, we might see more from TRON. I'd say if your a fan of the franchise as well, you should eventually pick it up, even if you have to wait for it to be on sale. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but my opinion still stands that it is a great addition to the TRON gaming franchise.			"

								Early Access ReviewI'd no idea a new Tron game was in the works so seeing TRON RUN/r was a pleasant surprise.The game in it's current state is quite enjoyable and I look forward to further levels and conent.  Currently there is one mode available entitled ""Disc"" with three levels accessible.  You play an unknown program fleeing the system.  This is a runner style game where you follow a prearranged set path with your movement limited to:  left/right, duck, jump and are unable to speed up or slow down.A number of powerups are available at the start of each level that you can purchase using energy bytes that you earn in game.  This allows you to customize your character with various power-ups and companions that can affect how you play a level.The visuals in the game are remarkable and harken back to the look of Tron 2.0 (a great fps if you haven't played) combined with the character designs from the newer Tron Evolution game.  It is also amusing to see the devs giving nods to the source material when you rack up an ""MCP Combo"" or ""Space Paranoid"" combo to name a few.All in all a fun little game that challenges you to keep playing in order to beat your previous scores and earn the 3 Light Bytes (aka gold stars) per level.The store page lists partial controller support.  I was able to play the game with no problem using an Xbox One controller.  In fact the in-game control options showed such a controller so that may be an indication that the devs plan to bring it to the Xbox One some time in the future.			"

												Who would have thought that Grand Theft Auto V would have a more enjoyable Tron mini-game than an entire game dedicated to Tron?TRON RUN/r isn't great but it isn't bad either. This game is visually pleasing and without a doubt looks and feels like Tron. Music is great too. I can't bring myself to recommend it though, because I would rather play GTAV's ""Deadline"" online game mode. I guess Deadline is what I was hoping the ""Cycle"" portion of this game would have been but it didn't really meet my expectations. In the end, TRON RUN/r has more in common with Temple Run and Sonic Dash than Disney would like to admit (""lightning fast, action-adventure racing game"" as they call it) and if it was a freemium mobile release like other endless runners, rather than a $20 PC/PS4/X1 game, I probably wouldn't be nearly as critical.I paid $8.99 for TRON RUN/r: Deluxe Edition during a sale in May 2016.

												I got this game on Early Access, played the same 12 levels over and over.  Ever Since the full release, I can't even play it.  I've deleted all the local files 5 times and reinstalled it multiple times, validated the content three times, and restarted my PC 4 times.  I've done everything a normal consumer could do with intermediate to noobish computer skills to make it work.  This needs to be patched because no one should have to go to a different website or email to try to get it running.  The developers should put a news release in Steam to give us a real update on fixing the game.  I'm not the only one that got the game either and can't even run it.  I would try to get a refund if I could but I can't cause I've had the purchase too long.  How the hell does a game atleast run in early access and on full release no one can get it to even start.  I'm running a GTX 970, i7-2600, and 8gb of ram.  I think my rig can handle it.  Patch it to run guys!  And I'm not the only one, I've seen other customers online say the same thing.			"

Early Access Review
								I´m a TRON fan and all I can say is: Damn, this game is awesome! 6 levels each gamemode which are Disc and Cycle, looks amazing, nice traits you can equip with the coins you win by playing, equipment is for 1 run though; levels are not infinite, but definetly not short, for an early access game this is pretty cool, it would be amazing if it had Disc or Cycle races online, definetly worth the price.11/10. finally a good TRON game (yes I´m looking at you TRON:Evolution)Just checked the final version, more awesomeness, you can even play as Tron!3 gamemodes, Disc, Cycle Race, and random (which is infinite). The traits are the same, levels look promising. Still worth the price. ;)			"

								At the moment, it is unplayable. Yes, it is early access, but the lack of tutorial/keymap and the runner teleporting in the middle of the race for no apparent reason makes it unplayable.The review will change, hopefully, after a couple of updates... But at the moment it is unplayable :(			"

								It may be early days for TRON RUN/r (great name, by the way) but things are looking super slick already. You'll only get three tracks as of launch day, but the core mechanics of running, jumping, wall-running, sliding, gliding and disc-throwing feel fantastic right away.Word on the street is that the developer here is Sanzaru Games, probably best known for their fantastic Sly Cooper game on the PS3. If this is the case, the pedigree here is strong enough that nobody should feel shy about putting down $10 for some exciting TRON action.			"

Kevin Flynn: The Grid. A digital frontier. 
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. 
What did they look like? Ships? motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? 
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. 
And then, one day...
7 Year Old Sam Flynn: You got in.

												To be honest I was not planning on buying the game any time soon since the gameplay looked like it was just a copy of Temple Run but with the Tron Theme attached to it. All of this changed when a generous friend of mine gave me a gift to my surprise was a copy of Tron Run/r. After giving the game a run or two of my time I found that the game plays very well and offers a variety of customizable add ons that change the whole playing field of each run. Above all what I like best is the ability to challenge your friends (not playing together of course) to see if they can beat your or their scores.			"

												This video game is only half good. Half of it is the running part, which is the good. The other half is the Light Cycle. Whoever designed that portion of the video game was wrong. Dead wrong. You go in one direction and there is no sudden cornering, all you do is get to little markers that give you more time on the clock. I wouldn't recommend this video game unless it was half off. That way you are ONLY paying for the half that is good.			"

								A Tron game?  In like Flynn.  Light on content of course because it's an early access, but I'm happy to see it as is already.  Game is beautiful, although I'd like if the music had some more beat / closer to the End of Line Club's beats.  Need to be able to customize controls, little hard to figure out once the tips go away.  Glad I bought, looking forward to more.			"

								Really good. The game has a solid sound track and excellent art design. It plays best with a controller but the controls are nice and responsive. There are only 3 levels so far but they provide a nice challenge and never feels unfare. Only issue is that in some collisions the runner will dispear, but this does not make the game unplayable at all. at its current state 8/10 but I'm really excited to see what they will add to this game.

								As a major Tron fan I was very pleased to see anything new related to the franchise. I'm not usually a fan of endless runner games, but this one meshes very well with the setting--which, by the way, is gorgeous even in its unfinished state! There are currently only three levels available to play, but each level was a lot of fun, and hints that the future levels will be even better. I'm very much looking forward to any updates on this game and the franchise as a whole.			"

								TRON RUN/r is a fantastic runner game, it's a great concept which twists the typical runner with a ""weapon"" type loadout to help you achieve the max amount of points out of each level. WARNING: The game is VERY new and has LITTLE content. If you want a much more content rich game, wait a few months, or at least wait till the light cycle update is released. Otherwise as of right now this game has a LOT of potential and whoever is backing this game is doing a fantastic job. I cannot wait for the light cycles to be added into this! In progress rating: 8.5/10 Pros: +Graphics - Oh my god the graphics look absolutely stunning+Customization - Love the new twist into this+Level Design is absolutely amazing - still trying to get a perfect score. Cons:-Not a lot of content-Possible Story? (Didn't subtract points just a suggestion)-Don't exactly like how if you get hit by anything once your Companion gets insta-killed and you have to rebuy it. Maybe it's for the realism of the game. Not sure. Flynn Lives even when others don't believe.			"

								Sonunda adam gibi bir Tron oyunu. Grafik takıntınız varsa eğer grafikler oldukça güzel. Oynanış da oldukça eğlenceli. Şuan tek sıkıntısı az sayıda parkura sahip olması olabilir, yamulmuyorsam 12 civarında parkur var. Herneyse hızlı oyunları veya Tron'u seviyorsanız buyurun alın. Sevmiyorsanız yine alın çünkü eğlenceli.Bu arada genelde bu tür oyunları görünce ""mobile çıkan oyunları steam'de de çıkarma"" furyasının bir ürünü olduğunu düşünürüm. Bu oyun öyle değil.

												I DO NOT recommend this game!I thought I could purchase this game to have a cool new Tron game. I purchased on April 27, only to get it refunded 3 days later due to a lack of sufficient support from either the community (people eager to tell you ""you're doing it wrong"" but not WHAT you're doing wrong) or Disney Interactive itself from its own ticket support system of how to overcome this:After the character select screen I proceeded to what seemed to be the screen to go into game play. But instead of this you are prompted to purchase disc power ups and character companions for an in-game currency, which, if you do not have it, must also be purchased and with real USD, in order to play.  I had been playing with a standard xBox One controller made for the PC- but I am accustomed to using Playstation controllers. When it says ""Push X to Play"" I am pushing ""A"" (which is ""X"" for Playstation) but it's trying to purchase the in-game items, and not entering game play. Apparently the credits to buy said power-ups, etc. are included if one buys the DLC for this game. After several attempts to enter a game and being unable to do so, I tried to contact support. They took several days to respond and without adequate information on how to start actual play. By then I had already refunded. (Too little, too late.) It wasn't until well after I had already refunded the game that people on the forums on the post I created had started to talk about what buttons should be pressed on the controller to initiate play. If only they had done this within the first 72 hours of my owning this instead of just vaguely telling me ""you're doing it wrong"". But many others also responded with the usual hostile trolling you get from the elitest-types in the gaming community who can't deal with the fact some of us just aren't as ""pro"" as they are.Console players of this game are not required to make any in-game purchases in order to play this game. Why this is required on the Steam version is beyond me.Due to previous harassment by members of the gaming community, any negative comments will be deleted. I did not have a good experience with this game and I am entitled to my opinion about it. You are wasting your time and keystrokes if you don't like what I'm saying and don't have anything constructive to offer.			"

												As a fan of the Tron mythology I has experienced all possible games based on the franchise (starting from the arcade game). This title would rank 5 (in a scale of 10). The only redeeming quality it has is the music and graphics.The gameplay is too fast (and not adjustable) meaning that you will die.... A LOT. The tutorial system is bad in terms that it shows you the move right before doing it. There is no practice level where you can perfect the move. Unlike other runner games, this one doesn't allow you to enjoy the game a bit. The fact that you can not use a game pad is a big NO NO considering the amount of moves and button combinations. Tron 2.0 and Tron: Evolution are way better games than this.  "

												I don't like menu interfaces, loading time is pretty long, especially for stream (randomly generated) levels. Game could have better optimization. GAME SOMETIME STOPS ALL COMPUTER if you minimaze game (specially then on loading screen), but it's fine if you are not doing.I like running levels itself. They are not easy and require practice. I don't know why it says partial-controller support, but you can do everything with controller. Motoauto levels are fine. It's exciting game to play with friends on couch. Bought it for 8eur (deluxe). ALSO THERE IS DEMO VERSION OF THIS GAME. But this demo have worse optimization than the actual game.And... why the ♥♥♥ there is /r in the title ? Is it some mistaken escaption symbol ? (lel)After some month I feel wasted money on this game. Game is really badly optimized. Loading times for this simple Temple Run game is too long.  And main menu interface is designed to use BIT's (gambling currency). I mean if you want to start game, you can press [Enter] [Enter] [Enter] ... and the last [Enter] before game start is to use BIT's instead of start level (wat?). And start level button is [Space] (wat?).			"

												Since the update I cannot play this game.  When I load the game it launches SteamVR and attempts to play the game in VR.  Obviously a bug.  Please fix.  Cannot recommend until the game loads again.Original review below:Early access aside, MAN this game has potential.  I got to see this game at PAX South and it looked amazing.  Honestly, I think the runner mode is dang near perfect.  But the light cycle mode I still think needs a LOT of work.  For me, the immediate down side of the light cycle mode is the color pallet.  The colors, looks and feel of the runner mode are breathtaking.  The first time I loaded up the light cycle mode, all of the style was GONE.  Everything looks whited out and it just comes off as bland and boring.That said, I am having a blast with the runner mode.  I'm really hoping to see multiplayer modes and tournament modes!			"

												This is a really fun game but buy when on sale with all the DLC.Both soundtracks available are great.Controls pretty easy to get used to.Gameplay difficulty increases steadily.Found my self just goin back to older levels to try and outbeat my score.			"

												I don't know how a game that's about running from point A to point B can be so addicting! I love the multiple characters and cycles to choose from. And you don't even have to play any of the game to unlock them! IF you like the TRON Series as much as I do, I highly reccomend this game!			"

												Would be a good game if it didn't fry your memory... Shame on Disney for using the Tron brand just to make money...Many people complain about this memory leak, nothing is done...Took me 30 minutes to recup from the crash, memory heat was thru the roof in less than 2 minutes, couldn't access Task Manager, had to force shutdown via the hard switch... Won't keep going...WTF is wrong with game makers now a days? No pride left?A big FU/10			"

												Certainly not bad for what it is: a flashy runner with Tron characters. Like most games in this sub-genre, it gets repetitive over long sessions and is essentially a high-end mobile game, but if you find this on sale and are a fan of the Tron franchise, this game will do the trick for passing the time.

												If you're a fan of games like Temple Run, Sonic Dash, or pretty much any endless runner, then you'll have a good time with this game.			"

												This game apparently supports the Oculus CV1 a little bit, I was not expecting it when I bought it on sale for $6US. I was confused when I started it up and there was nothing on the screen. The game has no head tracking or head orientation tracking and the menus are not completely visible in VR so it's extra hard to figure out how to start the game and avoid the micro transactions but it is playable and pretty neat. Need to play the game on the desktop now so I can figure out the menus, gameplay and the controls better.			"

Early Access Review
								I hope this game gets finished. This is a nice simple game to play after a few hours of the Destiny grind. The nice visuals of The Grid in all versions of the Tron world always put me in a trance. My wish is that I get enough for my money's worth. Please make this a great game ! ! !PS. I use a PS4 or PS3 remote for this, and it feels a lot better than my keyboard.PPS. Go ANON ! ! ! ! !			"

												Since the update I cannot play this game.  When I load the game it launches SteamVR and attempts to play the game in VR.  Obviously a bug.  Please fix.  Cannot recommend until the game loads again.Original review below:Early access aside, MAN this game has potential.  I got to see this game at PAX South and it looked amazing.  Honestly, I think the runner mode is dang near perfect.  But the light cycle mode I still think needs a LOT of work.  For me, the immediate down side of the light cycle mode is the color pallet.  The colors, looks and feel of the runner mode are breathtaking.  The first time I loaded up the light cycle mode, all of the style was GONE.  Everything looks whited out and it just comes off as bland and boring.That said, I am having a blast with the runner mode.  I'm really hoping to see multiplayer modes and tournament modes!			"

												I bought this game and all the DLCS during the Steam Winter Sale at a 70% discount.  This game is really fun, similar to other Tron games and Bit.Trip Runner 2.  There doesn't appear to be a lot of people that play it, I've already made top 10 the leaderboard for a map within the first 24 hours.  The music is no Daft Punk, but it's enjoyable enough.  My only complaint is that when customizing your character there are 3 different shades of blue but no orange, like all of Clu's minions including Rinzler (who is playable).  There are weekly contests, the current week is 17 minutes straight on a randomly generated map, that seems rather excessive to me, but since I am new I'll see if it's doable eventually.			"

												Nice gameplay and nice Ideas. I really like to play it every now and then. But it could be more. Way more.The rest doesn't work. Interface is super strange sometimes. Mircotransactions. Also this game needs game has no custimization for the endless runner mode.			"
