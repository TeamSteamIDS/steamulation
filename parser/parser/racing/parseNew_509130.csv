												Great game. However there is a very limited amount of things to do. Some suggestions:-Scale airplanes. All of the planes in this game look very small and would be cosidered micro.-More airplanes. There are only 9 planes, and 2 of them are the same but with different colours. -More fields. I get bored after a bit because you just see the same field over and over again.-Realistic planes. The planes look fictional and it would be cool to be able to fly planes that look realistic.-Different colours for the planes. It would be very cool if you could change the colour of the planes (Not just make it a new plane). This game is pretty cool, but I might stop playing it after a while. If Fabricated Reality Software considers these suggestions, I think that they will be able to turn this game into a great game.So far 6/10 stars.			"
