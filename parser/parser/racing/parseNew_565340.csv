												1981, I’m at a friends place looking over his brand new Atari VCS (2600) and the two games he got with it, Space Invaders and Street Racer. Space Invaders was the game to have in those days, it was fun. Then we played Street Racer. It was exciting for the first 20 minutes, then the crap factor started to dawn on us. The graphics was crap, the game play was crap, the game was overall just…….. crap! It was at this point that I wished for an Apple II (Thank god the Commodore 64 was only just around the corner before I committed to such heresy).Fast forward 36 years, Lo and behold ZombeTeamz brings out ZombieCarz, a retro racing game that they some how thought emulating Street Racer was a brilliant idea. No, a brilliant idea would have been to emulate a half decent car game like Carmageddon or even Interstate ‘76! Now there was a great Drive-n-shoot game.Game PlayZombieCarz is 20 levels of top down, scroll down (road moves from top of screen to bottom) half racing, half shooting game. You start in a stock standard car that looks like a chines Volvo, with a gun strapped to you roof (a pea shooter more like it). You steer your car, slide is more like it sans Digital Derby Auto Raceway style (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpPtMBScVII (God I loved that game)) using the Left and Right arrow keys and you use your Up arrow key to shoot. In the beginning levels you contend with zombies that stand on the road, ride on dirt bikes (how the….? Never mind) or Dune Buggys (ATV’s to you Millennials). Best to shoot these Moving Violation, P plate road hogs, as hitting them damages your car. You get cash for every kill. Other things to avoid on the road, is the tricky trash left behind by Anti-clean-my-room teenagers, these also will wreck your ride faster than Mr Bean on a Busway.You can save stranded survivors, before said zombies tenderise them into road kill, meat patties, gaining even more money but that is up to you. Also collect health packs to fix up your car or skid over a Nuke box to have a jet fighter zip across the screen, dropping bombs to clear your path.After each level you can go shopping to upgrade your guns, your car or add a deadly bull-bar/cow-scooper.Everything ElseThe handling of your car is CRAP! I mentioned DD Auto Raceway before (watch video), even that game has better handling than this. You have no throttle to adjust your speed enough to avoid most obstacles, your just a kamikaze drive bomb! Shooting is painful and slow, even the chain from Road Rash would do better damage! Even auto-shoot is pathetic.Options are few, with only Sound and music volume adjustment, windowed or full screen, touch-screen and language option. No Key binding which would be nice as I find the arrow keys annoying for games.Sound effects and music are sparse and will become boring after a few minutes.The only saving grace of this game is the nice cartoon style animation and background. The animation of a Zombie trying to stop you from leaving the game, by hitting the ‘Yes’ button out of your way, was the only thing that brought a smile to my face. This quirkiness should have been carried into the game, hell, I sat there for ten minutes just watching this one Zombie, he was more entertaining than the game itself!Don’t wast money on ZombieCarz, not even if it was free. In fact go out and download a copy of Road Rash, I know it is old but there never was a more satisfying game to make you laugh yourself sore, believe me you will thank me for it!

												funny vertical scroller game with great hand made graphics where you ride a car and shoot or squeeze zombies on your way: you have to be careful and try hard not to miss zomibies and build a perfect route to receive 3 stars for the level, to take powerups and to avoid dynamites.price is extremely cheap!
