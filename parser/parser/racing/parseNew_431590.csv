												[ENG] Pretty neat game, but for me its still a mobile game. And even though its on 20% sale right now its still more expensive than in the apple store. And as far as i can tell from Videos, Reviews and my own experience on mobile and Pc, there is no exclusive content for more than twice the price from the apple app store. Quite sad, that mobile games come overpriced to the pc marked and dont even get an upgrade.Refunded and bought on mobile[Ger] Echt schickes Spiel, aber für mich ist und bleibt es ein Handyspiel. Und trotz 20% Sale ist es noch immer mehr als doppelt so teuer als im Apple Appstore. Und soweit ich das anhand von Videos, Reviews und meiner eigenen Spielerfahrung am Handy und Pc sagen kann hat es nichtmal mehr Content als am Handy, wieso sollte ich also so viel mehr (bzw für Androiduser überhaupt) Geld ausgeben? Es ist echt schade zu sehen, wie Handyspiele derzeit total überteuert auf den Pc Markt kommen und dann nichtmal mehr Inhalt kriegen.Zurrück gegeben und aufm Handy gekauft.			"

EditAfter doing a bit of googling I noted there is like 7 different versions of ""Earn to Die"" on their website and Facebook. Yes this has more content but you could just go play 3-7. So after all that I would not recommend paying money on this, unless they add some features that differ from the websions heavily.This game isn't anything amazing but it is fun. At the start it seemed pretty straight forward and before I knew it I was trying to perfect my run and make that money to make my car better. I would recommend this game. Its a simple yet entertaining game, I would like to see leader boards or a ghost mode of your friends bets runs.Here is a video to see it a bit more indepth before you make a decision.

												Straight into the ""Story"" mode, no Options or anything...but that's okay, the graphics look dandy enough, and the controls are clearly stated and so simple that even an intellectually-challenged chimpanzee could probably learn 'em.   On the whole, this is a pretty fun game. Not as good as Zombie Driver HD - so unless you're especially biased towards a 2D side-scrolling format, definitely check that one out first - but for the price, and given the fact that it's a port of a mobile game, it's hard to find much to complain about.    Repetitive, yes, but addictive and challenging enough; without being TOO challenging for those of us not exactly overendowed in the ""skillz"" department. Add an agreeably dumb-but-kickass ""rawk"" soundtrack (fellow fans of The Darkness should be suitably appeased), and Bob's your monkey's uncle.    The gameplay? Upgrade your vehicle with crazy boosts and guns, and drive your hapless way through hordes of zombies. That's about it, really...but that's really all it has to be. Honestly, just look at the trailer, and look at the screenshots. If this looks like something you might enjoy, then chances are you're gonna enjoy it. 'Nuff said.Verdict: 8/10.UPDATE: Screw what I said up above...this is, in its own way, every bit as good as Zombie Driver HD, and while the main game should be completable by just about anyone, the missions provided as Extras are hard as all ♥♥♥♥. So I think I can safely recommend this game to almost everyone and their grandmother (as long as grandma likes gore, and still has at least SOME motor skills. Haha, ""motor skills""...gettit? Oh, EAT MY BALLSAC, the lot of you).Verdict: 9/10.			"

												Superbly fun. Earn to Die 2 is a driving side-scroller where your task is to customize upgrades on your car and make it through the next stretch of road, filled with zombies, crates, ramps, jumps, and all sorts of other obstacles. If you fail to reach the next checkpoint, you simply go back to the Garage screen and buy new upgrades from the cash you've collected. The more you upgrade, the better your vehicle becomes. Once you reach a checkpoint, you then continue from that checkpoint and tackle the next stretch of road. Once you complete the full stage, you unlock a new (better) vehicle and start upgrading that instead.The stages generally get harder, though they're all doable, since you keep earning cash after each time you fail, so it's just a matter of how many retries you need to beat the stage. The overall driving mechanics are incredibly well executed. Most objects are destructible and the physics are very realistic, which makes you feel good every time you smash into a set of boxes or run over a group of zombies, watching their limbs fly in all directions. The game doesn't waste your time. Every minute spent is a minute of wild fun.I'd highly recommend this game to everyone who likes fun indie games, even if you're not into driving games or sidescrollers. It will satisfy all those who have a love for tactical upgrades and those with a love for wrecking pure chaos and destruction.			"

												Absolutely amazing game! Loved playing the flash versions, Android versions, and now it's on Steam. I also like the addition of cash crates compared to the Android version of Earn to Die 2. The game is locked to 60fps by the way, probably something to do with the physics of the game. Overall, definitely worth a buy.			"

												This game is a time waster.  A 5-10 minute game to play at a time.  The object of the game is very simple, get to the destination so that you can survive the Zombie apocalypse.  You do this by driving different kinds of vehicles across a wasteland and enhancing them with better engine, transmission, tires and other things, to make your ride better and more durable.Its a fun game but if you play it for longer than 5-10 minutes you will find it extremely repetitive.  But for the amount of time I play it every day its a very casual game and its fun.  The vehicles are funny and the attachments you can add make zombie bashing a lot of fun.Something very positive the developers should add at some point is Workshop support so people can add their own weapons and vehicles and or maps.  Would add more to the game.Overall I give the game a 5/5.			"

												In part 3 i would like to see 3 features/things added in this game:1: Multiplayer (where you could race other players with fully upgraded the same vehicles to make it fair)2:Track/map editor (to make this game last even longer)3: Rebinding of keys (at the very least for boost)Anyone else agree with these 3? P.s sorry for my bad english grammar if it was.In the end, this game is good, until you reach mission stage. It's one of these games that you can listen to some kind of podcast in the background while playing it with in-game sound turned off. Also android's version is also good, but it's still is a little bit better on pc (this is just my personal opinion).			"
