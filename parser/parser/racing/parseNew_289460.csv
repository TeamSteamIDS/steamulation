												Most of this review can be summed up one way, and that's by saying this is a 1C game.1C are Russian game publishers characteristically known for how alien their games feel. They've gotten better in recent years, but this is an old school 1C game from 2003, back when you wondered if they were from another planet. If you want to play RC Cars, you're going to have to work for it. To get this game to work correctly, you primarily have to do two things:- Manually set the game's framerate (otherwise it won't run properly). I suggest 60fps.- Manually set your controller's analog senstivity AND the analog deadzone (otherwise, you won't be able to control your vehicle).Once you do this, you'll be able to navigate the game's confusing menu system and eventually compete in a race. The game itself is pretty difficult; the cars themselves seem to almost have sort of a simulation feel to them. What this means is that any little bump in the road will often fling you wildly out of control, just like a real RC car. But, with enough finesse, you'll eventually come to grips with it.Tracks are laid out in obtuse patterns. Early tracks follow the typical racing game format of circuits, but it's not long until 1C takes the ""checkpoint race"" concept in more esoteric directions, leading you down narrow dead ends and back out again. Tracks themselves take you across beaches, deserted ghost towns, mines, busy highways and active military bases.Vehicles can be customized, but not much. Each of the four or five available vehicles have several different paint jobs, and can be upgraded in three categories: boost, engine, and tires. Upgrades cost money, which can be won by completing championship races. What you might not realize at first is that you also have to pay to enter championship races; on one occasion I spent so much on vehicle upgrades that I had grind for more money just to do the next race.Would I recommend the game? Given that it's only $5, sure. It's not going to blow your socks off, and you might actually end up getting annoyed eventually, but it's just different enough from the norm that I think it's probably worth it.			"

												Haha this game is great. Once I'd figured out how to get my gamepad working and turn down the sensitivity (a lot!) it was superb. The graphics are really good, and there are some amusing things like the people on the beach trying to kick your RC car out of the way, and a nice pumping soundtrack to get the adrenaline pumping. Love it!			"

												I find the game fun to play despite the suspension going wild sometimes (always at the same spot in the track) but the menus are just so damn slow. It's so irritating. I think 2/3 of my Steam 'playtime' is just menu time. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!EDIT : Change your frame rate in the menu to 35 or 40 and the menu will run fine. Great game now!			"

												RC Cars is a simple little racer originally released in the PS2 era. Unlike similar games, there are no weapons, it's just pure racing. There are various obstacles around the tracks to hamper your progress, and jumps and bumps to fly over.Driving the cars is fairly easy as it's an arcade racer through and through. Most of the vehicles seem to grip well and aren't affected too much by rough terrain as in some other RC racers. The AI isn't too bad either, of course the other drivers will bash and shove you but your car isn't affected that much by this so they don't push you into a spin causing you to lost the race in the last 100 yards.Graphically it's pretty good for a game of it's age with nicely detailed cars and tracks. It looks a little sparse compared to a modern game and some of the textures seem fairly low quality, but as I said it's and older game, so probably looked OK at the time.Sound is decent to with the main engine sounding like a tiny engine should and plenty of ambient sounds such as waves crashing on the beach or the sound of gulls. Music however is not so good. It's not especially bad, just more of a background noise while you race.Problems? Well when I first loaded it up I experienced the same annoying slow menus as everyone else, then when I eventually managed to get into the game my car just bounced around uncontrollably. This was the cause of much swearing and I nearly wrote this review based on that, but then I adjusted the graphics and now everything seems fine. The menus are snappy and the cars control well.All in all this game is sort of average. Once you sort out the problems it's fun for a while. Having said that I'm not sure I'd want to pay 4.99 for it, but if you get it on sale it's fine.BTW. I don't know if this will help anyone, but since it is and old game I  ran CPU  Killer to limit the speed of my system. The game was jerky, but the menus were more responsive and the when I got into the game the physics seemed OK. Then I just adjusted the graphics to 1920x1080, maxed everything and set frame limited to 60 rather than unlimited. I've ran it a couple of times since (without CPU Killer) and it seems fine with nice snappy menus and cars that stay on the road.			"

												The racing feels somewhat like Mario cart. Can be fun if it works right.Notes:The menus were slow and unresponsive until I limited the framerate in the advanced options.The game was made for a 4:3 resolution and stretches for 16:9. Choose a 4:3 resolution or everything will look wider than it is.Car reset sets you back to the last check point, which can be quite a stretch back. Avoid that.Skip the intro with the Esc key.The game has moving obstacles, a track that allows for nonobvious shortcuts, and local splitscreen as well as TCP/IP multiplayer.			"

												Trust me, it didn't hold my attention for long.I got this because I compleatly remember playing this on my cousin's old Window's XP computer, and I was wanting a nostalgia reboot. Well, apperently I didn't remember that it was this buggy. And plus, it just isn't that good. It's hard to describe. Races are too long, too boring, functions didn't work, and to top it off, I was using a controller, which isn't good, because you can only navigate using the left stick. This was a problem and I just wanted to use the pad, but I couldn't. Anyway, a crappy developer with a crappy game.Hell, they couldn't keep my attention in the game for 30 minutes, 1st race compleated, and wanted to race the next track. Wait, I have to race the same track AGAIN? Nope. Uninstalled, and refunded on Steam to get what I really want.3/10			"

It's sad that Steam says that this game support multiplayer, but it's working only without conection on one keyboard. I refunded the game and I think this game worth 20 cents not 3€.

												Has a really really really awful menu... every option you chose takes roughly 30 seconds to get to the next screen, you will be literally traped inside the menu for about 7 minutes before you could think about starting you first race. Music is ok, gameplay feels good for a very low budget racer but it feels also dull and empty. No weapons, no boostpads, just gas and steering...			"

												Ok, so, I know I have like no time clocked into this game, but hear me out on this one:I loaded up RC Cars and found the worst main menu of all time. It took 10 seconds to go from one option to another as the game slooooooowly transitioned between things. It was so bad I loaded up FRAPS to record it. But then it started working fine, so I closed FRAPS and went back to playing, but it was slowed down again. After some experimenting with it, I figured out the game ACTUALLY RUNS MORE SMOOTHLY when FRAPS is recording video of it.This game was obviously made by witches and you should not support the dark arts.

												Don't buy it for the PC. I don't know what console it's made for, but it doesn't work properly on the pc. To use the menus you have to mouseover a key and hit enter - clicking doesn't do anything. And the interface is very very slow. Like it'll take you about 15 seconds to go from the championship menu into the main menu. And the game itself feels a bit like a cheap knockoff of revolt. In my opinion, if this game looks fun to you, go buy revolt instead. Dunno if it's on steam, but it is on gog.			"
