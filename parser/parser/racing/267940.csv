												""Bob Slayer’s best kept secret, the illegal Glacier Races""This should of stayed a secret and been illegal to be on Steam. The controls are horrendous with no option to change them. (I hit every button looking for the gun). The NPC's don't care about winning, they only care about blowing you up or running you off the mountain. You could still be at the start line and the NPC will turn around, drive back and annoy you lol. Driving straight consists of 360's, it's quite funny. The graphics in the screenshots don't look bad, but when you play, it's like a cardboard box. The annoying ambulance sound at the start of the game will explode your head. It was a free game, but I still wouldn't recommend it.			"

												This game is possibly the worst racing game i've ever played and no i havent played big rigs over the road racing but the cars are slippery yes i do get that its on ice but when its not on ice the cars control like they are on ice, im not entirely sure what A and D do apart from move the camera east or west abit the only weapon i could figure out using is missile which sucks by pressing space and you move the car with the arrow keys which i really like but i wish that there was an option to 1: change the resolution 2: change the controls and 3: an STORY LINE since there is a story mode but there is no story line oh and that leads me onto 4: A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TUTORIAL explaining the controls and what each button corresponds to apart from guess and most of the time its luck hell i dont think i've ever played a racing game this bad sure there's trucker but at least that has a tutorial and changeable controls but this the only things in the options menu is music and sound effects which get changed apart from that its just luck if you get a control and im not playing it again not even for £1,000,000,000,000,000 or $1,000,000,000,000,000 hell i would rather play E.T on the atari 2600 than this piece of crap and the fact that i got it for free through indiegala email adress they give you game thing it still feels like i diserve a refeund on this.

												This game has to be one of, if not the worst racing game i have played. The options only give you 2 things you can see or edit. Music volume and.. You guessed it! Game volume. No place does it say the controls because they didnt bother. The graphics belong in 1998 and even back then this would look terrible. You have a so called 'Story Mode' where its just like all other damn races or challenges. Race win, run out of the map multiple times, move around in mid-air if you turn the wheel.And on and on. Disgrace.			"

												There is no Manual, no option to see Controls (Key Bindings) in the game's menu. Ugly graphics, absurd physics. I like such kind of games very much. For example, I like very much the game ""Gas Guzzlers Extreme"", though the ""GGE"" has its own defects, but I really enjoy ""Gas Guzzlers Extreme"".It's a pity that there are too little such games. And I wish more games of such type but of HIGH QUALITY. ""Glacier 3: The Meltdown"" is the worst game of such sort.			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/glacier-3-the-meltdown-first-impressions/Glacier 3: The Meltdown is your typical ""destructive"" racing game. It's nothing too special, but it did a fantastic job keeping me entertained during my first play session.Nothing much can be said about what makes Glacier 3 special from other, similar games. Like I said, it is pretty typical. The game features eight vehicles to choose from and a variety of tracks that can be driven on. There are several power-ups spread throughout each of the tracks, each granting you some kind of advantage. I stuck with missiles the entire time. They act like the red shells in Mario Kart, homing in on enemies (most of the time).The game's physics, however, were very amusing. The vehicles each made very sharp turns, very easily, at high speeds. I also bounced off a rock at one point, like a basketball, landing back on the track. That was quite fun. The AI beat me everytime, aside from one track, where I went all-out with missiles, so the game can be a bit challenging at times, but nothing that a good missile or two can't solve.There's not much else to say about Glacier 3. If I were to attempt to justify its price, I would pin that on how ridiculous the racing is (physics, weapons, etc.). It is fun, but has some technical issues that I wish had been addressed, such as the resolution, which is locked at some low resolution.			"

The menu music is mainly consisted in 2 house-ish tracks, obviously cut-off of a random set with bad quality.

												Originally developed for the Wii and ported to PC in the worst possible way. There are no options to configure other than sliders for music and SFX volume, that's it. No control and graphics options. The game doesn't explain anything. You have to figure the controls out for yourself by pressing keys on your keyboard and see if something happens. In case you are wondering... arrow keys for movement, A and D for strafe/ram, ctrl for nitro, space to fire rockets, shift to lay mines and R to reset the car (I had to reset my car a lot) Those are the most important ones. The cars handle horribly by the way. Even for a pure arcade game like this. It's way too twitchy. There's a story mode (without a story) single race and challenges but those last two are locked. You have to unlock them in ""Story"" mode. It's a shame. It could have been a decent game with at least a proper control scheme, controller and resolution support. With the best will in the world I find it hard to say anything positive about this game. OK, I think the soundtrack is half decent. Luckily I got it for free, thanks to an Indiegala promotion a while back. There are much better alternatives, like Post Apocalyptic Mayhem or Fireburst, wich only cost a buck more but have much more to offer. Best to stay away from this meltdown of a game.			"

IntroductionGlacier 3: The Meltdown is a third person, combat racing game whose developers may have had big dreams for the game, but resulted in an overwhelmingly poor production. Released in 2010 on Steam, when games such as F1 2010, Blur, and heck even Need for Speed: World were their competitors (among others), this is not even a possible contestant among those other titles. Let us dive straight into it shall we?VisualsI normally leave this section for last, but I think it's a pretty significant part of this review so here it is.Images were pretty low resolution, car models were quite bad, even if this wasn't supposed to be a racing simulator like other titles. Animations were just barely acceptable and each level had at least a few different roads to drive on which didn't make a race completely linear. But honestly, after seeing the loading screen 3 times, I couldn't deal with it any more. It was visually cancer.InterfaceIt is worth noting that this game has an options menu, but only has TWO settings in the ENTIRE menu. FX Volume and Music Volume (or something like that). This is absolutely unnaceptable considering resolution, controls, graphic quality settings, you name it! I plugged in my xbox one controller, and it would not detect it, nor did it give me the option to even change the controls. Even if a workaround exists, the fact that it lacks the basic courtesy to give me the choice in-game, feels pretty lazy to be honest.GameplayOh boy...you see, I'm sort of a racing game fan, a huge one. I love games that give me a certain thrill, a sense of speed, a decent bit of competition at the very least. I especially love simulators, ones that give me a huge sense of immersion so I can enjoy the game even more. This game...has none of that. It has the absolute worst handling of vehicles I've ever had the misfortune of playing, I mean can you imagine a car sliding across the ground going at 1 or 2 MPH? These cars will break every law of physics you can imagine. The view is fixed to 3rd person. No decent controller support means you'll probably be using a keyboard (an absolute no no for racing fans) and no multiplayer? What exactly would motivate someone to playing this then?Let's see......well......hmmmm.....AudioCar sounds are quite bad, painfully so, and the rock music in the background half the time just grates on my nerves.Summary and ConclusionSo let's see, Broken driving physics Horrible looking cars and environments Essentially zero in-game settings Boring/Repetitive Sounds and MusicWhatever you do, don't spend full price, half price or even quarter price on this. You're much better off playing some flash racing game or F2P racing game than this. There's just nothing worth coming back to.1/10 - Please, save your money.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Some feats of human endeavor have simply hit a plateau and will advance no further: the presidential autobiography, the drunken bar fight, the hot dog-eating contest, the movie biopic, the musical-legend-in-his/her-golden-years duet album. In these areas, revision is unthinkable; sameness becomes a structuring principle rather than a liability. Every once in a while, however, this wisdom is turned on its head, and an idea, maybe one that seems a little crazy at first, catches fire, revitalizes old forms, and we have what's called a “game changer.”For the racing genre, Glacier 3: The Meltdown is not that game-changing game: It's like an artifact from early-'90s arcades, the kind you might still see at shopping malls and in movie theater lobbies. Tempting though it may be to chalk the game's throwback texture and jerky movements to nostalgia, Glacier 3 feels, finally, cheap and fly-by-night (and weirdly unfinished), the kind of thing that might blow your mind if you caught a glimpse of it while standing in 1989, but 20-plus years on it's a bit like Lola at the end of the Barry Manilow song, wearing faded feathers and a Havisham-grade evening gown while attempting to obliterate any thought that might separate the present from its glorious past.The only thing that dates it to within five years of its release date is a pronounced design influence on the vehicles by the 2008 Paul W.S. Anderson demolition-derby-dystopia actioner Death Race.The only thing that dates it to within five years of its release date is a pronounced design influence on the vehicles by the 2008 Paul W.S. Anderson demolition-derby-dystopia actioner Death Race. Team 6, Glacier's designers, might have been better off had they spent less time cribbing that film's death-proofed gunship/crotch-rockets and more time taking a page from Anderson's textbook on matters such as hybridizing the anything-it-takes-to-win mentality with the guiltless pleasure to be had from blasting or mashing or skewering a rival racer into the next life. For all the minutes getting setup, picking the right car, figuring how to do basic things such as drive and shoot, there's next to no gratification to be had from winning or, if it's the big draw for you, smokin' other drivers.

												This game deserves all of the negative reviews that it has.There is no guide to what the controls actually are and the ""combat"" is really dull and bland.If you want a good racing game, stick to the FlatOut Series.

												For a $2.50 Car Game... I wouldn't waste your money, there are soo many better games or bundles you could buy for that. I wouldn't spend more than 50cents on this rubbish. Don't get me wrong they have the base model for a really good car game... but they make no use of it and it seems rushed.Firstly, there are hardly any positives and the ones I did find... don't really give the game justice.Positives:♦ Kind of challenging if you can get past all the glitchy driving♦ The levels are designed well♦ You have to play campaign to unlock challenges and single player maps (Gives you an incentive to play Campaign and do well)Now onto the long list of negatives which ruin this car game and would deter anyone from wanting to buy or even play it.Negatives:♦ No Settings (Graphics, Controls, Help etc) Only two audio bars♦ Can't unlock new vehicles or even customize the three you are given♦ No Storyline just racing for the hell of it♦ No Achievements or Steam Trading Cards♦ Controls suck (Arrow keys to drive, comma, space-bar and left alt to shoot) Who doesn't use or have an option for WASD these days!♦ Way too many weapon crates, meaning if you see another car, you can almost always shoot it allowing you to go infront♦ If you crash, get hit or lose control of your vehicle for any reason, it's almost impossible to recover from it♦ Far too many weapons♦ Physics is dodgy as it seems ragdoll like when you turn or get hit♦ No highscores for you to better level times in camapaign (Only a track score for coming 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th in the race)♦ No Multiplayer whatsoever (Who makes a racing game and doesn't offer any sort of multiplayer is beyond me)♦ If the format of the race start is cars infront and cars behind as you go to take off, you'll most likely get hit from behind by the AI cars even before you've had a chance to accelerate enough to take off♦ The machine gun seemed like it wasn't doing anythingOverall, in my opinion, the game has the basis of a really fun Mario Kart, Crash Tag Team Racing etc styled game except the creators don't utilize what they have and have rushed it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and if you do end up getting it, I can assume you'll have no fun playing it.Overall, I'd rate this 0.3/5!PS: If you must buy this game, get it in a bundle or when it's on special. But, if you ask me... I would stear clear from it and possibly any game made by Team 6 Studios as almost all their games are negatively rated on Steam.			"

												If they'd actually put more effort into this game, this could turn into a decent battle racing game. Poor port + high price = 26% on steam. But that's not really fair. Considering there are not so many games of this genre out there, this one is actually playable for a few hours. Or at least you can make it playable.You can fix controls in this game, by editing misc\DefaultInput0.cfg file.You can change resolution by editing Autoexec.cfg.You can change gravity value in Gamesettings.cfg, so it doesn't take so long to fall.I guess you can even fix excessive steering by editing car xml settings, but I didn't really went that far.What's not fixable are physics and design of course, but that reminds of PS1 days for some reason.

There is no craphic options at all (no resolution settings is the worst part).Overall the first race was some fun but then it's just pain.Only way this could be worth it was if it was free.			"

												Tips for how to play this game: right-click the game in your game list, go to ""Local Files"", browse local files, mess with the game configuration files (there are two) turn off music, set resolution, give yourself infinite ammo, and then play. It's more fun that way. The controls are whack: arrow keys to move, ctrl to boost, / to shoot. If you got this for cheap, it could be worth it. But don't pay full price.			"

												I played this game for only 8 minutes and I can easily evaluate its quality by only those few minutes. The game is ok-ish but lacks a lot. What specifically? Options. There are absolutely no options in the game. No resolution control, key binding etc.. only volume control. The camera is extremely zoomed in, to the point where it feels like you have no idea where you're actually going. I have to constantly use the speed boost in order to see the game I want to see it. Given the game's name it leads to believe that it's the 3rd game in a series however they still couldn't implement some basic options to tweak the game so it fits the player's needs or actually learn from other games of the genre how to make a good game? Combat isn't fun, through and through. Driving isn't fun, at all. Your car flies around randomly when it hits things, levels aren't fun and are extremely short. And best of all, don't you just love violent car battle games like this with no human model inside the car? Yea, the veichle is driven by an invisible ghost... The game just screams incomplete. I honestly have more fun and find more visually appealing to play Carmageddon 1, a game from 1997. Overall 3/10 don't buy this, better waste your money on something better.			"

												ok So I got my copy for about a buck.. it could be worth the nine dollars it is marketed, as long as you are using a steam controller.. I am not even kidding.. this game is a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port that doesnt even have controler support(without using something like joy to key, or controller companion, which will feel honestly pretty jerky..,) and it leaves you too figure out the controlls from someone else.. or on your own.. however, once I found out the controls I binded them up useing analog emulatiion. then it started to feel like a decent little arcade game.. for the life of me I can not get the motion controls to work... but all on all this game felt fine with the joystick.. for anyone wanting to just hop on and play, ill be uploading my controll scheme once i have played the eloted amount of time to allow for upload.Edit: this is also probably a great game(once you et it set up lol) for kids too, not to challenging and very arcady.Controls (posted from another review, I cant find who it was):arrow keys= move (obviously)""A"" key = slide left""S"" key = slide rightctrl key = boost or nitroux however you wanna call itspace key = rockets""B"" key = look behind you""R"" key = respawn""comma/less than sign"" key = is mines or bombs ""ALT"" = machine guns or rockets (depending on the car)Hopefully this has helped you for anyone who owns the game or plans to buy it. Enjoy! =)Show			"

												It's like one night, Mario cart got extremely drunk at the Nintendo bar, and wandered off into the night, bar hopping to different genres, getting worse and worse, and things grew more and more blury, he looked up and saw his old fling, donkey kong 64, and why not. his had been a slow year, and their son, Diddy kong racing had done well. But the next morning, In the grips of a hang over, he looks over not to see donkey kong 64, but a third party fast and furious rip off. . . He haden't had a condom. stumbling from the room. pulling on his kirby dream word boxers, and his banana vomit covered shirt, he hoped only to forget the night. swearing to never drink again.ten sober months later he finds on his door step and baby game that is  month old. quickly and distressingly he sneaks from the Nintendo compound, not wanting any of his co workers to know. He knows where he can take the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child. a place that all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children can find some kind of life. Gently he lowers the non-descriptive basket on the door step, and knocks on the door, before quickly fleeing into the night. The door opens, standing the great all father, Steam. looking down on the child. and the note attached. ""I'm sorry, i cant do it. not after DKR"" The great all father took in the child to be raised. not be great. not to stand out, but to be the best he can. a game that would be entertaining for about ten minutes. and the child did not disappoint his father, but did those that purches him. the all father was pleased,and Mario cart wept, for the third party fast and furious rip off had kept his number, and he was not long sober these days.

												ok the advertisement sounds like it was filmed in the 40's and the gamepplay makes no sense i mean one second your driving and when you turn you do a 360 with your car although no control info or anything only options are noise also i feel its not very nice to leave out pros and cons so lets get started. Cons: game constantly puts you in pretty much offroad maps the only way you know if your going the right way is if you respawn.2 is slippery controls ok i now its ""Meltdown"" With nice to mention UNLESS ITS THE CONTROLS. Basicly even oon places with 0% ice you do a 360 which most maps have turning so because of turning the camera pans the opposite direction of your moving car this is one of the main issues i got.Now last but not least Pros. Pros:Game has some pretty good music not the best but good for racing.2 respawns are fast making it easy if you screw up (Which you most likely will).3 is the idea.The idea is creative but poorly executed some fun bonus challenges and i do not consider this bad racing.I know you all are like ""BUT YOU SAID HORRIBLE 360 TURNS PANNING THE CAMERA THE WRONG WAY AND WHY IS THERE MORE PROS THEN CONS???????.).Once again i do not consider this a bad thing i just think it could had been executed way better they were not being rushed and the game would be way better if it had controller support.why? you may be asking yourself why? it would make it feel  alot more control able. ok without making this too long most wont read this but gwt it if you want a cheap not great but cheap racing game that will keep you occupied for a month or 2.

												What you can expect to come in Glacier 3 is best forewarned when you boot the game. When you are greeted by a shrill, obnoxious siren that caps off the title music, you have to wonder if the rest of the game and all that it entails will be so unpleasant. The answer, sadly, is an unequivocal ""yes"".Glacier 3 is a series of races undertaken around - you guessed it - glaciers. It has a ""story mode"", although there is no story. It is merely a sequence of races. Each race contains you and three other AI controlled drivers, as there is no multiplayer. On the map you may find powerups, two that charge your turbo and three that provide ammo for your weapons, with which you may take other competitors out of the race.In the one hour I spent in this game, I completed all six campaigns or four tracks each. Really, it is my opinion that there were only three campaigns and twelve maps, as each map and campaign has a counterpart reversal, with nothing more than the direction of the track changed and the start and endpoints swapped.The map design isn't entirely bad. There is some variety, and the environments are as varied as you could ask for in a game called ""glacier"". There are ice sheets, cliffs, mountains and caves. However, while some heart was clearly put into their design, the game also feels very rushed and incomplete. This may be most obvious in your first race, when you drive into a massive jump and realize that you can change direction in mid-air, the worst sin committable in a ""realistic"" driving game. Perhaps you can forgive it as you race along the minute-long track, but you suddenly find yourself crashing into a wall of rocks placed at the middle of an overhang. You think you've crashed - and you technically have - but it's okay, as that rock wall is also the end-point of the race. There is no finish line, there is no obvious landmark, just a pile of rocks in which you and your three competitors burn until the game decides that it is time to show the results of the race.The physics are wonky all around, even beyond the ability to change direction mid-air. You will find yourself moving in a direction other than that in which your wheels are pointing. You will hit objects or other cars, only to be vaulted back 30 feet, do a ragdoll flip or clip through a barrier. You will fire your weapons on flat ground, only for them to literally blow up in your face. While you hopelessly bounce along the track, you may despair, as you can only unlock new content by winning a campaign. However, the AI is just as helpless as you are, and with a few turbo powerups you will find yourself abusing the game mechanics, deliberately turboing off a cliff about a sharp turn, resetting, and turboing again in your newfound direction.Bad music, barebones graphics, lack of customizability and content, lack of multiplayer support and so on are all forgivable. However, everything about this game is mediocre, and I do really mean everything, including aspects that you wouldn't even think about in most other racing games because Glacier 3 does wrong what most games do not. That this game was published on the Wii is astonishing, although that perhaps explains what is possibly the least comprehensive menu - consisting of two audio sliders - ever accomplished in a video game. To summarize, the game plays poorly, does not look nearly as good as the store page's screenshots suggest and is outdone even by racing games produced in the 90s.			"

												You know, making fun of this game is a bit like making fun of a 7 year old's web design project...so I'll do it anyway.Because this game is like something out of the web pages I saw people make in a computer course I took during the WWF Attitude Era.Like the attitude era's worst web pages, it suffers from:-ugly look (all that's missing are endlessly tiled Austin 3:16 signs)-dated gameplay (it was so 90s I felt the urge to throw out my mouse, crank up the Nirvana, and do a D-X crotch chop)-interface that reads like ""baby's first game design""-buttrock-premise stolen from a zillion better games-no options -impossible to use controls-driving that handles remarkably like a shopping cart driven by a sugar-high kid This is apparently the third in the series.WHY.And yet, when I look at it, I see part of myself in it.It's probably my self-loathing.This thing is frankly a mess.Do yourself a favor and buy Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now over this.  Hell, buy even TDR 2000 over this.Hell, buy anything BUT this.I got it for free and I still feel robbed.			"

Games like Super Street Taxi Driver, Glacier 1 and others and they were sold for nothing, like for 2€ . I remember my holiday present being Super Taxi Driver 2006 back in 2009 for Christmas and i enjoyed that game, because back then i didnt even had any Internet connection at all and the only games avalible in my small town where from Team6 .

												It takes me an hour to complete the game; Story Mode (which is actually Arcade Mode because there is no story) and Challenge Mode (unlock cars). Is it bad? Yes, but it is playable. For a 2010 game, it has a pretty good graphics. What its lack is the menu; difficulty, control and graphic setup. It's pretty challenging at first but then after a few minutes you are pretty much beat all the A.I.No achievements, no trading cards, no need to put your cash on it.

												Well, if you are a pro in racing games... you still won't win in a while.This game is quite good for a bad game.I recommend this game if you like bad games.Once you get used to turning left or right, you may try to play it.Luck you can go to the next level even if you finished last. The game looks like it's a port of an unfinished mobile game.I got it free, now I want my time back. Buy this if you collect bad games. If this is the third I wonder how the previous ones are like.Pros: - You can lower or mute sounds in menu.         - It has menu.         - Unlike other games in racing genre, your vechile is already a wreck before you even start the race. I thought it's a fun ironic thing next to the game.         - You won't notice the graphics because of it's playability.Cons: -  Don't let your children or cat play this thing. Seriously. Don't.          - If I'd make a game like this it wouldn't ever be greenlit here in steam.          - Uncontrollable car.Summary:- IGN 10/gogolplex - Would mute music again. -			"

												This game is really not worth whatever it costs, luckly i got it for free.First off, the game looks worse than most NES games.Second, the game has no way of telling you the controls (have fun mashing the keyboard).third, the cars handling is uncontrollable, also the cars fly like they're made of cardboard. Sometimes they even just fly off into space if youre in a certain angle.Fourth, theres little to no content. The story mode is just 3 sets of 5 courses and they're reverse variants and 6 challenges.Honestly, the best you can get from this game, is if you gift it to someone as a joke			"

												No control options is the best thing EVER! Now I dont have to mess with using a controller or even a wheel cuz I just don't have the ability to! No more mucking around with ""PRETTY"" games either this one is all gameplay. About the gameplay? Well, I tell you, Don't bother with any of these complicated games with gas, brake, HAND brake, views, FUN... Wow, it's just too much hassle to learn how to steer anything these days so this game gets it right it just does away with anything other than the BARE essentials! Go, stop, shoot the challenge guns and jerk violently to one side or the other, who needs anything else? The track design is just THE most amazing! Imagine a racing game you have to actually figure out where the track is! Ya, I know right? It's great it's like you get a free adventure game all included!  Don't wast a single penny on this ♥♥♥♥ing travesty. Buy a good game instead...			"

												After reading the reviews for this game I thought I had to try this game out for myself. This game is bad, pretty bad. The story mode has no story. You have to figure out the controls by yourself, there is no way to configure the keys and the mouse does absolutely nothing at all. It can't even be used to adjust the view while you're driving. The physics is non existent and it makes you press the enter key on screens that have no real purpose except to slow you down. If this game was made in 2000 I could understand it's UI but for a 2010 game...On the positive side, the music isn't too bad and the graphics look alright, like a gamecube era game with sharp graphics. The gameplay is like super mario kart where you race along picking up mystery boxes and try to shoot/bomb/ram the other competitors out of the way. The game also runs at 144fps and has zero lag and loading times. It's a pity - this game could have been a great game if they had used common sense 101 in the UI and put in a physics engine. But as a game that came out in 2010, don't expect any updates coming out anytime soon. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this game.			"

												Typical racing game where instead of skill, you have rely on weapons and speed boosts to get ahead.The idea itself is ok. Actually, that would be my favourite type of racing game, but everything that could go wrong, does.The controls and physics, the most important things in a racing game, are just horrible. It's not about them being unrealistic, they didn't have to, nor did I wanted them to be realistic; I just wanted to actually being able to control my car. The car just flies across the screen, spinning uncontrollably, hitting every obstacle in the way and literally flying in all directions. There's no weight in it, and also, the game isn't really punishing you for hitting walls or even mines set by the other racers, so all you have to, and can do, is just float forward at full speed, and hope for the best.The tracks, other very important thing in racing game, are boring and unimaginative, to the point that you can't really distinguish one part of the level from another (besides one part of the caves... too bad, the rest of it is just one long corridor with nothing in it.)Not to mention they even reusing the tracks in the campaign (to prolong it I assume,) which you have to complete, in order to unlock anything else. Normally I wouldn't mind unlocking stuff by playing the game, but when the game is that tedious, it's just bothersome.Even if it would be for free, I wouldn't recommend playing this game.To think that after creating this, they somehow acquired right to make FlatOut sequel... It just baffles me.			"

												Pros:+Creative storyline, so creative, that only purebloods are able to see it...muggles and halfbloods on other hand are given amazing opportunity to create your own story line while racing in story mode with no story mode...10/10 creative story.+No tutorial on how to use anything...why a pro and not a con? Oh cmon, dont be such a wuss, real gamers dont need tutorials. This should also be renamed to ""Ultimate gaming reflex tester"" - drive car on drugs with some guns on it while pressing the hell out of your keyboard. Something we never had, 10/10 for gameplay and controls.+No mouse needed, cuz why you need to use both hands for racing like in new games when you can race with one and do whatevah you like with the other? Saves your time! 10/10 time saver+Very cheap, only 9 euros for all this amazing stuff you recieve...who needs šome awesome gamepacks on sale right now for 9 euros who really are worth around 40 euros if you can have this amazing racing game that will test your ultimate gaming skills and creativity? Who knows maybe you will become a writer of next Fast and Furious franchise after traning on this?+ Came out in 2010 ohhhh this is great, because it means there wont be any updates and noone will spoil your own storyline and you can make bunch of new ones, thats awesome! Add some princess Romea and prince Juliet there.Cons:- Thank the cat god I got it for free...- I feel sorry for whoever actually bought this...accept my sorrows, please.- Still better than Twilight.

												I received this game for free from IndieGala.But I have to say that this is probably the worst racing game I've played. Even for an arcade style racer. Perhaps I would recommend it if it was free!However, for a game that costs £7 it is a complete rip-off!!!I completed all 6 Chapters of the Story Mode and Challenges in less than 2 hours!There is nothing really unique about this game compared to any other racing game.It is relatively enjoyably, yes. But it has very few features. You cannot change the resolution or graphical settings from in game. Luckily I did find an option to modify these settings from notepad C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown and then opening the Autoexec.cfg with notepad. And for graphics options I had to go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown\Misc VideoPreset0.cfg and modify the graphics quality to 3 for all of the settings.The same thing I had to do for the control keyboard settings by modifying the DefaultInput0.cfg. It is ridiculous that all these basic settings aren't included in the in game settings. There's no gamepad support either which I believe is essential for this particular game.Not to mention there are no Steam Achievements or a Multiplayer component. I understand if there were more Single Player Chapters. The animations, sound quality and graphics are poor! This game was released in 2010 but it is worse than SEGA's best selling Out Run game of 1986! You may as well as download the DOS version of Out Run and play that with DOSBox emulator, you'll have a more enjoyable experience than this.You'll also find better flash racing games on Miniclip.com that offer you a similar or even better gameplay and graphical experience compared to this game!However, if you are still interested in playing an arcade racing game on PC have a look at Split/Second or Ridge Racer Unbounded they're available here on Steam. These offer a far more enjoyable gameplay experience!			"

												Oh why oh why do game creators make something like this and then just abadone this and rake in their profits from the sales and ignore their customers.1st, no controller support2nd, no resolution settings3rd, no keyboard layout or even configuration of keys.4th, no tutorial to even help you get to grip of the no instructions.The game idea is great and the look of the game at first glance is very appealing however, i don't know any of the  controls, so i'm button bashing like a manaic trying to even get around and i just give up as even hitting esc doesn't give you any options.There is an ""options"" menu however this is only good if you want to turn the music up or down or sound effects, how this game even made it on to the store is a mystery when so many games struggle in greenlight which actually have mastered all the basics which this game has clearly not.I wish i had of read the reviews first i would be a few quid better off! i won't hold my breath that the creator will fix or address any of the issues as their probably working on another game to abandone at a later date.

												EN: I needed for only a few minutes to discover that this game is very bad. My first surprise was the lack of graphics settings. After I started race I went to 18 FPS so optimization also is not exactly the best, but fortunately it improved in later stage of race. I would also like to mention the handling ... Let's say it is a chapter in itself, control is hypersensitive, I clicked on the arrow and the car turned 90 degrees, again the lack of control settings, the lack of any tutorial or help to control the car. I suggest to buy this game to your worst enemy, it will be sufficient punishment. CZ: Upřímně stačilo mi pouze několik minut na to abych zjistil, že tato hra je velmi špatná. Jako první mě zaskočila absence grafického nastavení. Po té co jsem zapl závod hra mi jela na 18 FPS takže optimalizace taky nebude zrovna nejlepší, naštěstí se to v pozdější fázi hry zlepšilo. Dále bych se rád zmínil o ovladatelnosti... Řekněme, že to je kapitola sama o sobě, řízení je přecitlivělé, klepl jsem na šipku a auto se otočilo o 90 stupňů, opět absence nastavení ovládání, absence jakéhokoliv tutoriálu či nápovědy k ovládání auta. Hru doporučuji možná ke koupi svému největšímu nepříteli, trest by to byl dostatečný.			"

												k first off the ♥♥♥♥ing game is a wii port. this explains why the controls are slippery. so if the controls are ♥♥♥♥ do i still give it hope nope. All the game does is put u straight into the game no tutorial nothing to see the controls. Secondary the graphics this was made for wii so no but at least try. So that all i say this game is ♥♥♥♥ with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. NO MORE PORTS K THIS GAME IS THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME FOR PC.			"

												Never have I played a racing game as ♥♥♥♥♥ as this. I have to wonder do the devs even know how cars and for that matter physics as a whole works in the real world. Also why is there no options menu... Only thing you can adjust is audio. The only resolution the game supports is so low that when you load the steam community hub within steam overlay the site loads the mobile version. Not to mention the game looks like an early gamecube game.			"

												I received this game for free from IndieGala.But I have to say that this is probably the worst racing game I've played. Even for an arcade style racer. Perhaps I would recommend it if it was free!However, for a game that costs £7 it is a complete rip-off!!!I completed all 6 Chapters of the Story Mode and Challenges in less than 2 hours!There is nothing really unique about this game compared to any other racing game.It is relatively enjoyably, yes. But it has very few features. You cannot change the resolution or graphical settings from in game. Luckily I did find an option to modify these settings from notepad C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown and then opening the Autoexec.cfg with notepad. And for graphics options I had to go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown\Misc VideoPreset0.cfg and modify the graphics quality to 3 for all of the settings.The same thing I had to do for the control keyboard settings by modifying the DefaultInput0.cfg. It is ridiculous that all these basic settings aren't included in the in game settings. There's no gamepad support either which I believe is essential for this particular game.Not to mention there are no Steam Achievements or a Multiplayer component. I understand if there were more Single Player Chapters. The animations, sound quality and graphics are poor! This game was released in 2010 but it is worse than SEGA's best selling Out Run game of 1986! You may as well as download the DOS version of Out Run and play that with DOSBox emulator, you'll have a more enjoyable experience than this.You'll also find better flash racing games on Miniclip.com that offer you a similar or even better gameplay and graphical experience compared to this game!However, if you are still interested in playing an arcade racing game on PC have a look at Split/Second or Ridge Racer Unbounded they're available here on Steam. These offer a far more enjoyable gameplay experience!			"

												Racing games have always been a welcome platform for frauds to trick people into thinking they're getting a game. This ""game"" can proudly join the ranks of such trash as Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing and South Park Rally. I got it for free and still feel ripped off because it took electricity to download, install and run this.			"

												No control options is the best thing EVER! Now I dont have to mess with using a controller or even a wheel cuz I just don't have the ability to! No more mucking around with ""PRETTY"" games either this one is all gameplay. About the gameplay? Well, I tell you, Don't bother with any of these complicated games with gas, brake, HAND brake, views, FUN... Wow, it's just too much hassle to learn how to steer anything these days so this game gets it right it just does away with anything other than the BARE essentials! Go, stop, shoot the challenge guns and jerk violently to one side or the other, who needs anything else? The track design is just THE most amazing! Imagine a racing game you have to actually figure out where the track is! Ya, I know right? It's great it's like you get a free adventure game all included!  Don't wast a single penny on this ♥♥♥♥ing travesty. Buy a good game instead...			"

												You know, making fun of this game is a bit like making fun of a 7 year old's web design project...so I'll do it anyway.Because this game is like something out of the web pages I saw people make in a computer course I took during the WWF Attitude Era.Like the attitude era's worst web pages, it suffers from:-ugly look (all that's missing are endlessly tiled Austin 3:16 signs)-dated gameplay (it was so 90s I felt the urge to throw out my mouse, crank up the Nirvana, and do a D-X crotch chop)-interface that reads like ""baby's first game design""-buttrock-premise stolen from a zillion better games-no options -impossible to use controls-driving that handles remarkably like a shopping cart driven by a sugar-high kid This is apparently the third in the series.WHY.And yet, when I look at it, I see part of myself in it.It's probably my self-loathing.This thing is frankly a mess.Do yourself a favor and buy Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now over this.  Hell, buy even TDR 2000 over this.Hell, buy anything BUT this.I got it for free and I still feel robbed.			"

												What could i say about this  ?It`s a very low budget game from Team6 . Fun for like 10 minutes ..I remember that Team6 games where everywhere in my country . Games like Super Street Taxi Driver, Glacier 1 and others and they were sold for nothing, like for 2€ . I remember my holiday present being Super Taxi Driver 2006 back in 2009 for Christmas and i enjoyed that game, because back then i didnt even had any Internet connection at all and the only games avalible in my small town where from Team6 . If i was 12 again i would have been enjoying this game allot .			"

												I had some stupid fun with this one, but c'mon, who's idea was to make a PC port of a crappy Wii racing game? The difficulty is not existing, tracks are repetetive and boring to look and it can be completed in hour. Oh, and options menu have only audio settings...			"

												this game is amazingly fun. it is missing a few things though. Pros: Addicting, very fun, cute graphics, different game modesCons: no graphical settings, sound effects are off when game is started up, no split screen, no controller support, no real story for me the pros overweigh the cons. personally i wouldnt pay 10$ for it, maybe 2 or 3. i got this game for free though. :D im very happy about it. If this game were to be remade or stuff added to it, im sure it will be a best seller!! It has so much potencial!!I rate this game 9.5/10			"

												Don't even be tempted to try this game. If you like racers, you'll loathe this. If you hate racers, then keep on walking.The controls and car destruction physics are about the only decent parts. You can continue turning corners after being launched into the air - I don't mean you can turn the car, I mean you will continue along the track and have handling only slightly worse than whilst on the road. There are three weapons, only one of which is actually any use, and unless you master the wobbly physics quickly, get ready to replay the first four races over and over again.			"
