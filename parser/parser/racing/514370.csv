Early Access Review
								I was never a fan of endless runner games on mobile but I have to admit theres definitely potential here in VR (plus dragons are awesome ;D). I picked this game up on a whim since it was already cheap and on sale and I'm glad I did.Pros:- cheap- motha flippin dragons- it's surprisingly fun- very nice pick up and play game for the price (most games with arcade-level content are 3x as much)- High potential if devs stay active in communityCons:- Early access so little content diversity right now- takes a few minutes to get used to (screen moves fast, you may get motion sickness until you adjust which didn't take long for me)- collisions are clunky right now, hard to grab coins without dragon hitting things and losing a life, would help if there was unit collision with the dragon and environment, or preferrably hitting the environment would instead just slow you downThis game easly made my VR watch list and I'm excited to follow it through the developement process, if you're looking for a unique experience right now for cheap I would definitely pick this one up.

								In it's current state, I wouldn't say it's the most in depth game available, but it's polished, well made, looks great and a lot of fun. The half an hour or so I played last night just zipped by, and I only stopped playing as my son came out and reminded me I was supposed to read a book to him before he went to bed.Kind of Xortex meets Spyro, you control a cute dragon that responds to your controller, and  you sip forward shooting trolls with fireballs and collecting coins and power ups.Possible motion sickness trigger for those new to VR, but I felt absolutely none myself.

								This is definitely an early access product.  The game has potential.  I think the artwork and graphics are very nice.  The issues are primarily with the control.  It's as if there's too much drift when you move the dragon around.  Doesn't feel as responsive as it needs to for this type of game (where you are dodging arrows, collecting coins, and trying to hit archers).  Needs collision detection when dragon hits ground walls, etc..  Right now you fly through everything even the floor!  If the controls were tighter (more responsive--including your fireball), and you were penalized for hitting obstacles: i.e. hitting walls and bridges would end your run.  I think this would be a fun endless runner.So for the low price I'm giving it a thumbs up for a just-launched early access, with nice graphics and potential if they fix these isssues.			"

								It is a very good game.  Great graphics and good gameplay.  It just need more content.  It is good at this discount price.			"

								This game is very kewl, its pretty much different than any other game I've played on VR so far.It does have some bugs that need to be fixed. and may cause some motion sickness for some people, but I did not experense any motion sickness myself. But if you wanna try something new, and the price is cheap, your gonna have fun.			"

								Pretty great, especially for being under $5.  This is one of the few games for Vive so far that doesn't just feel like a Tech Demo.Some reviews have complained about sluggish controls, which I thought may have been an issue as well.  It seems this is intentional for the first dragon.  As you upgrade and purchase more dragons, they get faster and the controls are much tighter.  His controls are definitely a bit slow, but it's not a cursor controlled by your wand, more like suggesting the direction it goes.  I found it fine once I got used to it (but was still thankful to upgrade my dragon).I've hit a few ""bugs"" though...  the collision detection doesn't seem perfect, sometimes I will pass right through a coin without getting it.  Also sometimes a single arrow would deplete all three of my health hearts for (seemingly) no reason...  might just be a feature I haven't figured out yet, though.			"

Early Access Review
								This isn't Early Access, it's not even Pre-Alpha, it's as broken as broken can be.When I tried it first, the whole scene was running at super speed, like 100 mph.On the 2nd try it went slower, but I can't see the dragon. It's like 1 meter above me. And it's flying upright instead of having a forward flying animation. I hear some kid coughing when I pull the trigger, I guess that should be the sound of the fireball shooting. But I don't even see them flying like it is shown in the video.The graphics could be nice and are obviously bought from the asset store, but seriously a green plane instead of water? Or is that yet another bug?I paid 0.66 euro for this. But honestly I'd even want that back. This is the worst Early Access game that I've ever played. It makes me fear that other EA titles are as worthless as this one.			"

								Dumb rail shooter, super boring. My friend found it harder to actually get hit by a bullet than to not get hit when moving fast. If I figure out how to get a refund I will			"
