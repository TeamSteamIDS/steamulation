												If Adam Sandler was to make a video game, that would be it.Nothing in this game makes any sense. Real roads from somewhere in the middle east with balloons everywhere. Real cars on the screenshots and videos, but badges are missing in the game ( to avoid paying licencing I suppose ).  The 'rubberband AI' seems to crash constantly. UI design looks as if it was drawn by a 12 year old with crayons. His favourite colours were obviously toxic green and pink.I wish I could say something about the handling, however the game doesn't really have 360 controller support. It does seem to detect the input, but there is no way to reassign key mappings. I used to accelerate with the 'X' button back in 2002, trigger support please. The arrows seem to control both the car AND the chase camera. I dont understand how in a team of 10 people that made the game they all thought this is a great idea. If I want to steer my car left, that also rotates the camera left and I have no idea where am I going anymore.On the plus side, congratulations to the developers for trying. This is the first game I have ever played from their country so I applaud their ethusiasm. However they should have started with something simpler. A Mario Kart clone maybe?My review is negative for the obvious reasons, but by all means please buy this game. I suspect it will be taken down due to licensing in the next few weeks. Now is your chance to get it and show it to your friends after you have finished watching 'The Room'. A cringe classic in the making.			"

												Okay I changed my mind.  My review is officially negative unless the developer addresses many of the concerns I have.It's alright.  I mean, the gameplay is pretty good considering we are not dealing with something AAA.  Drawbacks:- Controller mapping does not work as intended.  I can't figure it out, and the default controls are not ideal (X on 360 pad is for accellerate while triggers don't really do anything).  I can sort of change some settings, like changing the throttle to a trigger was okay, but when I go to set handbrake to 'B' it will skip back to the previus menu as though I hit 'B' at any other time.  If I hit 'enter' on the keyboard on any button it thinks there is an axis on the controller pressed slightly somewhere and every button will get mapped to that axis if you try.  Luckily the default controls are manageable enough to play.- Controls are too sensitive, basically unplayable without a way to lower sensititivity dramatically.  I was able to get through a few races by just tapping left and right ever so slightly, and it's not too much to ask since the races are mostly straight.  - Crashes often.  Every 2 races my game locks up.  Very unstable.- Graphics options don't make a lot of sense, but they're serviceable I guess.  Crank it up and hope for the best, it at least can play at a high framerate and look decent.  - Things in the background flicker like crazy.- The entire game can glitch out.  One time I went to race and my car wouldn't go, you could hear my engine rev but my car wouldn't drive.  Same with everyone else in the starting line, we were all frozen in time at the starting line and slowly creeping backwards (I assume the wind) and all turning ever so slightly into each other.  For like 10-15 seconds and then suddenly we all got our gas working and we sped off and raced.  HIlarious game.- The reversing in the car doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I can't seem to figure it out, I keep hitting the wall and not knowing how to back up.  You press a button and 10% of the time it seems to back up.  It says you are in the reverse gear.  But it's okay because the AI is pretty broken and they are dealing with the same issues.  A few of the cars will just be stuck in random places and you're never lonely on the side of the road.   The Upsides:- The tires look amazing.  Before you race, you can steer left and right and you can get a glimpse of those tires!  They truly look great!  Very high poly models and the rain on them just looks amazing.  - It's pretty fun racing, considering how bad it could have been.  It's playable, it makes you want to keep playing to unlock all the cars and levels.  If we could get a few control tweaks it would be even better.- Everything is locked by default, so it's fun to sit through it to earn new cars to drive.  Plus they all have different paint jobs.- THERES TWO SUZUKI VITARA'S IN THIS GAME.  Can't wait to unlock those.  Is there any 4x4ing though?  Seem sort of out of place.  The game is obviously broken as hell but I'm glad it exists.  If you catch it on sale sometime definitely pick it up.  I can't recommend full price but it's got potential.  A lot of it's issues can be fixed.

												It's not a candidate for 'worst game of a year' award. It already took that award home and placed it on a shelf next to menu created in MS Paint, dull AI, slowly responding steering and 1990s graphic. And wait, we're driving through a tunnel, let's make car's engine 3 times louder and laggy, because that's what tunnels do, right? I also still don't know how to rename my character, it always resets to 'MyShofer'. And have I mentioned that AI is really bad? I'm not even sure how is that possible, but in the first real race (my time: 1 minute 40 seconds), the second car finished at 2:00, third at 2:50! Just stay away from this one until developers do some major rework.			"

												I'm going to finish this game, but throughout all of the bugs, glitches, lack of content, and overuse of assets I somewhat enjoyed this game, it's got the same charm as Flatout 3(or whatever the bad one was).I got this game for cheap in a bundle, and the asking price of $12 is not worth it at all.  I'd say pick this up at $1-2 at most.  The game lacks sound options and you can only turn down what sounds like Middle Eastern music in the Audio settings.  The graphics settings and difficulty are pretty nice, but lacking.The downfall of this game is the poor controls, overuse of assets, and crashing.The vehicle sometimes decides to turn, and sometimes it doesn't.  It's really random and for sharp turns you have to handbrake.  No other option.  I do enjoy that they put a reset vehicle option.  It puts you back on track and ready to get back into the action instantly.The AI is terrible.  They either go the wrong way, pit you, or go at max of 50-70kph.  They end up just getting in your way and once you get in front of them you're almost guaranteed the victory.I'd have to rate this game at a 3.5/10.  It's very frustrating, not fun, yet somewhat charming.  It would be lower, but I don't think this is considered the bottom of the barrel compared to other titles on this platform.			"

												this game is a joke and not the funny type joke, not gonna lie i was kinda hyped to try it cause from the pics and trailer it looks good but i was disappointed.-first of all the plot , you're just a driver trying to make a name for your self by winning races ( obviously ) and getting fans ( kinda like in grid 2 but not well exploited).-graphicly it's really bad even for an indie game ( looks like an early ps2 game even on ultra settings), you got textures and shadow flickering,low quality textures and coloration , paper like crowd (like in 2000 games),too much light reflection on cars and road .-gameplay: its an arcade game with some simulation elements ( weather affect the driving) , no real license cars ( pics are just lies) the cars in the game looks like real cars except with different names ( for example the peugeot 206 is 2006) , most of the race events are sprint ( long straight road with no challenge at all ),AI cars sometimes hit you when you pass them ,no reverse button ( seriously ?!!).-sound: they used ReadSpeaker or something like that for voice acting ( like in google) , iranian/persian music in the menus ( bad chose in my opinion) house/dance/techno music in races but sadly the engine sound will be blasting while you're racing so you will here nothing ( cant mute it or lower it )-no multiplayer-crashes and bugs: the game freeze sometimes, AI act weird when you pass them, you will be blocked in even 4 just like me ( you need to be in top 3 to win but it will give you game over each time even if you win the race in first position)cant or wont shift even on automatic and i heard that the dev abandoned the game so yeah those problems wont be fixed any time soon. -easy achievements ( they will pop up after you close the game) but you can't get them since you will be blocked in one of the events.- no steam trading cards.with all this Cons i was still going to thumb it up cause the game has its own charm but when you you're blocked then its a dead end for you and the game.the game is unplayable in this state and nothing justifies the price tag ( it should be around 4.99) so save your money and go buy grid 2 or something with it.5/10			"

Actual PoopPoopy graphics (like someone took a literal poop on it) poopy GUI (can't use mouse to select buttons), poopy controls (arrow keys, not WASD), poop gameplay (bad steering, bad feel), overall, you should wipe and it should be flushed down the toilet.Didn't realize I couldn't use the other word for poop "

												I'll give a thumbs up because i already knew it was not an A class game (you know, Iran is not exactly a reference for game industry) and despite the world bugs and typos, it's a fun game. In fact, it's much better than a many games from my country (Brazil), so why not?			"

												I believe that we should not insult and understate the this game or its developers.The game is surprisingly playable! This has its own charm.Great choice of tracks is excellent,realistic behavior of the car on the road,beautiful soundtracks in the game,finally, the hypnotizing hum of the motor! These are real arcade racing, the adrenaline in your blood! And I hope that the little flaws in the chart will fix with the next patch.It's not a problem! "

												The game is OK if cheap.Good:-Playable and decent handling (too bad controls are too sensitive).-Lot of stuff to unlock.-Somewhat enjoyable.-At last a game with landscapes from this part of the world without soldiers on them.-Feels different from any other game.Bad:-Graphics look dated-Controls are too sensitive-Crashes-Collisions are bad-Engine sounds like they were recorded with a very poor microphone-Damage? Not sure if working.-Medium difficulty is way too easy and racing is quite boring because not challenging.-AI is really bad and some cars go literally at 0km/h or 5km/h-Some small issues like selected buttons green on green.. Textures flickering-Why putting these musics to ""promote"" them without putting artist/song names-Not enough race locations...-Too many reflections on the car and their textures don't look good.I give it 4/10, i've played much worse than that.It could be 5/10 and a positive review with fixed bugs, and even 6/10 with fixed bugs + additional race locations..
