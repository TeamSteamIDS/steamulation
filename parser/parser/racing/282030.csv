												Improved version, with added glide wrapper, meaning you can play games designed for 3dfx Glide API without the need of having a 3dfx graphics card. The 90s :)If you go to your Steam Library and look for ""Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now"" then right click on it you will only find ""Play Game..."" and ""View Player Manual"" There is no option to configure the glide wrapper aka ""nGlide"" You have to do it manually go to your SteamApps/Common folders and inside ""Carmageddon2"" you fill find the ""nglide_config.exe"" so you can configure correctly the wrapper.Also when the game was released (Late 90s) it came with ipx support so for this release (Prolly the GOG version have it too) they added an ipx wrapper, that wraps IPX packets into UDP, so modern OS can run this legacy games with multiplayer support.About the music, The amazing soundtrack is still here, this time is compressed using Vorbis (Lossy compression) The original release of Carma2 came in a CD, it was an Enhanced CD (Yellow Book CD-ROM + Red Book CD-DA) where the 1st track was the Data (The video Game) and the rest of tracks were the music, meaning your were allowed to put your Game CD in your CD Player and listen to the music, of course if you played the 1st track the one that contains the game data you will only hear random noise. While writing this review I was listening to the songs and found out that track Number 8 ""The Trooper"" by Iron Maiden at the 3:04 there is an error in the song prolly the CD was damaged/scrached, and you guys ripped it anyway, Lazy Stainless :PExcelent Game, lots of fun.

												I'm one of the few people who liked Carmageddon 2 better than the original. The racing was a lot more exciting this time around and the use of 3D graphics, while primative, was a big asset. On the other hand, some of the challenges / missions were cruel in their difficulty.			"

												God, I love this game. Maybe I'm donning the nostalgia shades here but this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Sure, the series strived on the controversy of violence, it exemplifies something that most games now-a-days don't care about. ""What's that?"" You ask, sweet reader, all beautiful and scared. ""Simple my young gamer, it exemplifies fun gameplay."" That's right, this is a game that actually has fun and addicting gameplay fun for adults and kids of all ages.

												Burned tires, bent bars, metal, fire, explosions, blood and guts everywhere.This was hands down my favorite gore racing smashing game of my childhood, and playing and beating this was an unforgettable joyride.As all old games, you have a few issues playing this on modern OSs. Mind your compatibility mode and do some googling to find advise. the game itself may run smoothly (like it did to me) but there are plenty fixes published for those who can't run it. (because hey, 99% of old games need a little something in order to run on win 7 and win xp platforms like they did on win 98s etc)This game was obviously the awesome sequel of a major idea of a racing game where you can smash and disable your opponents instead of just winning the race first. Numerous games took after this franchise including the burnout games. The game has an awesome point awarding system where you can earn points by running over pedestrians, smashing opponents, destroying them, going through checkpoints and of course winning the race. The point system helps the player to buy the cars of fallen opponents (only when they're smashed to death) and use them onwards.Meanwhile the variety of cars available in the game is ridiculous and pretty awesome. You get to drive vehicles from hot rods and rally cars to supercars and heavy duty trucks, all buffed up with blades and addons that make them look ready to kick ♥♥♥. All cars have a pretty hilarious way to be introduced, each unique and each with a driver that is one of a kind. Another cool thing is that you don't have to keep buying new cars if you don't want to since there's an upgrading system the evolves you car's armor, force and speed abilities as you play alloying you to stick with your favorite vehicle even by playing 99% of the game with it if you want to.The game includes some nasty missions along with the races. Kind like boss battles. Some are really stressful and some are way too fun not to make you wanna replay them.The graphics of the game are awesome of its release. You can smash your opponents' and your own vehicle in any way imaginable. Crash on them, throw them off cliffs, push them on explosive barrels, cut them in half, fry them explode them.Use ridiculous powerups that make you throw flames or elecrify pedestrians, fart bombs from the back of your car and on your opponents behind you, make your car bounce, jump, turboboosted, undefeated or mess you up with drugs and alcohol effects.The game is CRAZY and totally worth having fun with if you are into the genre.Do mind that of course its not perfect. There are physics issues like the levels of handling on some cars, the was steering works on most, the sticky feeling of some walls of you crash on their side and other little details that for me didn't take out of the fun of the game at all.Can't wait to play the sequel :DRecommended? HELLZ YEAH! This is one of the most memorable and unique titles on racing gaming history.Even if its really old, it is worth trying to play again!! And if you haven't ever played this, GET IT NOW!!! (or on the next special offer :P )cheers!			"

												Got this game free from buying Reincarnation. This game truly needs full controller support for true maximised gameplay as using a keyboard could prove extremely hard than you people think.

												Only racing game where the initial ""3...2...1... GO"" doesn't initiate the race, but rather indicates the point in time when complete chaos and mayhem breaks out. Right after ""GO!"", most of the racers just disregard and completely ignore the ""official path"" and go their own way - one goes straight up, one decides to go left, the other one goes to the right, some idiot backs his car - , proceeding with destroying other racer's cars, violently murdering the pedestrians with electrcity, fire and other funny power-ups and all that while banging their heads to the fast rhytm of Iron Maiden songs.- great soundtrack included in this version- works like a charm on Windows 7 64-bit			"

												What makes this game more enjoyable to play than Carma 1 is its physics and vehicles' damage model. Cars feel lighter and more fragile in Carmageddon 2 - they're bending, losing parts, flying around swirling, splitting in half - it's ridiculous. It is so much fun to destroy your opponents.Missions, in my opinion, are a nice addition for people who like a challenge, but I have to agree that some of them can be really hard and frustrating. Keep in mind that the higher difficulty level you chose, the less time you get to finish them. I managed to beat them on hardest difficulty setting except the last one, which I theoretically beat on medium by editing the game files and adding myself those extra seconds.While a lot of people praise Carma 2's soundtrack, I'm not a big fun of it and I usually play with music turned off. Iron Maiden while great and all, gets boring pretty fast. I liked the first game's soundtrack a lot more. Back in the day I even used to play the game with Carma 1's disc in the drive so it would play its audio tracks.I highly recommed this game. It still holds up. It's still fun to play. Buy it.			"

												Carmageddon 2 is the first race… cargame I ever played, and I have never had this much fun with a racer since.Since this game is so old, I'll mostly mention the gameplay elements.Race, Kill, DestroyThat's basically it, you do those 3 things, all the time, for fun, because you can.Back then there already were soft-body physics, and though unrealistic and totally goofy, they are still fun, satisfying to see. Not only this, but they actively, and severely influence the gameplay itself, making you actually aim for certain ways to collide at times, just to cripple your opponent.Though crashing into your opponents, racing across the creative maps, and killing all the peds you see is great fun by itself, this is even made better with the addition of tons of crazy and goofy powerups. Nowhere else can you send a car flying across the whole map using a coil spring, but here. (and maybe soon in the new Carmageddon too)FIND ALL THE SECRETS!Yes these maps were all designed to be explored, making them not only great and interesting battlegrounds, but also filled with tons and tons of secrets, powerups, and curiosities. Not only this, but most maps also have challenges ready for you, to unlock those secrets; ever tried a jumping puzzle with a car? (or 10ft truck?)The Fun, The Crasy and the Annoying.Now a lot of fun is ready for you as you already read, but there are also some warnings I’ll have to give, especially regarding the physics engine.Carmageddon has a great physics engine, but it doesn’t feel or play like one of a racegame; often you will feel like you’re actually floating on water, or flying through the air like you’re on the moon. (even without the lunar-gravity powerup) This by itself means… DON’T EXPECT FLUIENT RACING. Jumping puzzles are made easier because of this, but making tight corners, or any corners at all at high speeds, are impossible.Be certain that you want a crazy, goofy, arcady game if you plan on buying it. This is not a real actual racegame, even if it is definitely a car game.The glue that keeps the mess together.The game has a simple GUI and should offer no problems at all. There are many quirky things to keep in mind like stats and cars to own and buy during and around the actual ‘races’, and the GUI certainly makes it easy to keep an eye on everything. The big flaws here lie with the controls settings, and the ‘map’. The controls are by default mapped to the NUMPAD KEYS… I know, a total WTF, and to make things worse, you can’t rebind them to any key you want… meaning that you won’t be able to use arrow keys or WASD.  Trust me though, even if you could rebind them, you wouldn’t be instantly comfortable either due to the physics, so please forgive the game for this and give it a shot anyway. It won’t be long before you get used to it. I do however recommend that you try to rebind the other keys (repair, handbrake, use power, etc) to keys convenient to you. I know the game used to work with a steering wheel, but I am uncertain how it responds to the more modern ones. I do recommend using a steering wheel if you get the chance.In regards to the map, this bugger is probably the only annoyance you’ll have with the GUI. There is a minimap you can put on your screen, but initially it’ll be in the center of the screen. You can fix that using Shift+arrow keys though, to move the lil bugger around. However, due to the low resolution of the game, it’s too small to be able to actually effectively use it as a minimap the way you’re probably used to. Apart from this there is a big map, which is a big overlay displaying the whole map at once. You can still drive though using a little portrait sized window… a bit the opposite concept of the minimap.The GUI has a little trick that helps with the map issues though, which basically locks on to targets and the next checkpoint. The minimap displays a line in that direction then, so you will at least be able to find the checkpoints and chase enemies, after looking at the big map on how to get there.Sounds And VisualsNow it’s 2014 so be gentle on this old-timer. Regardless I can already tell you that, although low quality, the sound is generally satisfying and applicable within the context. Scraping, bending and crashing metal sound very much as you’d want it to, as well as a very pleasant sound for breaking glass. Apart from this, Carmageddon offers you 4 tracks of heavy metal from Iron Maiden and 3 songs from Sentience… which… I don’t even know, but it sounds alright I guess, considering the game it is. So you’ll probably want to play your own music the 2nd time you run the game, since you’ll be hearing the same song over and over again otherwise.Visually Carmageddon is very simplistic, and very dated. This however isn’t any problem within the context of the game, and in fact can be amusing at times. If you don’t mind the old graphics style, then you’ll still find that artistically, the game is unique, entertaining and satestfying.Personal OpinionThis game I have been playing since childhood, and has never let me down in entertaining me with some good old fun, even if it’s old.Everybody has some game which is like a child to them, often old and forgotten by most of the population, and this is mine.NotesHave a Wacom tablet? I have, and with this game it’s been a pain in my buttocks. Often windows would suddenly start thinking my tablet is my main cursor input, causing many annoying bugs with my mouse. SOLLUTION: turn off the Wacom driver, either before or after, depending on how skilled  and knowledgeable you are with your keyboard.I have never played this game online yet, so this entire review is based upon single-player experiences.For all of you who don’t have enough fun yet with the game by itself, there are many cheatcodes available that allow you to do countless amounts of things. This game was made with FUN in mind.Are you 15 to 25 years old? Good! This game will have exactly your level of humor if you know where and when to find it.There apparently have been ports for this game, so you collectors, N64 owners or PS1 owners, you might be able to find this baby somewhere for those consoles as well.This game has aliens, rideable rollercoasters, zoo animals, clowns, nuclear bombs, airplanes/jets, underwater driving, juvenile humor, rideable 10ft high trucks, rideable bobsleigh tracks, aircraft carriers, flamethrowers, tesla powers, rideable ski-jumps, underground mines, landmines, volcano’s, farmyard animals, the grand canyon, pyramids, helicopters and much much much more.

												Well... i've played this game almost 20 years ago on a steam powered ancient computer.I was a kid, and back then i used to play only 3 games : Carmageddon 2, Duke 3d and Tomb Raider and obviously all the free shareware from 3d realms and Apogee.In the '90s almost 1\3 of complete games were given free with shareware(at least on pc). Now you have to pay for hats and gun skins what a bag of pi.ss the gaming world has become lol, sorry for the OTBTW wtf will you get in this game??Frenetic gameplayTons of the most various genres of powerupsA lot of carsFunny tracksBlood and guts everywhereAwesome phisycs, handling and damage system (better than carmageddon reincarnation in my opinion)Smashed cars and cunning stunts to the Max Damage (that's the name of the red skinned psycho)To complete a race you can : smash all enemy cars to pieces OR kill every pedestrian OR race through checkpoints (adviced for noobs and annoying people only;)There are also some bosses and other type of races that i will not spoiler now.You can easily find mod packs that add tons of cars and tracks for this game on the net so...Few simple things, but are the best recipe if you want some genuine fu.ckin fun.It was funny then, and even now you can find out that very few games are like this.This game alone should explain enough why the old school still rocks. (in the gaming but also in all the other fu.ckin things in my opinion;)			"

												Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now is the sequel to the vehicular combat 'racing' game by Stainless Software, using a modified version of the BRender engine for native hardware support out of the box in addition to a software renderer and was released in 1998, one year after the original game. If you haven't read my review for Carmageddon Max Pack and assume this is just another action racing game I'd highly recommend doing so as it covers the fundamentals of the game in greater detail as this review will focus on what's new in C2. But for a brief recap for the sake of convenience, there are three ways to win a race: Complete all the laps, waste all your opponents, or kill every pedestrian, the choice is yours. Of noteworthy interest, C2 is not a direct sequel to C1, but a reboot of sorts set in a more modern day environment (1998) with more traditional looking race cars with a macabre twist to their design, unlike the Mad Max inspired direction from the first game. As such the overall presentation and theme of C2 is slightly lighter in tone than C1.Carmageddon 2 introduces several new elements to the series: First off, your vehicle can now be wasted in the single player game, which wasn't unusual in multiplayer, but here it really changes the way you play. Carmageddon is an often unpredictable and chaotic experience, and the tension only rises further at the risk of failing a race. Not because you ran out of time, but because you got wasted in the numerous ways possible. Whether you split your vehicle in half driving into a corner, or you were made the filling in a truck and building sandwich. This demands a less reckless, more skillful play style in order to win in a race now, and at worst frustration when you've spent a long time on a race only to lose all progress made on it because you collided too hard with that light pole.More controversial however, was the inclusion of missions, which differ heavily from the traditional Carma formula of three-ways-to-win races. Unlike races, you cannot gain any additional time in a mission by killing peds or wasting opponents (if present), instead you are forced to complete your objectives in the quickest manner possible with the least amount of mistakes. This will undoubtedly result in a first time failure and require replaying a mission over at least once in order to memorize the layout and plan your approach. Most missions aren't too difficult, but some can be especially fiendish (don't feel bad if you have to look up a video solution for Control Freak).The game's levels are now setup in groups, with three races and one mission each, unlike C1's ranking system. Ten groups in all, totaling 29 races and 11 missions (2 missions in the last group, even though one isn't labelled as such). Unlike C1's ranking system you can replay a race in the group you're in as many times as you want, instead of being forced down a ladder as your rank increases from credits earned. However, in order to move onto the next group you have to complete the mission of that group. There's around ten environments in total to visit, more or less on par with C1 but boast a greater variety, from the cities and countryside akin to C1 to the fairgrounds and airports of C2.Pedestrians are now full 3D models compared to C1's sprites, and while this results in a loss of graphic intensity of C1's nastily animated deaths the 3D peds are more easily manipulable and a whole host of new ped-related Pups can further manipulate their form and function. Gorier still is their ability to lose limbs, making splatter bonuses particularly satisfying. They're also slightly easier to mow down this time as they often stop in place for a moment to scream right before being plowed through. There's also many more animals this time, which you can now turn off if you're squeamish about roadkill.Opponents are no longer stealworthy and must be purchased at the end of a race or mission, provided they were wasted. They're not cheap, so save your credits for the ones you really want. Some can be very handy in later races and during specific missions (hint: the Bugga has excellent traction, better suited to racing than fighting). Opponents, as well as the player, can also be crushed under certain circumstances or split in two from sharp collisions. Wasting an opponent has never been more satisfying.Further featured is the inclusion of user operable Pups, a since series standard. These differ from ordinary instant-use Pups in that they can be stored for later use and triggered at the player's discretion. Many affect peds and opponents like the new ped flamethrower or opponent repulsificator, making your job easier, and several others grant useful player-specific additions like performing jumps with your vehicle via kangaroo ability or providing increased acceleration with afterburner, handy for a getaway or delivering the final finishing blow to an opponent. Toggling afterburner also cancels out the negative effects of some instant-use Pups like jelly suspension or hot rod, so experiment!APO is also handled differently from C1 as there is no parts shop this time around, you'll have to do all your upgrades on the fly using the del, end and pgdn keys like in the MP portion of the first game. In addition there is APO parts scattered and hidden around the levels that provide immediate upgrades or additional spare slots for future installments. There is 30 slots in total and you begin the game with a few already filled in.Finally, there is the inclusion of a mini-map in the bottom corner of the screen allowing immediate knowledge of closest mission objectives, laps, whereabouts of opponents and ped places (via the peds shown on map Pup once acquired). There is also an opponent status bar at the bottom of the screen showing the condition of your opponent's vehicle and their state of mind, which is a bit more handy than you'd think.Visually, C2 looks OK for the time, though its early 3D hasn't exactly aged as well as C1's IMO. There's blurrier textures and lower res assets in general, though overall environmental detail is slightly higher in C2 and vehicle destruction is also higher. Sound design is practically straight from the first game, re-using many of the same sounds, in addition to some new ones. Peds scream at all times once spooked, as the updated engine keeps track of more things going on now, even out of the player's view, which can cause some annoying noise pollution. C2's soundtrack features four tracks from Iron Maiden and another four from a group called Sentience. It's nothing special, and I prefer my own soundtrack.I have more complaints regarding C2 than C1. The inclusion of permadeath can be insanely annoying and Stainless knew this was a bad design decision later on, ditching it in favor of C1's system for the new Carma. The missions can also be frustrating to newcomers and fans of C1 and C:MD, requiring mastering the vehicle handling and other aspects of the game to win them. Cops were also cut from the game due to time constraints, despite showing up in a mission once. Collision detection with breakables can be bizarre at times, with windows and fences that sometimes break and sometimes don't. Gravity from jupiter Pup vs. certain elevations in the ground could also potentially waste you out of nowhere, among other countless collision problems with certain vehicles and objects. There's also a rare but serious bug that can result in the last opponent of a race being unreachable as they teleport around the map, forcing you to finish the race in another way.Overall, C2 is a lot less polished than C1 and was rushed by Stainless' old publisher SCi for release and it shows at times. But at the end of the day it's essentially just more of the same with a few new and essential improvements and is still good fun to play at times. Recommended to fans of the original and the series in general. Hang on to yer helmet.3.5/5			"

												Here is a piece of nostalgia for you.The cars control well, (most of them).And not only do you have the option of racing through a track, but you can, alternatively, kill all the opponents or even harder kill all the people. Using your car, springs, electricity, explosives or just the scenery.On the bad side you are the only car that can win by completing the race, meaning that you are in no hurry to do anything . The AI on the opponents will sometimes stop for no reason or will make them go around the race course even though they can't win. The prices on the cars is so high that you will either have to grind upgrades on maps like the quarry or the City with the scrapyard or just plow through the game and get all cars and maps unlocked automatically.That is not to say that it is not fun, but when you consider that you can kill all drivers in less than 5 minutes and get very little money or ignore them in favor of grinding for money witch becomes boring, fast, but is a necessity.

												I have so many fond memories with this game! What is the best parts of this game?Well first there is basically three ways to win a race:1. Win the race by going through the checkpoints (boring)2. Killing of every single pedestrian in the current map (tedious)3. Kill of your opponents (the most fun you will ever experience)I used to play this with a friend of mine who had a forcefeedbackstearing wheel, and we would switch who was dring every map. However, there was a twist. The one who was not driving, had controll over the keyboard. And by that, had access to cheats, which would determine the drivers fate. His driving towards an opponent? Why not give him pinball mode!His about to head for a cliff? Why not make the road slippery beforethe brakes kick in! I am not sure if it still works in this version, but if it does, I sooo do recommend trying i out!			"

(Normal loader being Carma2.exe <<==forget this)This game brough back many old memories..Pity the peds are so glitched and sometimes the opponents freeze above ground and cannot be interacted with.will be spending more hors yet with this game till the new game is ready for the big time.

												Well, after wrecking my way through the original Carma and the Splat Pack, I fired up Carma 2.  And wow is there a world of difference.Carma 2 follows on from the success of the previous game and keeps on going and going strong.  But unlike Carma 1, this game has made some changes to keep it fresh and challenging.  There are now Groups of races as opposed to the ranking system of old.  Complete the races in the group to unlock the mission that you need to complete to advance on to the next group.  Missions range from a Time Trial against the clock, Destroying certain objects in a set amount of time and Destroying opponents.The upgrade system has changed also.  No longer are you able to just upgrade before a race, you upgrade DURING it.  Its an odd system, however it promotes exploration of your environment to find Bonus Slot pick ups to increase the available slots to your various upgrades and also finding free increases as opposed to buying them, which can be expensive.Also, no longer are certain cars available for you ""steal"" like Carma 1.  In this, any car wrecked is fair game to be purchased after the race providing you got the cash to get it.Power-up also had a bit of an overhaul with now, manually activated ones.  My fave being the Repulsificators ( seriously, they are awesome xP )  Opponents this time get a status bar, showing you their health, what they are doing ( Checkpoint Chasing, Sulking ect ) and a mini map marker so you know where they are, which is real handy if you want to hunt them down.Graphically, the game is real good looking, cannot fault it and some music, which I didn't know until recently, supplied by Iron Maiden....thats cool as hell!!!This is a worth successor to the original and carries the torch still.  TDR 2000 was good n'all, but nah, Carma 2 is still the king of this franchise...for the moment.  Just got to see how Reincarnation fairs, because its got some pretty big shoes to fill, left by Carma 1 and Carma 2.			"

												So, you want a racing game with damage mechanics! Good.But... you ALSO want to be able to win by wrecking everyone else. Great!Or... what if you want to just mow down every last pedestrian on the map? On an aircraft carrier?Sure, the graphics are a bit dated, the music is repetitive (even if it's Iron Maiden it does get old), and the required missions are either too easy or WAY too difficult... but on the bright side, you get to kill clowns!

												Ok so i played the original game way back when....and it was silly.But this sequel makes me now know why the game was no longer considered good.THe music was ok....the actual driving was horrible....steering was not happening very well....controls where also sub par....even when i attempted to re-map the controls it didnt help.Graphicwise the blur was way too much on menus...and inthe game....it was even worse....when the game came out it should have had better detail then it did....instead the original creators didnt even try.I got random points as i played.....ok that was like the first one....but inthis case i didnt even have to drive and got random points......I took a single screen shot....as i got stuck....there was no way to bypass....no key or control button allowed me to escape the problem i had to terminate the game.Also i noticed when i played the game....if i attempted to use the steam UI or other things the game interefered across the entire system.....i thought that was a bit weird.Now the funy part the game saves periodically....and you guessed it...it saved when i got stuck as well....my entire game progress was wrapped up in a broken game save.I do not recommend this game to anyone....as it is a poorly done game....even for the time it came out...it was badly done....which makes me realize why this game had been forgotten.....obviously this terrible version came out and made people hate the game as a whole.The original game was ten times better....as you could hit escape or press keys and reset you could travel where ever....unlike this version which puts you into a tunnel.I cant believe this is a sequel...as it is horrible.I recommend taking a spoon and scooping out your own brain before playing this game.

												Yeah a couple of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ put some negative reviews that were not actually helpful since they were false claims. You CAN save your data, it automatically saves after every race. You CAN rebind your keys, just curtain keys can't be bound to since they are permanantly bound to other actions. It has the same style of gameplay with CURTAIN missions that test your ability as a Carmegeddon racer. The negative comments should be looked at on this game just to check if they are actually reliable, since there are no reliale negative comments yet.			"

												Carmageddon II has a special place in my heart. It's just fantstic fun all of the time. I love it so much. I picked this game up from Salvo's (yeah, Salvo's) for like $3. Grew up loving TDR2000 and actually had no idea there were any other Carmageddon's. Although very glitchy and sometimes frustrating, it's just an honest blast. It runs perfectly as far as I can tell on most modern systems at your native resolution (yes, 1080p without configuring anything, not even in the menu), the only thing you have to do is delete the last two files in the games folder (delete winmm.dll and wsock32.dll) otherwise it will say it's running when it won't even boot. Unlike the original, this thing runs perfectly otherwise.Pros:+Decent graphics for 1998, though not great+Sound is great+The car destruction model is fantastic and though the cars themselves obviously look very dated, the actual destruction of them is rarely surpassed even nowadays+Great Carmageddon sense of humour+Long campaign+Multiplayer is even more of a blast+Very high replayability+Many cars to chose from and hilariously creative+Running over penguins and elephants never gets old, as well as peds of course+Huge variety in levels+Levels are fully explorable so do whatever you want!+Missions are actually pretty fun and creative, it's just the difficulty that lets them downCons:-Might want to turn off music as the same 5 tracks play over and over again (Iron Maiden are great though)-Very buggy-Cars' hoods can become ramps if their hood gets deformed making it extremely hard to kill them-A wall might decide to kill you and split you in half for no reason-Cars might be on 2% health, but apparently driving into them at 200km/h won't kill them (even though you credits for 'damaging' them)-Missions are extremely difficult (type smartb.a.s.t.a.r.d in-game while playing to skip them, without the full stops)-No idea why the Carmageddon series does this, but a lot of keys you can't use, WASD is a no-go, simply doesn't allow it for some reason-Later missions get rediculously tough if you don't upgrade your car often-Can't go back to previous missions until you've finished the gameSound: 6/10Graphics: 4/10 (very dated obviously, was released in 1998 after all, but is easy on the eyes)Gameplay: 9.5/10Content/Replayability: 9.5/10Overall: 9.5/10Although there's almost more cons than pros, they're all very, very minor but I thought I'd just point them out. It doesn't look like it but the positives far outway the negatives. This game is soooo good and very cheap. Get it, the mobile version of the original and Carmageddon TDR2000 (well, most people don't like that one, but I do) and you're set.			"

												you see, the game is very cool and soundtrack is great. A great classic in short, has a different gameplay a racing game, but entertains a lot.the problem is that version. U will need to delete two files to get the game open in Win7 or> and thus u lose the sound tilha (Goodbye Iron).It kills a lot of the atmosphere of the game and the game always presents small crashes and trouble off.If u want a 100% working version of Carmagedon, this version is not for u. If you want to know or remember only can you have fun.I finished the game even with these problems and had fun, but it could have been much betterveja bem, o jogo é muito legal e trilha sonora é ótima. Um grande classico em resumo, tem uma jogabilidade diferente de um jogo de corrida, mas diverte e muito.o problema é essa versão. Vc vai precisar deletar 2 arquivos para o jogo conseguir abrir no Win7 ou > e com isso vc perde a tilha sonora (Adeus Iron). Isso mata muito da atmosfera do jogo e o jogo sempre apresenta pequenos travamentos e problemas para desligar.Se vc quer uma versão 100% funcional de Carmagedon, essa versão não é para vc. Caso queira só conhecer ou relembrar pode ser que se divirta.Eu terminei o jogo mesmo com esses problemas e me diverti, mas poderia ter sido muito melhor			"

												I had very fond memories of this game. Those memories are wrong. Even the age of the game cant excuse how unresponsive the controls are, the poor design of... well.. everything really. Worst of all, it's just not fun.I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. I used to like it. But games have just moved on too much. There are some games that have stood the test of time and remain popular due to their quality, playability or awesomeness - Diablo II is 16 years old and still huge - but Carmageddon II is not one of them. By today's standards, it's virtually unplayable.I got it cheap in the summer sale, so I'm not angry. I'm just very disappointed.			"

												The sequel to one of my favourite games ever. You kids will have no idea what Carmageddon is, but it was a brilliant but controversial racing game from waaay back in '98.This improves on the original in almost every way. The mission mode adds some variety, and some of the new cars are awesome, but otherwise the core mechanics remain from the first. If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it, right?The driving mechanics are actually quite ""realistic"" i.e. cars have real weight and momentum and you won't be making hairpin turns at anything over 40mph. I personally prefer realistic to arcade style driving games so I like it here.The controversy centres around the fact that basically, pedestrians on the map are a resource. Killing them gets you money and time, and doing it in funny or novel ways will get you a bonus. If you have psycho-sociopathic tendencies, please do not play this game. If you are a normal person and realise that the actions within this game are, in context, hilarious and entertaining, I can't recommend Carmageddon 2 enough. I think it's slightly better than the original, and that's saying a lot from me :)			"

												One of my favorite games when I was young. It's still fun splattering pedestrians and smashing the other racers into oblivion. Honestly though, just buy the new Carmageddon: Reincarnation which comes with Carma 2 and the other games in the series. Plus, it really seems to capture all of the fun of the old Carma games with graphics that don't look like they were designed on a potato. It does run well on my current machine, which is nice, but after battering my way down memory lane for a bit, I realized I'd rather just play Reincarnation instead.But seriously, it was a really cool move on the developer's (Stainless) part to not only get these games on Steam, but to give them away to everyone who bought their new game. I would have happily dropped $10 on a Carma old-school pack, but instead I'm going to spend that $10 on something frivolous and possibly illegal.			"

What I liked about the game •	The game play is still very addictive and fun. The game has full 3D graphics this time round, so when you run over pedestrians you have a chance to dismember them.•	Tons of awesome power ups, which can affect your vehicle in positive and negative ways. •	When you complete a level you have a chance to purchase another opponent's vehicle.     •	You have manic missions now. One per group. This brings more variety to the mission groups.  •	Many cars to waste and purchase. Cars can now smash apart.•	The maps feel more alive. The pedestrians are now driving vehicles (cars and planes). You also have plenty of time to explore the maps. •	Not as repetitive as the first Carmageddon. A new map is introduced in every  group.   What I disliked or was disappointed with •	The game can be frustrating (other vehicles, timer, flipping car over and yourself). •	The soundtrack can get very repetitive. •	The manic missions are overall very good and they do bring more variety to the game, but some of them, in my opinion are too difficult, for example I had to use a cheat to stop the timer for two of the races and with a another manic mission I had to look up on Youtube to find out how to complete it.•The pedestrians don't look as good graphically, as compared to the first game.    •When you come to using the much bigger vehicles in the game like the bus, you will have to switch the camera from 3rd person to 1st person. There is no option to zoom out in 3rd person, the camera is too close to the vehicle, this makes driving the bigger vehicles almost impossible and you are unable to look around and see whats going on. Conclusion I really enjoyed Carmageddon 2, better than the first game, in my opinion. If you enjoyed the first game, I highly recommend you buy this. 77/100			"

												Casual driving game, avoid pedestrians and other racers, try to run laps as fast as you can. It is a family friend game just like the first one!Technical tip:If your game doesn't load your latest save, then go to settings and set Auto Load to On, then restart the game.			"

												Great game, I mainly use it for a stress reliever. Basically, the concept is to run over people. If I had to say how old u should be to play this, I'd say 10 because you can turn off blood			"

												Ok so it doesn't look that great now but back in the day it was pretty sweet looking and it has some technology that was, and still kind of is, impressive. It was an improvement from the first game and overall still holds onto the madness that is Carmageddon.There's enough here to keep the game fresh and fun without steering away (pun completely intended) from what Carmageddon is all about.

												I can't get this game to open. it claims to need to be closed before I can exit steam. according to my task manager it is not open. I read about the appcache fix and that did not work either. obviously ive restarted my computer but that did not help. otherwise this game is pretty cool if you can get it to work.			"

												A cult game and still as fun and timeless. Carmageddon 2 has revolutionized the concept of Free Driving Sandbox game with its own style (ex: Pedestrians killing and full of hilarious and delirious stuff...). A total success for the times. My favorite one I think. A game reserved for nostalgic fans. Note: Many thanks to Steam and all people who allowed us to play it today again!			"

												carma2 is my ultimate, many happy hours spent playing this so to get it back on Steam is tremendous.many involving maps, great cars and characters and Car handling matched to a good game Level of gravity all mix up into hours and hours of playability. carma reincarnation is a perfect example of evolution for revolutions sake. Stick with the best  and original until they get the plot back!			"

												Well... Regardless of how much time passed or what trends came and go or what movie-like look the games have these days...THIS GAME IS THE ♥♥♥♥.Back in time, there were brewtal games around like Doom, Duke 3D or GTA I-II with their morbid sense of humour but not a single game could blow the fuse of the conformists so efficiently like Carmageddon. It was fun and violent and of course developers were heavily criticised. They listened to these voices really seriously when they planned the next move.So, Carmageddon 2 screams a huge ♥♥♥♥ OFF! message for critics and the society in general as it did twice as much of everything that the first game with twice as much gore. Below the actual surface of a gore destruction derby you can find some raw punk - anarchist attitude. If you had any problem with the system, the conformity or hypocrisy of the society, it could easily became your fav game as the main plot is a big '♥♥♥♥ you' message to conformism in general. As far as I know, this game reached a cult status in most of underground rock and metalhead gamers, at least among the ones that I know. We burned months off our lifetimes while playing with each other via LAN. The sandbox-like gameplay and nasty attitude has paved the way for games like GTA III but you can find its attitude in any game that shows a middle finger to conformity.Sure, Carma II looks old and outdated. So what? Wacky and fun physics + causing mayhem never gets old.			"

Product received for free
What I liked about the game •	The game play is still very addictive and fun. The game has full 3D graphics this time round, so when you run over pedestrians you have a chance to dismember them.•	Tons of awesome power ups, which can affect your vehicle in positive and negative ways. •	When you complete a level you have a chance to purchase another opponent's vehicle.     •	You have manic missions now. One per group. This brings more variety to the mission groups.  •	Many cars to waste and purchase. Cars can now smash apart.•	The maps feel more alive. The pedestrians are now driving vehicles (cars and planes). You also have plenty of time to explore the maps. •	Not as repetitive as the first Carmageddon. A new map is introduced in every  group.   What I disliked or was disappointed with •	The game can be frustrating (other vehicles, timer, flipping car over and yourself). •	The soundtrack can get very repetitive. •	The manic missions are overall very good and they do bring more variety to the game, but some of them, in my opinion are too difficult, for example I had to use a cheat to stop the timer for two of the races and with a another manic mission I had to look up on Youtube to find out how to complete it.•The pedestrians don't look as good graphically, as compared to the first game.    •When you come to using the much bigger vehicles in the game like the bus, you will have to switch the camera from 3rd person to 1st person. There is no option to zoom out in 3rd person, the camera is too close to the vehicle, this makes driving the bigger vehicles almost impossible and you are unable to look around and see whats going on. Conclusion I really enjoyed Carmageddon 2, better than the first game, in my opinion. If you enjoyed the first game, I highly recommend you buy this. 77/100			"

												I like this game and I enjoy playing it, I like the car psyics and damge. But there is no music and the game tends to crash a lot and even crashes when you close the game after done playing. But despite that, the game is a classic. I use to love playing it when I was a kid but this game doesnt have the grittyness like the first game had, but for me I rate Carma2 a 7/10  This game is worth the 10 bucks!			"
