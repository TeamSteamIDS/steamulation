												Nail'd may be the best $1.24 I've ever spent on Steam.This game plays like the classic PS2 game ATV Offroad Fury, with better graphics, bigger maps, and a turbo on your ATV. Disclaimer: This is not real racing. You spend as much time in the air as you do on the ground. You can steer your vehicle in the air.But hot damn, it's fun. It lacks 2-player support. The soundtrack isn't the best. But the game is a blast to play, and it *does* support my Xbox controller. Try the demo.			"

In Nail'd you will crash a lot, at least in the beginning, maybe even accompanied with some cursing, but you after learn the tracks, both will be reduced. But lets not jump ahead to the gameplay and continue with the options. There are a lot video option (texture quality, material quality, shadows, texture filtering  and so on) to make the game run on slower machines. The game came out in 2010 and I can safely say it looks decent 4 years later. I was quite surprise from the audio option. You can manage every sound in the game – engine, music in game and in the menus, environment and so on. As a hole the audio is okay. The engines sound okay and the music is decent, fits really well with the game. Also you can adjust the brightness and rebind keys on the keyboard. And honestly, you need to, because by default they are weird. You can play with 360 controller, but controls are absolutely fine with the keyboard.After you set up all the option, it's time to choose male or female character, some clothes for them and atv or dirt bike. For your driver customizations are limited just to clothes, but you can change parts on your vehicle. They are unlocked just by playing the game and they have advantages and disadvantages.The gameplay is arcade. Here the gravity is not the master. What I mean is, you can do extremely ridiculous jumps. And the sense of speed is amazing. This maybe is one of the few games where I don't mind the motion blur. Even if I want to I can't turn it off. In the beginning, before I get used to the sense of speed, I often missed some turns. Interesting thing in the gameplay is the steering in the air and leaning to adjust your jump. In other words – you almost fly.There are 4 types of races – single lap, 3 laps, time challenge and stunt race. The first 3 are self explanatory. The stunt race is a little bit different. They are not stunts in a traditional sense. In this mode points are given if you drive through fire gates and circles, make wheelie and few others. And of course, here also matter if you finish in first place and how much you were in front of the other players. That way you can win a race, even if you didn't make enough stunts. All of them give you boost. My favorite way of getting it is to fall down on someone or push them in to obstacles. This can happen to you too. Other interesting thing is the mutators. They are constant boost or no collision.To work everything I said about the gameplay, you need really good tracks. This is the case here. The design is great, even the environments are good – village, harbor, forest, canyon and others. Every track have different routs to take, but not all of them are shortcuts. Also in some tracks there are obstacles like falling rocks, but they are easily avoidable and stop being a surprise after a while.One of the things I didn't like is the difficulty. I played on medium. The first half of the game I didn't have any problems with the AI. Then the difficulty jumps high for a few tracks. After them I was winning every race again without a problem. But biggest issue here is the repetition. It's kind get boring after a while, because there isn't enough variety. Since this is old game the online multiplayer is dead, but if you have some friends there is LAN, it's such rare thing to see these days.I never played racing game with such sense of speed and adrenalin. Some compare it to MotorStorm. Even with the repetition, which comes at some point, this is still a solid game. If you have friends to play it gets even better. I recommend it.			"

												nail'd is one of those games designed to flick all the ""HELL ♥♥♥♥ING YEAH!"" switches in your brain. Normally when I play a racing game, I'm super serious. No, that doesn't mean I play Gran Turismo, Forza, Project Cars, or any other simulation. I'm a fan of arcade racers like Daytona USA, Outrun 2, Ridge Racer, and so on. All of my attention is focused on making those expertly crafted turns, weaving past my rivals, and powersliding. I don't care about realism, but games that emphasize your opponent's destruction (Burnout) don't do anything for me. I have to admit, nail'd flicks my switches real good.This is an ATV/MX racer, with some vehicle customization. Sim-fans are going to be shown the door immediately, since the first thing they'll notice are stats like ""boost acceleration"" and ""mid-air steering"". It's expected that at least 1/5 of the mileage you put into this game, will be spent in the air. Each track is composed of ramps, hills, slopes, cliffs, and other structures designed to get you high. The tracks are also loaded with obstacles such as trees, rocks, trucks, trains, and so on on.Unlike the arcade-racers I usually play, collisions aren't an automatic restart in nail'd. You're always in the race, and you lose maybe 1/2 a second or so when you crash. However, keeping up with the pack (and winning) requires that you boost. Boost is acquired via certain gates, mid-air rings, perfect landings, wheelies, going fast, and even wrecking your rivals. That last one actually doesn't come up very often in a race, which is why I love it. With Burnout and its ilk, the pacing starts to become effected when it seems like every few seconds I'm watching a cut-scene of a burning wreck. What was once awesome, gets really tiring. Knocking your rivals out in nail'd works because there aren't any cut-scenes. Everything moves so quickly that it takes you a second to realize ""Did I just do that? Holy crap!"" At one point I jumped off a ramp and actually landed on someone, destroying them instantly, I was so freaked out I crashed twice in a row. There are other moments like this, like the time I got so much air I actually rode on top of a hot-air balloon. nail'd is an extreme racer sure, but it also has a touch of subtlety. It rewards players for doing the unexpected. The tracks are designed to accomodate rather than frustrate, giving racers room to look for shortcuts and opportunities to score more boost. This is likely one of those ""you already own this"" titles due to its appearance in bundles. Do yourself a favor and give it a go.Also it might be a trick of perspective, but the racers in this game have phat behinds.			"

												★★★★☆ This is an extremely fun racer. The sense of speed is incredible. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the lack of multiplayer. I did beat the entire first person mode, so if you enjoy a really challenging racer even in a single player campaign? Then you really should pick this one up. The graphics and sound are all great. The music is alright and keeps you going as fast as the game does. You will soar like you've never experienced, in the air nearly as much as on the ground. Learn to control it and you'll be rewarded with a rush like no other. It's a good purchase. Oh, and the partial controller support icon on the store page? I used an Xbox 360 compatable joystick just fine.			"

												Got it in a bundle, and while I don't hate it, it is just a little too arcade than what I was looking for.  I remember playing SSX a ski game thinking about how the physics were just too unrealistic.  This reminds me of that.It's an inexpensive game, and if you like arcade-style racing, you will probably get your money's worth.  It just isn't my kind of game.7.5/10 in a bundle5/10 at full retailadd a point to account for my bias.			"

												I like this game for what it is; a fast, over the top, pure arcade racer. Beware, there's no realism to be found here! The game has a great sense of speed. You can make ridiculous high jumps! While racing, you can earn boost with performing tricks, like flying through a hoop, to go even faster. There's the ability to adjust your vehicle for better speed, acceleration, handling on the ground or in the air. Yes, you can steer your vehicle while flying through the air :) Basically, all the thing you would expect from a game like this. It looks pretty good too and it's also really cheap. You would expect a much higher price for a game of this quality. So, if you are interested in the genre, you should pick it up. Especially for this little money.			"

												SHORT: For £1 its not a bad game but its a bit buggy, but its a very fun arcade racer. LONG: It is an off road all terrain vehicle racer. One thing you will immediately realize is that this game is incredibly fast and very arcade-y. It is all about how fast you can go while staying on the course and going through the ups and downs that you will face. Nail’d is extreme racing that has you flying off cliffs, over trains, up the side of a tunnel and much more. You will have to have quick reflexes as a course suddenly changes direction on you or if you need to try and negotiate a landing without landing face first into a wall.			"

												A nice little nostalgia trip,this game appears to be made by the same people as the original monster jam game.(y'know the one. It was on Wii,DS,PS2 and PC. not path of destruction,urban assault,MTM2 or rigs of rods,it was just ""Monster Jam"")Or at least these guys are pretty darn close because the handling is nearly identical,as is the soundtrack. Of course,they use newer songs of the same genre,but put on five horse john's missisipi king and omigosh it is nearly the same game.Of course,you do not drive monster trucks rather ATV quads and Motor Cross bikes. I can't help but see the bikes as the motorcross before the Monster Jam show,and the ATV's as the Monster Jam trucks,but that's probably from the coincidentally similar gameplay styles.However,the thing that sets this apart from that series is the customization. You can change colors of every part of your rides,making both the bike and ATV have different paintjobs. Then you can edit your driver. Make them male or female and apply one of 8 color schemes. I believe you unlock more as the game progresses.You have to make a profile for some reason,which is odd since this isn't multiplayer. However,with the ""remember my password"" just a simple press of the log-in button can have you racing twoards victory in no time. Again,this was a welcome surprise as it sent me on another nostalgia trip as the (what a shocker),ORIGINAL MONSTER JAM GAME did this too!Sorry for the constant comparison,but i'm seriously curious about all the similarities between this and the Monster Jam game.Of course,the tracks also show some similarities,some welcome similarities at that! You can fly through the air like in the MJ game,and some of the obstacles are pretty similar.Of course,unlike that game this time you can feel the power of these vehicles kicking up dirt and rocks,and it's remarkable! A+ on realism guys,awesome job!Unfortunately,there are one or two nitpicks.First off,the hitboxes on the tracks are questionable at best. I went flying under a curved,arch-shaped rock and it said i hit it. Then,i flew past a rock with a tire width between me and it and i still hit it.I wouldn't mind it if they added a damage system. Not like a performance limiting one such as N'14,but one where you hit something a chunk of your vehicle flies off like in the old MJ game this is so similar to.But one tiny impact and your driver and vehicle graphically burst as the screen fades to black,white and grey and eventually total darkness with some splatters here and there.And the respawn takes a whopping 30 seconds of in-game time,meaning one crash can absolutely DEVASTATE your lap time. This isn't uncommon among racing games though,so even if it is a minor annoyance this game isn't at fault.I also dislike you cannot mix colors and paint jobs. If you put on the ""graffiti"" one for example it makes the vehicle black and red. I turned the ATV yellow but when i applied the decal it switched the base color back to black! Every paint job i try does this. But that's just my customization freak mind,not a real problem in the game.In the end i gotta give this game an excellent rating of 5 stars. all games have problems,sure,but this isn't ment to be cutting edge i don't think,i think this was meant as a nice little reminder of some of the great racers of the past,and even the LOADING screen gave me that impression.Any racing game lover HAS to pick this up,it is a gem in any racing game collection!

												I'm bored today. so I'm going to do another review.*ahem*Sooooo...you DEFINITELY maybe want to get this game...if it's on sale for $1.This game is like FUEL if it were obsessed with catching air and -like my friend is with his 'your mom' jokes- it just doesn't know WHEN TO STOP sometimes.Nail'd is a fun game, and I really like it. but just for short bursts.CONS:- it's all about dat racing (there are a few challenges and modifiers throughout tournament mode, but nothing that changes your core objective, to be 1st place)- 3 laps takes too long on some of the courses (for a filthy casual like me)- No cool mid-air tricks (aka. no animations for tricks)NEUTRALS:+/- rockin' music thinks it's better than it is (OR they just need more songs on rotation)+/- online Multiplayer does NOT function+/- customizable clothing, gear, equipment, vehicles...but it's all just 'Meh' nothing to be excited aboutPROS:> catch EXTREME AIR> have a lot of boost/nitro capacity> you can kinda run other racers off the road so they crash into stuff & that's kinda awesomeSo as you can tell, I'm kind of divided on this game. Personally, I wish there was more variety to the game, like with different modes (combat-based, mini-games, et cetera) or perhaps a free-roam mode (what can I say, I loved FUEL). But that said, the core game in Nail'd is still strong and fun for what it is.TL;DR= If I had to pick: It is a NO for me at regular price. And a CAUTIOUS YES for me IF IT'S ON SALE (for 1 dollar or less). However, if you really like arcade-y, EXtreme-air type offroad RACING games that almost make you feel like you have super-powers, then it could be a (stronger) YES recommendation for you. :)-----edit [03/04/2016]: originally I said ""too many races to advance to the next tournament (okay, I get it. it's a racing game, but do I really need to do 18 laps (9 on the same track) to even advance past the most AMATEUR LEAGUE?)""I realize now tournament mode is actually relatively short. it's just 6 races, then a seperate cup to advance. (rinse, repeat, and add one more cup for the finale.)I was thinking you had to do EVERY race in your bracket, as if there was a glitch in the game. it's hard to explain, but now I see the game works how I originally THOUGHT it was supposed to be.edit 2 [09-22-2016]: added ""no cool tricks"" to Cons sectionedit 3 [01-05-2017] moved one pro and 2 cons to 'Neutrals' section. it's only fair.

												I BELIEVE I CAN FLY! I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SK-- *CRASH*I've to say...THIS IS THE BEST OFF-ROAD RACING GAME YOU CAN GET FOR $1.24 THIS HOLIDAY. Why? Okay...do you want a game where you could crash your bike through Burj Khalifa, race through it, and jump all the way down to a ramp while a dozen of other opponents chase you for the lead? Do you want a game where you could perform epic wins in midair without breaking your limbs in real life? DO YOU...want a game that is just as good as sex and pizza? Yes?Then you're in the right place. While this game won't give you a boner or make your tongue water due to the smell of the pizza topping that comes with an aroma of tender meat and cheese, it will certainly give you the rush of adrenaline you'd crave from many high-flying games (like Double Action: Boogaloo). The game doesn't let you do stunts like flips and spins (or maybe I haven't unlocked it yet) but if you're a flying speed freak like me, the jumps, curves, and air rush will be enough to keep you preoccupied for the rest of the track. The game isn't serious compared to the other biking games but it knows how to be a good lover and will remain faithful to your expectations as long as you have it (that is unless you've spent 1000+ hours on it you need something different).TL;DR: If you're looking for a sim, go somewhere else.

												This is probably the most fun I've had with a racing game in a while. It is crazy, intense, over-the-top, and has massive sprawiling courses. The graphics are decent, it has a small but good soundtrack, and decent customization. However, there are a few issues that I have here and there. The first being the lack of maps; there are roughly 12 different maps, and though they are all good, you will end up doing ewach one probably between 5 and 7 times each, and that gets pretty repetative. The customization is decent, but it seems to have little to no effect on how your vehicle drives, weather you're a motocross bike or an ATV. Either way, for $5, this is a really solid experience full of fun. I'm not a race game fan, so it didn't hold my attention too long, but while it did this game was really freaking fun.			"

												The top-rated review at the time of writing this review starts with the following line:    ""Nail'd may be the best $1.24 I've ever spent on Steam.""I paid £3.99, and I really did not expect much. For a game that is 6 years old, the graphics aren't that bad. Also, the gameplay is ridiculously fast.This isn't a driving simulation... but it is likely to be one of the most adrenaline-fueled arcade driving game you will ever play.£3.99 isn't too much to lose... and anyway, if you don't like, just refund it. :)			"

												Well.... if you have a controller and like some arcadey racing which looks and plays well, it's def worth the $1.24 it cost me on sale. I think I will enjoy finishing this.EDIT - on much further playing - this game TOTALLY ROCKS. For a demented adrenaline rush of awesome off road racing, this (along with Mad Riders) is my go to game on PC. The sense of breakneck speed and being on the verge of losing control is constant and you will have spectacular wipeouts and heart pounding wrecks with other riders and terrain features. The closest I can come to describing the sense of speed is the Burnout series from the PS2 era. I really like using the bike as opposed to the ATVs.I guess I am amongst the fortunate people for whom these games run. The Comm pages seem to have a lot of disgruntled purchasers for whom the games do not work at all and that is a shame because they are a blast.			"

												Naild is an overdose excitement atv-bmx game with a progression tree and bikes and atvs modifications. I realy enjıoy playing this crazy racing game for a while but it will feel repetitive after sometime. Therefore i recommend it if it is cheap.Here are the cons.Online system is not working anymore. You have to cerate an offline profile in the game.Visuals are average.Driving physics are not realistic.AI is ridicculous :DTracks feel the same after some time.There are some glitches in driving mechanics but it is afordable.But here is the reasons why are you going to like this game:Soundtrack suits the game.The game is not demanding at all. And visually well optimized.Driving super speed and being able to move quieckly around is fun.There are lots of high jumps in every track. I think this is what the game is created for :DVeichle customizations effects the driiving a lot.If you are looking for challenge, the game will push you to limits.Gameplay is fluid as it should be in this kind of game.The game makes you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ :)Overall, not a perfect game and does not worth much money and time, but it is fun to try for fun when you are bored.

												Even in the world of arcade racers, this one seems uninspired.  No reasons not to just mash on the throttle for an entire race, and just do your best to avoid the obstacles.  Big jumps, but no tricks or anything to keep you occupied while flying through the air.  Even on 'Hard' difficulty there's no real challenge - get out in front and the AI won't bother to catch you no matter how many times you crash.  Good thing it only cost a dollar.			"

												If there's one game genre that keeps getting outdone by itself, it has to be racing games.nail'd is of the latest games in that arms race.And after spending a while with simulators where you're trying to find a tenth of a second on one corner, nothing could be as refreshing as a racing game where you spend around one quarter of the time on the track, well, off the track - in the air. nail'd delivers high-flying racing on ATVs and motocross bikes, and while it purposely skips things like performing stunts, its seemingly drug-induced brand of ridiculous racing hardly needs any of that to be exciting.Playing nail'd is like controlling a Choose Your Own Adventure rollercoaster with a gamepad. Its tracks have massive ups and downs, completely unrealistic verticals - like not just crossing a canyon, but actually diving down into it, and landing it perfectly - and a sense of speed that's unparalleled in the motocross racing genre.nail'd does come with some downsides, though. While the tracks are fantastic and have lots of routes for you to go through, the developers often actually punish you for going too fast or too high, as you'll often crash into stuff in mid-air if you're going too fast.Despite the lack of depth to your racing strategy, nail'd is still a blast and a half for at least a while, and the online play works nicely - if you can find people online to play with, that is. The console versions are fine, but the PC version of the game was completely devoid of players on launch day.Nail'd is arcade driving taken to the extreme. A fun game over all, which engages you tu run and jump at incredible velocities.			"

												I love racing games and this one has that intence speed feeling I've been craving for. You can select a motorcycle or an atv, along with paint job and a few customizable parts to change the stats to your vehical. The courses are hazardous and difficult to not crash on with multiple paths to take, criss-crossing all over the forest or tundra. The one thing i hate about this though are the stunt competitions. The only stunt you can perform is a wheelie....so you have to rely on either landing on or crashing other people, and going through boost barriers.			"

												Highly recommend at a sale price (75% off) if you enjoy fast arcade racers with huge jumps. A simple pick up and play title offering quick highs best enjoyed in short bursts.+ Amazing sense of speed+ Visually appealing+ Stable performance+ Enjoyable original soundtrack+ Works with Xbox 360 Controller and Kb/m- Cannot do 'tricks' in mid-air- Limited vehicle/character customisation- Not enough tracks/modes- Online play not available anymoreNail'd is an arcade racer which is completely worth the discounted price I paid for.  It has an incredible sense of speed when boosting through the tracks and some of the environments (Mediterranean and Snowy Mountains) still looks great considering it was first released in 2010.However, throughout the campaign you'll race along the same tracks enough times to feel its repetitiveness and there's not enough variation in the different gametypes to fix this. You'll largely be doing the same thing in every mode which is racing through the track at breakneck speed (which may or may not be a bad thing).The A.I opponent difficulty never gets too hard but did stay on my tail towards the end of the game. Personally I had more trouble navigating some tracks than competing with the bots.Customisation of my vehicle and character came as an afterthought because if you're not actively seeking this feature out, there's not much reason to tinker with it. The performance of the stock vehicle seemed fine for me.Worked fine on Win 7 64-bit, finished single player in 9 hours.			"

GAME WORKS ONLY OFFLINE. BUT IT'S REALLY AWESOME!!!First let me say this game makes all other racing games I own seem boring. It's so crazy and addictive, so fast-paced and challenging - I LOVE it! If you're a fan of fast arcade off-road racing games, then this title is for you and I recommend it. But if you're more into realistic racing simulation games, well... I'd still recommend it, but don't expect that here. This game is not about being realistic, it's about being fun and CRAZY.Now for the technical stuff. This game requires you to create a profile and because of this it got many negative reviews, because the online registration doesn't work (all servers are down). Because of this I even refounded the game myself and gave it a negative review, but after searching the forums I found out that you can actually make an OFFLINE PROFILE. After reading that, I bought the game again and now I am a VERY happy customer. It's incredibly fun. :)The game is definitely worth the normal price, but if you can get it on sale, it's a steal. Just don't try to create an online profile, because it won't work. Instead, make sure you change the create/recover internet profile to ''Create local profile''. Then it will work.


Online Profiles are dead, switch to Local Profile if you want to play this game.

If you are O.k. with the fact that you can't play the game online anymore (that is the only ''flaw'' I can find in the game) and if you're O.k. with the fact that the jumps in the game aren't realistic (it's not a realistic race simulator, but it is a very fun arcade racing game), then you'll probably be as happy with the game as I am. As far as I'm concerned the game is REALLY good and worth it. Recommended for purchase.			"

Wasn't till after that when I realised there was no online multiplayer, nor any offline multiplayer. None whatsoever. This decision competely kills the longevity of Nail'd for me.

												Nail'd is an insane, over-the-top crash&burn racer something like Burnout in feel, but on ATV or MTX vehicles.The Chrome Engine is used to great effect here. It looks gorgeous and runs butter smooth. The handling model is appropriately arcade, with some subtle hints of challenging handling model, namely in the need to rotate your vehicle in the air to ensure a safe/fast landing. The reward for taking that control is that you will get boost added to your gauge for every landing you make that is perfect.The level design is pretty awesome as well. The tracks sprawl and are completely populated with tons of set pieces and hazards that make the race even more engaging. All of the tracks also employ sections that completely disregard gravity or the laws of physics, and it makes for some really fun sections of track.Sound design is adequate, and the soundtrack is a pretty solid metal affair. It is in the game directory in OGG format, so that is pretty awesome as well.To further the enjoyment, there are a wealth of new parts you can unlock and install on either your ATV or MTX vehicle. The interesting thing, unlike most racers with ""upgrades"", is that these parts aren't always a clear betterment to the ones you have installed. Each part carries some bonus or some malus with it, so it is up to you to choose the parts that will balance the various characterstics of your ride as you see fit. Really nice depth to tuning there.Overall, a pure arcade racer with some awesome levels, interesting upgrade system, and great presentation.Get it for cheap, give it a go.			"

												Constant sensation of ultimate speed is the players companion throughout the game. Lightning-fast reflexes and tactical skills are what stands between victory and defeat. Breakneck rides on near vertical mountainsides with up to 70-degree slopes - feel your heart pumping! Extreme track design with breathtaking vistas - learning the inside-outs of their topography will be an advantage in the race for #1. Steer your vehicle mid air allowing for full control over your ride. Shortening or lengthening your jumps, changing angles can make or break your lap time. Assemble your own vehicles from a wide selection of parts and components. Adjust their parameters to best suit your playing style and personalize the looks, making it unique and truly your own.			"

												Boy, this is gonna an unpopular review, but... Nail'd is garbage.I like this genre of racers-- the tricks, the constant speed, the excitement that so many others manage to capture. Why can't Nail'd do it?Well, for one, because it's impossible to lose.Even at the hardest difficulties, I never, ever finished in anything but first place. Even if I constantly crash my bike, I respawn farther ahead than I was before, so it doesn't set me back in the slightest.I'd still manage to have fun if I could perform tricks, race to awesome music, or at least race on a decent track, but this is just so... boring.There are no tricks in Nail'd. There's, um... going through gates. Those refill your nitrous. What skill.The tracks are bland and repetitive. There's really not much else to say, is there? I might as well describe the flashlight on my desk. It's black, but the switch is dark blue. It's more interesting than this game.The music's better off muted. There aren't many songs, and they all suck.If you consider yourself a gamer of good taste, spare yourself and buy Mad Riders instead. It has a variety of tricks, a sense of speed, a more exciting soundtrack, and pretty maps. Much less of an eyesore than endless desert.			"

												Nail'd could have been an average generic racer if it wasn't for a huge flaw: the driving mechanics. Everything is unpredictable. The way the gravity will react, the way the vehicle is going to respond when landing after a jump, or even if you're going to grip or not. This makes for a very unpleasant experience, not helped by the amount of glitches. Sometimes you can pull one-wheel wheelies because the engine glitches, sometimes you will crash into invisible walls, sometimes you will crash face first while trying to land, and much more. This is why I can't recommend the game.This is a shame, because it has all the basics for an enjoyable little racing game. The graphics are decent (apart for the ugly and nearly headache-inducing shake filter when boosting), sound design isn't too unpleasant and there are some interesting ride and rider customization options. The game still has the same faults you can find on pretty much every relatively low budget racing game:- nail'd becomes a bit boring as you start powering through it. The limited amount of tracks (12) compared to amount of races (around 70-80) means you'll be going around the same tracks again and again, which completely nullifies the point of having branching tracks and scripted set pieces. You'll have to learn the optimal line around a track to be able to beat the AI.- Horrible, inconsistent AI. The AI will teleport itself, it will drive through you, it will do impossible moves. But it will be slow nonetheless. There are only a couple of near end-game events where the AI cheats enough to be challenging. In most races, it's easy to gain a 5 second lead and never let go of it.- Generic locations and art-style. While I did appreciate the mediterranean caricature, the three other environments are painfully generic. Generic desert area with huge rock formations and a western movie styled town. Generic jungle area with mud, too many trees and some wood bridges. Generic snow area with snow covered mountains. Generic vehicles with generic paintjobs.On the technical side, since it's running on Techland's engine you'll have to deal with all sorts of bugs and issues depending on your configuration and the moon's phase.

												Absolutely HORRID. The worst, by far, driving or vehicle based game of any kind since Desert Bus and Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing. The physics are maniacal! You can take a 180 Degree corner at 60MPH on a quad bike, INSTANTLY. No loss of speed, no loss of traction. Just flipped around. Jumping physics are simply hilarious. One minute, you will be going 20MPH, hit a SMALL ramp, and fly a good 300 Meters. The next, Going 90MPH and hit a LARGE jump, you are on the ground 50 feet away in about two seconds. If you get a good laugh out of sheer frustration and disgust as well as mind-boggling stupidity, this is the one for you.EDIT: Everyone that dislikes this review, go play PURE on the 360 if you haven't already (It's like $5 everywhere you can find Xbox 360 games). It's this.. but not terrible. I'm comparing this to PURE, because the similiarities are simply un-ignorable. PURE is a good arcade quad game, this is not.			"

												the game with its arcade speed and crazy jumps is fun in the beginning but gets repetitive and boring pretty fast because of the lack of a considerable amount of different tracks. the only difference later on are the play modes race, time trial and ""stunt"" (where driving thru gates or landing on your wheels are considered as stunts) which does not really enhance variety. so be prepared to drive the same few tracks over and over until you see the finish line of the single player part (multiplayer is not available any more). and just like the tracks the music will repeat itself over and over which is so annoying that you soon want to turn it off. it´s an ok arcade racer as an occasional snack but far away from a delicious meal. i wouldn´t buy it again, so i can´t recommend it.edit: interestingly hardly one of the supporters (positive reviews) played the game longer than three hours. if you just plan to sink one afternoon in it, go for it, because you barely will notice repetition and it will be fun... ;-) i guess i also would have rated it positive after a short session since the repetition is its greatest drawback!

												I was dissapointed at first because I couldnt create a profile in the main screen, their servers were down. Then I clicked the arrow to get to Lan mode, where I could create a profile. I wanted to play the game, but couldnt because it didnt recognise any of the controllers I plugged into the PC. It seemed to only want an Xbox controller. I did want to give the game itself a chance, so I used a program called XPadder to make the game think I was using my keyboard where I was really using my controller, just assigned the buttons in the program, done.What I got after this effort was worth it, this is one of the most adrenaline packed racing games I have come across so far. Its a shame the multiplayer isnt working as this is an awesome game to me. Especially the unlimited boost races they are a real rush. I prefer the motorcycles to the MTX. Yeah, thumbs up from me. I think this would still make for an epic multiplayer game on any LAN or over hamachi it should even be possible to play online together. Btw. If a free version of Xpadder says its uncompatible in Win 7, just run it in Win XP compatability mode, then you can assign your buttons. Also you must start Xpadder before starting the game each time.			"

												This game could be interesting and amazing, could be very funbutit crashes a lot.I'm trying to play the tournament, but I can't , nine of ten times the game give me a crash to desktop, oh my god, wtfI can't recommend this for anyone, sorry.  I regret to buy and waste my time with this POS, even I bought in a sale.If you're looking for casual fun racing, I can recommend Ridge Racer Unbounded, FlatOut, Need for Speed, Grid...Just editing to be more clear: I like the game, it's very fun, it's very nice! It's a good game just to relax and play for fun. The problem is: the game crashes a lot, most of times the game crashes. If I go options and change one thing and apply, game crashes. I try to play the tournament, if I'm luck I can play one map, then when go to next map, game crashes. Then I try do play again to continue, game crashes for six to ten times. Then I can play, ow yeahhh, nice. Then go next map, game crashes again. So bad :( The game is fun, but has technical problems, and because this you waste more time trying to play than playing.			"

												I have not had much time with the game. The good first grapics and sense of speed is great and it works fine for windows 7 64bit with no issue. I do have a few issues with the game though despite the good sense of speed sometimes it moves to fast for its own good and sometimes your driver will hit a leaf and crash out. Sometimes he will hit a cactus and live to tell the tale. Slightly annoying. Invisible walls abound inside the track. You wont see them but a respawn be coming your way if you hit one. Got this for a the Price of $1dollar so I am not complaining. The music is hard rock but I like it however its a little loud on default settings. Other then the invisible walls, and leaves killing my rider its a fun and good looking game.I do have one other nitpick the pick your own parts for your bike is junk. It takes away at least as much it replaces. Now I understand why they did this its for the online play to keep it all fair. However why even offer it? It seems like a waste and not very well thought out. Also the online portion for the pc is now dead and buried. So its a waste of resources even bothering with this option.			"

												The first thing I noticed when starting the tutorial race was the field of view (FOV). It's cranked way up to some ridiculous number, it must be 120-150. Everything has this weird fish-eye look, and the sides of the screen are all stretched out. Whenever you take a tight corner, it gives you this bizarre feeling almost like vertigo. There's no way to adjust it in the options so enjoy! The screenshots on the store page don't make this very obvious so trust me, it's EXTREME fish-eye. Very distorted.Other than that, this is an over-the-top arcade racer, not a simulation. You'll be jumping hundreds of feet in the air across ravines, over rocks, under arches, and sometimes even around corners. You can control your direction in the air (aftertouch) like in Super Mario Brothers, except in 3D, and you must or else you'll crash. Even then you'll still crash.I like that you can customize your driver, and you can choose gender. There are lots of different outfit options and paint jobs for your vehicle which you can unlock as you go along. I'm just not sure how much I can play this one with that bizarre FOV setting. But hey it's cheap so if you're looking for something to add to your library it's not terrible. I can't honestly recommend it though. 6/10			"

												WARNING: This game is BUSTED. It FORCES you to create an internet-capable profile, even though it's own internet capabilities no longer work, meaning, YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME. Tried playing it offline, same thing. I created a profile, picked my region, and it just wouldn't connect online, even though my internet works plenty fine, fine enough to write this scathing comment about this friggin game. It may have been fun at some point, back in it's heyday, and maybe there's a mod or work-around to this, but i'm not digging around the internet just to get this ATV game to work. I'm super annoyed though, as i loved the ATV Offroad Fury games.UPDATE:Thank you, everyone, i did finally figure it out. so when you first boot it up, it asks you to create an Online Profile, just hit right on the keyboard or analog stick, and it'll bring you to a menu that allows you to create a Local Profile, instead. In my frustration, when i first started it, i was only pressing up and down, not left or right. So, a slightly more accurate review: It's not bad! Nothing mind-blowing, it plays about the same as Mad Riders and Pure, and Mud. I actually enjoy that it's WAY Arcade-y, in that the physics are crazy and allow for giant jumps and levels that fly by in an instant. This and Mad Riders are technically closer to Hydro Thunder and Arctic Thunder, rather than the ATV Offroad Fury series. All in all, if you're looking for a non-complex, quick-to-play racing game, without having to learn how to drive and earn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ driver's license (damn you Gran Turismo introduction missions!), then pick this up. I see this on sale all the time, so can probably get it at a dollar or 2, making it well worth the price of admission.			"

For me, this is the kind of racer I really like because the game play is such that its very playable and not to ""simulator"" and is more like a full size 1 dollar per play arcade game. I love it!There are more tracks in the game than I initially thought which was a nice surprise. You can ""upgrade"" your bike/atv as you unlock stuff by doing well in races.Seriously - for $5.00 - This is SOOOO WORTH IT!			"

												Definitely worth the $0.99 I bought this game just because the reviews were decent and it's only a buck. After an hour and a half of gameplay, I can confidently say that this game is worth it. It's actually really intense, and the maps are very well made. Although I just started playing, I'm sure that I will play this game through and enjoy it. Pros: good graphics, large maps, vehicle customization, the priceCons: unrealistic, worthless without a controller, inability to do stunts (maybe there's some way but I haven't found it).			"

												I got this thinking it would be like Motorstorm, but its not, its a load of rubbish. The bikes are so fast I havent got a clue whats going on. They go from 0 - 1000mph in under a second, they are faster than the Wipeout ships and they are from the future!!! The music is generic rock, and despite the game having more than one song, you wont be able to tell as they all sound the same. I think the graphics are quite nice but cant really tell as the game is so quick you dont get a chance to see the environments. Dont even waste 75p on this. You will have more fun eating a delicious cadburys Kitkat bought for the same price, than playing this game!			"

												This is a great game.  If you can get it on sale (I paid $1) it's totally worth having.  The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is pretty decent, and the customization was unexpectedly deep.  I like how you can swap parts and it changes the actual parts on the vehicle.  It's an 'extreme' sort of game, realism is out the window but it does it's rediculous driving well.  I felt very much in control in my first run going up walls and stuff, it was pretty cool.  The whole time keeping in mind, it only cost $1.  The abandonment of multiplayer is the downside.  Still a lot of value here.			"

												Reluctantly crouched at the starting line,Engines pumping and thumping in time.The green light flashes, the flags go up.Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup.They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank,Fuel burning fast on an empty tank.Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns.Their prowess is potent and secretly stearn.As they speed through the finish, the flags go down.The fans get up and they get out of town.The arena is empty except for one man,Still driving and striving as fast as he can.The sun has gone down and the moon has come up,And long ago somebody left with the cup.But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns.And thinking of someone for whom he still burns. He's going the distance.He's going for speed.She's all aloneIn her time of need.Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course,He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse,			"

												Constant sensation of ultimate speed is the players companion throughout the game. Lightning-fast reflexes and tactical skills are what stands between victory and defeat. Breakneck rides on near vertical mountainsides with up to 70-degree slopes - feel your heart pumping! Extreme track design with breathtaking vistas - learning the inside-outs of their topography will be an advantage in the race for #1. Steer your vehicle mid air allowing for full control over your ride. Shortening or lengthening your jumps, changing angles can make or break your lap time. Assemble your own vehicles from a wide selection of parts and components. Adjust their parameters to best suit your playing style and personalize the looks, making it unique and truly your own.			"

This game is huge amounts of fun for single player. The reviews made it seem pretty dumbed down but it's so much fun it should be wrong and wrong in so many ways. It's near impossible to play silently and not smile and giggle. Buy it, jack it all up to warp sped as you jump huge air through forests, desserts, exotic fantasy race courses and you become a sooper hero beyond compare.

												Nail'd is a unique game, that definately does not get the attention it deserves. Yes, it has quite a lot of bugs and has not got many maps/features, but the 1,30€ (or the 5€ if it is not on sale) are definately worth it!

												I have noticed a few reviews stating that people could not get this to their desired resolution, or that it won't get out of windowed mode. First, you absolutely have to finish the training tutorial prior to having access to these options if I'm not mistaken.Given that Windows 10 is sometimes a major letdown for older games... I was surprised at how well this one runs. The resolution goes as high as my monitor and GPU allow. The FPS on here is ridiculous at high resolutions.. Hitting over 300 FPS constantly. There isn't a V-Sync option (at least I didn't notice one)so those with 1080p monitors running at 60hz may see some screen tearing... Just an assumption, I don't know. This is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's fast, unrealistic and fun as hell. Not many graphics options, but that is to be expected with a game from the early Xbox 360 era. I enjoiy it for what it is. If you like games where you can hop on a ATV or Motocross bike, go fast and make outrageous jumps.. this one is for you. I paid like $3 for it so i feel I got my money's worth.			"

												I was kind of expecting this to be a bit of a let down, but while it i definatly a budget title it is pretty damn good fun.The physics dont have the flair of some of the other titles in this general area (mx vs atv for example) but who cares, this game is just good fun. The levels are super fast and very intresting to try and find the patharound. The gameplay is more mario kart on lsd style with huge jumps and actually decent visuals. The soundtrack is also nothing like you could expect from mario kart featureing some pretty decent music from artists such as slipknot, while not my usual listening they are all pretty cool songs and suit the game very well.From my experience this is a very solid console port, everything worked perfectly, would have been nice if the fonts didnt get smaller with high resolutions but it is hardly an issue.So i would recommend this game if you can get it cheap.Just make sure to bring an xbox controller to the party otherwise i cant imagine it being much fun.

												This game was totally worth the 99c that I paid! I think I might even feel bad about not paying full price. Really fun arcade-like ATV/dirt bike racer that's got all kinds of high-flying and sudden death drop races. Is a great ""casual"" experience, and I suppose you could bring it online but I legit don't even care about the online that much. I got my money out of it already!Edit: Though, upon playing more and more I come to the conclusion that the ""stunt races"" aren't any fun and they really bog down the ""campaign"" quite a bit. Race mode is awesome, even when the rules change for infinite boost or ""no bump,"" but EWWW on ""stunt races."" Very Ew!			"

												""I reject your reality and substitute it with my own!""This would be a fitting tagline for this game. The physics don't make sense, the track design is ridiculous, and most of the things you're going to should be impossible.In other words - it's nothing but mindless fun. Give your cortex some time off and let your brain stem take over.Good music (several licensed songs, well chosen), fast driving, acceptable graphics, easy gameplay once you get comfortable with it.Which will likely take some time - at first you may think the game responds weirdly, and the blurred graphics are disorienting.Still, once you start jumping down a ledge, down being about 50 meters, or use an opportunity to race atop a speeding train, you'll see the game is well worth the few drawbacks it has.(The only real drawback is the lack of online play. Once it worked. Now all that is left is LAN, apparently...)The single player campaign consists of a tournament with quite a number of races. Unfortunately the number of tracks is rather limited (14), and several share segments. After a while they repeat, since they're grouped into regions (for the races).To offset this, each race has ""mutators"", which change the way the race works - for example, in one race you may have continuous boost, while in another you can't hurt another player.Which can be quite a drawback, as the game clearly intends for you to win races, not friends. When someone is trying to overtake you - bump them. Ideally, they crash and you get 30% boost fuel.Land on someone after a jump? 100% boost fuel!Don't worry for them, as you'll see when you crash (and you will, believe me), all that happens is that you respawn a few seconds later.You can customize your vehicle somewhat - by winning races you unlock parts and paintjobs - different parts will give different benefits, so you might want to check that carefully.The track design, which I described as ""ridiculous"" above, is actually quite fancy - it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.The tracks are clearly marked - you cannot escape the track, unfortunately - but they lead you across an active train track sometimes, or right through a hot-air-balloon festival.On one track, part of the physical track is held in the air by helicopters even. (They change altitude, btw.)Mindless fun.Fast fun.Fun.			"

												Sorry, but the game comits a heinous PC-game crime that i cant ignore. it lacks a V-sync option and the refresh limiter that i assume is supposed to take its place doesnt seem to work. thus, i get a ton of screen tearing that annoys and distracts me. there might be 3rd party tools that solves this, but you shouldnt have to rely on that to prevent tearing. about the game itself, its a very fast arcade racer, reminiscent of excite trucks on the Wii if you ever played that. you boost through terrain based tracks pulling off stunts to earn nitrous. if speed is your craving, you will get it allright. some game mechanics seem a bit unpolished id say like doing wheelies which feels very wonky to pull off, i crashed some times even when i shouldnt logically crash(driving up a ramp, slightly bumping into a wall). it seems a bit unpolished, not a AAA title, but i guess its fun and if you like fast and furious off-road racers, you will probably like this game, assuming you can take the screen tearing.

After a while they repeat, since they're grouped into regions (for the races).To offset this, each race has ""mutators"", which change the way the race works - for example, in one race you may have continuous boost, while in another you can't hurt another player.Which can be quite a drawback, as the game clearly intends for you to win races, not friends. When someone is trying to overtake you - bump them. Ideally, they crash and you get 30% boost fuel.Land on someone after a jump? 100% boost fuel!Don't worry for them, as you'll see when you crash (and you will, believe me), all that happens is that you respawn a few seconds later.You can customize your vehicle somewhat - by winning races you unlock parts and paintjobs - different parts will give different benefits, so you might want to check that carefully.The track design, which I described as ""ridiculous"" above, is actually quite fancy - it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.The tracks are clearly marked - you cannot escape the track, unfortunately - but they lead you across an active train track sometimes, or right through a hot-air-balloon festival.On one track, part of the physical track is held in the air by helicopters even. (They change altitude, btw.)Mindless fun.Fast fun.Fun.			"

												I keep trying, but I can't bring myself to truly enjoy it or recommend it. Suffers from being not only extremely uninspired, but also just has a severe lack of identity. It can't decide what it wants to be. Not skill-based or free-flowing enough to be ATV Quad Power Racing 2, but at the same time despite the similar lack of control and excessive corridor race lines of Pure, it lacks that title's polish and love from its developers. While most ATV games try their best to be unique in the face of the familiarity of their subject matter, Nail'd is quite content to simply be ""there."" I can tell there was a great vision for this title in at least a few of the developers' efforts, but something seems to have happened along the way because while it does have those moments where it truly shines, those moments don't last more than a few seconds and are surrounded by stretches of directionless ""sameness."" Darn shame, for a bit it looked like QPR2's spiritual successor. 4/10, wouldn't recommend			"

												First of all this game is like motorstorm wich is't a bad thing because motorstorm was a really good game.This game is pretty much a high-speed offroad arcade racer.This game has got alot of content for the cheap price.The races are always very intresting there is always 2-7 of different routes to take so if you want to you can do a different route every lap. The graphics are Ok they aren't triple A graphics but they still work really good.Gameplay is really really fast and arcady so If you are looking for a simulator check out mx vs atv.overall the game is about a 9.5			"

												I bought this game because it looked so much like Pure and i was not dissapointed. Only reason i would downvote this i because of the invicible walls, i sometimes like to go from other road to the other but i can't always trust this game because i will hit some annoying wall, but still really nice offroad game.

												I have noticed a few reviews stating that people could not get this to their desired resolution, or that it won't get out of windowed mode. First, you absolutely have to finish the training tutorial prior to having access to these options if I'm not mistaken.Given that Windows 10 is sometimes a major letdown for older games... I was surprised at how well this one runs. The resolution goes as high as my monitor and GPU allow. The FPS on here is ridiculous at high resolutions.. Hitting over 300 FPS constantly. There isn't a V-Sync option (at least I didn't notice one)so those with 1080p monitors running at 60hz may see some screen tearing... Just an assumption, I don't know. This is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's fast, unrealistic and fun as hell. Not many graphics options, but that is to be expected with a game from the early Xbox 360 era. I enjoiy it for what it is. If you like games where you can hop on a ATV or Motocross bike, go fast and make outrageous jumps.. this one is for you. I paid like $3 for it so i feel I got my money's worth.			"

												Criminally underrated game, a true hidden gem among the arcade-style racing games. The sence of speed is very good, most time it feels like you going 1000 kmp/h yet you fully in control of your bike/ATV. The controls itself is good and tight. Overall there's nothing bad about this game to say. You rarely can find good arcade racing game with bikes/ATVs so there's no reason not to buy Nail'd, also considering it's dirt cheap.			"
