												Good game, I've tried in non-VR mode and all I can say it's that mouse input is fantastic and the game is very fluid, well paced. I like the progression of the game and the ship upgrades system.			"

												- Don't play this in VR if you don't want to hurt your back or your neck : it's impossible to control the ship movements with joypads (only head movements), and thats very annoying.- Don't try to pause the game while playing : you will be stuck there without any contols working and you will be forced to restart the game.Hope an update corrects that.

												Are you kidding me? You are controlling the ship by moving the head. So far so good and nothing new, but using the Oculus Rift (seated of course) it is nearly impossible to reach the upper doors, coins or addons. There needs to be a sensitivity option for the OR headset or just change the way you steer to where you look instead of how you move your head.Not recommended for Oculus Rift users.			"

												Played on HTC Vive. Driving a ship by moving the head is not fun.All I want is to play using my joystick and be immersed in the cockpit. But you can't either be in the cockpit and look around or control the ship using regular control. It's just a crappy minigame that will make your neck hurt.			"

												The Collider 2 is quite a fun, addicting reflex based 'endless' experience. Though as to be expected with recent releases, there is a plethora of bugs and issues with the menu system; from options not triggering any changes within the game, to purchases not updating within in the store and achievements not being unlocked, this game needs some serious refinement before it is worth it's $10 asking price. The actual gameplay itself is really well made and a lot of fun, if you can look past these issues present within the rest of the game, it is a good way to pass the time, that's if the game continues to give you xp for completing missions, in my case, I'm stuck at the same level forever now. Yay.			"

												This reminded me of a couple older games I enjoyed when I was a kid (Novastorm and Terminal Velocity specifically) so I decided to give it a shot.It's a pretty solid entry to the runner genre. Graphics are nice, unlike most games of this sort it was not built for smartphones which shows in the slick visuals and presentation. Gameplay is simple, you dodge obstacles until you get to the end of the mission. Stick to move, trigger to boost. There are also three different camera modes: third person zoomed, third person close, and first person.Missions have various objectives to complete with bronze, silver, and gold ranks attainable. There is the standard time trial in addition to a mode where you're blowing up mines (point the crosshair at them and you shoot automatically), one where you're collecting pickups, and boss fights. Missions get steadily tougher, especially as you progress through the sectors, each of which introduce new obstacles and differently themed visuals to encounter.There's a solid amount of content here with 6 sectors, each of which presumably has 9 missions. You will also unlock survival mode fairly early on into the campaign.Success is largely tied to how well you manage your boost. Boosting gives a short increase to your mauverability, so using it in bursts can be beneficial in certain areas. For time trials you generall want to boost as much as  possible, but you will start to overheat eventually. If you completely overheat your ship blows up and you have to restart the mission. Letting off the boost lets your ship cool down, as represented by a bar at the bottom of the screen.There is a progression system where you collect coins to level up. Leveling up grants you an even larger chunk of coins. You then spend them on new ships, ship upgrades, and powerup duration upgrades which will be required in order to achieve gold rank on some missions.Each mission requires a certain ship, so if you spent too much and don't have enough to unlock the one you need to progress, you may need to go back and grind missions you've already completed.The game's music is generic, I recommend turning it off and playing your own instead. Sound effects are also nothing to write home about but they get the job done.I have one major gripe and it's that the layout of the missions seems to be somewhat randomized. Placement of obstacles is always the same, but the type of obstacle you encounter can differ slightly. This has the potential to create zones from hell that are almost impossible to navigate without forgoing your boost completely, which is a big problem on time trial missions.Powerup types are also random, which has a terrible effect on gameplay. For example, there are some sections of each mission where you will get a powerup right before hitting some ridiculously tightly packed obstacles. You were obviously meant to get the shield powerup, which will let you clip right through everything while invulnerable, but instead the game decided to give you the unlimited boost powerup, which is next to worthless here. Likewise, you will also encounter long, open sections with no obstacles at all and lots of coins to pick up. You were obviously meant to have the unlimited boost powerup here, but the game decided to give you shield invulnerability instead, which will end up being completely wasted.All this randomization means achieving gold rank is often a matter of repeating the mission over and over until you get the perfect setup: the right powerups when you need them, and obstacles that can be navigated without sacrificing speed.Overall though, there is enough content and polish here to warrant a recommendation. Note that this review is the standard non-VR version of the game.			"

YouTube™ Video: The Collider 2 (PC, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive) - PXA Peeks 

			Views: 340		

			In this episode of PXA Peeks, I take a look at The Collider 2, a casual combination of a runner and a space shooter that's exclusively for PC and also has support for the two big VR headsets.		

Disclosure: I was provided a review code for this title by the developer's PR company.Despite it's Wing Commander-esque appearance, this is actually a more casual runner style game that happens to take place in space. While it's systems and mechanics are pretty basic and shallow, there's actually a lot of content and challenge here.The only things you control in The Collider 2 is your ship's position and whether or not your boost is active. Shooting takes place automatically when necessary and you can't stop or even slow down. The challenge comes from having to skillfully manipulate these two simple mechanics very quickly to stay ahead of the levels rushing toward you.The Collider 2 has two modes, a mission-based mode where you go through a series of missions ranging from time attack to item collection to target destruction and an endless score attack mode. The variety in mission mode is a bit lacking but there are a large number of levels available and they start to get very challenging very quickly. It will likely take you a number of hours to get through everything. The endless mode puts you in a never-ending, randomly generated level where you are scored not only on how long you survive but how much you boost as well. Your goal is simply to survive as long as possible and to try to reach the highest position on the online leaderboards.There is also currency in the game that you can use to buy new ships, upgrades to their base abilities, cosmetic paint jobs and extensions to the length of the various powerups you'll encounter in the levels. Where this game excels over similar titles like TRON RUN/r is that you can't buy your way to better positions on the leaderboards by spending real money. Despite the presence of in-game currency, you can only earn it in the game, there are no microtransactions whatsoever. Not only is this title much cheaper to buy than TRON RUN/r but it's a much more balanced playing field. Yes, those with more upgrades can get higher on the leaderboards more easily but you can earn that same preference yourself just by playing the game. This is how it should be.The Collider 2 is mechanically simple but looks quite visually striking. I don't have a VR headset and can't speak to its native VR support but others have said it's pretty good and this makes for a nice value add. The only problem is that at least in the initial version, controllers (which are the optimal but not only way to play) occasionally stop responding on menus and require you to move to another menu with the mouse before getting control back. This could be easily patched and I hope it is.If you're not into endless runner games or are expecting a more in-depth story-based space shooter, this is not for you. However, it's a very nice package with a good amount of content for a reasonable price and I've been having a surprising amount of fun with it. It's a great game to just fire up in short bursts when you don't have a lot of time for a bigger gaming session.			"

												Fun for what it is.  Don't expect a AAA title.  If you are as cheap as I am, however, just wait for it to go on sale.IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR THE VR, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTI received this game as a review copy.  The developer did not pay me for this review.Check out the video I did for this game  here:  "

												The Collider 2 features lightning fast gameplay which requires even faster reaction times. Its responsive controls and general difficulty curve provide a great level of challenge and fuel an addiction that’ll have you retry its missions over and over again. However, those who prioritise story won’t find it here, and others may consider it repetitive. Thanks to Unreal Engine 4, this game looks dazzling from one sector to the next. The Collider 2 fires you out into space to captain your Starfighter, taking on intergalactic invaders with breakneck speed and manic manoeuvres. It almost makes you wonder why Mass Effect hasn’t released a game around Star Wars pod racing yet.Pros+ Smooth Controls+ Difficulty curve makes for an addictive challenge+ Sector-by-sector aesthetics are greatCons- Only 3 different mission types may get repetitive- Having to buy upgrades for each ship all over againThe full review can be found here: http://www.keengamer.com/article/13538_the-collider-2-review "

												I absolutely IN LOVE with this game! For me it is one of the best VR games out there and my child dreams come true! :D Head-based control feeld cumbersome at first, but after you play few levels it becomes your second nature! I absolutely recommend this game for anyone with VR headset out there!The only thing I'd like developers to fix is Hangar. First, it somehow tracks head movement and selects ships colors. But there is NO visual clue for were you looking at currently, and all other menus are controller-basd only, so why Hangar? Also, there are ship upgrades to the right in Hangar - it took me quite a while to figure out how to select them for purchase :)			"

												Not sure why so many negative reviews.  This game is an absolute BLAST to play on the Oculus Rift.  Just make sure you put the sensitivity settings all the way to max so you can easily steer your ship with a slight nod or tilt of your head.  Not doing so will make the ship too hard to control.  Once you nail the controls down the game an INCREDIBLE feeling of speed and immersion never before seen in other games.  I feel it is absolutely worth the asking price.			"

												This game isn't exceptionally challenging or genre defining, but it runs incredibly smoothly and has enough variety to stay consistantly good. Bonus: The music is dramatic and I wasn't bothered by vr sickness despite the fast movement in every level! Buy it to have a game with good replayability in your library.			"

												9/10 for this type of game:There's some minor issues with perception of space and the interface design on normal, non-VR display, but apart from that it's an incredibly well designed and intuitive fast paced obstacle course - addictive as hell, can't wait to check it out on VR.			"
