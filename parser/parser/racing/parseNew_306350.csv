												Super old game here, so you can't really judge the graphics but for 20 years ago it's pretty good!  For primitive 3D graphics, it is impressive. 


YouTube™ Video: Let's play Slipstream 5000 (PC game on Steam) by Gremlin Interactive 1080p 60fps 

			Views: 542		

			Here's an ancient relic for you! This game was made 20 years ago. Some of these really old 3D games are hard to play but I really enjoyed this one.		

I just tried it out and everything works as you would imagine.  I was able to use an Xbox 360 controller right out of the box, and the split-screen works fine as well.  Even has networking modes which you may be able to get working at some point, essentially the game is untouched as it was released in 1995.  Was able to use keyboard or mouse controls as well and there was no issues there, the learning curve is quite easy on this one.  All sorts of various gameplay modes and upgrades are available.  If you look at the screenshots and like what you see, then the game will not disappoint you, but only recommended for those looking for the retro PC gaming experience.			"

Good game for those looking a more unique racing experience and not bothered by primitive 3D graphics.Slipstream 5000 is a futuristic flight and combat racing game by Gremlin Interactive.This game is a child of the 90s, from times when future was not all apocalypse and racing games dared to have other vehicles than automobiles.The sounds of the planes, the craft and course design, radio chatter between competitors and the pre-race TV hosts introducing the upcoming track are few of the highlights which really make this futuristic world believable.The game is challenging and the controls are really tight PROVIDED you're using a joystick or even analog gamepad. This game NEEDS analog controls. Period.One negative is the low in-game resolution which makes it hard to judge turns at distance and you to rely on track memorization. While the graphics are mostly OK and at times quite good for a 3D DOS game, there is no option to increase resolution past 320x200. Play it in 14"" CRT telly and it'll be much better.It would be nice for DosBox to exit itself though. Not a dealbreaker but some people might find this confusing when quitting the game.			"

												I am by no means an old-school gamer, but I have no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best racing games out there. Period. You get to choose your hovercraft and race and shoot and dodge your way through a variety of well-designed maps. The 3D racing concept is so different and fun.I mean, It's basically like a really competitive Starfox.This unique racing game is an absolute gem. 9/10, Highly recommended.			"

												This game is older than me but considering that it is 23 years old it is actually fun to play. DOS-BOX emulates it very well, considering how badly other younger games run nowadays, this is a solid piece of software. Slipstream 5000 really helps you to get into this nostalgic feeling while playing, so sometimes the highly overused phrase ""old but gold"" is still just true.Metacritic:tbd / 100 Metascoretbd / 10 User Score			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												Slipstream 5000 is a very old game that has not aged very well.The game has some interesting features and gameplay, and they would be very good if I had played the game when it came out, but nothing that the game has is particularly groundbreaking now. In fact, the whole game is very dated. I know that it is unfair to judge a game from so long ago using today's standards, but as for enjoyability, it just lacks it unless you are playing for the nostalgia.I am going to give this a not recommended purely because in today's expectations, the game just simply isn't very fun. I know it's not fair, but the game just didn't age very well.Raing: 4.7/10Recommend Price: $0.24 or lower			"

												This is an old game and it shows. I don't feel it aged well enough to recommend it. That is not to say it is a bad game.Once you get the hang of it, the controls are fairly solid.The graphics are decent (compared to when the game was created).AND it lets you easily exit to dos (which can be surprisingly hard on windows these days).

												This game has a bad control and is pretty hard to maneuver. It also feels pretty old, being pretty dated and not really that fun. There is not much in this game actually can make you have a good time. I don't really recommend it, but since it is somewhat cheap you may as well have some fun time with it. Either way, I can't recommend it. I played this game when I was younger, but I still find it pretty bad.			"

												It runs on DOS BOX, controls are terrible as typical back in those days. The concept of the game is something i typically enjoy in a racer but this game is way past its days. Exiting to DOS i was met with the command line LOL. Some folks may find this enjoyable especially if you crave old school, but $5.99 normal price tag is asking to much.			"

Finicky controls- not sure how to get my 360 controller working with this game unlike the other reviewers. Picked this little guy up as part of an Indie Gala bundle. Not a terrible time waster if you like retro games and don't get frustrated easily.			"

												A rather unique game that unfortunately didn't age well.Since it doesn't seem to use hardware 3D (I think it was made before that), advancements in technology didn't improve the graphics.So unless you already know the game from the time it was fresh, you're probably not enjoying as much.The main problem the game has are the graphics - for todays standards, they are atrocious.Still, if you can overlook that, you get a rather unique combat racing game in 3 dimensions (perhaps comparable to Descent).Still, if you can get it cheap (say 1 or 2 Euro), I'd give it a try.
