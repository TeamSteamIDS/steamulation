IntroductionDear reader,I want to let you know WRC 6 is everything WRC 5 had to be. It has improved on all levels. It's the best game since 2010, when MIlestone was the developer. Kylotonn did a very good job out here. I can say it's worth your money. But please read further for it's shortcomings, what can be improved and what did it do good. I took my WRC 5 format, because it's good for the eye and it's not to long to read.What are the bad things about WRC 6:- Cockpit is bland- Cockpit has no fov and seat-adjustment, which is mandatory in every racing simulation game now. (It actually has, but it's still too far away for a triple/wide screen user. )- Cockpit is too far and too high seated for triple screens.(Even at Very Close)- Co-drivers sound a bit robotic; will explain further down below- Cannot use my analog handbrake- Wish there was a clutch, because I want to rev my hairpins, etc* (Link below)- Can cheat the start line by a few meters. - No false starts. There actually is but you can move. Read line above.- Eyefinity / triple screens fish eye-effect- AI is not affected by weather; like fog etc. - Sound at staggered start from other car can be annoying loud. - Online Challenges can be restarted. - Online hit or miss; people or no people online.- No shakedowns/recce.- Losing lightpod doesn't have consequenses. - The non-time based online challenge can be exploited- Expert mode is bugged/cheats and very unfair. Recommended to play at Hard, but can be too easy for some of us.- Extensive mud on the windshield is annoying. What do I like about WRC 6?- Taking damage? It means something here. I lost my handbrake, my brakes, my gears. Oh ♥♥♥♥.- Presentation is really nice. - Repair system is alright. Similar to Dirt Rally. - Online challenges etc. just like Dirt Rally. (and with a twist)- No restarts in Expert difficulty- Career is well done working up from J-WRC to WRC 1- Triple screen- FFB is very well done. It's has some effects DR nor RBR has.- Sound has improved a lot. - Visuals are outstanding. There is some real eyecandy- Narrow and longer roads finally!- Here and there good stuff too- Able to disable vignette, depth of field, etc. - 1:1 Stages. I watched the Finnish stage live a few months ago, and it's 1:1 the very same in-game. Impressive. - Expert difficulty is really challenging.- AI does not always lose or win by .100 secs, like WRC 5 had. - Tyre wear - Setup and tyres do affect your time and handling.- FFB and handling differs per surface, etc. - Cars can caught fire or anything else and the stage will be canceled then. :O - On top of that, stages are more narrow with more hazards; lots of areas to unsettled the car, mostly by way of ditches, cambers and pot-holes. There are actual reasons not to cut. What can Kylotonn improve in WRC 6 or for WRC 7?- Improve SAT. Counter-steering. - Physics can always be improved. It feels good in WRC 6, however. - Less grip, more momentum, etc. - Rally school- Wished the cockpit had fov and seat-adjustment for us triple screen or widescreen users- Prettier cockpits- Adapt a real fov and seat-adjustment like every other racing game has. Mandatory! - Perhaps it is an idea to put a real co-driver(s) in a D-box and let them record the pace-notes for some real good co-driver sound. Just like Paul Coleman did for DR. - Longer stages (20+ km and more)- Real stages, of course- Filter leader boards or separate, so not all kind of people are in the same leader board. I use Simulation for example, another person may use Amateur thus gain a advantage on me + restarts. - Triple screens could use an adjustment-thingy just like Assetto Corsa has, or Multi view like AMS etc has. - Able to see throttle, brake and wheel pressure when fiddling with the settings.- Able to choose linearity and saturation for pedals and wheel. - Analog handbrake- Maybe give the career some RPG-elements- Driving older licensed WRC cars- Historic mode, maybe. - API support, so our simdashes can actually be useful in this game. - Removable wheel and arms.- AI bit inconsistent here and there; Portugal and Australia were very easy, but the rest was not. (J-WRC season, expert) So AI needs to be rebalanced.* (Link below)- Non-restartable Online Challenges. - Performance optimizations. - Reverse and mirrored stages.- Sound can be better. - Could use leagues, like DR has, to prevent empty multiplayer. - Some more to improve but not very important- Repairsystem can be better. I want to repair parts of the car. Not ""precentages"" (Windshield broken? I want to repair the windshield, not the whole bodywork.)- I would actually prefer more bumps and uneven surfaces in the road. It still feels a bit flat in some countries. Italy was spot on. - Lock the steeringwheel rotation to their real life counterparts, and add wheel ratio- Expert mode must have a rebalance. Hard is too easy, Expert too hard. ConclusionI recommend this game. Kylotonn has really improved this game. It's the one of the best Rally games out now. It's better than WRC 5, even better than Loeb. It is however still a step below Dirt Rally and RBR, but WRC 6 is a worthy rally game. It only needs to expand and improve slowly.I am really glad Kylotonn listed to the community. I give the company a big thumb up for that too. Now keep it like that. I also hope the company will do WRC 7, WRC 8 etc, because it has with WRC 6 a good basis to work from. However, If FIA WRC decided to not going further with Kylotonn / BigBen.. I sincerely hope the engine, date, etc will transfer over to the current company so Kylotonn / BigBen can turn this game into a non-WRC licenced game, but towards hardcore and simulation thus being a direct competitor towards Codemasters's DR and hopefully DR 2. Why? Because DR and Dark Souls are why. People don't want to be spoonfed anymore.Tested with a Thrustmaster TX, G27 GTeyed pedals, Heusinkveld Seq Shifter.Regarding improvements for a Rally game in general taken from my DR manifesto:http://steamcommunity.com/app/310560/discussions/0/357287304436205237/Regarding the clutch in WRC 6http://steamcommunity.com/app/458770/discussions/0/343788552537157965/?tscn=1475872960Regarding inconsistent AIhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/458770/discussions/1/343788552543192990/ "

												After more than 300 hours played of Dirt Rally and SLRE, I just needed an hour to conclude that this game can't be recommended for any rally enthusiast in its actual state. The major technical problem is a horrible frame stutter that, according to the forums, comes from WRC 5 and still wasn't fixed by developers. This stuttering really breaks immersion, and it happens even with a rig capable of delivering a frame rate that more than doubles today's standard refresh rate (60fps). So, definitely it's not a matter of performance in this case. Any proposed workaround haven't fixed this problem for me.Also, the force feedback feels very off, especially if compared to other racing titles. It's just bad, there's no other way to say this. I tried every racing title on the last couple years. DR, SLRE, Assetto Corsa, RRRE, Project Cars, you name it. WRC's FFB is by far the worst. Adding to the uninspiring visuals, this makes the (many) tracks available look and feel the same. All of them are really flat and boring, with a serious lack of surfacing work. Sound effects are okay.Unfortunately, this game can't be compared with Dirt Rally at any level, and even Sebastien Loeb's EVO, with all its limitations, offers a much better sim experience. Maybe, like me - and many other people, you just want another rally game to have some ""detox"" from the so few DR's stages, and waited to get WRC 6 with a better pricing. But even in this scenario, I don't think it's worth it. I know Kylotonn improved a lot if comparing to WRC 5, but they still need to fix a lot of things, with this game-breaking frame stutter as priority. I'm really confident that they'll manage to fix some of these problems to make WRC 7 a worthwhile evolution. Let's just wait.			"

												They seem to have got it right this time! Physics are drastically improved, audio is much better (no more wasp in a matchbox car sounds!!) and graphics are way better too. I'm having an blast playing this.I really disliked WRC5 but this is lightyears ahead of that. ALSO: (updated to include this 14/10) .. the developers are actually patching this one up and fixing stuff. We have had more patches, fixes and improvements in the first month than the previous WRC games had in years.. please keep up the good work, developer peoples! We like being looked after and all of us WRC fans have been treated pretty badly in the past so it is nice to feel like our game is getting some love for a change :) Thank you!BAD BITS: 1. It can feel a little slow when you are in the in-car view (I wish the FOV was more adjustable because right now it feels too narrow) 2. My biggest problem is that the co-driver just doesn't deliver the calls early enough even on 'Far ahead' setting. My personal preference would be to get them earlier.3. The tape damages the car WAYYyyy too much. Last time I checked, tape does not dent the car this badly. Bit silly, but I can forgive that!4. The bonnet cam seems really high up. It's not a nice position to drive from. Wish it was either lower or there was some way to move it a bit!It picked up my wheel nice (Logitech G27) and the FFB is great. Nice to feel the weight shifting around and tthe grip through the wheel like this and it took very little set up. I started the game and the wheel was detected. I did have to change the button bindings a bit, though, which was a bit of a pain to do. It looks like the UI for bindings is a bit wonky in the launch build (it's too sensitive - you press the button to set the button and it thinks you meant to use that button rather than waiting for another one). Hopefully they can get that fixed in an update?			"

												For years now, the WRC branded games have been nothing but disappointment. The last one I played properly was WRC 3, and that game was just hateful. Rubbish physics, nasty graphics and a soundtrack that could give a deaf person a migraine. Years later, I expected something better, especially given the rights have changed company. I also read a few other reviews before buying and it sounded somewhat promising. I didn’t go into this game expecting a full simulator like Dirt Rally, but I did expect better. Firstly, the stages are rather poor, as they really don’t represent the rally they are for well at all. There is still an over-reliance on hairpins to make the stages seem longer. I also expected better real stages. The game boasts that they have represented real WRC stages in the game. Don’t be fooled by that, they have only rendered the short spectator stages. The physics have come a long way from WRC 3. There is a decent feel to the cars in the flowing sections of the stages, but they are far too loose in the sharp turns, defaulting to a drift very quickly (even the front wheel drive DS3s). It just ruins the feel with the car and prevents you having any confidence in the car.The pacenotes are pathetic. Games from 10 years ago did a better job than this. They are very robotic. You can tell the developers recorded the bare minimum and stitched them together. This means they are very jerky and lack any flow at all. They are also wrong in places and the timing is appalling, even after changing the delivery time. Once again, it just prevents you from having any confidence in the notes.There are good features. The graphics aren’t too bad (but Dirt Rally has it beaten) and the career mode is decent, but the game just doesn’t feel finished. The AI is too easy, and there are just some moments that make you feel like the game just isn’t a polished product. For example, in a head to head super special stage, I crossed the line behind the AI car in the other lane. It then said I won the stage by 20 seconds. Amazing.Finally, the little “facts” on the loading screens are just stupid. They didn’t need to be! It only requires a bit of reading into the sport to get those right, but most of them are just pointless or wrong. For example, the fact I got before Portugal was saying the rally is run solely on gravel (which is true), but the Portuguese stage I did had a tarmac section in it! It almost feels like the game developers have absolutely no idea about the sport they are representing at all. When will the WRC realise that Codemasters do a far better job at games like this and give them the rights to the championship!? "

												I'm a DiRT Rally driver. If you put this on Sim, it's pretty tough! It won't be as tough as DR though once I get the settings for my G27, which works fine.There are still some glitches to be worked out I can see already.But overall, the game is pretty immersive, I'm not totally missing the exact replicas of all the courses, the notable features on the tracks are good enough! St. Laurent's downhill hairpins and Fafe's big jump, El Condor is sweet too. But I am loving the 1 to 1 on the SSSs, that is really cool.The Yaris is fun to throw around as well.Anyhow, the last WRC game I had was 4, this is soooo much better and I look forward to doing the career! Def, recommend, especially at the cheaper price.			"

												G29 compability is very limited, no gearshifter, no clutch. its not a racing sim, more an arcade game and has a console game feel to it.Physics are decent, keeping drifts is very easy. FFB gives a good feeling and you can feel when you took the corner too hard.Pacenotes are very confusing, a 5-turn is sometimes way more than a 3-turn.Graphics even on the highest setting are no where near at those from the first screenshots but on the other hand the sound is decent.When this game has a clutch support, a gearshifter support I will play it again.But if you expect a good arcade rally game, grab it, if you expect something like Dirt Rally you have to ignore this one. Buy it if you liked WRC 4			"

												Definitely an improvement over the last one (WRC 5).First of all, the optimisation is great, i can max it easily with amazing framerate on a gtx 970M (laptop).Secondo : The driving feels a lot better and is more immersive than WRC 5, sensations are here !! and grow up with you unlocking better cars. Playing with xbox 360 wireless controller from logitech without any issue.Graphics look really good, the new immersive Lightning is what i love best fallowed by the amazing foliage, full of detail.Other than that the game feels complete with multiplayer on its side too.Definitely recommend to the Rally fans out there !!! A really great WRC !!!			"

Product received for free
												Update: Dec. 25th. 2016 WARNING!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! This is a rip off!!!!! Even after the newest patch ver. 1.0.52 the developer is not able to integrate a realistic weather system that is essential for rally games - as you can see in DiRT Rally!!!Cloudy, rainy and snowy weather look like night driving through fog. Cockpit view is unplayable as it is way too dark!!!! https://abload.de/img/cloudyvvssh.jpgBetter they just used the normal weather and just a filter to darken the scene. You can see sunshadows even when you´re driving through cloudy and rainy weather conditions. This is just ♥♥♥♥ed up and the developer just wanted to collect money the fast way. No real support for this game!!!!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- After several hours of playing and endless discussions in the forums I am gonna write my thoughts down. Most of you guys may think why does he not recommend this cool game. Answer is - the developer. The game has been released for weeks now. The developer only and I say only fixes minor issues with their patches. Most users complain about freezing and stuttering during gameplay - an issue that the developer should probably aware of when reading the community posts. Another major issue is the weather system. In WRC6 the weather system is terrible. Cloudy conditions look like a drive at night through pea soup. Lots of people complaining about it and the developer is not fixing this major issue although a good weather system is essential for a rallye game. They may read the comments but care a shait about it or just fixing minor issues of the game which should not be top priority here because it doesn´t affect gameplay at all whereby a weather system that simulates, rain, cloudy, dusty and snowy weather as a pitch black foggy night drive does!  That ain´t fun!!!When driving through the rain road surfaces are still the same that are used during dry road conditions. Especially in stages like Italy and Portugal you can see this. The only stage that have puddles on the road is the Wales Rally but they have puddles on dry conditions either.  Another thing is sun shadows and reflections. Ever watched your car or the road when it is cloudy? There are no sunshadows from trees or sun reflections on your car. There are shadows but they´re totally different from a bright and sunny day! NOT in WRC6 here it seems they only used a filter that darkens the whole scene but showing you the same sunshadows and reflections if driving on sunny weather. These points are the reason I do NOT recommend this game because they affect gameplay, they affect realism of the gameplay and they destroy the gameplay when it´s done WRONG!  I will redo my review if developers fix that but until now they really ♥♥♥♥ed it up!!! OK what is cool about the game. The stages are quite difficult and not as flat as in WRC5 they offer lots of bumps, jumps, chicanes and narrow turns. That´s really cool because you have to concentrate. Steering of the car is great. Thank god they support the ""Thrustmaster TX"" racing wheel from the start. So I had no trouble of using it. There may be some other wheels that are not yet supported yet so I only can say that for the Thrustmaster TX. Graphics on sunny conditions look great nice sharp road textures. Lots of foliage, bushes, trees on the roadside and also plenty of destructable fences, signs. Pedestrians are hmm not destructable but you get a time penalty of 12 secs. when loosing your car and crashing into them. Oh yeah another thing they  did a really great job. Sound. Rally cars roar really cool. Exhaust backfire sounds are mega cool and all road surfaces have different sound effects so tarmac sounds like tarmac, gravel like gravel and mud - you know! Except the terrible weather system they did a great job with this game it is fun, challenging and beatiful. But as weather is so essential and now so undrivable at the moment I can´t recommend it until they fix it!			"

												WRC 6 reminds me a lot of the old WRC games under EvoStudios back on the PS1 & 2, otherwise known as the glory days of WRC gaming. Let's just get one thing out the way first though... one cannot logically compare this game to DiRT Rally; I love DR, but WRC 6 is a licensed game, therefore must appeal to a wider audience. DR is a passion project, and Codies had more creative freedom with restrictions largely limited to vehicle licensing. Expect a ceiling. Anyway, it's clear to see that WRC 5 was largely just a stepping stone on to better things. They didn't have long to make that game either, and the result was evident. However, WRC 6 has improved in all areas, from visuals and sound, all the way down to quality of content. Stages are narrower with unforgiving elements (mostly between 6-8km long, with some a little shorter or a little longer), pacenotes are less robotic (yet still c&p) and more accurate, car models are better, and most importantly the cars themselves feel like they have more weight and contact with the road surface, and generally the feel and appearance of car physics are much more polished.Damage model has been developed to be more realistic, which means it's more progressive and dynamic depending on where you hit the car. You can also suffer from punctures during the stage, in which case you will need to stop and change the wheel. Cockpit cam is a little more zoomed out, and you can now freely look around the car, and take a peek at the drivers body if you wish. Still on cameras, the chase cam has also been improved, if that's your thing. It's very much like the early 2000's WRC games; more fluid following, compared to how stiff and horrid is has been in recent years. Performance wise, it runs perfectly. I'm getting 60fps solid with most of the settings on the highest quality. Alongside performance WRC 6 is also a nice looking game, and far better than the titles in recent years. It looks a lot more natural by way of colouring and post fx, and car and stage textures are very good. This is the first time I've been this happy playing the first few hours of a WRC game in a long, long time. I'm just glad I can finally say that again.  "

TL:DRWRC6 is a huge improvement over the previous game in the series. They really paid attention to every last detail which makes rallying a joy and delivered a great fun and challenging rally game. If you're a complete casual or more of a hardcore fan, there should be something for everyone in here.9/10Full review...if you can call it oneSo I've been playing this quite a lot just in the couple days after launch, and I must say I am very impressed. It's interesting what a year of work can bring if you work on the right bits and pieces. People should note tho that this is not suppose to be Dirt Rally 2 or something, mainly because it's based at a much wider audience than DR is. But just because of that, it doesn't mean it's a bad game either. In fact, it's a blast! Things that should be noted are:PROS:- Very detailed and well made/updated tracks - There's 14 different rallies, including China, so there's plenty of environments to race through. A big variety of destinations (something DR actually lacks...) with great attention to detail.- Fun for everyone - Considering it's a licensed game, it has to be made so it can suit as many people as possible. And I must say, great job on achieving that, because with assists, even the most casual rally fans can have a go without major issues, while cracking it up to simulation mode, brings a challenge even to the more hardcore audience. Even after playing around 200 hours on DR at the time, I must admit I find this game more enjoyable, it's the perfect ballance of fun and challenge.- Graphics/sounds/physics - a bunch of well improved elements which make the game that more enjoyable.- Splitscreen - Not for everybody but I personally really appreciate this feature. Thank you! :DCONS:- Co-driver - Although he does get the job done, there are times he cannot manage to deliver the pacenotes in time. It often happens, at least in my case, that I overtake him and he can't keep up. So there's something that'll need a bit more work.- Replay cameras - The onboard cameras that are used most of the time aren't really anything special...would be nice to see trackside cameras through most of the stages.- Track variety - Now bare with me on this...I know I mentioned tracks under pros as well, but there's a few things that should be noted, if not else maybe for next years game I suppose. Track selection is great, BUT there are only a few per rally. About 3-4 plus a ""Super Special Stage"" if the rally even has one. Not to mention some tracks are more or less the same layout than in the previous game, maybe extended a kilometer or so. So quick suggestions to devs, do what codemasters do, make the tracks available in reverse as well. BOOM, instant double rally lenght. Maybe could be considered for next year.Overall, WRC 6 is a great ""simcade"" like racing game. If you're a rally fan and are looking for a game which delivers both fun and a good challenge, this game should be one to consider. I'm giving it a solid 9/10 considering they only had a year to develop it all as well. Good job Kylotonn, looking forward to future titles already!			"

												I was sceptical about trying WRC 6 at first, but after reading a few positive reviews from fellow DiRT Rally veterans, I decided to give it a go. And I'm so glad I did. I was hooked from the first stage.The physics and FFB are first class: realistic and intuitive. It's how a car should behave in both low and high speeds. You can feel the weight of the car through the steering wheel and know what to do to make the car behave. The second really impressive aspect of the game is the stages. There are only five per country, but all official countries being represented it's quite enough. And the different rallies are very well portrayed atmospherically and through the surfaces. It's clear that a lot of effort went into stage design, especially the super special stages which are modeled accurately after real life ones.The career mode is great. I was highly motivated to finish the whole thing. With hard difficulty it required absolute focus without much practice, so I'm guessing the expert difficulty requires both. Which is how it should be.I still haven't encountered a single bug. It seems to me a very well polished product.Other positive things to be mentioned: the damage model, online multiplayer mode (simultaneous racing with others showing up as coloured shadow cars), sounds, tire model and achievements.Things to work on: camera modes, more detailed car setups and maybe some proofreading of the pacenotes.Overall it's a fantastic rally game which captures the spirit of WRC well. I have high hopes for future games of the series, which I hope will feature even more real life stages and maybe a wider range of cars and classes. I'm won't go into comparisons between this and DiRT Rally as they are both great games, and deserve to be enjoyed individually.			"

												First review I've done, here goes nothing...Firstly, this game is a HUGE improvement on WRC5, although that wouldn't be entirely difficult. As soon as you jump into career mode, you can tell the developers have actually thought about the product they are producing. This is evident in little things such as seeing another driver start the stage before you (and its actually the car ahead of you in the timings, not a random). Another nice touch which I appreciated is the fact stages can be cancelled due to bad weather, an accident or too many spectators on the stage. The handling and FFB feels really rewarding to me. You can really feel when you are driving on snow and ice (steering goes light with lack of grip) and on tarmac (steering is harder as there is lots of grip). The stages are much more realistic as they are longer and narrower with a lot more obstacles to prevent cutting and a lot more spectators lining the stage which really immerses you into the world of rally. In addition, the stages are accurate to that of the real rally. For example, the constant corners in Corsica, the square corners and hairpins in Germany along with fast stretches on narrow roads. WRC 5 was guilty of having constant hairpins on every rally, as if the developers have never seen a rally stage. Thankfully, this isnt the case in WRC6!The damage model is more realistic now as well, although it could be more realistic for my liking. Punctures can occur along stages, forcing you into either struggling to the end or replacing the tire, costing a 30 second time penalty. Again, a nice touch by the developers. The best stages are the super specials which are SO MUCH FUN to drive. The downside of this game for me is how boring career mode can become. Seb Ogier wins almost every single rally, and the AI time appear to be fake as you could lose to your opponent on a super special but still be quickest?! The developers need to look at F1 2016 to spice up their career mode. I like the categories you have to go through on your path to WRC, but once you get there my god it is dreary. Career mode should evolve, like F1 2016's. For example, in 3 years time M-Sport are suddenly very quick and VW arent. Overall, the game looks stunning. Visibility is poor in foggy conditions which is a real challenge. Stages are nice and long and ready to kill you at any moment. Rally fans, it is a must buy. Casual gamers, you could enjoy it. I believe this game could get you interested in the world of rallying.8/10. Sort out the AI!			"

												After 226 hours Dirt Rally and 36 hours WRC 6, I claim the WRC 6 in the overall package (physics and tracks) is better than Dirt Rally.I would now like to leave the entire Pikes Peak sector and the other vehicles from Dirt Rally outside.Before anyone starts a discussion, please check out real WRC Rallys on Youtube with cockpit camera and helicopter camera for comparison.1. Engine Sound (Turbo whistle) Cockpit mode absolutely real.2. Transmission (switching noise) Cockpit mode absolutely real.3. Stone strike and tire noise in the cockpit mode very nicely implemented.4. The acceleration of the vehicles is very beautifully implemented.- The response of the accelerator can be adjusted.5. The drifting of the vehicle is more real as with DR and very beautifully implemented.- Watch the helicopter camera mode while drifting over the vehicle's center axis6. The braking behavior in snow and ice (Monte Carlo and Sweden) is brilliantly implemented.7. The tracks are not 100% replicated (shortened versions) but genious to drive.8. The credit system in the career mode is simply exemplary. It is fun to watch the victory.One thing you have to say quite honestly, I can not remember when Richard Burns Rally another rally simulation after release was so clean to play.If now KT some small things like the Replay camera mode, a few weather conditions adapts, the analog handbrake control (USB) adapted I am already very satisfied.New DLC with Group A and Group B cars would make the thing round.And of course:- Subaru Impreza WRC- Ford Focus RS WRC- Peugeot RC 206 WRC- Mitsubishi Lancer EVO WRC.I can only say, play through the career mode and you become addicted!Sorry for my bad english.Best regardsHans Peter			"

												This is a SimCade game leaning more towards arcade though. If you are searching for a simulation rally game then this is not for you, try Dirt Rally or Richard Burns Rally. This game is unplayable with my driving wheel, a DFGT. It is made to be played with a gamepad. I am using a xbx360 gamepad and it plays very nicely.It has a lot of tracks and teams and is enjoyable if you take it lightly and play casually.So, not recommended for Sim Racers. Recommended for simcade or arcade racers. I am going to give a thumbs up because the dev team has done good job with this title and hope they can improve in the future and deliver a simulation racer in the end.			"

												I already own Dirt Rally and now WRC 6 as well. WRC 6 shouldn't really be seen as a poor man's Dirt Rally. It is simpler to get into and more accessible while still getting a good rally fix. I was really surprised how much I like this game, especially since WRC 5 wasn't very good. The jittery framerate is gone and the graphics are significantly improved with no ugly pop up. It's my opinion, but having played both the graphics are certainly in the ball park of Dirt Rally and in some stages I think better. I also use reshade 3 with no problems to tweak lighting to my preference. Positives:Car handling feels good and appropriately rally like. Car settings are simplified but not totally dumbed down and affect handling as expected. Graphics are good  (I get 60fps vsync @1440p on GTX980ti). Timing of navigator calls can be adjusted. More forgiving of small off roads than Dirt Rally. Negatives: No seat or FOV adjustment for in-car camera. Default car setups are too loose (good for  handling demo, not so good for times.)Car interior  graphics are basic. Controller setup better than WRC 5 but still lacking. (Dead zone still exists when set to zero and excessive input lag with controller, not Sebastien Loeb Rally levels of lag but could be better).   "

												I prefer this to Dirt!Ok, maybe I am a little crazy, but for FUN, I think this is better than dirt. Quick summary:PLUSES (vs. Dirt). - Controls and handling much more fun using a controller than dirt (I could never get settings with Dirt I felt comfortable with). See below though. - The atmosphere is great; the WRC liscense obviously helps, but there is some nice detail (crowd sounds, helecopters, etc). - Stage variety; these stages feel like WRC stages, with distinctive geographical locations. Dirt needs a couple more locations.  - Decent damage model (but see below)50/50 with DIRT: - Graphics. Dirt in some ways better (particles, some effects - windshield say, and headlights), but I think WRC 6 graphics are close and have their own advantages. I prefer the WRC cars, helped by the offical liveries, and they get dirtier without the mod you can get for Dirt. Stage graphics are even IMHO. - Sound (apart from co-driver!). I think the WRC sounds are good, and I like the crowd atmosphere.DIRT IS BETTER: - Dirt is clearly more a sim, but I don't have a wheel so DIRT can be fun, but also v. frustrating. - The co driver. Oh my! The co-driver in WRC is poor. IF the co-driver was the standard of DIRT then I think WRC would be exponetially better. I have not had a problem with pace-note timing, but they just sound a bit amateurish. Shame. - Some odd damage effects. The model is potentially excellent with WRC (nice culmulative damage), but some of it is odd: the damage caused by some elements seems a bit excessive. Overall though, for what I paid, this is solid. Hopefully it'll get some mods :)			"

												The good:Car handling is very easy to adapt to and behaves differently on each surface. (I am using an Xbox 360 controller)There is a sense of speed and some sense of weight distribution.The engine sounds have improved. The game performs very well at a constant 60fps on the highest graphics setting. (RX 480 Sapphire Nitro 8gb)There are many stages and countries to visit.The bad:Driving over gravel always makes me think the exhaust is dragging on the ground because of the terrible noise it makes.Graphics are not so great, but are decent for what the game is. I think most of us who are interested in this game will probably worry more about the driving aspect than looking at pretty scenery. Nothing looks natural. Not in a graphical sense, but I get the feeling everybody I see in the game is some sort of an early build android robot.The ugly:The pace notes are just awful. After you get past the robotic and comical way they are said and yelled to you while you are driving, you will also learn fairly early into the game that a 3 turn could actually be a 5 or 1. I have taken 3's in 6th gear and other times had to drop to 2nd, pull the e-brake and power out of the outside of the turn to save myself. Just be cautious when he says 3, he's probably lying. Also since pace notes are such an important part of rally, I think the creators should have put more time into making them at least bearable to listen to. Overall this is a good game and very fun to play. I'm going to be playing this one a lot. This is definitely a good addition for rally game fans and those looking for a more official and professional rally experience. By the way ""Left 5. Over crest. 40. BRAKE!!! Left 1. DEFINITELY DON'T CUT!!! 100. Right 3."" *crashes into a ditch*   "

												I play WRC 6 with a T500 RS wheel and a TH8A sequential shifter, purely in cockpit view with maxed out graphic settings and in Simulation mode, i.e. will all assists off.In the past I played DiRT Rally for more than 200 hours but really got bored at some point by its lack of content in terms of variety and amount of rally stages.Please find below my list of pros and cons for WRC 6:++ Big variety of stages++ Comparatively big amount of stages. I think it will take quite long for me to memorize any stage.++ Good sensation of speed including increasing car instability at very high speeds+ Different road surfaces make a big difference in the amount of grip and the required braking distances. Loss of grip on icy sections or through ponds of water is quite credible.+ Good FFB right out of the box+ Good sound. Although I must admit that nowadays cars sound quite ""meh"".+ I like the way flat tyres are simulated.+ On sunny days the light effects are quite nice.+ Credible physics in simulation mode (in my layman opinion)o I don't like the German co-driver. Luckily the British one is quite ok.- Only today's WRC cars available. No classics :-(- Bad balance of AI strength between different rally events. On difficulty level ""Difficult"" in the WRC I managed to win a couple of rallies while at others I did not stand a chance without making any major mistakes and once was even worse than most of the WRC 2 drivers.- The road surface is almost entirely flat without any potholes or significant camber. Especially the latter point is way better in DiRT Rally.- Some rally events contain the same stage multiple times, and this so only in the same direction. Why no reverse direction?And last but not least the most annoying points, which make this game sometimes really unlikable for me:-- At the Super Special Stages, where you are racing directly against another opponent, this other car's engine is louder than your own car's engine. This is quite annoying if you are using manual gear shift and would like to shift according to your engine's rev sound.-- The image brightness in the game is generally way too dark. Since the game does not provide a gamma correction or brightness feature in the graphics settings, the only way tweak the brigthness is via the monitor's settings. Even on sunny summer stages at midday you sometimes can get the feeling of driving in the twilight. What makes things worse is that the car's headlights have a felt reach of only about 5 metres in front of your car. Foggy stages or stages at night time are like a blind flight and thus become a real pain to drive. Under such weather conditions I don't stand a chance against the AI's stage times.-- On some gravel stages the windscreen gets more and more dirty over time. This, in general, could have been a quite nice and immersive feature. But it is not: the screen gets dirty quite quickly even on straight sections under dry conditions. On twisty sections it's even worse so that I sometimes drive with my wipers active all the time, which is quite ridiculous under dry weather conditions and even more annoying in combination with the game's already quite bad overall brightness.-- The cockpit view offers 5 different camera positions with varying distances to the windscreen. For some cars (like the Polo) there is only one position where it's actually possible to see the gear indicator all the time. For other cars another position may have to be configured in order to see the gear indicator. At the same time the broad sun protection strip at the top of the windscreen makes the already dark road environment even darker. So there may be no perfect camera position where you can see at the same time the gear indicator and where the sun protection strip disturbs you the least.After having just finished a Rally Portugal event under mostly very frustrating visibility conditions, I am quite annoyed at the moment and give WRC 6 a rating of 6 out of 10.Update on 2017-01-07: After having permanently switched from cockpit to bonnet view some of the aforementioned negatives are no longer disturbing so that I change my rating to a 7 out of 10.

												one that keeps me triggered was one of the shallow reasons why this game is having a low rating was simply because it is being kept compared by the community to Codies far superior DiRT Rally(which we cannot deny IS the best rally game atm)...but it DOES NOT mean that this sophomore Kylotonn effort for their official WRC license is a terrible piece of s***, please keep that in mind.WRC 6 is a noticeable improvement over its predecessor, the WRC 5 and the *cough cough* Milestone ones: its been a long time that the typical chain of crap official WRC games FINALLY has garnered such potential with on-par graphics at best, decent physics/mechanics, good sounds, and with its albeit clinical yet straightforward presentation, this reinstates a new hope for this honestly struggling series.sure there are still a lot of disappointing issues that needs some more ironing(bah bind controls and irritating wheel incompatibilities!) but considering theyre starting to churn patches lately, and for the spirit of unadulterated casual rally racing, this game should be treated with simple expectations; give the game a generous chance~ a still must-have for those rally artists and some OCD racing game collectors alike, once the price is right, WRC 6 should at least be given some love. this franchise is trying their best to revive themselves from the ashes, to put them back on radar and to be noticed again by the audience. a solid 7/10 attempt that could(and should) be the start~  "

Two small issues with my G920 though, the FFB seems to carry on after a stage has finished into the menus and for some weird reason the X & B buttons are mixed up but other than these small issues I'm having a blast playing this.

												WRC 6 is a definite step up in many areas compared to the previous installments in the series. Gone from WRC 5 are the graphical glitches and sudden FPS drops, as well as the very unrealistic sounds of the cars.It's not ""dirt rally quality"" although it's not trying to be. It's very much focussed at the arcade/casual crowd from consoles, however it does do a very good job for an arcade game. FFB and wheel options are ok with a G27 but it feels much better with a gamepad I've found so far. With more tracks and cars than WRC 5 had, as well as a visual overhaul of the routes you race on and improved car handling physics, it's a decent game I've had fun playing.How much you want to pay for it is up to you, but it's certainly not a game to avoid because of bugs or bad gameplay like previous games in the series.

												Unplayable even on decent hardware and lowest settings,contains bugs that were already present in WRC5.Not happy.Edit Jan 24:I think I should elaborate my negative review a bit...Per default the game won't detect my GTX so the launcher only lets me choosemy onboard graphics chip resulting in horribly slow rendering.I can 'force' the game into using my GTX with the Nvidia config softwarebut why doesn't WRC 6 recognise it automatically while earlier WRC titles (1-4) do so?Even with the GTX the performance is still below average. I can run Resident Evil 7 constantlywith a minimum of 60 FPS but WRC 6 is stuttering massively? Weird.Then, where did all the great features that were still present in earlier WRC titles go?Where are custom colors, sponsors, mechanics, team management, upgrading of cars, etc pp?Starting off WRC 5 the series only seemed to update licences and names a bit but bugs that haven't been fixed in WRC 5 still appear in WRC 6. Looks like a mere cash grab to me and really makes me want to play Rallisport Challenge 2 on my old Xbox again.			"

												Please, make yourself a favour, absolutely don't be lured by the official WRC license and DON'T buy this product!Infact, it has a lot of nice 'features'... some of the most remarkable, among others:- 99,9% of chance that your racing wheel will be not recognize at all by the program, don't listen to what developers could say, the game is for controllers or keyboard;- night stages are a nightmare to race due to lack of lighting, you can barely see a couple of meters in front of the car, it's a ridiculous thing;- there's not a proper replay feature, the one implemented is totally a joke...Add a nonsense phisycs, a stupid car's handling, and a totally missing collision code, and you are sure you don't want to pay for a bare alpha program.If you want a rally sim go for Dirt Rally, for a rally game go for Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo, and you are ok.

												Summary: WRC 6 is an improvement on WRC 5. It's not Dirt Rally, but it's a decent simcade rally game. Rating:7/10System Specs:Windows 10 Anniversary Updatei7-6700HQ @ 2.6016GB RamSamsung 850 Pro SSDGTX 1060Controller:XBOX One S BTPros:- Handling:Handling is good on an XBONE controller. No visible controller lag, responsive to minor adjustments, works well.- Stage length:Stages are surprisingly long and complicated. - Damage modeling:You can break just about everything and it has a physical affect on the car.- Licensed:All the licensed rallies, teams, and cars.- Performance:At Very High settings / 1080p / Vsync A, I'm getting a solid 60FPS with no drops and no stuttering.Cons:- Graphics:While they are an improvement over last year's graphics, there's still visible shimmering and the visual fidelity isn't up to par with say AC, F1 2016, Dirt Rally or Forza Horizon 3.- Sound:The sound is mediocre. There's a distinction between the gear whine, engine sound and popoff, but the engines sound pretty weak and there's no real aural difference between cars.- Co-driver:The robotic co-drivers are dated at best. They serve a function, but the Dirt games have done co-drivers better and smoother.- Measurements:(This is the American in me speaking, so metric-using friends, I apologize). There's no way that I've determined to switch from Metric to Imperial measurements (m to ft, kmph to mph, etc). Overall, this is not a bad game, and with the 20% promotional discount is a decent price. It's a marked improvement over WRC 5, and while it's not on par with Dirt Rally, it's very good in its own right. It's a mix of sim and arcade that is approachable and works well as a licensed game. It's also very important to point out Kylotonn is NOT Milestone, and they've done a good job of fixing the problems from last year while introducing some decent improvements.			"

												Wheel support seems to be nonexistent right now. I will change my review back to positive when it works. If you only have a controller go ahead and buy WRC6 it's fun with that for sure.Here are my notes after playing WRC6 for a bit.https://streamable.com/w6gc gameplay on simulation settings with controller. Going to try a bit later with wheel+UI is better compared to WRC5Optimization. Has triplescreen+widescreen support, many graphic optionsCan customize most of the HUDMany sound optionsPlenty of stats (distance traveled,fav car, crashes etc)LeaderboardsWeekly eventsLot's of co-driver optionsCareer mode starts you in Junior WRC and let's you work to the top. The teams ""Morale"" changes depending on how you drive. You can choose teams that expect different things from you. You also get different objectives through rallies.Super Special Stages are fun14 Different RalliesStages are narrowDamage model is improved and now accurately shows damage. You can also get electronic failures so you can't hear the co-driverRepair UI is pretty coolRandom events can happen during a season, like if a car has caught fire the stage is cancelled, or you can get a message during the stage that someone has crashed and is out for the entire rallyYou can drive off to early and recieve a penalty.Local split-screenPlenty weather/time of day options-Co-driver is still just copypasted soundbites instead of recordings like DIRT RallyNot a lot of choices in terms of difficulty and assistsLimited FOV options. They are there but not very specificSounds are still meh compared to DIRT Rally (Better than WRC5 tho)Hood cam sucksNo Dash camIn car view is too darkPhysics are still not very advanced, so it's much more a controller gameNo clutch at all. (Do modern rally cars not have this?)Replay only has standard car views and then a helicopter cam that sucks. DIRT or SLRE is much better at thisGraphics are okay, nothing special but it's not ugly eitherSuper Special can not be done in Multiplayer.NeultralsNo rewindsStages can't be restarted in career mode after the first 10 or so seconds			"

												In short words: Finally a fun rally-game with decent sounds, graphics, 67 stages & vertical split-screen for even more fun. For gamepad driver the best rally-game out now. A so-so wheel experience I had with my G27 - more wheel fun brought me SLRE in my home.Who liked RalliSport Challenge 2, the old PS2 WRC Titles and is not looking for a hardcore sim is here right.Some notes I have made while I was rallying:- Fun to drive, but only with boring recent rally cars. No classic rally cars available.- Nice dynamic car-cam & intense driving with cockpit-cam- Night rallies are no fun with bad driving lights- Missing brightness slider- Replay action cam is no fun- Nice replay helicopter cam- Missing FOV-slider- Missing TrackIR- Missing seat & head position adjustments: left-right,..... (Best reference: iRacing (Alt+F12))- Missing features: hide arms & wheel- Menue useless with G27 -> XBox signs- Less gamepad fun with missing optional rewind-feature- Only vertical split-screen :( We prefer horizontal! - Unfriendly Day1 dlc+ for WRC 7: An improved engine with proper anti-aliasing. We have the year 2017 dear devs ;)			"

												As others have said this game is an improvement on any previous WRC game. The physics are better and the tracks are narrower but they are also flat and drifting is easy. The challenge is to keep out of the gullies and avoid the drops. Textures are a bit weak on banking and surface. Like the previous games this supports a limited number of steering wheels. I use the xbox speed wheel, which is supported in the Dirt series of games but not WRC. Saying that there does seem to be more controller adjustment with this game so I can over tweak the sensitivity for it to be used.Not sure about the weather, played one race and it was either fog or rain but came across as just grey screen and a depth of view of about 5 metres.I am disappointed as yet again there are no female drivers which is a total insult to the likes of Louise Cook, Molly Taylor, and Emma Gilmour. Also absent from this game is the WRC3 class which makes vehicles limited.Overall, it is a fun rally game with a large number of tracks to slip and slide around. Visually and tecnically it is weaker than Dirt Rally but still a lot of fun to play.			"

												I was so, so sceptictal about buying this game after feeling this would be a really poor representation of rallying. I've been a huge fan of the WRC for years and have been going to Wales every year since I was 15. After playing DiRT Rally I was convinced that nothing could surpass the quality and simulation from Codemasters' finest creation. WRC 6 obviously comes nowhere close to DiRT Rally. However, I can't say that Kylotonn Racing Games have made a bad game. When I bought this I had the mind-set of ""this isn't a rally sim. It's an arcade game for everyone from novices to experienced gamers."" When I adopted this mind-set my perception of the game totally changed. The handling model isn't bad once you're used to it and the stages are far more satisfying to run than in previous titles.  The sounds aren't like those from WRC 5 nor are the weathering effects to cars. They are actually good (apart from the co-driver who still lacks human emotion-the pace-notes are good though) and shows they have taken the time improve aspects of the game. It even has local co-op which further reinforces it's position as an arcade game. There aren't tonnes of tracks but there are ones from each of the locations on the WRC calendar, which is nice. The cars aren't all copy and paste replicas of one another either and it actually feels like a step up going from WRC 2 to WRC class.  I'll re-iterate- this ISN'T a rally sim. Approach this game like it is one and you'll ♥♥♥♥ing hate it, but approach it as a game you can pick up and play for a few hours, and you'll see WRC 6 in an entirely different light. I'll finish up and say no, don't buy this at full price; by no means is this worth £34.99 not when DiRT 3 and other such titles are cheaper. If it's on sale though (steam or otherwise) grab it. If you're an avid rally fan looking for a simple time-killer, go for WRC 6.FYI: I've had this on PS4 for a while so don't think my opinion is invalid from the Steam game time :)			"

												I would like to say that I agree with the people who say that this is a step up from the last game, unfortunately I cannot. I wanted to give the WRC titles another shot as I always enjoyed them in the past but I don't feel that right now I can recommend this game. The graphics are still very poor compared to other titles.  I have to admit, even on my system running a GTX 1070 with everything cranked up, it still looked like an old xbox 360 title.  The screenshots posted on the store actually look nothing like the game.  I hate to say it, but it feels like false advertising.  I always liked the fact that you start off in the junior leagues in the WRC titles and work your way up but the actual driving physics which should be the most important aspect feels so off.  Yes the cars feel weightier but you cannot justify the snap oversteer/understeer that you feel.  Comparing this to Dirt Rally is unfair. Codemasters have been doing this for years and honed it.  Dirt Rally is as close to a simulated rally experience you can get here on Steam, this isn't a simulation at all even though it has a sim handling option.  Treating it as a stand alone racer, I don't find the experience rewarding and although it is better than WRC 5, it still has a long way to go before it is as enjoyable as the original titles.  I feel that what is needed is a new focus.  Rather than churning out a new itineration every year, take the time to actually get the car physics right.  I admire the fact that you have 1:1 scale stages but what is the point if you feel like every turn is laboured.  Do what Slightly Mad and Codemasters done and get this into Early Access and let us racers actually make this the game that we all hoped it would be. I was seriously hoping for better and I hope that things get sorted out otherwise I can just see the WRC titles just not existing and us all just going back to Dirt Rally.			"

												I play with an xbox controller and the handling feels good. Literally tons of stages from the WRC calendar. Looks great on my system but I had to bump the resolution right up to get it that way. Excellent sounds too. No it's not DR, but it's pretty good and I would recommend it.			"

												EDIT: Oct 26    I must change my rating for recommending this game to warn all who may consider buying. At first the team was interactive with the customer and I truly believed the few ""bugs"" would be fixed. Sadly I believe the main""bug"" of rapid frame drops and micro stuttering is not something this team is experienced or cares enough to fix, and it is deal breaker for anyone interested in this game because if anything it has gotten worse just like last years attempt at ""fixing"" it with 2 versions of V-SYNC, neither of which fixes the problem. Yes it does help, but in 2016 and this being their second attempt at this title, they have failed the customer again. So in closing-unless by some miracle they fix this game breaking issue-along with some other ""bugs"" like the pace note calling being rubbish and sounding like some crazy mad man is in the car screaming certain calls usually too late, save your money . I have above the recommended specs for this game and run it on medium and still have the stuttering and frame drops, so its definately not my rig. Have a GTX970 iCore5 6500 16 GB of DDR4 2133MhZ ram, so you be the judge on why it still runs crappy?WRC 6 first off is NOT in the same league as Dirt Rally, but, it really cant be and still be sold to the masses. Rally is a cliche already, and to make it as real and difficult as Dirt would not help sales. I will say that I own all 6 WRC titles and WRC 6 which was made by this same developer is a HUGE improvement over last year. The cars seem to be a little more in touch with the road and the different surfaces. the tracks are quite different than any previous title and vary enough to keep you interested. Now ehn WRC 5 came out last year I purchased it and gave it a recommend, then they tryed to fix it and did more harm than good. This year there doesnt seem to be as many issues as last year except for the V-Sync , screen tearing issue. Not as bad for me as for some others, but, still present and the most dissappointing issue about the title. I have a GTX970 and Windows 10 64 bit, iCore5 6600 and msi Motherboard, 16 GB DDR 4 2133 MhZ,  not the best, but pretty good, and I dont have hardly any FPS drops or screen tearing issues as I have heard some complain of  the game has a lot of different ways to play, hot seat being one of my favorites, and you can start at WRC JR and work your way up in career mode. You can design your own championship with any class and put the rallies in any order or just your favorites. All in all, good FFB and not bad physics if you choose sim mode.  I am very hopeful that the few issues there are will be given the proper attention and be fixed, the main problem being the PACENOTES. They dont come on time even adjusting the timing in menu and sound ridiculous, takes away from the immersiveness of the rally. The FOV and no rear view nor seat adjustments are unconscionable in a new title when they should be included as a no brainer. The rear view is what I think is a big issue mainly when you are playing head to head against someone, and i always like to take a gander back once in a while in the game just to see what i hit and the damage it caused.  In my opinion (and I own all of the modern games RRRE  Dirt Project CARS Assetto Corsa Automobilista) to name a few and enjoy sims more than arcade racers, but, this is good enough to own if you enjoy racing games and want the WRC lisence experience. I would say that if you liked GRID Autosport and its sim-cade experience, than this is as good at least as that.			"

												Review based on version 1.0.53If you want a simulation and play with a wheel, than Dirt Rally is game for you and WRC 6 will disappoint you. But if you want a funny and easy-to-learn simcade (mixture between pure arcade like in Need for Speed and simulation like in Dirt Rally or Richard Burns Rally) title, you will have fun with it :) Two different games for different audiences.It improved a lot compared to WRC 6. The super special stages are new. Random events like tyre punctures, too.Graphics and sound are only mediocre (much better compared to WRC 5, but still not as good as Dirt 3), but drifting around is a lot of fun, even with a keyboard. Unlike Dirt Rally, this game forgives errors and one small mistake doesn't mean you have to restart the stage. The variety of tracks and cars is great, unfortunately there are no classic rally cars (e.g. group B). The weather effects can create an amazing athmosphere, driving through sweden at night while it snows is something very different compared to the same stage at daylight with sunshine. Set ""Digital Vibrance"" to 70 % in the Nvidia control panel for much better graphics and more intense light (for Nvidia desktop users only).I do not have the stuttering some players experience. For the too dark nights or fogs, see the tip with the ""Digital Vibrance"" above.Attention: the retail DVD doesn't contain any gamedata! Only the Steam installer and the serial.			"

												Casual rally and driving gamer here. Definitely harder than Dirt 3 but not as hard as Dirt Rally. The control will require some getting use to but overall it's pretty arcady. The game also has some nice community events that gets updated regularly with a nice online feature. Recommended for people who just wants to shred some dirt.			"

												I used to like this game a lot. Then I found some bugs. No big deal right? Patch came out, didn't fix the bugs, and actually added MORE bugs. Now the game runs like it's a potato(it used to be fine), on a GTX960, and the suspension will break if you go over a twig, or even just brake to hard. The off track reset system is awful, sometimes it won't reset you if you drive 500 meters of the track, other times it resets if one tyre comes off the road by a millimeter. If these problems were fixed, I would love this game. But, sadly, just like the previous game, Kylotonn has seemingly forgot about it, or gave up. It's a dead game I guess.			"

												This is my first and only negative review about a racing game, or any product.  Having said that I will start with the positive bits.  The physics are improved over WRC 5, but not as much as people say in their reviews.  I love the special stages, and wish I could import them into Assetto somehow, but that's not the point is it? The game is fun as an arcade game, but in our age of Dirt Rally, Assetto Corsa, and Rfactor 2, no developer has business creating a rally game where you don't need to use the hand brake.  Using it made me slower on the simulation setting, so I just tried turning and braking like in WRC 5 on the same simulation setting and I was able to do a perfect drift each time. Ok, that was the positive part, if you can call it that.  The physics and feedback people talk about is nothing but a constant rattle of the wheel.  My fanatac was just rattling no matter what the terrain was, or how big the bumps were.  This fake feeling of feeback from the tires and road just became annoying after a short time.  This game is not in the same league as Dirt Rally in any area except SS tracks, and for my money nowhere close to Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo either.  What SLRE had going for it was one very simple little thing, the feel of weight transfer of the vehicle when braking.  I believe that they nailed that over any other rally game in history, and i'm sure it's thanks to Loeb, but people trash it cause understandably they were expecting the greatest rally game ever made, because of how great he was.  I won't compare this to RBR.The cartoon like graphics don't bother me so much.  In fact, they make the environment more lively and pretty.  However, what developers need to realize is that those types of graphics make colours bleed into each other, which makes it hard to see the road.  The reason realistic graphics work is because it creates a visual contrast that allows you to look further down the road.I actually feel kind of bad giving this game a bad review, because generally I love racing games, simracing games, and especially rally racing games, and would love to encourage developers to make more of them.  I hope that the develper listens to the community and gives us a proper rally game that feels like a rally game.  If they only fixed the fake ffb (fffb), and fixed the physics so drifts don't feel assisted in simulation mode (so you have to use a handbrake to go faster around hairpins), I would completely recommend it.

												I was looking for some early review performance-wise like but since I was unable to find any, I decided to buy the game and try it on my own. Wasn't guite sure how it's going to perform on my Lenovo Y50 with i7-4710, GTX 860, SSD & Win10, so here it is.What seems to be a huge improvement over the last year's WRC 5, here you have the list options available from the in-game menu which is useful if you need to tweak the game while in playing. I tried few options already mosty in tutorial races and so far I can only say that I can run the game in high settings on 1600/900 resolution at 60 FPS most of the time with random drops to 55-58. Barely noticeable comparing to WRC 5 lagging when my laptop by some reasons couldn't maintain the stable frame rate. I don't mind running in lower resolutions so as you can guess now by doing so I don't spot any FPS drops. There is also much more options to be tweaked comparing to WRC5. However I do miss a proper AA mode, FXAA seems to be a bit off to my liking. Overall I must say after less then 60 minutes within the game, the optimization seems to be more friendly than WRC5 or SLR. What may also matters to some of you, I find the performance better than DR, but that might be due to a higher game requirements for Codemasters game overall.I wasn't really playing for long but driving with XBOX360 controller seems to be well optimized as well, it's easy enough to drive even on pro settings without giving you that terrible impression the previous game had. Voice acting is done nicely, the copilot doesn't really scream as he used to have in last's game. Sounds of the engine are, well, far from what DR has to offer, but it's definitely an improvement. I might say a bit more if I play a bit more.So if you hesitate if you want to buy it and you're bored already with DR, try it.EDITED:So after few more hours in the game I have to say I gave up 900p for 720p in order to keep my stable frame rate at 60 FPS (still same Lenovo Y50). I have a feeling that vegetation density is the bottleneck for me at this game. Actually I do play on both settings & post process effects set on high with vegetation set as medium. I hope there will be a patch coming soon to improve the performance, but hey, the game is only/already few days old so it should be/should have been fixed somehow.Speaking about the graphics, I must say the interior camera (the one I always use on rally games) sucks badly on night stages, I mean it's simply really ugly. I think I switch to far side view for this game. In all fairness, I'd love to drive some other cars like classics, but I know it's the official WRC game so I won't keep my hopes too high. Anyway, game is still recommended, however I do wait for performance patch. Please.			"

			My review of WRC 6 on the PC. Written review below: It is the second year now for Kylotonn Racing Games and Bigben Interactive. There has been definite improvement since last years WRC 5.		

It is the second year now for Kylotonn Racing Games and Bigben Interactive.  There has been definite improvement since last years WRC 5.  Is it on the same simulation level as Dirt Rally no however this being the official WRC game they are aiming to be more accessible.  They have a multitude of difficulty settings which allow you to go from the arcade to simulation which is fairly close to the level of Dirt Rally which I am impressed by.The engine sounds have gotten better and the pace notes are back to what most people know with a 1-6 which is nice.  Handling feels good if at times a bit loose but I have only played the Junior WRC in career where setup changes are not allowed.  The stages also feel more like the real world counterparts this year which is also a huge plus.Downside would be the damage model feels too forgiving but then almost all games are like this.  For example in the video I run into a fence and have next to no damage from the impact.Overall I would recommend this even if you have WRC 5 as they have done a good improvement over last year unlike most yearly releases as long as you know it is a more simcade than simulation.

												This game is a blast.It's not a sim drivers sim - get dirt rally if you want more of a sim experience.What this game does do though, it does pretty much perfectly.The sense of speed when you use the bonnet camera is thrilling.The xbox controller works fantastically with this game. I use my steering wheel for games like Automobilista, Assetto Crosa, and Dirty Rally, but this game works so well on the xbox controller.I've found myself playing this game more than the other games I mentioned earlier, becasue I can just plug in my controller and have a blast - theres just the right amount of arcade thrill mixed with good physics for a fun challenge.For those of us who don't want to 'overdo' it with sims - getting expensive wheels, force feedback chairs, 3 screen monitors etc - this game rocks			"

												Short review here: I find myself agreeing with the IGN review of this game and score of 7.1/10. Physics are solid, even if a bit ""arcady"" compared to Dirt Rally. I'd been on hiatus from DIrt Rally after putting nearly 50 hours, and I very much like the change of pace and fun factor that WRC 6 offers.Picked this up on sale for around $27. I expect to put in a lot of hours into WRC 6 before returning to DIrt Rally.  I can definitely recommend this title even if you already own Dirt Rally. Playing both titles with a Logitech G27.  Note: this is the first ever WRC title I've played, so I am unable to compare WRC 6 to previous WRC titles.			"

												Nov. 11, 2016More frustration again.It appears there is very little to none side traction/friction. When going into corners, especially in dirt, you should be able to slide into the corner and it should slow down quite a bit. But WRC 6 just does not do that. 10/20/2016: Now getting more frustrated unfortunately!What is with the Brakes on these cars? You CANNOT lock them up, at least now with my G25 wheel/pedal combo. In snow the brakes appear to do almost nothing and you must have your foot on the brake at all times. The only way to drive effectively is on HOOD cam view, and then you miss the windshield wipers!More notes as of late:  -The car always seems to be too slippery on every surface other than tarmac-Snow with studded tires should be incredible grip, yet is as if the tires are bald in the rain on tarmac-Cockpit view is nearly impossible to see out of-Hood cam is too high up10/8/2015: Still loving it!Just a few ideas I had:-more ground cameras-Skoda Fabia R5 has 5 speeds not 6-adjustable seat-remove the tinted upper area of the window, its hard to see through it (some cars have it, not all)-Clutch pedalThis is a really fun game!  We get windshield wipers!  Engine sounds are great, gfx are great!  Personally I turn my racing games DOWN in gfx for better FPS. I like to run above 100FPS.  WRC 6 runs 130+ on VERY HIGH Gfx, but I still turn in down to HIGH and get 150+ fps. (GTX 980). Handling is very good and I really like the smooth tracks they have created.Overall (after 118minutes of play) Rating  9 / 10.			"

												I like rally, I like official content. This game gives you both, so I am satisfied with it. Real drivers, real cars (well done models), nice tracks - the Super Special Stages are really made 1:1 like in reality, the rest of Special Stages is fictional, however, I noticed they include some well known elements taken from real tracks, like Colin's Crest, Portugal Fafe's jump, Catalonia donuts, harpin etc. This is nice that those places are recognizable in game. Those tracks are narrow and bumpy, some are short sprints, some of them are over 10km long and take over 8 min to finish.  Some tracks miss curvature on gravel corners (are bit too flat) in my opinion, but generally stage design is very nice. You got standard career, ""from zero to hero"", with many nice flavors in it. Repairing your car, gravel/tarmac/snow setup settings, tires, everything is here. What is strange, I found there is no WRC 3 class in career, nor in whole game (there are: WRC Junior, WRC 2 and WRC).However, there is almost as many disadvantages as advantages. Generally the framerate in game is quite decent. Even on my lower-end PC it runs on about 40 fps (low settings) which is great, but huge part ofcommunity suffers from suttering - freezig game for splitseconds (sometimes after that game speeds up to compensate time - depending how long freeze was) This is unacceptable in rally game, when 1 second of stutter makes you go off road, straight into a tree. Devs realased a patch which should fix it, for some it does, for others it does not. I am in the second half of community in that case. At the beggining, for about 2 weeks after realase devs have been contacting players as they said ""to make their product better"" (such phrases appeared on almost every post) after what, they realased couple patches which did not introduce significant improvements. They just patch some critical bugs, which should never appear in final realase game. Also it is worth to say - first of them was critical patching for people who couldn't run game on realase day because of error - I was in those group agin. Now, on 8th of November - developers are keeping silent for around 3 weeks (last patch - 18th of October) leaving game unplayable for some people - some wheels doesn't work while they should - supported equipment list says that. However there is a slight chance they are keeping silent because working on patches, but I don't really belive (if it comes to be true and patch will be realesed I will add EDIT on the end of the review). We all are waiting for stutter fix and camera angles fix - the cockpit view is hardly playable - you can't see the track sometimes through strange (small) windshield. To end with - multiplayer mode is badly designed - 90% of time you will get ""connection error"" which is caused by missing online players waiting in lobby, which is radical, not having enough online players 1 month after realase. Only if you open your own lobby some people might join; come on, we got 2016 year... - that suggest the match-making feature is badly designed.This is what I found playing this game and also as being a part of it's community. Maybe you won't encouter those problems but I did. On the other hand, if the game would be free from huge stutters, (probably due to my low PC spec; it could run better because framerate is smooth), I could 100% enjoy it, and reccomend it as a rally enthusiast - and that is why I give it a positive note. But in such state decision belongs to you.EDIT: After long silence, developers have introduced patch o two, but none of them repaired any issues mentioned. Just fixing wheel support agin and injected some things for new eSports League (ranking system etc). "

												Gameplay solo - 7/10Gameplay multiplayer - 10/10Sounds - 8/10  , much better than DIrt RallyGFX - 9/10 , if you have comp for very high ( i dont )Content 5/10 - there should be like 8 stages+SSSCo-driver need to be patched alot. He let you sometimes crash , cause he is slow. Less useless information , and implement better critical situation warning.Give woman and man choice of co-driver voice.Sometimes car is reseted just few meters away from road. Should be fixed. I dont want something like in WRC 5 , that ppl cutting alot , but on some spots (for example  Deutchland stages) , there is reset and shouldnt be.Multiplayer lobby  need chat and ready check.( this is critical )I like spectators. Those waving at you are best :)  , BUt anyway , game needs more of the spectators. In real, ppl are almost everywhere. And .. some spectators are on danger place , where they never should be.Summary - i give 8/10 , for WRC6Its really good rally game. I played DIrt Rally alot , which is more realistic ( roads , physics ) , but WRC got better gameplay overall. Escpecialy for better multiplayer.Worth to buy , i expecting more content , roads , possibly group B cars./cheers			"

												I like how they have a veriaty of tracks and cars. It is fun to be able to drive and race as my favorite driver I see on tv.However...I have a G27 race wheel and I cannot get any car to handle like a car should no matter what I try. It makes the game unplayable and not fun. The tracks are not from real life. This may not be a big deal for some, but I find that the tracks are more of a made up arcade game rather than what it would be like in real life. The car do not operate like I would expect or even hope. When you hit red line RPM the car keep accelerating quite a bit. And the turbo gauge is almost always at full. This is what I would want from a game I was hoping to be more of a simulator. Overall I do not like this game. I STRONGLY prefer Dirt Rally (and soon to be Dirt 4!!!!!!!) and am rather disapointed I even purchased this game.			"

												As mentioned numerous times already, WRC 6 is a significant improvement over the previous titles in this series. Perhaps the biggest endorsement of this game I can offer, is to say that after playing 210 hours of Dirt Rally (the benchmark against which all rally titles will now be measured), I still immediately enjoyed WRC 6. Well, almost immediately - I had to experiment with the wheel settings for about 30 minutes before finding settings I was satisfied with.  It was definitely worth it, as the game quickly went from being mediocre, to very, very good. I'm using a Fanatec CSR Elite and the feedback and feel is excellent.Anyway, let's get on with inevitable Dirt Rally comparison. While the game isn't as visually spectacular as Dirt Rally, the graphics are a marked improvement on previous versions, and generally very pleasing to the eyes.  The game doesn't appear to be too demanding of your hardware either, and will run in 1080p at very high settings on my machine (which has a fairly modest spec sheet by today's standards). I have no complaints about the audio either. Again, probably not quite up to Dirt's standards, but more than adequate nonetheless. The physics? Well, that will really depend on your perspective, but for me, WRC 6 falls short of Dirt Rally in this regard, as the physics simply don't have that realistic simulation feel.  If however, you prefer less challenging, 'arcade' style physics, then you'll likely enjoy the car behaviour in WRC 6 more than Dirt Rally.  I turned the settings to simulation and turned off all assists, and I find the handling to be a good balance between arcade and simulation, and for the most part, challenging enough to be enjoyable.WRC 6 also can't compete with Dirt Rally for variety of content, the latter offering Hill Climb and Rally Cross events in addition to the standard Rally events. These additions are by no means a novelty either, they are brilliantly executed, and keep you coming back for more.  WRC 6 does however offer an esports competition, an officail online WRC if you like, which is a great addition for all of us wannabe WRC drivers.If it's starting to sound like a one-sided fight, and a clear victory for Dirt Rally, well it's not quite that simple. If, like me, you're a WRC fanatic, then WRC 6 trumps Dirt in one key area - official content. You get all 14 rounds of the 2016 championship, all the official drivers, teams, cars etc. which is very appealing for hardcore WRC fans. The stages are fanatstic too.  Rally enthusiasts will be pleased to know that the stages are now properly narrow, and some of those stages are now also seriously long, and will really test your concentration levels. Objectively, WRC 6 falls short of Dirt Rally in almost every way, but it's a game that seems to be greater than the sum of its parts, and for me, is at times even more enjoyable than Codies' recent masterpiece.  Time will tell if WRC 6 has the enduring appeal of Dirt Rally, but at the moment I'm loving it, and can't see myself getting bored of it anytime soon. If you're a rally fan and a keen gamer, do yourself a favour...			"

												Definitely a sim game this time around: functional wipers, manual headlights, time penalties for in-race tyre changes (after getting a puncture), time penalties for getting off-road, authentic engine sounds, more realistic stage designs, narrower roads, and more complex physics. It's more sim than arcade. Ignore the Dirt Rally Fanboys, like all Fanboys and most Mainstream gamers they are fully content with playing just ONE game from every single genre or niche they come across, and obsess over it like some child. Dirt Rally is awesome and you should get it, however I don't want to play the same rally game over and over and over. I want variety, I want new and different content. I like racing games, not just 'A' racing game or 'THE' racing game. If you are the same you should have a look at WRC 6, as well as Loeb Rally and all other non-Codemasters racing games.The standout feature for me so far in WRC 6 is the stage designs. While I enjoyed the aggressiveness of the stages in WRC 5 they felt a bit similar after a while. The stages in WRC 6 are completely new and different from WRC 5. They are much more varied and unique. I've not had any technical issues so far, 'true' I had to tweak the settings to get the game to run smoothly, but I've been forced to do that with every racing game I've played for the last 20 years, even the mighty Dirt Rally. It's the reality of playing games on PC.			"

												It’s always difficult to quantify a rally game because we all want different things from a driving experience. WRC 6 isn’t a demanding sim like Dirt Rally but it bridges the gap between arcade and realism nicely. The cars handle well and playing it on PC it seems made with an Xbox controller in mind. Graphically it’s a big improvement over what has come before and has everything you would expect in terms of career mode. If you enjoy rally games and want a break from the strict intensity of Dirt Rally then WRC 6 is the game to kick back and have fun with.			"

												Well, well..This edition of the WRC family suprised me...I have good memories on the WRC4 version, but bad with the WRC5 one..(played that one only a couple of hours and knew enough, what a crap was that..)OK, it's not as good as RBR or DiRT Rally (cause they are the best of the rest, and even called a Simulation game in the Rally buisiness of games). But for a Arcade rally game WRC 6 suprised me at all, in the positive way.. It's fun and easy to drive with my G25 wheel. And much better than the WRC5. The Graphics are great. Only the sound of the car-engine (like a vacuumcleaner) and the pace/calls are crap.. But for WRC game standards the best after all.. WRC6 is for fun, DiRT Rally is for real..			"

												If like most you were horribly disappointed in the appalling WRC 5 but liked the premise and want the full WRC Championship then you will be amazed at how dramatically improved this edition is.  Outstanding from the get go with none of the crushing disappointments of WRC 5.  Only downside is the night stages still suffer from ridiculously poor lighting and the graphics engine struggles with bad weather causing the visibility to drop dramatically.  But when the weather is good it's a BLAST for some casual fun! It is not Dirt Rally but it really is good.  Very enjoyable and an excellent price.  If you like rally racing DO NOT hesitate!			"

												Despite all the negative reviews, probably written by professional rally drivers, the game is fun and easy to get into. In comparison to Dirt, the game has small pieces like the scenes of the car sitting in a tent after the stage and mechanics working on it that brings the whole game together and makes you feel like you are part of the team. Performance is good, running without stutter on high with GTX970.			"

												Not as Good as Dirt Rally by any means, but possibly not as bad as some make it out to be for the £15 I paid.   Happy to have another Rally game to play and have a bit of fun in.  WORTH GETTING IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TWEAK THINGS AND PRACTISE UNTIL IT FEELS RIGHT AND USE SIMILAR SETTINGS TO MIMIC THE LIGHT FEEL OF THOSE SUGGESTED BY 'REAL RALLY DRIVER' for DIRT RALLY  Here is the video with the settinggs demonstrated for Dirt Rally:


YouTube™ Video: Logitech G25/G27 - DiRT Rally Force Feedback Settings by Real Rally Driver 

			Views: 36,111		

			I had a few requests from my previous video on what settings I used with DiRT Rally for my Logitech G25 steering wheel. So I decided to make a small video which shows the settings I use for the...		

Ok I'll keep this brief.  Bought this game having already played DIRT RALLY loads using G27.  I had to tweak that game a lot until I was happy and only when I stumbled upon the amazing Irish REAL RALLY DRIVER settings (can't remember the guy's name) - much LIGHTER settings, less is more, get that wheel light and movable rather than all heavy and stodgy.    Was initially immediately dissapointed with WRC 6, it felt terrible - FFB felt plastic WAY WAY TOO HEAVY and also relying WAY too much on the self-aligning torque of the wheel itself rather than any actual feel from the road/tyres etc.HOWEVER - after tweaking around with the wheel settings and logitech profiler. and the in game settings I got things feeling pretty close to what I was used to in DR and AFTER A FEW STAGES WAS HAVING ALMOST AS MUCH FUN AS DIRT RALLY, although there is clearly less detail in the feel and the graphics aren't as immersive.I am now happy with this game and don't regret the purchase, in fact it's nice to have a Rally Game which is slightly less involved than DR and also a little easier once you get used to it.  If you're happy with lighter FFB settings on your wheel for Rally Driving (and you should be, less is more in Rally Driving!), this game CAN be made to work.    Here are my settings for G27:Logitech Profiler (Excatly the same as 'REAL RALLY DRIVER' recommendations for DR):Overall Strength: 57%Spring Effect: 0Damper: 0Enable Spring 0% (not checked)Degrees of ROtation: 655Use Special Game Settings (UNCHECKED - unusual, but works for me)In Game Settings;Accel Sens: 20Accell Dead: 0Brake Sens:20Brake Dead: 0Steering Sens: 30Steering Dead: 0Force Feedback: 5%  (yes light as a feather guys it's what you need for decent Rally Driving!)Levle of Vibration: 65%Max Wheel Angle: 900  (yes this doesn't match the profiler , but it works, and grades the FFB right for me).Well each to his own, I think if you prefer HEAVIER wheel settings WRC 6 probably cannot be made to feel good because the weight is achieved in a terribly crude way in their FFB, not sure why it is so poor.  But  for LIGHT settings it;s not so much an issue.			"

												Sadly this game didn't work for me which is a shame. I enjoyed WRC5 on PS4 but have largely moved over to PC gaming since. I was pleasantly surprised to read other reviews stating this game is much improved over the last one. However, when I tried to play it, the horrendous stuttering made it completely unplayable. I tried altering all the settings to no avail. Looking at the discussions, this is a common issue and this was also present in the PC version of WRC5 and was never fixed. Therefore, I have asked for a refund. If the developers fix this issue then I will likely repurchase it and alter my review but for now I cannot recommend a product that didn't work.			"

There's more polish to the games accents, then there is realistics on environment, car physics, and what I can only describe as ""Janky"" menu interface and controls, and settings! The Online Multiplayer system is not functional, after hunting for it. Why is it every time there's a Official Endorsement on a racing game, the game always sucks? It doesn't reflect well on the sport...makes no sense to me. Anyway, I don't recommend wasting your money (like I did) on this game, you will be disappointed as well as angry for relying on feedback that's false!			"

It was harder to kick the back end out on garvel.I read that WRC6 only has modern WRC cars but much more stages conpared with DiRT, but I haven't played enough to confirm that.WRC 6 is much more beginner freindly, so if you got frustrated with DiRT but still like rallying, this game is worth your time.If you are a die hard rally sim fan and are happy with DiRT Rally (and are not tired of the lack of stages), feel free to pass.

Bad FFB undercountsteering, as if going thru glue. Correcting and scandavian flicks were almost impossible with the heavy feel.Bad car variety (due to bland WRC cars)Bad non existent cockpit movement options, in a racing game in 2016 ..cmon!Yes i could/should of tried for longer but the awful heavy feeling self aliging torque and the pendulum effect it caused, put me off and lack of ffb options. Could be patched i suppose.

												imagine a Rally game where you can't use your handbrake. I have the Fanatec csw v2, csp v3, and a Fanatec handbrake. So nothing unusual or exotic. It took me almost one hour to figure out how to activate my wheel. You have to disconnect all USB devices to make wrc6 working with your PC. No button box, no shifter. The next day I couldn't connect the wheel again. Don't know why. Last but not least I could not activate my handbrake in the game! A Rally game without handbrake!? Are you kidding me! These WRC titles are just something for controller kids. The whole navigation through the menus of WRC 6  are made for consoles (xbox symbols), no mouse navigation, just keyboard entries. No serious stuff like DiRT Rally. I'm really disappointed and angry about to release a game that is not more then a beta version. Even the game Wreckfest, that is currently available as an early access version handels my wheel and button box, navigation as well better than WRC 6. Nothing more than a merchandising article of WRC. I got my refund already. When the developer have done their homework I might buy it again.			"

												WRC6 is to my eyes the best version of the game the devs have created since they bought the license to the series. The graphics are a lot nicer the 5, with the detail and environmental effects on the car being second to none on the market, simply put - its awesome. Dirt/snow/gravel/mud buildup is really nicely done, its just a shame the replay camera's are not quite up to how good it looks. In fact, all the cameras are a bit wacky, why they move backwards as you go faster - I have no idea.It features every rally on the calendar, and the stages do bear resemblance to their real life counterparts (with Germany to my eyes being a perfect example of this). The career is well thought out with the lower series included (which is a great introduction to the game and how the cars feel).I could not get my G27 to work with the game, but using my 360 controller, I can't think of a game that works better with the controller. I know exactly how much I need to turn, and that is everything for a game.However, the pacenotes are in some corners do not forewarn dangers, or in some cases are just wrong for the corner ahead, which gives me no confidence going into each corner, but tbh I don't really care about the esport side of this game.Well worth it if you like rally games, more 'full' content then dirt rally has.EDIT: I have got my wheel to work in-game, but the FFB is so bad I much rather it hadn't worked at all.6.5/10			"

												I can't help but compare this to DiRT Rally. It's just poor effort in every aspect. It doesn't run as well, the handling and controls are nowhere near as intuitive (maybe ""familiar"", in my case), the graphics suck, the camera angles are horrible and the co-driver's voice and tone is unbearably robotic. Unless you're desperate for official cars and stages from the WRC calendar and/or are a huge fan of rallying and are highly skilled at rally games, I cannot recommend this over any of the DiRT games (except maybe DiRT Showdown :P).

												The worst rally game ever! The fisics of the car is the same on every surface (playing with the more realistic settigns) and you are not able to set up anything! damages are ininfluent on the car or on the engine. Gears are too short ancd you cannot tune them. The car will spinn even in 4th gear! The grafic is quite good but the sound is horrible!Don't waste your money, buy Seb Loeb Rally or Dirt Rally. Now I understand why WRC6 is cheeper than WRC5!!			"

												Played for only 11mins and had to request a refund.  To put it simply, WRC6 doesn't even compare to Dirt Rally.  It just has this arcarde-like feel to it, and no sense of realism.  With the graphics set to max, it still looked ""malnourished.""  I will say that the different stages/locations WRC6 has to offer are nice, where as Dirt Rally has only so many.  WRC6 (and as with most racing games) was designed for a racing wheel, one that I do no have.  So attempting to find a setup for the controller was almost impossible.  This might be the reason why I felt the controls for the game to be ""clunky"" lol but hey, us gamepad players gotta complain about something (Dirt Rally gamepad controls did not have this issue btw).  The overall sounds too were just, meh.  I couldn't get serious, I didn't feel immersed and again, Dirt Rally certainly didn't lack in this area of their department.There are many other reasons why I wouldn't reccommend to purchase this game, but to leave an honest review I'm going to just end it here.  Those are my top pros/cons.  If you're looking at the pictures and starting to get the ""drools"" as I like to call it, please do not let that be your determining factor.  Yes this game is cheap and if I'm not mistaken, there is a special sale going on for it as I'm typing this review.  But if you're willing to spend the $35 for it, might as well keep it in your pocket and put it towards Dirt Rally :)			"

												I was skeptical about this game after seeing the reviews but all I can say is: They're wrong. This game is a great balance of realism and fun and I am completely addicted to it. Yes, it's hard, harder than Dirt 3 but it's supposed to be... When you get the hang of it, it's simply a dream to drive. Yes some tracks are repeated but THIS IS AN OFFICIAL GAME! This happens in real life so the game does the same... Come on people. If you're after a great rally game that takes some time to master but rewards you with so much fun and pleasure then BUY THIS!

												Gameplay vice it seems that thay have come some way since WRC 5. Handling, sound and FFB is improved.But if you try Dirt Rally right after a stint of WRC 6, there is still not one element that matches the level of Dirt Rally, in every aspect is WRC 6 still inferior to Dirt Rally. And by a comfortable margin.One thing that could be better in WRC 6 is the fact that its backed by a licence, but that is not something that speaks for the game itself.Lots of problems with controller setup.

												I must be playing a completley different game to everyone else? First off it won't recognise my wheel/shifter/Handbrake so it's an xbox controller for me, great immersion not....APPLE! secondly it's running quite poorly and i have a high end pc...APPLE!My rift resolution looks better than this, and the stuttering WTF?....APPLE!Handling is arcade at best, but i always knew it would be...APPLE!Why the F### does that droid sat next to me keep shouting APPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I already have a rubbish rally game i'm stuck with thanks to Milestone so this has got to go. It's not finished and i can't be bothered waiting for the developers to get it finished. The discount says it all to me...Sweetner??....APPLE!Long live codemasters nothing ever seems to come close. So if your a massive Dirt fan like me but keep hoping for something to match it than this is most definatley not it. We will just have to wait for Dirt 2. F###ing APPLE!This is just my opinion and everyone else seems to be enjoying it...But maybe they have to go bed at 9 and the adults will  start to review it. In short Simple/unfinished/annoying/dissappointing and full of chuffin APPLES apparently! which are clearly a hazard in WRC			"

												Improvements Gallore - Much better than last year's game! I have good wheel support now, can assign my TH8-A shifter as a handbrake in standard mode by assigning 4th to handbrake. (not sequential) Happy about this. Driving feels better, the co-driver robot is improved; still not fluid though and shouts ""apple"" for some reason.I really would love a clutch override pedal. I can't assign the clutch at all, which makes drifting feel really weird. It's a much different experience than Dirt rally - this is modern WRC, which isn't quite as exciting to me is having all types of cars, but I feel that it adequately captures the WRC experience, even though the cars aren't my favorite types of rally cars.  Also, it lacks a female co-driver voice. Boo. Otherwise, I'm having fun with it.  "

												In my opinion this is a good game. it is much easier than dirt 3 to play which makes the game play different.it could be improved given just a little more development time. It sufferes from fps slowdown that i cannot seem to get rid of, even though i have a top spec machine. which is the worst snag. the other snag is in gameplay with the pacenotes. Even if you set them to furthest ahead setting they are still far to late in some places to be worth listening to.But i think as far as nailing it down country lanes goes this game is quite good and worth buying. ( i know nothing about using stearing wheels and cluches etc, Ive never used them on video games. So i cant comment on what it is like as a real driving simulator !! Only as a game. But it works well with an xbox controller :-)better than wrc 5 by a clear mile !  "

												This is probably the best WRC game so far, but since WRC 1-5 are trash that doesn't mean much.Positive:- lots of lengthy stages in 10+ different countries- handling is a great mix between realism and arcade- graphics are okay, some stages are actually beautifulNegative:- while I get 90+ fps on my gtx1070, the game looks like it's rendered at 20fps. Lots of stuttering while turning or at the sides of the track.- career mode isn't really exciting- annoying co-drivers voice- difficulty is rather unbalanced: normal is way too easy, hard is too challengingMight be a good buy when the game is on sale, but I regret buying it at full price at launch.

												I was not expecting much but for twenty bucks I had to try the only other rally franchise that interested me over the years and am pleased to report that the game is actually good. Sure it doesnt feel as responsive or have as much physics into the driving model as our resident hero: Dirt...BUT it does very well for itself and after a few races I was able to get into that ""rally flow"" (flick left, right...feathering the brake...etc) and THAT is what matters ! I played a demo of this on console a few months back and hated it as it ran poorly but on PC this game handles pretty good with a higher fps and possibly better simulation model.As long as you're not trying to replace Dirt, this racer is a great addition to rally fans libraries.*UPDATE*  This game has some serious controller issues that need to be ironed out BUT with that being said, I have started playing the game using my Logitech Wheel and it's night and day in comparison...It's almost like theres a completely different driving model in-play when using a wheel and I would recommend using this control scheme as opposed to a controller.

												Initially thinking it was reasonable for a pad based rally game, and even giving it a positive review, it just seemed to get worse, not better, with time.Although this title is the best in the series thus far, it pails in comparison even to the likes of Xpand Rally and My Summer Car (even with just a pad/keyboard, not tried either with a wheel).For a proper rally experience, pad or wheel users should look at Dirt Rally, or Richard Burns Rally with the RSRBR mod. Keep an eye out for gRally, an upcoming sim by the team that made the RBR Online mod. Both DR and RBR do a better job at delievering a realistic rallying experience than the official WRC licensed game does.You might like it for an hour, then you realise how terrible that co-driver is, and it just escalates from there. Stay clear.			"

I found it unforgiving and difficult. Even after numerous runs on the same track I couldn't place a competative time. Maybe I'm just rubbish at rally games. This being said I was using a keyboard.

Yeah your friend half the screen and fight for who would be the winner or 8 friends beers and just wait to play after the first crosses the line! The best time  takes it all9: Better by far than WRC 5  10: Tyre choice which affect the time and durability of your actual tyres Now the bad things...1: Physics..if this game has proper physics at all...dont get me wrong but sometimes its like you drive a feather...You can only proper brake by acceleration and braking together,The handbrake sometimes feel like touching a rock and the car is turning..2: Transmission... oh... its like CVT on a Vespa...NO absolutely feel on the gears you can hit from 6 to 1 and nothing happens you not gonna feel anything, come on! 3: Pacenotes...Yes they are bad,computeraized and they will get inside your nerves so for me they are 0 in the sound menu! 4: Graphics...Well they are not that bad at all but i am hit them here because they can be improved a lot..5: 3D models of the cars also are not that bad but they can be recreated with moe details and in a greater scale 6: Online. Yes you would expect that you will log into WRC6 a day need a challenge with others players! hahahah NO! Online is dead...I mean no lobbies...even if you make a lobby rarely someone will join...in my experience none log to play together7: Cut penalties... look its good they improve them because WRC5 especially in eSports was a joke...but really that much? I mean you cut when you are in your racing line and sometimes somehow you will get 3 seconds from nothing...come on! 8: Price! Yup for what it offers for me its way overpriced but depends of what type of player you are and what do you want from it.9: DLC price... 3 euros for a mediocre 3d designed Car? Really? 10: Force feedback, a word:   There isn't ! 11: Really low quality set-up menu...you have the basic and less+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++12: eSports the so called magic about this game! Do you want a word? TRASH,JUNK! Seriously What the actual ♥♥♥♥? If you want to be the ""top"" guys..you have to drive like Nintendo Kart,fake peice of trash..thats it..THIS IS NOT RALLY! So you have the rally 5 stages and 5 tries...hahaha so funny...Just see the top times and see how they drive...its a piece of junk..13: IS SO UNFAIR A GAME LIKE THIS TO REPRESENT EVEN THE NAME OF THE WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP...this game is for kids but maybe even kids will say the same and will not appreciate this garbage. Why i still put some hours on it? Well it has Skoda Fabia R5 driven by Greeks Lambros Athanasoulas and Nick Zackheos...Some stages are nice And if i am in a good mood just to pass my 15 minutes.So my last worlds... My options for WRC 6 1) If you want this game for a little fun and you will not take it serious then buy it if you find yourself good with the price 2) if you want to complete in eSports and dont care for anything else then you know what to do3) if you are a Sim-racer like me, Rally is your passion, you done everything in Dirt Rally (and you are  bored because no more content to explore :( :P ) and you want to have both fun and compete in eSports then buy it...( Thank to WRC Gamers Club i won it )4) if you expect a game like Dirt Rally and a close competitor to it then go away 5) Maybe SLRE wasnt that bad after all compare to WRC6-5 ;) ( Ah i will put it RECOMMENDED because i wake up in a good mood! )_______________I WAS WRONG.THIS GAME CANT BE RECOMENDED._______________--------------------------          ERROR 451---WTF IS THIS---ERROR 451             --------------------------			"

												Well this game isint so bad at all! I acually like it very much!  👍 its not so good than dirt rally but its really fun experince, and fun game to play and i really suggest this game if you are rally fan and want game that does have official cars. The game does not have ""BIG"" suprises but is still fun to play 👍 and feel like a really rally driver 😉			"
