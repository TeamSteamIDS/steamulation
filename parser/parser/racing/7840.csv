Fun if it wasn't so Frustrating*CONS1st track is too long(the first race shouldn't take 12 minutes to complete)rear camera wouldn't work for me**all tracks except ONE are locked until you complete the 1st tournament raceIF you pass an opponent, then they can shoot you up all day and there's not much you can do about it (except for brake, die, use your nitro, or lay mines & the last 2 only save you in limited situations)difficulty isn't balanced(there is a difference between hard AI and lazy programming. I can  barely tell a difference betwen Normal and Easy. The highest I can get ON THE FIRST RACE easy is 8th place out of 10; it's like they didn't playtest the game at all)enemies have unlimited respawn(so even if you destroy them, they just come back. WHY!?)Ammo capacity is too low IMO(5 mines, 8 missles, and 80 machine gun)PROSexplosionsfunny voice overs -other drivers' faces pop up on the HUD (CarmaGeddon style) when you do certain things & sometimes they make you laugh (in a 'WTF?' kind of way)aim with your mouse & shoot -I found the 'skill-shot' aiming to be more fun & engaging than a fixed target in the middle of the screen (using keyboard & mouse, that is) I'll just leave it at that. Hopefully you'll find this one of the more informational 'reviews' of this game. TL;DR= The truth is: the game has/had a lot of potential, but unfortunately the game seems to fight you every step of the way, keeping you from having fun for too long. In fact it's making me quit before I even beat the first level. For $0.99 it MAY be worth it to you if you really like (unfairly) challenging racers, but IMO it's not worth your time. :D-------------------* NOTE: this entire review is based off my experience playing the game in 'modern mode.' There is also a 'classic mode' which features 1 life per vehicle (instead of infinite) and has 2 laps (instead of 3).**If someone else tells me otherwise, I'll change that part of the review.			"

												This game is an absolute FAIL!  No multiplayer, sloppy levels and handling that predates the invention of the wheel.  I'm going to play the original Death Track with DOSBOX instead!			"

												I must have gotten this game in a bundle at some point in the past because I do not know where it came from.  That thought alone makes me feel better about owning it.  This game is crap.  No, it's CRAAAAAAAAAP.  It started showing that trait as soon as it started.  It seemed to be obsessed with the ""B"" button on my XBOX controller.  It is used to confirm an action rather than cancel it.  Okay.  Anyway, the game itself is just ugly.  BROWN and ugly.  You are racing.  I guess.  And shooting at the other drivers.  I guess.  Navigating the brown roads that are silhouetted by brown buildings and brown sky is a bit tricky and since you are given no hints as to what the controls are, you will have to look them up.  Awesome.  An announcer seems to be shouting out nonsensical remarks about whatever it is you are doing.  ""Yeah!""  ""Way to go!""  ""Snatch!""  WTH?  I was seriously about to quit when the race finished.  I did it so you won't have to.  Steer clear of this.  Get it?  Steer?  Oh well...			"

												ok this game is just wow  it reminds me of when i play Jak X Combat Racing on the PS2   BUT i must say there are some downsides to this title the story is rather short lack of a sound track i think i heard the same song Twice on the same track but the gamplay is TIght its Challenging and rather good  Sound and Effects = 8/10music = 4/10 gameplay = 9/10difficulty curve = 7/10replay value = 9/10final score of  6/10 furry clawsthis game is good if you had a bad day and want to blow something up  THE only thing i wish that was in the game was a Online and Offline multiplayer  i mean i can see it right now  Tag team racing as a type of game mode one drives while one is on the gun  and i can just belive the insainty that could happen if this went online  oh well a cat can dream can't she?

												It's pretty bad when the default xbox 360 controller controls are up + down = left and right and left + right on the other stick is accelerate and brake. Although it was funny playing the game with the controller turned 90 degrees.EDIT: Typo and ""helpful review. for anyone wondering, you CAN REBIND the buttons.

												Janky Russian Combat Racer.  I got it in a bundle so I can't complain.Weird as heck cut scenes.I just wish the racing actually made you feel like you were going fast instead of feeling like things slowed down.I'm gonna uninstall this now.			"

												Despite all the issues this game suffers from It isn't really that bad. I see far too many people complaining that using an Xbox controller has a terrible preset and I have to agree. It's downright awful! But with some tweaking you can easily get it to where It should be. But that's part of the problem I suppose- These days people cannot be bothered to do that.What the game really lack is phasing. Simple as that. Even the cutscenes are somewhat slow and confusing! (Though most people should get the idea quickly enough.)At the very start of the game you get the feeling your going backwards in time due to the races being so utterly slow but the more you progress the faster it goes. Not to mention the usage of powerups. Even so it will never be as fast as one expects but be thankful for it as the later tracks may prove somewhat difficult.Although the Storyline is extremely short and some obvious issues with the game I'd still recommend it. Though not at full price but around $3.			"

												It's got some future nice 2008th GOTY style, even for driving & weaponry, but bottom line is, that this Arcade has no potential matter of intense language & gore for some reason.Maybe it's because it ain't so badass as it seems Rate:(6/10), total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from side, if you ask me!			"

												The controls are dreadful, I plugged in my controller, granted it had an option for a PS2 controller which I don't see often, but when I plugged in my Xbox 360 controller, it only had two buttons working, go and shoot, no turning, no brakes, nothing else, so my first race was just me driving forward running into walls. I had to go back and put in every single button into the control layout, and even with that the game feels...weird. I got it in an indie bundle, so I don't feel so bad about getting it, but I don't think I'll be playing this ever again.			"

												Remember Split/Second ? Well, in my opinion, this is the game that started the  game mechanic where you race and blow up the environments at the same time. It's the same as all the other arcade racers - it isn't even good, mind you - but it mixes racing with vehicular combat and destructible environments. Somewhat succesful. It's kind of fun at times, but Split/Second is better in every way so if I have to make a choice for you; go for that game.[Rating: 64/100]			"
