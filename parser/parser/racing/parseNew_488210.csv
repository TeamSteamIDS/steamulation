												ok so its a cheap game that could have been free i mean you have that old game call drag racer V3 that is still better after all that time than this game. you can do less thing that drag racer v3. this game have less car less modification/tuning it the car with who you racing cant win if you dont miss shift and even so it stay far behing. you cannot realy go head to head against a supra with an bone stock AE86. worst that that the can on the back is clearly bigger than you even if you are the one near the screen so no depth of field. sorry but even for a game at 30% rebate that cost me 75 canadian cent it too much. im gonna go back to drag racer v3 if i want to play a 2d drag racing game.

												If you are going to present as something that should be a free flash game. Don't use licensed logos such as Billabong, Sony and Subway to sell your product. That's before we talk about car stuff, including WRC..


YouTube™ Video: JDM Tuner Racing Gameplay (PC HD) 

			Views: 4,626		

			JDM Tuner Racing 60fps pc gameplay (no commentary) (steam). Playlist: https://goo.gl/znVwxh ""JDM Tuner Racing"" is a drag racing simulation video game for PC.		

[review]Hold up, press shift, x4. win. Receive some change. Do this 10+ times to 'level up' for bonus cash. No ranks or leaderboards. Most 'licensed' cars and parts cost too much and require higher levels. About the most detailed thing you do is tweak gear ratio. Cheap or not, it's mind-numbing.[/review]			"

												I love drag racer v3 (which is a FREE flash game) and I really wanted to love this game too, but it lacks in so much content and customization features as well as a AI difficulty settings, you either smoke them or they smoke you. there is no feel of progression all it is race after race after race and the cars, or lack there of, aren’t organised in classes.Until the devs put more content into the game I am going to have to not recommend it. This game needs more cars, more body, rim, spoiler and hood customization as well as being able to set the AI difficulty and a test track section to test your tune setup.			"

												The only option in this game is resolution in the base menu.This game is LOUDThe menus are terrible. (The ""Engine"" icon takes you to the upgrade page.)There is nothing to this game and there are only around 5 buttons you'll have to ever press.It's not even bad, it's terrible, tedious, and monotonous.  It takes too long to level up even if you're winning every or almost every race.  You'd have more fun printing a picture of a car and making engine noises as you move it around your room.			"

												JDM Tuner Racing reminds me of a Flash game, and there's apparently a reason for that. According to other gamers who've bought this game, it's virtually identical to Drag Racer v3. Normally, I wouldn't fault a game for seeming similar to another, especially since there's only so many ways to design a game within the same genre. That said, JDMTR provides nothing new or of any value beyond the free Flash game that apparently inspired it. The basic concept behind JDMTR is illegal racing where you take normal cars, modify them way beyond the manufacturer's specifications (which is dangerous in real life) while adding various bits of ridiculous design elements, such as an overly large spoiler.That alone would make for a fine game (and in fact, it's worked in other games), but JDMTR breaks down immediately once you start playing it. How so? Allow me to explain...There is NO documentation, tutorial, or any instructions/guides whatsoever. The game itself isn't difficult to play, but many features within it — such as knowing how to fine tune your gear shift — or explaining certain acronyms (i.e. NOS) and initialisms (i.e. RPM) are left entirely up to the player to figure out. The menu system is confusing and clunky to use. For instance, there's a section entitled ""setup,"" which most gamers will assume means ""this is the options menu."" Not so in JDMTR. This section lets you tune your gear shift, but like I explained before, offers no guidance on what any of it means or how it works. The money you earn while playing lets you purchase new vehicles and upgrade components. The problem with this is there's no ""undo"" function. Some people might say, ""There's a downgrade option to solve this!"" Well, yes and no. Downgrading will get rid of the last upgrade you bought and installed; however, it won't refund any of the money you spent, so downgrading leaves you worse off than before. The graphics are passable, but static and look at least a decade out of date, if not more so. Honestly, the graphics in JDMTR are the least of its issues, which doesn't say much for it.The actual gameplay is extremely limited and as far as I can tell, is entirely keyboard-only except for navigating the menus, which uses the mouse. Racing consists of pushing ""up"" on the arrow keys, while ""left shift"" will shift into a higher gear (oddly enough, you can't downshift) and the ""alt"" key will fire NOS. Aside from clicking on menus, that's all the gameplay present in JDMTR. Now to be fair, there is a positive to JDMTR: It's incredibly cheap (normally priced at 99 cents USD, and I got it on sale for 69 cents USD) so at absolute worst, you've wasted one solitary dollar. You can't buy anything for a dollar nowadays, not even a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda.So would I recommend JDM Tuner Racing? Absolutely not. Save yourself some money and go play the free Flash game version instead.			"

												Boring 2D drag racing from infamous Drift Streets Japan author. One day he'll get sued for using stolen assets and licensed car names/designs.A gameplay like this was in Race America for NES. But there were oil pits and some bumps on the road.

 JDM Tuner Racing is a game that looks like one developed for a flash player, extremely simple, could have been free, and overall unenjoyable for its price.  Pros Racing  (ironically in the title)  good spicy meme when peers enquire about the game  Cons Extremely basic gameplay and mechanics.The pricetag -  This game is legitimately a total waste of money. Even though it's selling at a standard price of $0.99 USD. A rip-off of other racing flash games  (i.e. Drag Racer V3) , but this one being something like a crappier ""paid version"". Concluding, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Please do not purchase this game.  "

												The game is a bit broken, I wish the speedometer was in MPH and not KMH, also you can set the rev points and such for each gear which is definitely a great idea but can be used to your advantage. (In my case I used the max revs to 11,000, which in the long run no car could compete with mine except 1 or 2 here and there). Sounds are on point and stuff but shifting and stuff just isn't all there, if you accidentally shift to early you can't downshift and comeback from such a messup.. instead you just get burned and lose the race sadly.Good idea and stuff behind the game, but getting levels and money just isn't all there. However it can be improved by adding more of a fun motive to the game like having people on social media setup street races with you and such, and then them replying back to you, etc.. something to make the game fun as well as getting your car up there.

												This isnt a bad game. It's addictive, but it has a bunch of problems and glitches. I cant move, enlarge or rotate my decals at all. The speedometer glitches, too. There also seem to have some stolen assets here and there. Which wouldn't be so bad if it was a free game, but this is a game you usually buy!It might have a lot of glitches, but JDM Tuner Racing is enjoyable. That being said, I still don't recommend it for a good reason.This game is a clone of the Drag Racer games, which are good and free flash games. The problem is that JDM Tuner Racing isnt as good as Drag Racer, so why buy it?? Just go play Drag Racer V3, it's a better experience.To conclude, JDM Tuner Racing, even though it's not that bad, is not worth buying for the simple reason that the game it is supposed to copy is better and free. Don't waste your money on this. Only get this game if it's for free, or if you are really curious.			"

												Cute drag racer. The setup and tuning part is interesting, albeit simple... It translates any kind of upgrade to raw horsepower... So, getting spoilers, lowering the car, getting lighter wheels don't affect the car's acceleration neither top speed. Adding turbo, changing shafts or the piston heads add to the car's total HP... The only actual input the game needs are the correct gear ratio for your car and timed shifts. The game even throttles automatically for you. Most likely because this looks like a mobile game port.It's a good passtime though. It'd look better on a mobile, but it can provide a 5-minute passtime if needed.			"

												JDM Tuner Racing is a Blatantly obvious remake of the flash game Drag Racer V3DRV3 was a game from my childhood since it's been around for as long as I can remember, but its awesome.I always wanted to have it for roadtrips and times I couldn't be online, and this would've been great when I was younger and wanted it.Pro's:- Looks WAY better than the original- Limited controls makes it pretty easy and fun (for a short time)- Worth getting on sale- Has some funny parts that look ridiculous while still staying true to the original- Definitely NostalgicCon's:- Gets old really quick- Some low rez textures (obviously)- Somewhat unoriginal.Conclusions/Ideas.I reccomend you get this game if you have some spare cash in your account or you see it for free somewhere, Maybe they should get a story mode or championships like the old one has? to give some push and progression. Also bring back the ability to make the car stupidly low and the wheels way to big as that was so funny. (Also I'm pretty sure this wasn't made by the original developers, so sorry for acting like it was).			"

												A great throwback to an old flash pc game I used to play when I was a kid.Maybe it got so many negative reviews because the quality of games are different nowdays.But back then this was one of the best flash games out there.And I love it because it's street racing and you can customize your cars.Will update review as I play more but so far this game is awesome!

												You basically get what you paid for with this.When playing try think of it like this, don't expect this game to change your life, but it can kill a couple of hours of time for a small price and maybe you actually enjoy playing it. Thats why I gave it a good review.  "

												For a game under 1 dollar it will give a couple hours of fun...It's basic just win races, earn cash and buy new cars you can customize and race but it is actually fun especially when you add a turbocharger and you hear the blow off valve!			"

												- Good like Drag Racing on android- Most people reviewing ugly but I think this game is great for indie games.- Only just this game is too simple- And if later I uninstalled whether this game will save in the cloud. I do not know?			"

												It's a really cra**y game, with 2d graphics. It's useless to say how much does the animations, models, and customization suck. The textures aren't scaled properly and there isn't even an HD texture (everything is upscaled badly). If you have a functioning brain don't buy this. Luckily, I found the key for this game free on Internet, so I didn't pay anything. Don't waste your money, even if it is 1$.(sorry for bad english)			"

												Im going to give this game a thumbs up but this game could use some improvements such as adding multiplayer to the mix and perhaps a few steam achievements or just some ingame because everyone likes rewards :D this game would be so fun if me and my friends could vs each other in it.

												The game is not too bad. I can play with controller so it make it more easier.But, this is a knock-off.I get it free using CD-KEY i found on the web.If you really want to spend money for a game to sell on the market, you can buy it			"
