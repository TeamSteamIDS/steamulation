												(Deep breath)...  :*( I am a Garfield fan and was really looking forward to Garfield Kart being a good game and it really could have been but unfortunately this is a lazy port of the 3DS version with partial controller support that only works when driving. The mouse is needed when going through the menu and starting each round.There are framerate issues and they get worse on some areas of each map, even on low graphics settings. Lowering the resolution also does not help the problem.I was also sad to see Garfield Kart's description says Single Player. Yup, not even local multiplayer. :/ Seriously?, even Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing has Co-op and Local Co-op, and that game is worse than this. >.>Also, there are no achievements and no cards drops.Each characters speech is very limited and Garfield's favorite words seem to be ""Whoo hoo!"", since that's all he seems to say throughout each round.On the positive side, the detail of the game looks good. There are plenty of characters, karts, helmets, spoiler parts and boosters to unlock and choose from. On the tracks you will find shortcut paths, speed boosts and awesome power-ups and weapons to collect and stack.This game has the potential to be so much better but it's a shame the devs were lazy with the PC port.If not for the problems mentioned above, I would have given Garfield Kart a positive review because it really could be fun.If you are a fan of Garfield, save your money and follow this game to hopefully get a notice of an update that fixes Garfield Kart's current problems.

												This game came into my life at the perfect time. Allow me to give you a little backstory of myself: When I was 14 years old, I was a massive Garfield fan. Often times, I would sit about and do nothing but read the classic comic strips. They are hilarious! Garfield hating mondays and loving lasania, that was my childhood. I began to feel really depressed and worthless at about 15, and I often times wanted to end my life. My family lived in a tough part of compton, and I got beat up a lot by the tougher black kids of the community. When I was 17 years old, I attempted to end my life. I tied a rope around my ceiling fan, stuck my head through the loop at the other end and jumped off my bed. Ultimatley, my obesity problem stopped me from certain death, and the ceiling fan was ripped down off the ceiling and collasped on top of me on the floor.  My parents where unable to pay my hospital bills, and they were so angry with me that they disowned me, leaving me to fend for myself on the streets. I met a few other young men who spent there lives in poverty, and I joined them to attempt to make some money. We sold cocaine on the tough streets, but my curiousity got the better of me and I took some home and tried it myself. IT WAS AMAZING! I kept doing it, because it was the best feeling of my life, and I was quickly addicted to it. When I was 19 years old, I nearly overdosed and died, but I barley survived. I noticed something both times I was rushed to the E.R.: The only thing going through my head while I was dying in the back of that ambulance was Garfield. After spending 9 months in a goverment funded rehab, I decided to dedicate my life to Garfield. When I first discoved this game, my life was eterinally changed. Instead of getting high on cocaine, I'm getting high on Garfield Kart. I love this game so much, it encouraged me to go out and get a job at a go kart track. Sometimes, when the little kids go around the track in the karts, I like to pretend that the kids are garfield characters. Unfortunatly, my imagination got a little too vivid, and I imagined one of the little girls was the sexy Chadore', the hottest cat in all of the garfield universe, beckoning me to ♥♥♥♥ her hard. I'm still in court over that one. Anyway, this game is life changing, and I deeply encourage you to indulge yourselves.			"

												Another child died today Garfield. He was terrified. In that moment I wished I could merge with his fear and slip into a saccharine foreverscream. But this is my duty Garfield, have you stopped eating my lasagna? Have you ever looked in that pan? When was the last time you tasted what you were chewing? You shuffling, bumbling, crusty, dumb ♥♥♥♥ cat Garfield. If I pelted you with rocks who would hear the dumb screams? If I set myself on fire and smothered you who would die first? You're a tumor Garfield, but God made cancer, just like he made lasagna, except I made the lasagna. Does that make me more than a man?They call you a ""bad cat"" but they will never drink from the fat and rotten juices, they are unfit to be in the kingdom of Heaven and Hell Garfield. You are cut from the nape of the Earth, you little bitty cat. Don't kick Odie off the table!! Gaaarfiiieeeeld!!!!You stumble home drunk and your bits are all cut away. Did you let someone get to them? Did you snip them off yourself? You won't tell me. Instead you sit in front of the telly, sagging and staring at a sitcom. Your bits are still bleeding. Chunks soak into the upholstery. You'll be fine tomorrow GarfieldYou live here, Garfield. You are in between the walls and the beams but you live here. I breathe you in sometimes. It makes me remember innocence. I scream and shake outside of the shower. I try to step in but I slip on a wacky tie. I catch a glimpse of you on the way down just outside of the door frame. Your smile all pus and burn scars. Whose face will it be tomorrow? Garfield, I am your keeper. I just can't seem to get a date!A thousand shifting fever dreams couldn't molest my love for you, Garfield. It runs through the wires and the cogs and the paper cuts and the plushies. It died twenty years ago. It's pumped up again from a black river bottom and vomited onto naked little bodies. Can I remove myself from its fate?They pick at you like a great big feast. Garfield, your bulbous thoughts were always clear. I just didn't want to hear. But now it doesn't matter. Now you will see tomorrow. A thousand million living things melted for you. A hundred thousand writhing tongues coming from you. It's a wonderful world and this is all that there is. Tell me you're happy, you fatty cat. Tell me to sleep. Nermal comes to visit.			"

												SynopsisBorn in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to power in German politics as leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, also known as the Nazi Party. Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.Early YearsDictator Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889, and was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl. When Hitler was 3 years old, the family moved from Austria to Germany. As a child, Hitler clashed frequently with his father. Following the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, he became detached and introverted. His father did not approve of his interest in fine art rather than business. In addition to art, Hitler showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life.Alois died suddenly in 1903. Two years later, Adolf's mother allowed her son to drop out of school. He moved to Vienna and worked as a casual laborer and a watercolor painter. Hitler applied to the Academy of Fine Arts twice, and was rejected both times. Out of money, he moved into a homeless shelter, where he remained for several years. Hitler later pointed to these years as the time when he first cultivated his anti-Semitism, though there is some debate about this account.At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler applied to serve in the German army. He was accepted in August 1914, though he was still an Austrian citizen. Although he spent much of his time away from the front lines, Hitler was present at a number of significant battles and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge.3GALLERY3 ImagesHitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany's surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that the German army had been betrayed by civilian leaders and Marxists. He found the Treaty of Versailles degrading, particularly the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the stipulation that Germany accept responsibility for starting the war.After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. While monitoring the activities of the German Workers’ Party (DAP), Hitler adopted many of the anti-Semitic, nationalist and anti-Marxist ideas of DAP founder Anton Drexler. Drexler invited Hitler to join the DAP, which he did in 1919.To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). Hitler personally designed the party banner, featuring a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his vitriolic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, Marxists and Jews. In 1921, Hitler replaced Drexler as NSDAP party chairman.Hitler's vitriolic beer-hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included army captain Ernst Rohm, the head of the Nazi paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents.On November 8, 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people at a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government. After a short struggle including 20 deaths, the coup, known as the ""Beer Hall Putsch,"" failed.Hitler was arrested three days later and tried for high treason. He served a year in prison, during which time he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (""My Struggle"") to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.Rise to PowerThe Great Depression in Germany provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent to the parliamentary republic and increasingly open to extremist options. In 1932, Hitler ran against Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency. Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 percent of the vote in the final election. The election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor in order to promote political balance.Hitler used his position as chancellor to form a de facto legal dictatorship. The Reichstag Fire Decree, announced after a suspicious fire at the Reichstag, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution.Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.Military opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot.The day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany’s armed forces.The Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance.A main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived ""non-Aryans"" of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults.The Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings.World War IIIn 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938. This diplomatic win only whetted his appetite for a renewed German dominance. On September 1, Germany invaded Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany "

												Garfield Kart is a racing game developed by Gravity Europe releasing on PC in November 2013. The game has also been released on Nintendo 3DS previously as well. We have all come to know what to expect from kart racing games from the likes of Mario Kart in the past. Most kart games that have come out to try and rival Mario Kart have often fallen flat on their face. Prior to playing Garfield, I had played another kart racing game on Steam, Coffin Dodgers and sadly that didn’t live up to the mark. Garfield Kart is almost an identical game to that of Coffin Dodgers. Gameplay is going to be simple when it comes to kart racing, simply beat your opponents in the race around a circuit. There are 16 different courses to race around with 8 different powerups to collect around the circuits too. The game’s tutorial is back to front when it comes to explaining the controls; whether they did it with a different controller in mind I am not sure, but the controls on an Xbox controller were the complete opposite to shown on the screen. Garfield Kart has three different game modes to play, Grand Prix, Single Race and Time Trial. Grand Prix is the more structured part of the game, where you take part in 4 or 5 races at a time in a league, depending on where you finish in the races will determine how many points you get. Single Race is more like the “free mode”, whilst you can gain money from competing in races here; there aren’t any huge rewards for winning. Time Trial is what you would expect from a Kart Racing game; nothing too exciting and certainly the least interesting of the three modes. There is one final game mode which is where Garfield does something a little different to the rest of the Kart Games on Steam. A daily challenge mode is included, complete the set task and you will get a reward at the end of it. This is a really easy way to gather better upgrades for your car without having the need to grind out money by replaying previous tournaments.  Graphically, Garfield Karts looks really nice. It looks like one of the cartoons, with some really nice modelling, textures and animations on show. The game’s environments are all very nicely designed as well. The sound effects do let the game down a little bit; it can sometimes seem too quiet at times. Your engine noise can almost seem too quiet for it to seem realistic which something which felt really odd when playing is. The sound track is really catchy though. Garfield Kart has three levels of difficulties. Whilst you are not able to choose the difficulties per race, you choose which bracket of difficulty race to take part in; 50cc, 100cc and 150cc.  Obviously the higher the number the more powerful the rest of your opponents cars will be. In order to even be competitive in the 100cc and 150cc bracket, you will have to completely upgrade your car using the upgrade system; you are able to purchase items for your car which will improve three criteria of performance, speed, handling and power. You will also be able to choose from a selection of helmets which will also grant you a specific bonus for individual power ups which you can collect. Whilst I really liked the upgrade system, it does feel very much like a grind to unlock items as you have to replay previously won competitions in order to get anywhere close to being able to buy anything. I would have personally liked to have seen a reduction in the price set on the items so you aren’t forced to replay already played content if you don’t want to.  The daily challenge mode helps with this, but only if you play the game in small doses.  I have been playing for over an hour so far and I have just completed the first bracket of races whilst also taking part in the daily challenge and a couple of time trials. There is easily another 3 or 4 hours of content from this game. Sadly the game will have very little staying power and I will more than likely not play the game again after completing the three stages of difficulty. With the lack of any multiplayer mode, the developers have really shot themselves in the foot of making game out of a genre which is so perfectly crafted for any type of multiplayer action. As the Steam page says for this game, there is only partial controller support for this game. The gameplay itself works well with a control, however you have to navigate menus with your mouse, making a bit awkward to play on a couch setup.  There is a wide selection of resolutions to play on, right the way up to 4k, with minimal graphic options to change. To sum up, Garfield Kart is purely an OK game. There aren’t any glaringly obvious negative points; it’s just not going to blow your socks off with exciting game play moments and hilarious local multiplayer. The only thing that resembles Garfield in this game is the character models; there is no story, no voice acting, and nothing else that makes this game any different to a generic kart racer. Luckily the game is priced low at £5, 59, and for that price you will get some enjoyment out of it, just don’t go into it expecting all the bells and whistles of Mario Kart.  I’ve marked it down as a 3 on my scale, it’s not the best game, but it certainly isn’t a bad game either. If you can get it less than the sale price, you will want to consider checking it out for an hour or two of action.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I never really understood what the deal with this whole 'Islam' thing was, but Garfield Kart has really enlightened me. I didn't really expect Garfield Kart to be a learning tool for devout Muslisms, I was under the impression it was a JRPG of sorts, but my misconception only left me happily surprised. This game delivers a strong narrative that rocked me to my core, and gave me an insight into the Islamic religion that you could only find in the Quran itself.  I am happy to say I am now a follower of the one true prophet Muhammad and give my life to Allah the one true god. Thank you Garfield Kart, I owe my life to you.			"

												Once upon a time there was this orange cat that ripped off Heathcliff like nobody's business. Then it got its own movie starring Bill Murray in a catsuit, which was funny because Bill played Pete from the Ghostbusters. Then when the Ghostbusters had a cartoon show, the voice of Garfield's cartoon show was also the voice of Pete. No one liked the movie, not even with Jennifer Love Hewitt in it and she can sell icecream to a dying man in the arctic who has no mouth or hands and he's trapped in a block of ice.So with Heathfield's popularity it was only a matter of time before he got his own video game. Sure he had other video games, but this one would be good. The one to compete against the greatest kart racing game in existence, Crash Team Racing on the PS1. The men that forged this game would need the ultimate engine to play the game on that would power the game across several different platforms such as mobile devices, the 3DS and the PC itself. That game engine is Unity 3D, the engine used by other popular games like Walden and the Werewolf!Once they had their game, they filled it with food items. Candy for weapons that consist of pies, lasagna and pillows. We've all had that dream where we're eating a really big marsh mellow and when we wake up there's no pillow on the bed and we burp feathers. This will be that game. A game so thrilling that the pillow will put all the other drivers to sleep, letting us slip by unnoticed. Lasagna will be made of nuclear energy that will let us boost ahead.I say let us this and let us that meaning you. The buyer of this game. You will be that us, because there's no multiplayer in this game coop or otherwise. I mean online or local. That's what I mean.Garfield Kart will be a great game for kids. All children love Garfield and they have since he was invented way back in 1910. A game so great for kids that powersliding becomes a tough as nails art to master and necessary for survival in 100 CC races because 50 CC is so dull and slow I found myself dozing with every turn before someone hit me with a diamond. I'm looking at you Odie...Eight characters have been shoveled into this masterpiece that I put now with my wallet photo of Mona Lisa. Classics like Jen, who is someone's girlfriend. I assume played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, who becomes the most overpowered character in the game as ever man, woman and cat stares her way as she drives by using perfume and lust as a weapon, jumping over bridges, rolling over hills, slamming down on the dirt roads that you will drive over again and again on your way to victory over those that compete for Jen's love.This game is great because it incorporates two control schemes people love at the same time. There is a mouse control scheme for the menu and a 360 controls for the driving, but not 360 controls for the menu or mouse controls for the driving. This lets me get my third hand playing the game as well. The game has the controls backward when displaying the tutorial. The left trigger goes backward, the right trigger goes forward. Its all part of the challenge the game brings. There are two buttons for forward attacking and behind attacking too, but there's only one button for hopping when it could have been hopping left or hopping right like Super Mario Kart had twenty years ago.The sixteen tracks are all fun and interesting. Four of them take place at the airport. Another few take place in egypt, some are in the snow with snowmen and pine trees. Others take place on a farm where cows live, but there are no cows, because Garfield loves to eat things. That is why there are no cows. Garfield and other characters have eaten so much that they are the same size and height as Jon who is a human, but Garfield is Bill Murray. Odie is played by Rhea Pearlman (great aunt of Ron Pearlman and Danny DiVito's wife) and Sheldon (Cooper?) in this game and it must have cost a lot of money to get the celebrity voice acting. I'm just kidding there isn't celebrity voice acting, just bad voice acting that you get to hear a lot.Before each race you get to buy what cheats you want to use. These cheats cost money, but not micropayments. Instead you need to grind for the cash you need to buy stuff. Playing the same races over and over before you can buy that chick magnet car you always wanted, but Nermal drives. Cheats really help you compete in the 155 CC races so you can finish in 6th and final place a few seconds less than you would normally.This game comes with a stop watch, because during the races, they don't keep time for you. You need to do that yourself. With a stop watch. I then write down my best times for the grand prix mode so I have them always. There is a time trial, but why would I ever use that to keep track of time when I'm only racing against a UFO? That's right Garfield Kart has UFOs and so many of them that they should be identified by now. You race against one in the time trial, which makes it more of a race with an actual time instead of the real races with no time. Then you also find them in the real races as a way to crash the first place racer, so its always best to be in second place until the end, where winning matters. You play to win.I will recommend it to all my friends no matter what their age. We all know and love Garfield. He is the best cat and Felix would end up in 6th place if he raced Garfield, because Garfield can drive a truck in this game but Felix can just sack race. Garfield is a great game and will continue to be the standard bearer for Bill Murray and Jennifer Love Hewitt games. Someone should make a sequel with Alvin & the Chipmunks.			"

												Garfield Kart takes place in the ancient city of Mapungubwe (meaning 'hill of the jackal'), an Iron Age archaeological site in the Limpopo Province on the border between South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, 75 km from Messina. It sits close to the point where the Limpopo and Shashe Rivers meet. One thousand years ago, Mapungubwe appears to have been the centre of the largest known kingdom in the African sub-continent. The civilization thrived as a sophisticated trading center from around 1200 to 1300 AD, trading gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt.Your goal is to transform this small city into a nation. Barbaric tribes will try to raid your areas, and European invaders along with other African nations will rival you for land.The site was 'discovered' on 31 December 1932, when a local informant, Mowena, led E.S.J. van Graan (farmer and prospector), his son and three others, to Greefswald farm on Mapungubwe Hill. On the hill they noticed stone walls and on closer inspection, they recovered gold and iron artifacts, pottery and glass beads. Van Graan's son recognized the academic value of the site and contacted the head history department at the University of Pretoria, Professor Leo FouchÁƒÂƒ©. As a result of his intervention, the University negotiated with the owner of the property, E.E. Collins. In a legal agreement the University took ownership of the gold and other artifacts and secured an option and contract for excavation rights. The University also successfully requested a postponement of prospecting, mining and related activities on Greefswald. In June 1933, Greefswald was bought by the Government and excavation rights were granted to the University of Pretoria. The University established an Archaeological Committee, which from 1933 to 1947 oversaw research and excavations (read more about the excavations).The find initially received wide publicity in the media, but soon the archaeological digs and discoveries made by the University were kept fairly secret and were only made public after 1994. Possibly because the discovery provided evidence of a civilization that existed and flourished years before European occupation.Mapungubwe hill is 300m long, broad at one end, tapering at the other. It is only accessible by means of two very steep and narrow paths that twist their way to the summit, and yet 2 000 tons of soil were been artificially transported to the very top by a prehistoric people of unknown identity.Archaeological enquiry uncovered the remnants of numerous dwellings, which had been built on the ruins of predecessors over many generations, resulting in a series of habitation phases. Radiocarbon dates show that the first buildings were erected below the hill at the beginning of the 11th century AD. But adjacent to Mapungubwe is the sister site of Bambadyanalo, which was settled even earlier. It seems that the centre of the state shifted from Bambandyanalo to Mapungubwe hill in about 1045 AD, when the town most probably became overcrowded. It was also at about this time that hills and mountains became associated with royalty and the noble classes began to build their structure on high ground. This is an important observation as it provided evidence of the extensive wealth and social differentiation of the people of Mapungubwe, in other words this ancient civilization was class-based.The gold findings are also evidence of early gold smelting. A large amount of artifacts from the royal family were discovered at Mapungubwe. The best known of these objects is the golden rhinoceros. All in all, the amount of gold from this burial amounted to 7 503 ounces.In the 1400's it appears that all the citizens of the kingdom left leaving palaces and the settlements behind. We don't know exactly why the people of Mapungubwe moved away, but the ruins give us a good idea of how these people lived and how their society and political structures grew over the years. Scholars believe that the climate in the area changed, which made it much harder to grow crops and feed animals, this might have caused the civilization to move.Greefswald farm remained the property of the State from the 1930s. Management of the farm was taken over by the provincial Department of Nature Conservation in 1992 and control was transferred to SANParks in 1999. Mapungubwe was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in July 2003.			"

												CRISPY WHOLE THAI FRIED FISH WITH GINGER TAMARIND SAUCERecipe courtesy of Guy FieriTAGS: coconut ginger snapper tamarindAPPEARD IN: guy’s big bite, season 18ep. 01 – snap(per) to itINGREDIENTSGinger Tamarind Sauce:1/4 cup canola oil1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots8 cloves slivered garlic1/4 cup grated ginger2 tablespoons sambal2 tablespoons fish sauce1/4 cup tamarind paste1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce1/4 cup granulated sugar1/2 cup water Canola oil, for deep fryingOne 2 pound whole snapper, cleaned and scaled1/2 cup rice flour1/2 cup cornstarch1 teaspoon granulated garlic1 teaspoon ground ginger1 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper2 fresno chilies, finely sliced, for garnish2 scallions, cut on bias, for garnish1/2 lime, juicedTwo 12-inch bamboo skewersCoconut and Cilantro RiceDIRECTIONSPrepare ginger tamarind sauce: In large sauté pan over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and allow to heat. Once heated, add the shallots, garlic and ginger.Sauté until fragrant and shallots are translucent – about 3 to 4 minutes.Add the sambal, fish sauce, tamarind paste, soy sauce, sugar and water.Stir well and cook until slightly reduced and has a maple syrup like consistency – about 5 to 6 minutes.Remove from heat but keep warm until ready to serve. Preheat 4 to 5 inches of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven or deep wok. You need enough oil so the whole fish can be submerged in oil. Prepare fish: Make three diagonal slices directly into the flesh of the snapper from top to bottom all the way to the bone. Make the cuts two inches apart equally spaced between the head and tail.Combine flour, cornstarch, garlic, ginger, salt and pepper in a large baking dish.Lightly dredge the fish all over, including inside the cuts with the seasoned flour.Shake off any excess flour then form the fish into an “S” curve by threading two long skewers through the tail and body so it holds its wavy shape.Carefully place the fish into the hot oil so it is almost completely submerged.  Fry the fish for about 8 to 10 minutes.As it cooks use a large metal spoon or ladle to carefully pour hot oil over any exposed part of the fish to ensure it cooks evenly.Once fish is deep golden in color and very crispy carefully remove the fish from the oil. Place on a wire rack to drain briefly.Season immediately with salt and lime juice.Carefully remove skewers from fish, then place upright on a platter of coconut and cilantro rice and pour ginger tamarind sauce over the top.Garnish with chilies and scallions.Yield: 2 to 4 servings			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up.Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling			"

												Who we are is not just what we appear to be on the outside. When you think of Garfield, you may think of a lazy cat lounging next to some of that sweet, sweet lasagna and otherwise not caring about a single thing that doesn't involve naptime. However, what you believed Garfield to be will be crushed in this harrowing tale of smashing our limiters and truly becoming who we are behind the mask that society gives us to live by, Garfield Kart.In Garfield Kart, you play as any one of the Garfield cast in thrilling and chaotic go-kart rides through insane and strategically-involved tracks everywhere from Egypt to industrial Zimbabwe. After racing you can customize your racer with special items such as hats, spoilers and new karts. The items you buy effect your driver performance, and some item sets are made specifically for a certain driver. Stacking a full set of driver-specific items onto the driver they were meant for makes you very powerful, and in the world of Garfield Kart, you either get good or die hard.During your gameplay you may wonder why some characters act out of place according to the setting of the original comics they come from. The nurse (Liz) turns from helpful hand of medicine into a competitive matriarch who crushes the enemy beneath her iron go-kart, and even Garfield himself acts out of his usual lazy character. All of the people in Garfield Kart seem to be only alike to their comic counterparts only in appearance (and even that is questionable once the hats start rolling in). How could this be? You may wonder to yourself how these characters could be so unlike their original bases, until you realize one day that they are not different at all.Garfield Kart isn't just a tale of a friendly competition between some friends (and also that stupid grey cat who keeps hitting me with aliens RIGHT BEFORE I FINISH THE FINAL LAP IN FIRST NERMAL I WILL END YOU), but the tale of self-actualization and the breaking of societal norms through sport. Garfield himself abandons the mask so forced upon him by society to become his true self. The character customization store is just another way to self actualize, with every set of items for each character representing who they really are in the dark. When you finish a set of items for a character, you successfuly break society's pre-determined path for this character and allow them to be themselves once more. This is also why the completed sets make your characters much more powerful.Garfield Kart is a triumph of the gaming industry, and is more akin to a work of art that focuses on the trials and tribulations the people of today go through to become their true selves. I think we can all take a page out of Garfield Kart's book, and strive not only to be the best we can be, but to also become who we know we are deep inside.Thank you.			"

												The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, in the Territory of Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II.Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese *attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.15 All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured.The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan.  Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared. Clandestine support of the United Kingdom (e.g., the Neutrality Patrol) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.From the 1950s, several writers alleged that parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may have let it happen (or even encouraged it) with the aim of bringing the U.S. into war. However, this advance-knowledge conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, ""a date which will live in infamy"". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was judged by the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.			"

												I wake in the smouldering wreckage of what was once my kart, all around me I see flames and gore, as my fellow racers cannot avoid the pile of bodies. I hear the screams of John and Liz as their bodies are consumed by the flames. I struggle to regain my senses but am only met with more confusion. As I finally am able to take in my surroundings I am met with impending doom, the pie is coming straight at me. I want and end to this suffering, I spread my arms, and the let the pie come towards me, it will all be over soon, this is the life I chose, now it is the life I have chosen to end. Goodbye Garfield Kart			"

												Hi, number 8 Garfield Kart player in the world here.  The ""Haters"" and the ""Trolls"" have recently been harassing me for my Garfield Kart skills, and my limited edition Garfield Merchandise collection.  First of all, is is the best game I've ever played, the graphics and lighting are AMAZING, the controls are incredibly fluid.  It's a bit pricey, so I'd wait until a sale to purchase.  I obviously couldn't wait that long, so I bought it at its reasonable but only slightly pricey $4.99 price-tag. Now, a message to my haters.What the lasagna did you just lasagning say about me, you little odie? I’ll have you know I placed number 8 in the Garfield Kart tournament, and I’ve been involved in numerous other Garfield Kart tournaments, and I have over 95.6 confirmed hours. I am trained in tactical lasagna eating, and I’m the top Garfield Kart player in the entire Washington State. You are nothing to me but just another Jon. I will kick you the lasagna off this table with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words, Jon. You think you can get away with saying that lasagna to me over the Internet? Think again, Jon. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of mice across the USA and your IP is being traced right now, so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing dead, Jon. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare claws. Not only am I extensively trained in tactical lasagna eating, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Garfield Pet Force and I will use it to its full extent to kick odie  off the face of the continent, you little ♥♥♥♥. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comments were about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your hecking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, Jon, you idiot. I will eat every lasagna then ♥♥♥♥ it out, and you will drown in it. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing dead, Jon Think twice before saying that I'm stuffing my face as usual. It's what I do, Jon. I eat.			"

												Disregaurd my time spent playing this game on steam, as I have invested thousands of hours on other platforms. If Cory in the House for the Nintendo DS was not the Cory in the House of video games, this would be the Cory in the House of video games. A true classic that defined not only it's genre and medium, but an entire generation. There are few artistic works released in the last 20 years that do not contain some traces of Garfeild Kart in them. You cannot call yourself a gamer until you have picked this up. For only five dollars, it is the cheapest price for which you can find enlightenment as I, and many others, have.			"

												This is what you get when you slap a Garfield skin on Mario Kart, ♥♥♥♥ up everything that makes it good, release it on mobile/tablet platforms, and then do a horrible port to PC.ProsIt's colorful (thought low-poly) and looks better than Garfield comics.It's cheap enough to gift to friends as a joke (guess how I got this)It's less than 200MB to downloadAll of the game's mechanics are lifted straight from Mario Kart - blue sparks, lasagna (mushrooms), pie (shells), etc. This means you're immediately familiar with most of it.ConsFramerate varies between 60fps and 15fps for no discernible reason on max quality. This is on a GTX970. For a mobile port, this is inexcusable.Controls aren't greatMobile port aspect shines though in everything:Besides selecting characters, cars, hats, and spoilers, you can also use the ingame currency to buy ""boosts"" - one-time use items that will give you an edge in the next race - for example, starting off at higher speed. If you don't get any of these, there's a yes/no prompt if you're sure you didn't mean to buy a boost. Then, on the screen before the race starts, it says ""No boosts? Shame!"". These were obviously meant to get people to purchase ingame currency on mobile.Menus were made for touchscreens and it shows. You have to click-drag the lists of characters, cars, customization items, etc. There's no indicator for controllers where your menu selection is, if it even exists (in some menus pressing A does something, in some it doesn't)Geometry is very simple (though this doesn't clash badly with the cartoon aesthetic)You always lose collisions. The AI isn't bothered by these, but the player is always slowed down by bumping into other cars, even if the other car bumps into you from the back.Hazards have larger hitboxes than you'd expect, leading you to get dicked over by stuff you were sure you'd avoided.The classic Mario Kart frustration of getting hit by everything just before you finish in 1st place is back with a vengeance.Game balance seems a bit hard for a kid's game, but this might be to stimulate just buying your way through it for the mobile version.TL;DR: This game sucks, Garfield sucks, Artefact Studios sucks, Microids sucks, go do something useful with your time rather than reading reviews for (or playing) absolute garbage games.

												On September 11, 2001, at 8:45 a.m. on a clear Tuesday morning, an American Airlines Boeing 767 loaded with 20,000 gallons of jet fuel crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. The impact left a gaping, burning hole near the 80th floor of the 110-story skyscraper, instantly killing hundreds of people and trapping hundreds more in higher floors. As the evacuation of the tower and its twin got underway, television cameras broadcasted live images of what initially appeared to be a freak accident. Then, 18 minutes after the first plane hit, a second Boeing 767–United Airlines Flight 175–appeared out of the sky, turned sharply toward the World Trade Center and sliced into the south tower near the 60th floor. The collision caused a massive explosion that showered burning debris over surrounding buildings and the streets below. America was under attack.			"

A three panel comic strip that... as simple as it seemed... changed me. Changed my being. Changed who i am. It made me who i am. Enlightened me. This strip - ""Garfield"", the comic strip was new, no more than maybe a month and a half since inception, since coming into existence. And there it was before me. A print before me. A comic strip. What was it called? Garfield. The story here is of a man. A plain man. He's Jon, but he is more than that. But we'll get to that later. For now he is just Jon. A plain man. And there is a cat. Garfield. This is the nature of the world here.

												Mario cart is a really fun game for all ages. But watch out, delving deep into the games story may lead to some graphic depictions of violence, sex and alcohol. Kiddies, be careful because uncle Garf is out to get you. I think the game is slightly overpriced, as 4 dollars is quite expensive for a shrek game. SPOILER ALERT: Garfield cart is actually being haunted by a wendigo, and not a psychopath like everyone thought (Jon played a prank on Garfield and co because they had eaten his Lasagna last summer). Garfield Kart is a no holds barred cross-country racing game from Anuman Interactive. Anuman sounds ♥♥♥♥♥, but an ♥♥♥♥♥ is the opposite of the wondrous Garfleid carte. Le jeu est comme la france, incroyablement lasagne. I hope this game gets ported to the Ouya, so that I can lasagna people in glorious HD with a competent controller (Im looking at you, Gamecube/Any controller you like but I put Gamecube because all the fanboys would rage). En conclusion, ITS A MASTAPIECE BABY. 69/10.			"

												The Diary of a Vietnam Soldier:----------------------------------------------This long day began like all the rest - hot and humid. My day began, like all the rest, with a trip to the latrine. Just as I was getting ready to leave, a tremendous blast blew me out the door onto the dusty ground outside. Realizing I was not wounded, I rose quickly and ran toward the site of the explosion as the sirens screamed red alert - incoming rounds.As I neared the smoking, black crater I felt warm liquid running across my shoulders and down my arms. Still feeling no pain of my own, it dawned on me that body parts were raining down from the sky, landing on my head and shoulders.I stopped, overcome. To my right lay a torso heaving one last, reflex-driven sigh. To my left writhed a screaming man clutching the remains of his arm.Feet pounded by as braver men than I ran to assist their fallen comrades. I could not move.In time, two of my men led me to the shower for the first of several I took that day as I tried to wash from my body the remnants of corpses that still stain my memory.The telegram went out that evening to six sets of devastated parents and spouses with the dreaded introduction; ""We regret to inform you that your son, (name of deceased), was killed in combat operations in the Republic of Vietnam in the service of his country....""But it was not an incoming enemy mortar round that caused the carnage I witnessed that day. A despondent GI, very high on pure heroin, chose to commit suicide and in the process, take some of his comrades with him.He was cleaning his weapon by a table with five other soldiers returned from a night of duty on our defensive berm. The self-destructive 18-year-old removed a hand grenade from the case in the center of the table, pulled its pin, then put it back in the box, detonating the entire batch.During the nightly drinking scene in our officers' club made of sandbags, we decided that the telegram sent home should have been modified. It should have read: ""We regret to inform you that your son died needlessly in a conflict that should not have happened, at the hands of a person under the influence of a powerful drug taken to anesthetize the pain of separation from his family and confusion for his participation in this stupid war.""Even today, we can and should dishonor that war without dishonoring the warriors.The movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"" confirms one difference between World War II and Vietnam. The war we won inflicted great pain on innocent children as the battle ebbed and flowed across Western Europe. The war we lost produced two new classes of child victims: Amerasian babies and political refugees. On Sundays, when the Viet Cong went home to tend crops, an informal truce occurred between their side and ours. On those days, I oversaw the provision of food, medical supplies and later, clothing, to an orphanage in My Tho city on the Mekong River near our base in Dong Tam. The effort boosted our morale as much or more than of that of the two Vietnamese nuns who operated the facility populated by over 200 orphans and disabled persons ranging in age from a few months to some well into their 80s.The many troops trucked to the orphanage on those Sunday afternoons returned to the war with pieces of their souls repaired. I soon learned that the nuns were not without their political skills. They had the older children make sure that at least one of their number latched on to a GI each afternoon to encourage our continued support. I fell in love with the eight-year-old who regularly attached herself to me over those 10 months. Tears came one day when she greeted me wearing a T-shirt with ""Bowdoin, Class of 19??"" printed on it. The shirt came in a ""CARE"" package sent by my parents' church in Belmont, Mass. who became involved in the clothing component of this mercy mission. I'd graduated from Bowdoin.These orphans may have differed from those wandering Europe, however, in that many were the issue of unions of American soldiers with Vietnamese women. You can imagine, then, how outraged I became at the American colonel in Saigon who ordered me to leave the kids unsupported and unprotected when my unit, the 9th Infantry Division, was redeployed to Hawaii and Ft. Lewis as part of President Nixon's first troop removal. This event capped my transition from a defender of U.S. policy in Asia to ardent critic. The cultural bias toward mixed-race children combined with the hatred of anything touched by Americans, spelled doom for those children, including the young girl whose affection kept me at least partially sane those long 10 months of incessant combat conditions.Thanh Tran, who arrived at Salem State College via Andover Academy, Everett High School, and a virtual child slave camp in Hong Kong, personifies the second kind of causality. Tran is a so-called boat child, exiled to Hong Kong and later to the U.S. because his father fought on the side of the United States during the war. As an officer in the South Vietnamese army, his father was taken prisoner following the removal of U.S. troops and later died in a ""re-education"" camp.This story is particularly moving to me as his father served with the 9th ARVA division alongside my unit in the delta region of South Vietnam. Through Tran, I have learned a good deal about how new immigrants experience our citizenship process. Angered by the inexcusable delays in processing his application, I asked Senator Ted Kennedy for his help at an event in Salem last March. But even the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Immigration of the Senate Judiciary Committee cannot expedite the interminable process to which applicants are subjected by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Thus the offspring of our deceased former allies must wait with all citizenship wannabes while our country decides whether or not to hang a ""no vacancy"" sign around the Statue of Liberty's neck. A mother's pain is a mother's pain whether we win or lose the war. As we celebrate Speilberg's triumph in his film about the invasion of Normandy a half-century ago, let's not lose its meaning. The damage war inflicts continues long after the bullets stop flying.			"

												Garfield Kart is a Lazy phone port.You know the game is shoddy when it says ""touch to continue"" instead of click or press. You can use the controller to move your character, but if you pause the game, you then have to use the mouse to resume. Same goes for the end of a race, you can't use  the controller to continue, you have to move the mouse to the continue icon (not that the icons tell you what they are when you hover over them)Add to that chunky (but workable) graphics and carts that handle like a brick, this one even big Garfield fans can skip.

												This game is honestly the most graphically intense game I have ever witnessed, i have dual titans (12gb) and I have to run it on the lowest quality and resolution, also the world and environments are very immersive, I honestly feel mezmerized by the production quality of this game.The gameplay of ""Garfield Kart"" is so amazing with mechanics, such as drifting that are pulled off so well. The controls are very responsive and it makes me realize how much of useless human being I really am and that I will never have the physical and mental capability to do anything this revolutionary and magnificent.Another thing I wanted to talk about was the character development, the dialogue is so well written and you really feel connected to the characters through out this magnificent tale of lasagne and that dang dog, when certain characters die it's really emotional and aggrivating, Nermal is just the perfect villain for this game they couldn't have chosen better voice actors.I think its really great that they added cosmetics such as hats and cars to this game, they also have more playable characters giving you more gameplay, but even if it didn't there is a lot of replayability to this game.In conclusion this game is simply magnificent, I love it from the bottom of my heart. Skyrim and Witcher 3 Wild Huntdon't have ♥♥♥♥ on Garfield Kart, honestly if you don't already have this game just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it already.P.S Stupie owes me 2 boxes of cornflakes.			"

												Garfield Kart is a well made racing game, much like the older Mario Kart games. There’s good gameplay, music, level design and replayability. There are also collectables in the game placed over the different levels in the game ad-GameplayGarfield Kart is a racing game; specifically a Racing Kart game. Therefore the gameplay is simple. Which it should be. It’s responsive with, for me atleast, no input lag; something that’s important in the high octane racing world of Garfield Kart. One thing I would say is that in certain areas on certain maps there are FPS lag spikes, where my frame rate tanked for like 2 seconds. I’m not sure why, but I haven’t looked into it enough to have an answer.Much like a Mario Kart game you can customise your racing experience choose between many different characters from the Garfield universe, different Karts, hats and using “Starting Power ups”. Each character has an advantage over the others in different areas. Those being Speed, Power ups and Handling. You unlock the different characters as you go through the Grand prix. It’s similar with Karts and hat. You can unlock them as you race, do daily challenges or you can buy them with the coins you pick up while racing.Speaking of racing there are 4 different types you can do in Garfield Kart: Single races, the Grand Prix, Time trials and the Daily challenge. Single races are self explanatory; you can choose to do a single race on one of the maps from either 50cc, 100cc or 150cc. (Each harder than the last). The Grand Prix has a total of 3 cups available, in each category, from the start. With a 4th being unlocked after completing the previous 3. Time trials put you against the clock on different maps, making find the fastest way round the track and it’ll cause you to look for shortcuts everywhere you can. Finally the Daily challenge. As it suggests each day you can try a challenge, from which you can unlock hats, cars and powerups.-The CollectablesThe collectable are kind of basic.They’re puzzle pieces, which once collected form a picture of Garfield and his friends in different situations. If you find them in 50cc you have them in 150cc, They could have added some that are only available on 150cc and those which are only available on 50cc. Prolonging the collecting.-MusicThis game has some very catchy music and some of the best I’ve heard in a game for a while. You may think that a ridiculous claim but the music fits the game perfectly. It’s cartoonish, fun and catchy. I’m sure I wouldn’t like the game as much as I do if the music wasn’t this good; It’s stella. Additionally on the 3rd lap the tempo increase give the race a sense of urgency. Making me feel as if I’m again the clock. -Level DesignWhile some of the levels resemble places from Garfield movies, TV shows, and I guess comic strips. There are no level directly from them. I don’t think this would have been impossible to do, just have us all be toy size racing around Garfield's home. I’d be giddy with joy  Boy, I sound autistic  Otherwise the level design works. It’s fun, and fits in with the Cartoon aesthetic. Taking us to places like ancient egypt, the Alps?... I think, and even a building site. The next thing this game need is Multiplayer races and it could be a real party game up there with the like of Mario Kart. As well as adding a level of replayability to the thin layer there already is.			"

												This game was a disappointment. I grew up watching and reading Garfield and I usually like arcade go-kart type racing games. This was a swing and a miss on all fronts.First, this one needs a surprisingly good graphics card to run without being choppy. That seems a bit much. Lazy on the part of the developers, in my opinion. This isn't a ""kill a few minutes on an Intel graphics laptop"" type of game.Second, the game just feels glitchy, unpolished, and clunky. Very low price, and for a reason.			"

Garfield Kart.Words can't describe the tender love I have for this game, unfortunately the game is now in the past, but it will always remain a masterpiece in an old gamer's eyes.Starting off with the gameplay, we get extremely innovative things in this category, creative power-ups and more, it really is a marvel to see Artefacts Studios in it's creative prime. Details aren't needed to describe how good this section is. So we'll give a solid 10/10 in the lasagna mark.Now we have a variety of characters to choose from in Garfield Kart, fan favorites of the beloved Garfield Franchise: Jon,Garfield,Odie,Nermal and much more. The choices are just remarkable in this category and I'm extremely impressed by the variety here.The soundtrack is memorable, that is all I can say in this remark, one can only get the game to truly feel the weight the music brings.Over-all, Garfield Kart is an old gem in the Steam Market that was over-shadowed by all those pesky greenlight games. Do pick it up and experience the fun for yourself, and support Artefacts Studios in new releases ; hopefully a sequel might come of it.EDIT: Also as a reminder, do not let my gametime fool you, I've played tens of dozens of hours in offline mode. There really is a lot of gameplay here. "

												My girlfriend bought this game for me because I love Garfield. Little did I know, this would be the hardest game I have ever played. I've spent countless hours grueling over and trying to beat the beast that is garfield kart, but I've never succeeded. If I get close, the game forces me in a loop of watching my previous battle and not letting me continue. I would be mad, but I'm just numb to it by now. If you're asking yourself if you should get this game because for some reason you're genuinely considering it and it's not for the meme, spare yourself. You will end up like me. Stuck slaving over a game that you should be able to win, but can't for some godforsaken reason. One day I will beat you, garfield kart. One day.			"

												A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of ""melts"". Almost every ""grilled cheese"" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called ""grilledcheese"" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled ""melts"" because that is not a ♥♥♥♥ing grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. ♥♥♥♥, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples ""grilled cheeses"" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.			"

												Once in every millenia, there comes something inspiring. Something jawdropping. Something timeless and classic, so much so to the point where it defines the culture of future generations. For far too long we've been unable to find what defines our own. But the search is over at last. Our furry savior has arrived to bring our souls to peace and restore to the universe. This godly force is known as Garfield Kart.Garfield Kart is not just a game. It is a religion. We live and base our morale off the principles Garfield Kart set out for us, becasue we know that if we do not submit and allow Garfield to confess our sins, we'll be damned to anti-Lasagna Hell for eternity with the Satanic Jon. We spend every day and night of our existence working ever so determinedly to satisfy and please our holy father Garfield. We acknowledge that our lives fall apart every Monday. But our god almighty reminds us that there is always a Tuesday and a pan of lasagna waiting for us at the end of each difficult path we walk down. We owe it to Garfield for ending racism among the lasagnaphobes and now 99% of the population of the planet watches their fatass privelidge. We have Garfield Kart to thank. Thank you Garfield Kart. We as a species are forever endowed to the amazingness our hungry kitty lord Garfield has granted us.This game is a meme. 2/15 too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This Cart Racing game isn't terrible, but the technical aspects or lack thereof makes it terrible.As noted by many the optimization is not there and it's very, very  laggy which is bad news for a racerThe game seems to be made with Unity.  You can use the controller to race but the main menu navigation needs the keyboard.If improvements can be made on the technical side the game would be ok, but as of now it is not ok.			"

												I bought this game mainly because I've always liked all things Garfield, and besides that, I somewhat also like kart racing games the likes of Mario Kart, but despite my love for this fluffy cat, I strongly regret my purchase.Somehow you may think that this game is child-oriented because of the style, graphics and theme, but as soon as you open it, you'll see that the menus and options are not that user friendly to the point that even an adult can have a rough time figuring out how this works.Before the game actually fires, you'll face a small configuration window with two tabs, ""Graphics"" and ""Input"", pretty self explanatory. The problems begin when you try to configure your own keys (or controller) since the assignations are not intuitive; for instance, this are the first options you can choose from when setting up your keyboard:- Turn right (Digital) (+)- Turn right (Digital) (-)- Turn left (Digital) (+)- Turn left (Digital) (-)- Turn right (Analog)- Turn left (Analog)...and so on.The options for the graphical configuration are merely ""Screen resolution"" and ""Graphics quality"", which you can change from ""Very low"" to ""Very high"" with five steps, but I don't have any complains in those since this is a pretty basic game and that will suffice, I bet this can even be played on any recent iGPU.Then, after you're done with te settings window, you'll find out that no matter what keys you entered in the config, the game will act completely different: in my case, after setting up the keys, I have to press Left in order for the cart to go Right, I have to press Down for the cart to accelerate, etc.I think the only ""positive"" point of the game, is that it looks nice, it's only visually attractive, no more. You'll have to deal with key mapping problems, config issues and even, maybe, optimisation issues since the game suffers from frame dropping even with its simple and undemanding graphics.The only reason I'm keeping the game it's because of the cat and because it will be an extra number in my Steam library, but I'm sure I will never install it nor ""play"" it again.

												As a cart racing game this one is pretty generic but perfectly fine, however the PC port is a disaster. No matter what graphical preset I selected or resolution, this game would drop to sub 30 FPS on a consistent basis. Some tracks would see single digit FPS drops in places. And it's not just the low FPS, it's the insane dips and spikes. If you have a good PC, in the span of 15 seconds you will go from 100+ FPS down to 10 FPS. The framerate is all over the place, making the karts impossible to control at times. And the specs given are completely off base with the games actual demands. My PC slaughters the recommended specs. I have an fx 8350 Black Overclocked, an RX 480 with 8gbs VRAM and 16 gbs of Ram. I can't even maintain a solid 30 on the lowest graphical preset with Garfield Kart, so the idea that a dual core 2ghz CPU, and 256 mbs of VRAM could run this thing, is laughable. So unless you have quad sli 1080's with a G-Sync monitor to negate the massive dips and spikes, you might want to steer clear of this one. It's a shame that the port is unplayable, because the actual game was pretty good.UpdateI forgot to mention the fact that in Grand Prix mode, you cannot advance races in fullscreen, you are forced to play windowed.Here is my full in-depth review

HOWEVER NONE OF THOSE THINGS COMPARE TO WHAT MY EYES WERE JUST SUBJECTED TO.The controls feel like the rear of a homeless man's ♥♥♥ after having sex with 5 hookers, slippery yet surprisingly firm.The graphics are as if my dog somehow managed to access Microsoft Paint, not any other program mind you, and decided to bark on the keyboard. Later, when somebody cleaned the keyboard of the vomit they pressed down everything and somehow those pixelated lined were born.The music sounds like the death of every human simutaliniously being processed into a Dollarama grade microphone (So it was the highlight of the game)TL:DRI felt my dreams melt away after playing this game.6/10			"

												Garfield Kart is the third title in the massively popular Garfield series, following 2008's Garfield: Devasta Coastline and 2011's Garfield: Tides of Darkness. Garfield Kart follows the titular character 'Garfield' and his crew of ragtag mercenaries as they continue their search for the buried treasure of the legendary pirate captain Orion Baskerville. This particular game takes place on the arid desert planet of Boralia, and see's our heroes utilising vehicles to cross the massive landscapes. The driving controls are tight and responsive, and the ground combat, a mix of Batman Arkham melee and Gears of War-esque gunplay, works well, with the bosses spiking difficulty later in the game. The story is enjoyable and kept me interested for its 20+ hour duration. Plenty of sidequests and diversions in the game world to keep players interested long after completing the campaign. The sound design is absoloutely top-notch, from the report of gun, rev of an engine or blood curdling squeal of an undead aboriginal pirate. Guest voice actors include Michael Rosen, Johan Hegg and Alexis Texas.The game runs perfectly at 24+ FPS on Virtual Machine running Windows 95 with 64mb RAM and 1.2Mgz processor.My only criticism is that the controller support is a bit dodgy, the only button prompts i could get to show up on screen appeared to be from a Neo-Geo pocket X.Overall, 9.75/10 would definetly play for 104 hours  again			"

Just a short wait later, Jim Davis returned to his first Steam Garfield game to give it a second go: there is so much creativity, variety and challenge poured into this masterpiece. 2009 The Garfield Show was brilliant, but 2013's Garfield Kart is absolutely amazing.10/10			"

At the very same time, a train leaves City Y for City X at 20 mph on the same track. At the same moment, a bird leaves the City X train station and flies towards the City Y train station at 25 mph. When the bird reaches the train from City Y, it immediately reverses direction. It then continues to fly at the same speed towards the train from City X, when it reverses its direction again, and so forth. The bird continues to do this until the trains collide. How far would the bird have traveled in the meantime?thanks			"

												    In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.    Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. "

												I think that Garfield Kart really captures that world war II element that most games don't have. It's amazing how accurate the karts are compared to other games like battlefield one, It also has very promising gameplay with different levels and stats for characters! I think that garfield kart also includes a 1900's vibe in it with the background music. The guns are very realistic and aswell suitable for all ages! It's got some Humor in it as well! I Highly (Don't) reccomend $5 on garfield kart12/11!			"

												Plot summaryThe animals of the Manor Farm lived badly because their farmer Mr. Jones, a mean and always drunk man, exploits them. One day Old Major, the old pig who led the animals, called a meeting of all the animals and told them about a dream that he had the previous night. He had dreamed about an old song called, 'Beasts of England' that started a resistance against the human beings. When Old Major sang the song every other animal started to join in. Everyone was very excited about rebelling. Old Major died a few days later and two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, started leading the preparations for the Rebellion. About three months later they revolted against Mr. Jones and they took over the farm. The purpose of the revolution was to create a fair society made only by animals, or animalism and it was based on seven commandments such as “Four legs good, two legs bad” and most importantly: ""All animals are equal"". They also changed the name of the farm to ""Animal Farm"" from Manor Farm.Snowball, an inventive and vivacious pig and Napoleon, a big and cruel-looking pig, started to fight for leadership. In the meantime Mr. Jones was planning to attack to get the farm back but when he did the animals won the battle called ""The Battle of the Cowshed"" and Mr. Jones was forced to stay out of the farm. One day, when Snowball announced his plans to build a windmill, Napoleon arrived in the farm with nine big and cruel dogs that made Snowball run away bleeding. From that day Napoleon was the real dictator of the farm; if an animal didn't agree with him, he was eaten up by his dogs. If something went wrong (like when the windmill they'd worked so hard on was wrecked), Napoleon blamed it on Snowball, who, according to him, was sneaking around Animal Farm ruining everything. When Boxer, the strongest horse in the farm, lost his strength because of old age and fell while he was building a windmill, Napoleon sent him to be slaughtered. Now Napoleon had pity on nobody. He and the pigs were like Mr. Jones - they exploited the other animals, they took advantage of the foolishness of some animals and they came into contact with human beings for business although they had said it was forbidden. In the end they became like human beings, they started to walk on their hind legs and they changed the old maxim with a new one: “Four legs good, two legs better”. Nothing was changed and their resistance seemed to be useless.InspirationOrwell, who was a socialist, wrote in the introduction of the 1947 Ukrainian translation of Animal Farm that he got the idea from seeing a young boy whipping a large cart horse. He explained, ""It struck me that if only such animals became aware of (knew) their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit (badly use) animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat (the poor, the lower class)""Overall 10/10 fascist goverment again "

												This game is one of the most revolutionary games of the century. Not only does it have cunning graphics and engaging gameplay, but is a true modern art form that can easily be related to Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. Garfield Kart acts as a basis in which all games in the future shall follow. I call for Garfield Kart to be added as the 11th commandment as it is a game and world we all shall follow. I can highly recommend this game to anyone, the rich, poor, and working class as this game can appeal to anyone in any outreach of the world. Why, this game should be displayed 24/7 on a screen in Times Square, for all to see and enjoy as everyone should have at least 12% of their daily diet being lasagna. Our government leaders and representatives shall play this game as well, as it will increase the chances they start a Garfield Kart Fund and a Lasagna Fund. Although I now have to conclude this review, I do not know where to end. This game simply cannot be described in a paragraph... or with words for that matter. It shall be explained through easily interpreted body and hand movements along with the soothing sound of a cat chewing lasagna. However, this review must come to a slow and sickening end. My final statement on the matter is this: this game is not worth five dollars... It is worth the life of a cat and his lasagna, worth the world. If you do not enjoy this game, there is simply something wrong and you need to contact your doctor immediately for support. All show your support for this flawless and innovative game and let it live on!			"

												The seventh and last on my Garfield™, Garfield Kart is Stephane Longeard being reluctantly cashed out by Garfield & Friend's corporations in general. She has been bought. As she handed the reigns of her masterclass series of games to Garfield/Friends, she shed a tear. Not in sadness it was gone, but in happiness because it ever was in the first place. She knew she had left her permanent, unignorable mark on gaming forever. Garfield Kart is nothing more than a EA'ed, hollywoodized shell of a game. You can feel the absence of Stéphane leaving such a remarkable hollow within the game.It serves as nothing more than a reminder that, in the end, money wins.			"

												Garfield Kart is a racing game developed by Gravity Europe releasing on PC in November 2013. The game has also been released on Nintendo 3DS previously as well. We have all come to know what to expect from kart racing games from the likes of Mario Kart in the past. Most kart games that have come out to try and rival Mario Kart have often fallen flat on their face. Prior to playing Garfield, I had played another kart racing game on Steam, Coffin Dodgers and sadly that didn’t live up to the mark. Garfield Kart is almost an identical game to that of Coffin Dodgers. Gameplay is going to be simple when it comes to kart racing, simply beat your opponents in the race around a circuit. There are 16 different courses to race around with 8 different powerups to collect around the circuits too. The game’s tutorial is back to front when it comes to explaining the controls; whether they did it with a different controller in mind I am not sure, but the controls on an Xbox controller were the complete opposite to shown on the screen. Garfield Kart has three different game modes to play, Grand Prix, Single Race and Time Trial. Grand Prix is the more structured part of the game, where you take part in 4 or 5 races at a time in a league, depending on where you finish in the races will determine how many points you get. Single Race is more like the “free mode”, whilst you can gain money from competing in races here; there aren’t any huge rewards for winning. Time Trial is what you would expect from a Kart Racing game; nothing too exciting and certainly the least interesting of the three modes. There is one final game mode which is where Garfield does something a little different to the rest of the Kart Games on Steam. A daily challenge mode is included, complete the set task and you will get a reward at the end of it. This is a really easy way to gather better upgrades for your car without having the need to grind out money by replaying previous tournaments. Graphically, Garfield Karts looks really nice. It looks like one of the cartoons, with some really nice modelling, textures and animations on show. The game’s environments are all very nicely designed as well. The sound effects do let the game down a little bit; it can sometimes seem too quiet at times. Your engine noise can almost seem too quiet for it to seem realistic which something which felt really odd when playing is. The sound track is really catchy though. Garfield Kart has three levels of difficulties. Whilst you are not able to choose the difficulties per race, you choose which bracket of difficulty race to take part in; 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. Obviously the higher the number the more powerful the rest of your opponents cars will be. In order to even be competitive in the 100cc and 150cc bracket, you will have to completely upgrade your car using the upgrade system; you are able to purchase items for your car which will improve three criteria of performance, speed, handling and power. You will also be able to choose from a selection of helmets which will also grant you a specific bonus for individual power ups which you can collect. Whilst I really liked the upgrade system, it does feel very much like a grind to unlock items as you have to replay previously won competitions in order to get anywhere close to being able to buy anything. I would have personally liked to have seen a reduction in the price set on the items so you aren’t forced to replay already played content if you don’t want to. The daily challenge mode helps with this, but only if you play the game in small doses. I have been playing for over an hour so far and I have just completed the first bracket of races whilst also taking part in the daily challenge and a couple of time trials. There is easily another 3 or 4 hours of content from this game. Sadly the game will have very little staying power and I will more than likely not play the game again after completing the three stages of difficulty. With the lack of any multiplayer mode, the developers have really shot themselves in the foot of making game out of a genre which is so perfectly crafted for any type of multiplayer action.As the Steam page says for this game, there is only partial controller support for this game. The gameplay itself works well with a control, however you have to navigate menus with your mouse, making a bit awkward to play on a couch setup. There is a wide selection of resolutions to play on, right the way up to 4k, with minimal graphic options to change. To sum up, Garfield Kart is purely an OK game. There aren’t any glaringly obvious negative points; it’s just not going to blow your socks off with exciting game play moments and hilarious local multiplayer. The only thing that resembles Garfield in this game is the character models; there is no story, no voice acting, and nothing else that makes this game any different to a generic kart racer. Luckily the game is priced low at £5, 59, and for that price you will get some enjoyment out of it, just don’t go into it expecting all the bells and whistles of Mario Kart. I’ve marked it down as a 3 on my scale, it’s not the best game, but it certainly isn’t a bad game either. If you can get it less than the sale price, you will want to consider checking it out for an hour or two of action.			"

												Garfield Kart (Gar-feeld Cart) is a cult classic devolped by Rockstar Studios, Bethesda, ID Games, Blizzard Entartainment, 2K Games, and Telltale, and Valve. It was made in 2014, and still holds up today as one of the greatest games EVER made. The frame rate is always a steady 300fps, and the story elements Telltale put in the game makes it shine even more. In this game, Garfield is on an epic journey to find the key to the vault that leads to the golden lasagna. Along the way he meets other important friends and strong enemies, such as Odie (whom he kicks into orbit so he can retreive the map (SPOILER!!!)) Jon, the main antagonist who sends talon company to hunt down garfief. This is where the word ""Kart"" shines. garfield must use his ""i hate Mondays' powered kart to get to his goal, the key to the golden lasagna.The driving physics are top of the line, it makes you wanna push to get 1st place. The shooting mechanics devolped by Rockstar are top of the line, you never see the same reload animation twice in a row. The graphics surpass Fallout 4, MGS 5: The Phatom Pain, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Remastered.I dont think a 10/10 is a high enough score for this game, this needs to be put into a time caspule and given to the people of the future just to pass on the tradition of Garfield kart.

												I love this game! It is extremely fun and enjoyable. I very much so enjoyed playing this with my son, as he loves garfield and I can safely say after playing this I do too! My top tip is that you come prepared for giggles as the art style and racing aspect is quite wacky. My first impression of the game changed my opinion on the game completely at first I thought 'Oh great another mario cart' but it is its own thing. It took the best parts from garfield, raing games and comedy and compliled them into one. 10/10			"

												ENG:Garfield is one of my favorite comic book characters ever so that's why I bought the game.However, performance despite the problems, this game is playable in the game. Possibly the best kart game that I actually played on the computer, which is based on TV characters or other brand characters.A nice and functional game. Referral!FIN:Karvinen on yksi minun suosikki sarjakuva hahmoista ikinä joten siksi ostin pelin.Kuitenkin suorituskyky ongelmista huolimatta tämä peli on pelattavissa oleva peli. Mahdollisesti paras karting peli jota olen itse pelannut tietokoneella, joka perustuu tv -hahmoihin tai muihin brandi hahmoihin.Kiva ja toimiva peli. Suositteluni!			"

												TL;DR Possibly the most ""meh"" game I have ever played, no one thing was particularly problematic, but nothing was memorable or even of significant note either. 6/10Garfield Kart is fun enough to pick up and play for a few quick chuckles, only to sooner or later realize you don't recognise half of these characters and only get a few of the references and be reminded you haven't watched anything Garfield related that came out in this century.Pros:Nothing really wrong with it I could find.Controls are quick to learn and surprisingly intuitive.Reasonable price.Cones:Makes me feel old.

												Garfield Kart, memery aside certainly is not a horrible game. However, keep a few things in mind:1. If you are trying to give this to someone you dislike, it may not be worth it because Garfield Kart is not that horrible; get Bad Rats instead for that.2. If you are looking for a quality kart racer don't buy this. It definitely is passable but not really worth 5 dollars.3. If you are looking for a game to give to a young kid it may be good, however, my computer (Gtx 960 2gb, 16gb of ram, and a i5) lags horribly in certain areas on max settings and never exceeds 60 anywhere. 4. If you have made many Garfield Cart jokes you probably should buy this.Also a few things about actual gameplay:1. The bots will scale in items which is BS because you will never truly have an edge over the bots.2. No online.3. No split-screen.4. Bots will sometimes have impossibly fast reactions at 100cc and up.5. Grinding is essential so get the hang of it.Hope this helps. "

												Lasagna Fun Facts: Lasagne is a wide, flat pasta shape and possibly one of the oldest. As with most other types of pasta, the word is a plural form, lasagne meaning more than one piece of lasagna ribbon. The word also refers to a dish made with this type of pasta in several layers interspersed with layers of various ingredients and sauces.Lasagne originated in Italy, in the region of Emilia-Romagna.July 29th is National Lasagna Day.Traditionally, the dough was prepared in Southern Italy with semolina and water and in the northern regions, where semolina was not available, with flour and eggs.Originally, in Italy, the word “lasagna” did not refer to a food (in fact, today, the food is still spelled “lasagne” as the plural form). The word “lasagna” referred to the pot in which the food was cooked. It is thought that the word “lasagna” for the pot is derived from the Greek word for “chamber pot.The earliest lasagna recipes known are dated from the thirteenth century. At that time, tomatoes were not known to Europeans. This means that they couldn’t have used them in the recipes. However, depending on the recipe, different cheeses are used.Boiling noodles used to be a requirement for making lasagna. No-boil noodles now exist. These are great as they soften in the oven, but it is absolutely necessary to make sure that there is a great quantity of sauce so the noodles get wet and cook while they are in the oven.You can make lasagna in the dish washer. All you have to do is put the ingredients together in a dish (either boils noodles or use the no boil noodles), cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil, then use the heated dry and sanitize cycle on your dishwasher to cook the lasagna.The most well-known bit of lasagna lore is probably that the cat, Garfield, from the comic strip, has lasagna as his favorite food.Weird Al Yankovic recorded a song called “Lasagna” that is a parody of “La Bamba”.

												I DID IT.Yesterday on August 15, the three of us, Me (53 years old), the dirty fetish workman (45 years old) who sent me an E-mail the other day, and the usual old bum (60 years old), enjoyed having group sex under the riverbank in the northern part of Okayama.Because the next day was a holiday, and the it was a quiet place, there was nothing to prevent us from getting high. So we went to a convenience store to buy alcohol and some snacks. After boozing up, we started to suck and ♥♥♥♥ each other.

Tasting the workman's ♥♥♥♥, with my hip on the old bum's head, he suddenly spewed his ♥♥♥♥ into my mouth. With that start, me and the old man also gushed out.

It felt so good to thrust my ♥♥♥♥ into the bum's ♥♥♥, the combination of pee and ♥♥♥♥ worked very well. The workman was also ♥♥♥♥ing the old bum. He thrusted his ♥♥♥♥ into the bum's mouth and shaked his hips skillfully. While scraping-off the old man's ♥♥♥♥-covered ♥♥♥♥, I ejaculated with all my might.

												A certain town comprises of 100 married couples. Everyone in the town lives by the following rule: If a husband cheats on his wife, the husband is executed as soon as his wife finds out about him. All the women in the town only gossip about the husbands of other women. No woman ever tells another woman if her husband is cheating on her.  So every woman in the town knows about all the cheating husbands in the town except her own. It can also be assumed that a husband remains silent about his infidelity. One day, the mayor of the town announces to the whole town that there is at least 1 cheating husband in the town. What do you think happens?pls help me with my math			"

If you have no knowledge of the lore or expanded universe, there's a brief summary in the beginning.) to defeat the Monday Menace, the main villain of the game. As the game progresses, Garfield's love of lasagna hinders him but also keeps him going, as he knows that destroying Mondays once and for all will mean endless amounts of lasagna for him and his friends. Garfield meets new friends along the way, but also loses some. I will stop here, to avoid spoiling it for those thinking of purchasing. The one thing I will say is that you might want to keep a box of tissues nearby, as the ending is a tearjerking farewell to a character we know and love.Garfield Kart is work of art. If this game is not in your library, put it on your wishlist. This game goes on sale every summer and winter sale, for only $1.49, which isn't too much for a game worth a million dollars such as this one.			"

												a true game of inspiration. This game is the root of all joy and happiness in this depressing world. Anyone who doesn't have gradfeld karti in their library is  a lost soul, and nothing else. Odie is our true lord. He will always be our savior and our father. Every night i bow down to Odie and let him cleanse my soul. I fall asleep listening to the classic gradfeld move from cartoon netwoek. I will always be one with Odie, and noo one can change that. I would do anything for odie. He has gifted us with this beautiful game from the angles. I will never take Odie for granted, and always see him as my father and one true lord. Gradfield and Odie are said to fight on Earth one day, and when that day comes, I will be ready for Odie to take me to his home. Odie and Gradfeld are the true lord of this world, and when they fight, there will be no survivors. I will be brought to paradise because of my true faith in Odie. I can trust Odie to do anything for me, and you can trust him to do anything for you. All you have to do is buy this game. $15 is a small price to pay for infinite peace. I will travel  to Odie land and eat all the lasaga I want because there are no fat cats to stop me from eating all the lasaga in the world. Soon gradfeld will fall, and when he does, all the non believers will fall with him.			"

												Playing Garfileld has given me a whole new reason to live. I have taken up interest in photoshopping boobs onto Donald Trump's nose. I have also started to drink melted candle wax. I see rainbows in my worst nightmares now, because of fungal spores clogging my arteries. Everyone who's ever consumed a fedora can probably relate to my pain. If you know anyone willing to wear deodorant, please send help. Marine biologists and Visa gift cards are good going away gifts to give to your pet dog as he/she leaves to go to the military. Rail road spikes can commonly be found underground, near where the Grinch lives. I am schitofrenic, and probably mispelled that. I've never had so much money in my Steam account. Thank you for your time. I'm going to go jerk off to some cows ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Garfielf cart runs at 4.20 fps on my computer, and now you've got aids. I'm dying becuse my favorite word is, ""sofa."" Did you know that the word, ""bottle,"" has 47 letters in it? Well, now you know. Please remove the sand from my lungs. There is Mtn Dew in my Dr. Pepper bottle.			"

												One of the most heartwrenching sci-fi thrillers of the decade. Garfield Kart is a jack of all trades in the video game industry, and is a gem to behold. This game is worth every penny as it takes you on the emotional rollercoaster that is Garfield Kart. Garfield/10			"

												You can't play as Lyman. That's really all you need to know.This is a kart racing game based on Garfield. Because all the kids are crazy for Garfield. It was very obviously made for a phone touchscreen, many of the menus only work when you realize that it's expecting you to swipe with the mouse. It looks pretty bad, yet it runs surprisingly poorly. In all, it's exactly the game you would expect from a PC port of a smartphone game based on a licensed character nobody has cared about for at least two decades.			"

												Garfield kart is the best game known to man, it stopped me from committed suicide. this is even better than the best movies of 2046 ( bee movie, the smosh movie, the fred trilogy, alvin and the chipmunks road chip, food fight, and norm of the north). this game has been given to us  from the gods themselves. garfield kart basically plays like your average first person shooter and jrpg, with some hentai elements added to it. but don't let that fool you, this game is so good that it won 1743647354736543746237543467345747549839203754736239484734658746.45 awards for game of the year and best looking game of the year. my favorite part was when u deul odie in bling bling boy's mansion or shrek's swamp. this game is definitely a 7346734637648858535738563487/15. defenitely woth $800.

												While this game has become somewhat of a meme due to Pyrocynical playing it, Garfield Kart is very bad in terms of quality of AI and other thing I'll get to. Whenever you get dropping/decreased frames the other AI players do not so you're always somehow getting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ end of the stick. Whenever you get a Bronze, Silver, or Gold cup the game glitches to where it's a blank moving shot of the backround. This game seems very lazy and rushed in many ways from the characters being choppy and Certain things not doing what they're supposed to do. I do like this game, but sadly I don't recommend it to most people. Kek Salt Man made this review			"

												Don't believe these other guys giving Garfield Kart with only 0.6 hours played.  This game has dozens of hours of unlockable content and secret stages that will keep you entertained for your money's worth and more.  Procedurally generated racing maps, hyper-intelligent AI, tons of fun multiplayer game modes with both local and online support, and the Garfield characters we know and love make this game a must-buy.

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

												This will probably be one of the few serious reviews.Garfield Kart is a bad racing game.The physics of the game are awful,the driving feels odd to say the least,the power ups are annoying and boring.The game's map diversity and customization are awful.To top it all off,the game is poorly optimized.Even if the graphics are decent,it shouldn't tax my PC so much and for sure it shouldn't have frame drops.The only good part of the game-The Garfield brand.3/10 do not buy this!

												First things first, it's a fun game. However, I wouldn't recommend it right now because the controls are broken, big time. The default setting is steering with arrow keys, so I tried rebinding the keys to WASD. This worked, once. Every single time after, the game would rebind the keys so that both a and d turned left, or vice versa. I went to the discussion boards for some help, but it seems like there is no solution for the moment. With no way to restore defaults, I literally cannot play the game, which is a shame considering I love Garfield, the graphics, and the gameplay. If this issue gets addressed I will absolutely update my review, but at this point in time it's not worth it.			"

												This game is an amazing game I love it to the bones and to the core I think it creates a personality that only the orignal cartoons could capture of this lovable fluff ball. you know for most games it is annoying for thier it be pay to win but with this game it feels natural almost like cutting yourself... a slice lasagna. I remember from my childhood watching a special cartoon for Garfeild where odie gets captured by a dog handler and man playing this game revives the need THE lust of watching that cartoon again. The cast of characters from carfeild kart brings back so many memory's of walking to the mail box and grabbing that sunday news paper and the anticipation of opening to that cartoon page and opening my imported branmd new Garfield vanilla rings from mexico pouring the 2% milk. one day I was watching my saturday toons, their was a comerical for a garfield online, man I remember the moment i made my account and bagn playing that amazing wonderful jawdropping game. I know many of you will remember the live action movie the first one was great but the second put the garfield name to shame. Me and garfield we always had the smae values in life eat sleep and hate thouse monday's everytime he took bite i would always take another every nap he evertook was another dream i had for him and every monday i cursed its name along with my hero Garfield. I would like to share another man who strongly loves the garfield brand about as much as i do he is the owner of the Officalgarfield channel he dosent have many views and it sure is a shame so I hope that I can bring some light to it  https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialGarfield/videos. I know the Garfield craze has lost its meow but i will always have another slice of that garfield pie and this game truely brings it back to life.			"

												Uhh I tried to start the game but all it showed was a black screen. I checked task manager to make sure that Garfield Kart was running well and it was. I tried changing the Graphics as a last resort and it didnt work. Idk maybe maybe my Gtx970 can't run such a professional game. "

												Overall:The game is great. I recently built my new pc for running this game only and I have to say I am impressed I am pulling off a consistent 30fps for my £10,000 pc on all the lowest settings.. The game shows the most amazing mechanics that no other game has used before, such as items used for enhancments and attacking. Garfield cart is a very fun, high quality, intense racing game which in all honesty is the best I have ever played. The fact it can offer such smooth racing with a realistic feel is amazing, as the realism matched with the pure fantasy makes my wildest dreams come true. Graphics:Better than any other game out there so far, so good that even my 8k monitor can't match what was truly intended. One issue for some may be that you can't process the pure magic of these graphics with your current components. Fear not, as this game offers the highest quality optimisation for your machine.Sound:A very unique interesting range of sounds. I often find myself jamming to the main menu music, and feeling the intesity of the final lap when everything speeds up and gets the adrenaline pumping.			"

												This game is honestly the best Mario Kart installment from Nintendo ever! The addition of Garfield characters and getting rid of Mario was an amazing, but risky move to make on Nintendo's part. I'm still baffled on how they even got the rights to the Garfield characters. The controls, as you would imagine, are smoother than ever before, and the new items are top knotch. The addition of pies, lazagna, and UFOs really fit the new Garfield style. So, overall I would say this game is a MUST BUY, and it's only 5 dollars so why not!			"

												Don't even buy this game as a joke.-This game is badly optimized-It's a port of an existing mobile game-The controls are so bad it makes you play Twister on your keyboard-Some of the background music has an annoying high frequency that can, literally, give you a bad migrain-The collision psychics barely exist-There's no catching up on racers ahead of you-Power Ups are pixel-perfect-Very boring when there is no obstacles-In-Game purchases needed to help you win-You only get 1 track and the rest need to be payed forIt may not seem that bad the way you look at it, but all of these problems are legit and serious, this is indeed one of the worst racing games ever, Big Rigs is better than this crap.You are better off buying a $50 2DS off Amazon and a used $20 copy of Mario Kart 7.

												This game is honestly the best Mario Kart installment from Nintendo ever! The addition of Garfield characters and getting rid of Mario was an amazing, but risky move to make on Nintendo's part. I'm still baffled on how they even got the rights to the Garfield characters. The controls, as you would imagine, are smoother than ever before, and the new items are top knotch. The addition of pies, lazagna, and UFOs really fit the new Garfield style. So, overall I would say this game is a MUST BUY, and it's only 5 dollars so why not!			"

												Hi, number 9 Garfield Kart player in the world here. The ""Haters"" and the ""Trolls"" have recently been harassing me for my Garfield Kart skills, and my limited edition Garfield Merchandise collection. First of all, is is the best game I've ever played, the graphics and lighting are AMAZING, the controls are incredibly fluid. This game is 10/10 would recommend to IGN and CynicalBrit and all the other game reviewers out there. Please get this game and do a duty to yourself. It is very helpful to your health and will take you places that you have never been. You get to gain the experience of being a cat and driving a cart.			"

												So essentially i'm doing this and them i'm going to bed. Got this game as a gift from my good friend Maren (thanks for the gift) and i was pretty happy because i actually like Garfield very much, i grew up watching his cartoons and i love kart games, specially those on Steam (take a hint ""Mario Kart"") so i was pretty excited to play this one, installed and played a race. First thing is the usual progression system that i'm not fully sure if you have to pay for stuff like candy crush (the boosters) or for the characters but i only had Garfield and Jon and 1 track to select, also there was this big ""Microtransctions"" sign in the menu, no customisation options, no directimput or ximput support and the frames... the race started at 60 fps and i think that was the last time, god the anwful framerates of this game, every turn was like a jump in time, for a port of a 3ds game so WHY? thing is i'm deleting it and never playing it again. Do not buy.			"

												Garfield Kart is a karting game similar to Mario Kart & Modnation Racers.  You race, get weapons, and shoot at your opponents.  I saw people complaining about the graphics and the controller set-up, I have not had any frame rate issues and I am playing on the highest setting.  I also hooked up my Xbox controller to my PC and tested it out and it works better than the keyboard, in my opinion, and I have not had any issues with it and it was easy to set-up. Lots of custimaztion options for your caracters and kart.  Very fun game and I highly recommend this game for anyone that likes racing games!			"

												Garfield Kart is a fun racing game with wacky gameplay mechanics and an easy to master control system! It comes packed with a wide variety of levels, graphic options and a really well-done tutorial.The game has a cartoony interface and simple control inputs, but is unique enough to be classed as a desktop game rather than feeling like a mobile port. It's reminiscent of Sonic Racing in many ways, with its stylish visuals and sound design.Recommended! :)			"

												This is the new Bad Rats. This is an extremely poorly optimized port of a mobile game; my system has an i5 4690K, 8 gigs of RAM, and an r9 390, and the game hardly ever goes above 30 fps, even dropping to 10 on Medium settings at 1080p. I set up my controller to play, and when I started I had to use the mouse to select the options, and the game ws already asking for me to buy things! Once I got into the race, my controls were very different, and for some reason the right trigger pawsed the game. Turning is nonexistant, and you have to completely rely on drifting, but drifting only worked the first time I used it in any race, so I consistantly lost because I couldn't turn at all. If you want to make better use of your time, make your own Kart racing game, even if you just roll your head on the keyboard to program it it'd probably turn out better. I got this as a gag gift and I feel like I wasted money.			"

												This game is fun for just messing around but it would be a lot of fun if it were full controller supported and multi player. With no motivation to play and beat other players I'm probably going to set it aside and play it once or twice a year if that. I got this game in a bundle and thought it would be fun. For the $.50 (if that much) that went towards this game, I was right. It's entertaining if you've got nothing else going on and don't want to take a game too seriously but the lack of multi player really takes away from what this game could be. For the $8 normal price tag or the $2 sale price, I would say this game isn't worth the buy. If you get it in a bundle it's worth it as long as you don't buy the bundle for this game. I wouldn't spend the money to buy this game at all because of the lack of key features that are supposed to be with games like these.			"

												This is the new Bad Rats. This is an extremely poorly optimized port of a mobile game; my system has an i5 4690K, 8 gigs of RAM, and an r9 390, and the game hardly ever goes above 30 fps, even dropping to 10 on Medium settings at 1080p. I set up my controller to play, and when I started I had to use the mouse to select the options, and the game ws already asking for me to buy things! Once I got into the race, my controls were very different, and for some reason the right trigger pawsed the game. Turning is nonexistant, and you have to completely rely on drifting, but drifting only worked the first time I used it in any race, so I consistantly lost because I couldn't turn at all. If you want to make better use of your time, make your own Kart racing game, even if you just roll your head on the keyboard to program it it'd probably turn out better. I got this as a gag gift and I feel like I wasted money.			"

												This game is fun for just messing around but it would be a lot of fun if it were full controller supported and multi player. With no motivation to play and beat other players I'm probably going to set it aside and play it once or twice a year if that. I got this game in a bundle and thought it would be fun. For the $.50 (if that much) that went towards this game, I was right. It's entertaining if you've got nothing else going on and don't want to take a game too seriously but the lack of multi player really takes away from what this game could be. For the $8 normal price tag or the $2 sale price, I would say this game isn't worth the buy. If you get it in a bundle it's worth it as long as you don't buy the bundle for this game. I wouldn't spend the money to buy this game at all because of the lack of key features that are supposed to be with games like these.			"

												Garfield Kart is the pinnacle of human creation. Nothing ever came close. The plot is phenomenal. I won't spoil it, but just know that the romance subplot between Jon and Odie is one of the best I've witnessed. This game is one of the most beautiful games I've played. It's so good, my computer can barely run it at max settings. The gameplay is even better. The game is so good, it crashed my entire computer twice, and now the game loads into a black screen.

												ADOLF HITLER: EARLY YEARS, 1889–1913Related ArticlesCommentsHow to cite this articleBaptized a Catholic, Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) was born on April 20, 1889, in the Upper Austrian border town Braunau am Inn, located approximately 65 miles east of Munich and nearly 30 miles north of Salzburg.His father, Alois Hitler (1837–1903), was a mid-level customs official. Born out of wedlock to Maria Anna Schickelgruber in 1837, Alois Schickelgruber changed his name in 1876 to Hitler, the Christian name of the man who married his mother five years after his birth. Alois Hitler's illegitimacy would cause speculation as early as the 1920s—and still present in popular culture today—that Hitler's grandfather was Jewish. Credible evidence to support the notion of Hitler's Jewish descent has never turned up. The two most likely candidates to have been Hitler's grandfather are the man who married his grandmother and that man's brother.LINZ  In 1898, the Hitler family moved to Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. Seeking a career in the visual arts, Hitler fought bitterly with his father, who wanted him to enter the Habsburg civil service. After his father's death, Hitler eventually persuaded his mother, Klara Hitler, née Pölzl, to permit him to pursue his dream to become an artist. As she lay dying of breast cancer in the autumn of 1907, Hitler took the entrance exam to the Vienna Academy of the Arts and failed to gain acceptance. In early 1908, some weeks after Klara's death in December 1907, Hitler moved to Vienna, ostensibly in the hope of renewing efforts to win acceptance in the Academy of Arts.VIENNA  Hitler lived in Vienna between February 1908 and May 1913. He had grown up in a middle-class family, with relatively few contacts with Jewish people, in a region of the Habsburg state in which many German nationalists had been disappointed that the German Empire founded in 1871 had not included the German-speaking regions of the Habsburg Monarchy. Yet the legacy of the Vienna years is not as clear as Hitler depicted it in his political autobiography. His impoverishment and residence in homeless shelters began only a year after his arrival and after he had frittered away a generous inheritance left by his parents and rejected all arguments of surviving relatives and family friends that he embark upon a career in the civil service.By the end of 1909, Hitler knew real poverty as his sources of income dried up. That winter, however, helped briefly by a last gift from his aunt, he began to paint watercolor scenes of Vienna for a business partner and made enough to live on until he departed for Munich in 1913. It is likely that Hitler experienced and possible that he shared the general antisemitism common among middle-class German nationalists. Nevertheless, he had personal and business relationships with Jews in Vienna and was, at times, dependent in part on Jews for his living. This may have been a cause for discretion about his actual feelings about Jews. It was not until after World War I that Hitler can be demonstrated to have adopted an “antisemitic” ideology.INFLUENCES UPON HITLER IN VIENNA  Hitler was genuinely influenced in Vienna by two political movements. The first was the German racist nationalism propagated by the Upper Austrian Pan-German politician Georg von Schönerer. The second key influence was that of Karl Lueger, Mayor of Vienna from 1897 to his death in 1910.Still in power when Hitler arrived in Vienna, Lueger promoted an antisemitism that was more practical and organizational than ideological. Nevertheless, it reinforced anti-Jewish stereotypes and cast Jews as enemies of the German middle and lower classes. Finally, unlike Schönerer, who was always more comfortable with the elitist nationalism of the student fraternities, Lueger was comfortable with big city crowds and knew how to channel their protest into political gain. Hitler drew his ideology in large part from Schönerer, but his strategy and tactics from Lueger.			"

												Much like the actual Garfield comic strips, this is yet another Garfield product that would be improved without Garfield.(The actual racing is okay but bland enough that it's a generic mobile kart racer with Garfield themes weirdly slapped on. It's not the trainwreck you're hoping for or anything beyond slightly competent. It's just below par.)			"

												IntroductionThis is the first game I've ever had the urge to write a formal review for. That may be because I enjoyed it much much more than I expected, or because I struggle with it, even as someone who's played 'hardcore' games for a very long time. This game is well worth your money.Rating10/10. Great combat, though a little stiff, great story and atmosphere. Well worth the money.In DetailGarfield Kart is an incredibly difficult, incredibly punishing game about discovery and chaotic, blood-pumping combat. To this day, I have only discovered a total of three games that give me an unforgettable adrenaline rush in the combat: Rust, Dark Souls, and Garfield Kart. It is not a game you will understand within an hour, or maybe even two. It took me just under three hours to get the full grasp of the combat, and to become a competent player. You will get angry. Garfield Kart is much like Dark Souls in atmosphere and writing style, in that nothing is handed to you through the story, you piece it together through parchment and books scattered all over the dungeon the game takes place in.Garfield Kart is also said to be part of a larger project known as Sui Generis, been in development since November 2014 if I'm correct, and for a prototype, it's incredibly well done. Although the animations and combat movement seem a bit stiff, it is still incredibly satisfying. Garfield Kart has, probably the most satisfying combat in any game I've played. The physics-based gameplay make it possible to knock an enemy off their feet with a high-impact weapon, or occasionaly tangle yourself into them so much that they are knocked off their feet. Nothing is more satisfying than smacking someone in the face with a sledgehammer and seeing them topple to the ground in Garfield Kart.This is all said with only barely mentioning the writing - which has a very admirable air of mystery and some, more subtle horror elements to it. It's dark, gritty and bloody, and incredibly interesting. It's unfortunate I didn't know that you could interact with items in the environment until a few hours into play.Top notch work, one of my favourite  games to date.			"

												I wanted to love this game when I got it. Unfortunately, love only really turned into kind of like. I do enjoy the game play. The carts are pretty easy to control. Their movements are not difficult. It is very reminiscent of Mario Kart, which is what I was hoping for. So in that respect, I am happy. You get power ups that effect you in different ways. In addition, you get power ups that you can throw at others, or drop behind you, again, just like Mario Kart. For that reason, I do recommend the game, for game play, and nastalgia. With that said, there are several negatives which made me no love this game.1--Music cannot be turned off. Turn off the music, you turn off all the sound effects. They are not seperate from one another.2--The cart does NOT make sounds. The only sounds that the cart makes is if you skid. To me, this reduces much of the fun of this game. A simple engine sound, with excelleration sounds and deceleration would make me LOVE this game. Unfortunately, it really falls short. I know, engine sound doesn't seem like a major deal. But, when you are playing a game that has a motorized vehicle in it, if that vehicle has no motor, and all you have is this heavily anooying music, it gets lame fast.3--The settings screen, from what I have seen, does not really have any settings.4--My game played in a small windowSo would I recommend this game? Yes, but barely. Would I recommend paying full price for this game? Absolutely not!			"

												“The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black God, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry. For the Initiates, this is not a person, but a force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or free will. They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the mythologic and horned form of the God Pan; thence the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the light bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend”.Albert Pike Morals and Dogma, Ancient and Accepted Rite of Free Masonry written and published in 1871. Plagiarized from History of Magic published in 1860 written by Eliphas Levi, born Alphonse Louis Constant. Here is his version of the paragraph:“According to the Kabalists, the true name of Satan is that of Yahveh reversed, for Satan is not a black god but the negation of Deity. He is the personification of Atheism and Idolatry. The devil is not a personality for initiates but a force created with a good object, though it can be applied to evil: it is really the instrument of liberty. They represented this force, which presides over physical generation, under the mythological figure of the horned god Pan, and hence comes the goat of the Sabbath, brother of the old Serpent, the light-bearer or phosphorus, converted by poets into the false Lucifer of the legend”.“Science is the highest form of Satanism”.“Hate those that earn it, as you would love those that earn it. As Above, so below”.“When the world is viewed with no set reality, the lies of society are revealed and the bonds of slavery, broken”.– Rev. Michael S. Margolin“93, a Satanist by definition, which admittedly is a term that varies widely, is a rebellious soul in defiance of everything that he or she opposes that restricts them. The only sin of a Thelemite is ‘restriction’ which is why I’ve always argued that we are in a sense a satanic breed. So, in my thinking, ‘Thelema’ and ‘Santanism’ are kindred souls, both questing for the same thing, i.e. Freedom from slave gods. So it would be redundant to use both terms together, no? However, if you define “Thelemic Satanist” as a person who thinks the modern Thelemic movement has sold itself out and gone wishy-washy-white-Light on us, then by all means use both terms to imply your defiance to those Thelemites who act more like closet Christians than soldiers of Freedom. In other words, “Thelemic Satanist” could then imply a rebellious Thelemite fighting against those who use the name (i.e. Thelemite) but act more like the slave gods imposing restriction on our Creed. The bottom line, to use the phrase or not – there is no law but do what thou wilt! 93 93/93”.                     -Jerry Edward Cornelius, current head of the A:.A:. – Astrum Argentum  Grady Louis McMurtry Lineage.

												Garfield Kart is an exceptional, beautiful, breathtaking experience that will leave you asking for more. I will never forget the time played on this stunning game as I will remember it as one of the greatest games of my time. I am truly in shock at the lore of the game as it takes you on a journey that will forever be with you as the years past. It was a massive pleasure playing this robustful game. 11/10 amazing experience.Just kidding it was pure garbage 1/10 lmao			"

You can choose from laods of characters, cars, tracs, etc., the graphics and sound are great and it's the sort of game you can pick up any time and get straight in to the action without faffing around.

												I wanted to love this game when I got it. Unfortunately, love only really turned into kind of like. I do enjoy the game play. The carts are pretty easy to control. Their movements are not difficult. It is very reminiscent of Mario Kart, which is what I was hoping for. So in that respect, I am happy. You get power ups that effect you in different ways. In addition, you get power ups that you can throw at others, or drop behind you, again, just like Mario Kart. For that reason, I do recommend the game, for game play, and nastalgia. With that said, there are several negatives which made me no love this game.1--Music cannot be turned off. Turn off the music, you turn off all the sound effects. They are not seperate from one another.2--The cart does NOT make sounds. The only sounds that the cart makes is if you skid. To me, this reduces much of the fun of this game. A simple engine sound, with excelleration sounds and deceleration would make me LOVE this game. Unfortunately, it really falls short. I know, engine sound doesn't seem like a major deal. But, when you are playing a game that has a motorized vehicle in it, if that vehicle has no motor, and all you have is this heavily anooying music, it gets lame fast.3--The settings screen, from what I have seen, does not really have any settings.4--My game played in a small windowSo would I recommend this game? Yes, but barely. Would I recommend paying full price for this game? Absolutely not!			"

												GOTY 2016-2020 I had so much fun jumping while wanting to drift and bumping into invisible walls. The port is pretty decent. You can get 24-54 FPS with a GTX 770 and a i5 4570, so I think you cant moan. The graphics are top notch. In some situations the game looks even better than Witcher 3. Of courede there are some small issues like constantly not loading backgrounds or textures, but that's not to bad I guess. The gameplay is very easy to learn, but hard to master. There are currently 35 maps with infinite ways to solve them. The puzzles are unique,  challengin and very creative. The story about an italian cat searching for his princess seems a bit ripped off, but it is very well executed and even brought some tears to my eyes. Definitely worth the 10$.			"

												This game claims to have partial controller support. Now, imagine there is a god who is called the Steam Controller. Gaben is his son, so he is our Jesus. Now imagine all the people in the land bow to this religion. Mostly everyone in the enitre universe loves this God. They pray and worship, and then the day comes. To present the honor of being the new re-incarnation of God onto a mortal, because they are worried of the people no longer having faith in the Steam Controller and his son Gaben. Now imagine if this game is a nonbeliever. And no one knew until they passed down the honor of becoming worshiped to this game.There is no support. There is no God.But at least I got in when it was on sale. :)			"

												I don’t get what ppl are all about. Yeah, day 1 was bad, but so was day 1-10 on every other MMORPG and those were releases and not early access. Fair enough, people complain, but here you have developers all over the place answering to people and telling them what is going on and why. Some of the big ones could learn a thing or two here. The patch helped a lot, I can log in without any problems and can play the game. OMG I had to wait 1 day and imagine that, the world didnt end.I played a bit and I like what I see. There is a lot to improve, but that is early access for you. I am surprised how they discuss changes with us and for once take us serious, not that marketing works as intended BS.			"

Even paired with 2 titan x's you still would struggle to get more than 26fps on very low 640*480. So if you like having the all of the types of cancer you might aswell get this game as you will die anyway. I on the other hand, quite enjoy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ existence so i will refund this ♥♥♥ munching ♥♥♥♥ storm that they had the cheek to charge me £3.99 for, so i don't use up all my benefits for the month.Furthermore the controls feel like having your ♥♥♥♥ stuck in a cows ear and trying to rid it on the m5, if you ask me thats not a good time. And who the actual ♥♥♥♥ thinks that it is a good idea to not be able to change the controls in game, for ♥♥♥♥ sake games from the 80's had better menues than this. Moreover the nob gobbling ♥♥♥♥ prick waffles who put together this game blatantly ripped of nintendo. For goodness sake, even the ♥♥♥♥♥ music speeds up at the third round.Lastly, did i mention that this crusty nipple sniffing abortion has micro-transactions, i can't even be botherd to cough up the words to describe this ♥♥♥♥ so ill leave it up you the reader to figure out.So, in conclusion, buy this game. You will not know the pain I went through playin this thing, it can only be expressed with a first hand experience, a lot like the vietnam war.Nik out , ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Garfield Kart is nothing more than a little time waster.I would only recommend this game for it's $5 price tag as nothing more than an evening diversion.Otherwise, most of it is decent at best.Buy a good kart racer with actual multiplayer if you're going to throw $5 away.Donate that $5 to charity or something.For a Full review, you can check me out here:

												This to me is a remake of Mario Karting on an old 64. Jump and slide for boost and collect weapons to use during the race. Same ase mario kart just the drivers, cars, weapons, and levels are different. I have played with both a keyboard and a steam controller and I do have to say once you set up you controller, thats the way to play the game. Charchters were done really well and so were the levels. Not the most detailed work but its for a cartoon game so the graphic quality is quite nice. Just dont get irritated like I did when it seems like every other car is faster. Its because they are and you need to utilize your boosts and weapons to come out on top in the end. I give this game a 7 out of 10 because they sould have made this game with FULL controller support.			"

												Looking for that purr-fect kart racer? Look no further than Garfield Kart! If you're a fan of a certain lasagna-loving, Monday-hating tubby fella (and who isn't!) then you owe it to yourself to check this little under-the-radar gem out. Sure, the production value isn't quite up to par with that of another well-known kart racer that, let's be honest, is becoming a little long in the tooth, but the sheer amount of enthusiasm the developers have for our favorite feline franchise is evident in every nook and cranny of this lovingly crafted title. Beautiful 1080p graphics and a whimsical color pallete bring Garfield's world to fluid, 60-fps life and it's a truly sublime experience to finally race through the environments that Jim Davis let us escape to for so many years. The power up items are all clever nods to the comic - Garfield's favorite pasta dish (if you're a true fan, enough said on what this could be!) allows him and his friends to perform heart-pounding, tooth gritting boosts to the karts - as well as to the player's heart rate as the adrenaline starts to surge! The famous (or infamous?...) spring is also present, enabling players to finally re-enact all of their favorite spring-related antics from the comic strip. Character and kart customization options allow for endless replayablility, plus playing dress-up with our furry friends is a joy in and of itself (ever wish you could just slap a chef's hat on Odie? Wish no more, your prayers have been answered!).I could go on, but hopefully if you've read this far I've already convinced you to give this game a shot. If you have even the slightest interest in Garfield, Kart racing, or video games in general then don't let this one pass you by!			"

												I love my man Garfield, but he did not want me to enjoy his game. I wanted to play with keyboard controls. However, no matter what I mapped it to Garfield came out of his food coma and was like ""no ♥♥♥♥♥ you're playing with these controls, you piece of ♥♥♥♥. You make Monday's look like heaven on earth you little ♥♥♥♥♥."" His words. So after about 20 minutes of me uncontrollably sobbing, I just used a controller. It was some of the worst handling I've ever dealt with. Garfield then got extremely livid with me not enjoying his game and got very violent with me. I was able to escape to my mother's house with only a black eye and the clothes on my back. I'm filing for divorce as I write this review, I'm safe now. Do not buy this game, do not support this monster. Don't even watch reruns of the Garfield show, Garfield & Friends was far superior!

												Family Guy is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series, with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.Since its debut on January 31, 1999, 282 episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast. Its fifteenth season began on September 25, 2016. Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons.Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.A spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. ""The Simpsons Guy"", a crossover episode with The Simpsons, aired on September 28, 2014.[2] Family Guy is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.[3] In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.[4]			"

												The September 11 attacks (also referred to as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda on the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks killed 2,996 people, injured over 6,000 others, and caused at least $10 billion in property and infrastructure damage and $3 trillion in total costs. Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines) — all of which departed from airports on the northeastern United States bound for California — were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed, with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, initially was steered toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. It was the deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers[5] in the history of the United States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively.

It was the deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively. The destruction of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets, closing Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One World Trade Center began at the World Trade Center site. The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014. Numerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

												rather terrible.- Single player only. for a mario kart game clone. Dont expect this game to last long. You will get bored after a cople of hours.- Gamepad (MS x-box 360 was tested) only works in a race. In the main menu you have to SLIDE with your mouse (when there is a list of options to choose from). Like its some sort of mobile game port.- Hats to wear. (and unlock). WHY??? Is this a F2P game?- You have to buy ANYTHING with the coins. you just have 2 cars and 2 persons. The rest should be unlocked. (hats too). - spoilers that add speed/and other stats... IMO very cheap and uncreative implementetaion of a game's progress.TLDR: dont bother. The AI is simple, and there is no multiplayer at all. I know the game looks fun and promising, but that will last for 2 hours max. This game is unfinished and is not worth money at all.The devs spend developing time on something that doesnt matters like hats but didnt even added local co-op. Something that would add a huge value to the game.Why?			"

												I've seen things. Horrible things. But nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is more terrifying than this. I would rather have to watch Pluto Nash and play Sonic 06 while drinking bleach and having my wrists slit than have to endure one more second of this game. It was made as a sick practical joke by the Nazis to try and cause mass suicied. I am currently holding a noose while writing this review. I've never wanted to hang myself this badly ever since I played No Man's Sky, but now, I don't think I have any other option.			"

												Garfield Kart is a poorly optimised mobile port of a Mario Kart knockoff, and it does absolutely nothing well. The tracks are not interesting, there is a complete lack of multiplayer (the only thing that would actually make this game enjoyable in my opinion) and honestly, the game has an unpolished feel that really makes it clear that it was never intended for the desktop.I do not recommend.

												Game of the decade for me, within the ranks of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Half Life 2, and Grand Theft Auto V. Where do I begin? The stunning visuals make it difficult for my GTX 970 to maintain 60fps when I am boosting past my opponents. The 4k textures really shine in this game with thorough detail through and through. The plot of the story makes the campaign a joy to play, I constantly wondered what was going to happen next and couldn't put the game down for weeks after launch. For its low entry cost, you owe yourself as a gamer to buy this game, you will not be disappointed. 100/100. Perfect.			"

												Are you looking for the perfect game?Have you not been able to find it?Have you even searched on that sh*thole called Origin?You just want the best game out there?Then look no further.Garfield Kart, is just for you.Developed by Artifacts Studios and published by Microids, Garfield Kart has some stellar gameplay.You will not find a better game than this.I could tell you a whole story of Garfield Kart but that would take to long, so here are the the pros and cons.Pros:- Stunning graphics.- Amazing physics.- Eargasming sound quality.- No lag, even though it looks so good.- The storyline was probably created by George R. R. Martin or Patrick Rothfuss, seeing it is this good.- Easy to understand, though the skillcap is very, very high.- Cheap game.- No P2W aspects.- Fun for young and old.Cons:- No multiplayer.And there you have it. Garfield Kart is a must have for every gamer.Garfield Kart is just a masterpiece, even called a true form of art by some.I rate this game a solid 10/10. And yes, would throw lasagna, again.			"

I had no friends was overweight and ugly. But since ive grinded in this game for over 2k hours I have become a better man. And i've learned to love everything and accept everyone for who they are and what they do. I love almost everything in the world besides bad people. And I am now a 230lb 6'2 Alpha Male and jacked, ive also gotten a wife since playing this game and now we have two kids one named Jared From Subway, and the other Tyler Mutha ♥♥♥♥♥ 1.

												The Pope's movement took its first public shape at the Council of Piacenza, where, in March 1095, Urban II received an ambassador from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos asking for help against Muslim (Seljuk) Turks who had taken over most of formerly Byzantine Anatolia. A great council met, attended by numerous Italian, Burgundian, and French bishops in such vast numbers it had to be held in the open air outside the city of Clermont. Though the Council of Clermont held in November of the same year was primarily focused on reforms within the church hierarchy, Urban II gave a speech on 27 November 1095 to a broader audience. Urban II's sermon proved highly effective, as he summoned the attending nobility and the people to wrest the Holy Land, and the eastern churches generally from the control of the Seljuk Turks.			"

												When I first launched this game, I was given the preparing to launch notification on a loop, wich caused people on my friends list to be barraged with notifications that I was playing garfield cart... After troubleshooting the issue I found out that I had to delete steam and reinstall it, I then proceeded to uninstall steam in the way that also deletes all of my games. ANd when I realunched garfield cart I discovered that the default controls were arrow keys. A quick restart and rebinding later, when I launched the game I had found that the game automapped all of the movement keys to S and A. After repededly rebinding the keys I eventualy got the controls to work properly... until I restarted the game and they had gone back.So this is how I ended up garfield cart being the only game on my computer.... And to top it all off with a crusty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ covered  cherry it dosen't even work... FML			"

												Garfield Minus Garfield (also known as Jon Arbuckle) is a webcomic created by Dan Walsh, a technology manager from Dublin, Ireland,[1] which received considerable attention during 2008. Each strip consists of a reprint of a past episode from the comic strip Garfield, from which all the characters except Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle have been removed through photo manipulation.[2][3] Though Walsh admits that he was not the first to come up with this idea,[4] he was the first to ""champion and popularize"" it.Paws, Inc. publishes an identically named and themed strip on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.[5]Contents  [hide] 1	Content2	Reception3	Publication4	References5	External linksContent[edit]Without the presence of Garfield, the resulting strips consist mostly of Garfield's owner, Jon Arbuckle, interacting with himself, rather than with his pet cat. The strip's website characterizes this result as ""a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb.""[6]Reception[edit]Garfield creator and artist Jim Davis has commented on the webcomic, stating that he is an occasional reader and finds it ""fascinating""[1] and an ""inspired thing to do"".[7]Publication[edit]On October 28, 2008, Ballantine Books released a Garfield Minus Garfield book in full color, with the original comics alongside the ""minused"" ones.[8] It is credited to Jim Davis (who officially sanctioned its publication), with a foreword written by Dan Walsh. Inside the book, however, most of the content is devoted to a section with ""Garfield Minus Garfield Strips by Dan"", followed in the end by ""A word from Jim Davis"" and a small section of Davis' own attempts at making Garfield Minus Garfield strips.[9]Paws, Inc. published its own Garfield Minus Garfield from November 3, 2008 to July 21, 2010, and resumed publishing on April 25, 2012. Unlike Walsh's version, it also includes the original Garfield strip underneath.[5]References[edit]^ Jump up to: a b Doty, Cate (2 June 2008). ""Is the Main Character Missing? Maybe Not"".

												This game is beautiful. I know I don't have much time in in but that time is the best I've ever had in my life. If you don't own this game then kill yourself. I'm being serious. This game is an open world psychological horror game which stars you, Garfield, or Happysedits, a brave cat, but acts as a tiger, going up against the evil John. John will do ANYTHING to just get ahead of you. Amazing story, beautiful atmosphere, and GREAT controls. Unfortunatly it is priced at a high price of $4.99, but it is worth it. Try to pick it up on sale, but if it's not on sale still buy it as soon as possible, even if you know it goes on sale for free tomorrow. BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

												Good and cheap casual game and Fun to play.Also for kids.But there is ONE ANNOYING BUG !When the UFO's grab you and drop you to the ground again here and then there is no way to continue the game.You can not accelerate any more....This is VERY frustating. and you have to exit the race.NOT FUNNY WHEN IN THE FINAL LAP OF THE FOURTH TRACK !FIX IT AND IT's GOOD !
