								BeamNG.drive is a very physics-heavy simulation, utilizing Torque3D and a very accurate, realistic soft-body physics engine. What does this mean for you, however? This game provides stunningly realistic vehicle deformations, much like Rigs of Rods, which BeamNG.drive is based off. BeamNG.drive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator, and it is succeeding. While it is still only in Alpha, I strongly recommend picking this up if you're like me and find pleasure in smashing pickup trucks into small Japanese compact cars.If you wish to own this title, you can order a Steam Alpha key at their website, http://www.beamng.com/ "

								I purchased this game since day 1 and i am very very glad I did. I have seen the development of the game grow from the start. The developers have been amazing keeping us informed of the status of the game with consistant detailed dev blog's.An amazing game with the best physics engine for vehicles out there. From crashes, weight of the vehicle, traction, torque ..... everything is incredibly accurate.There is so much to do with many many hours of fun from using community made mods such as vehicles, maps, objects and much more, cruising around the beautiful maps, re-enacting crash scenes, racing, demoilition derby ..... The list goes on.It may seem as if I have only been on this game for a couple of hours, but I can assure you I have played this game well over 100 hours.			"

								First of all, your search for the ultimate car game/simulator ends RIGHT HERE and RIGHT NOW. I'm serious. No other simulator in history has ever been as realistic as BeamNG.drive. In fact, once this sim gets popular, it could even be used in driving schools! The cars handle, perform, and DEform EXACTLY like their real life counterparts. Behind each car is a revolutionary system of nodes and beams that calculates the deformation of the car's body at 2000 times a second! Not only that, but the windows crack and shatter, and pretty much every part from the headlights to the tailpipes to the fenders to the engine can break off like they would in real life.This is a long, in-depth review, to give you the best idea of what this is.This is an awesome simulator! You can do anything you want with cars, trucks, boats, planes, and drive/fly them as well as smash them, crash them, and drop boulders on them (Yes, I'm not kidding). If you want you can put that 3 foot high spoiler on your 1990 Honda! The base game comes with 13 worlds (aka terrains) to explore, and they range from 1 square kilometer to 4 square kilometers. The developers do, however make them seem much bigger despite their real size. There is also an infinite grid map which is completely flat and empty and the ground is nothing more than a grid. In addition, there are maps created by the community that can be as big as ~350 square kilometers. Once BeamNG's engine gets optimized to the point we can have open world maps, we will start seeing even larger maps.Here are the vehicles included with BeamNG.Also in the base game are 20 fictional vehicles (as of last review update) based off of real-life vehicles, which are FULLY customizable. In addition to in-depth customization, you also get about 10 preset configurations (trims) for every car. You can choose the one you like the most and then add/remove/change the parts on that trim to make it JUST the way you want. Here is the vehicle list:http://wiki.beamng.com/Official_Content#VehiclesAnyway, enough about the content. Let's get into the gameplay and physics.Although for now there is no Career mode, this simulator is still very fun to play. There are scenarios, and they are usually coordinated time trials on a specific course on a specific terrain. Sometimes it is just for fun, like jumping a van off a ramp and landing unscathed. And the physics, oh they will not get any better than this. BeamNG is the most realistic and detailed vehicle simulator to date. It simulates the behavior of vehicles from the glass breaking to the hubcaps falling off. BeamNG uses a unique system for ultra-realistic vehicle behavior that yields a unique gaming experience each time. It uses beams (BEAMng) and nodes to simulate each and every part independently. The nodes connect all of the thousands of beams together, and the beams can deform, bend, and break. There are no predefined damage models. The node and beam system calculates the damage on any one section of the car. For example, if you slide past a wall in a Need For Speed game, with the front facing it slightly more than the back, the windows will probably shatter and then there will be paint scratches on random places of the car. Let's slide past that same wall in BeamNG. The mirror fell off and there is a dent in the front bumper EXACTLY where the car contacted the wall. Also a hubcap most likely fell off if the car had plastic rims.If all that isn't enough, there is a big community on the BeamNG forums cranking out mods frequently. There are about 50 extra vehicles for download at the time of this writing and well over 75 terrains. About the devs, they're on it with a big update at least every month. In just about a year we have gotten from version 0.4 all the way to 0.6.And, finally, let's talk customization. Let's take the D-15 for example. For this single vehicle, you can customize the paint job, the tow hitch, the type of engine (I6 or V8), supercharger, lights, color, bumper type and color, suspension, body, and even the light bar to name a few. So the bottom line is, this game offers more customization options than any other driving game currently on the market.I hope this review was helpful to any new BeamNG players. Enjoy this wonderful game!			"

Introduction BeamNG.drive is a realistic soft-body physics simulator developed by BeamNG. BeamNG.drive not only lets you drive realistic cars, it also lets you crash them into each other! While the racing may not appeal to those who don’t use a wheel, the game’s awesome physics can be easily enjoyed using a gamepad or even a keyboard. It’s worth mentioning I’m in the camp of mainly crashing things into each other so I won’t focus so much on anything more heavily related to racing.While I’ve only recently received the game I have been following its progress for around a year and it has received regular updates during that time. Obviously it’s still not a finished product but what’s already in the game is good and if the devs continue working on the game it’s only going to get better.Full Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.Presentation As you’d expect from a realistic simulator, it’s a good looking game. Of course it’s not to the point of being photo-realistic but everything looks good enough in the game to make it feel about as real as a simulator can be. The UI and menus are absolutely spot on for the game, the speedometer is usually the only visible UI element and it’s only visible when you’re using the third person camera, it’s out of the way otherwise which certainly helps your driving if you’re just smashing things into each other. The menus are simple and easy to use and even when you’re using the menu you can still see most of the screen (which is good because you’ll occasionally want to be editing your option while playing the game, for example if you want to increase gravity while you’re mid-air to utterly obliterate your car).Gameplay BeamNG.drive’s two (current) game modes are Scenarios and Free Roam with a Career mode coming soon. The Scenario game mode features pre-made scenarios from the developers themselves as well as any user made scenarios that you download from the BeamNG website. Generally these scenarios are either races or car tests but some of them are a little more exciting (not to say the others aren’t fun) such as scenarios where you drive a police car and you have to stop a speeding vehicle. The Free Roam mode is pretty much self-explanatory, you can choose one of the game’s eleven maps with any of the game’s thirteen vehicles. You can also use other in-game objects here too like a giant hamster wheel or a canon. Free Roam is where you’ll be making your own scenarios if you’re so inclined but as far as I can tell you need the Scenario editing mod from the website to do this. But if you don’t want to make your own scenarios it can be a lot of fun to just drive your car around one of the Island maps or smash it into things in the gridmap full of ramps and other fun things. Realism Realism is of course the most important part of a simulation game and, as far as I can tell, BeamNG.drive is pretty realistic. Now it is worth mentioning that I don’t drive and I’ve never seen a real car crash but I reckon I’ve got enough experience as a passenger and as someone who has a decent knowledge of physics to comment on this aspect of the game. Of course it’s hard to tell when playing with a gamepad rather than a wheel but vehicle handling seems pretty solid. As far as I know there’s no traction control for the vehicles in the game so things do get a little bit skiddy from time to time but the cars all feel pretty weighty (apart from the three wheel Pigeon of course). The soft body physics are out of this world good, I don’t think I’ve come across a game with better. Obviously slamming things into each other looks good but it’s when you misjudge a corner and go head on into a tree that you really see just how powerful the engine is.


Well that's one way to stop a car

By: Kemo




Miscellaneous When in Free Roam you have control over environmental variables such as time of day and gravity and in both Free Roam and Scenarios you’re able to slow down time up to 100x.All thirteen vehicles have several different pre-made configurations but you can customize the cars with parts and paint jobs as well as then save whatever you make to be used in future.The game ran really well for me despite the fact that I have a pretty weak GPU.There’s not a huge amount of ‘defined’ content right now so if you’re not the kind of person who can make their own fun in a sandbox game then you may wish to hit the follow button instead of buying the game for the time being. Just to be clear, there’s probably a good few hours of scenarios The engine sounds didn’t sound too realistic to me but that may just be from a lack of car knowledge rather than the sounds being unrealistic. It turns out that these sound effects are simply placeholders for the time being. The crashing sound effects are reasonably good but if you’re hitting things for a prolonged period of time it seems the sound effects are only audible from time to time rather than every time there’s a collision.While the vehicles in the game aren’t ‘real’ makes and models they are all based on real vehicles.Verdict Worth Purchasing.  (If you like Sandbox physics games)BeamNG.drive may be lacking in 'defined' content but it more than makes up for it with its incredibly realistic soft body physics and good graphics. If you want a realistic driving sim or you just want to crash things into each other then chances are you’ll enjoy this game!No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			"

								A review is nothing if it isn't helpful, so let's get down to brass tacks. At the moment, you should know BeamNG is not a game.  It's at best a sandbox title with most of the necessary content missing.  Its far better to say at the moment that its a game engine looking for a game.  But what a game engine ...The content, as it stands, offers you the chance to drive round a handful of locations.  Thanks to Johnny3600 who points out that this game uses Torque3D as an engine, not the CryEngine as I first thought (though the backgrounds are very Far Cry - think tropical, vegetation, poorish roads), but critically are quite large and varied.  So you can expect well-made tarmacked roads to ring islands, with grotty little dirt tracks in the centre often leading to ledges, mountains etc.  The vehicles are mostly regular cars (I believe generic models), including pickups and a Rig.  Don't expect forumula 1 cars, this is a far more everyday selection of vehicles.So far it all sounds uninspiring.  What makes it so good?  Well, the physics engine effectively makes it a crash simulator.  Every piece of each car is detailed to give it form, bendableness, weight and mass, etc.  When assembled they work as a real car would, but when you come into contact with something they all crush, get displaced and generally smash up most convincingly.  On its own its not enough to make a car game, but when its combined with a very satisfying feeling of driving you have a potential monster hit.In a word, what we have here is the beauty of mathematics, cutting edge in all its glory, put to use to smash things up.  It's fantastic, rewarding, enormous fun to drive, and best of all utterly convincing.  I've crashed enough in this game to know that you don't want to fishtail and clip the rear of your car if you're going to crash in real life because the loss of control is horrendous (as in how a certain English ex-Princess met her fate).  You stand a far better chance of survival just going head on with an object despite the g-forces (with a seatbelt, of course.)  Trust me, the first time you crash a car in this game, the sense of emotional trauma in the silence that follows is palpable.So there it is.  A few cars, some nice locations, and nothing to do.  All dressed up and nowhere to go.  I'm not even sure that anyone knows exactly how it will all end up when it finally becomes a game.  There are experiments with car chases, and there's always the prospect of multiplayer, but frankly it doesn't lend itself to the usual genres of car games.  You just have to buy it on faith at the moment, but its still immensely enjoyable.Crazikyle points out that there are lots of MODs available right now and for many people this is a deal breaker.  I'm no expert on MODs, so by all means anyone who has some to recommend should add them to the bottom of the review in the comments section.  I want to make this review as helpful as possible, and if you folks can help do that by contributing suggestions then please go right ahead and do so.One more thought to leave you with: I've played some excellent racing games including iRacer, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, etc.  None of them feel like you are driving an organic, real-world machine quite the way that BeamNG does.  The cars in BeamNG are made of assembled pieces, and the pieces shake and rattle and bounce under the torque and forces just like a real car.  Other developers  'pretend' their cars are real by suggesting movement and bounce, but only BeamNG has the sense that you have a real, honest-to-God vehicle glued to your throttle pedal.If that isn't enough to pique your interest, may I suggest a nice game of Scrabble?

YouTube™ Video: BeamNG.Drive - Logitech G27 Picture-in-Picture - Touring Small Island in the 4x4 Manual Pickup 

			Views: 23,055		

			I see a lot of people asking about the Logitech G27 and how it works with this game, so I decided to show you first hand!		

When I played the game with my X-360 controller, I thought it was neat. The damage physics, the way the suspension moves, the way the body rolls with bumps is just amazing. This game has the best soft-body physics I've seen in any game. When I really fell in love with the game, as you can see in the above video, is when I hooked my Logitech G27 up to it. Wow! The off-road handling is fantastic with a wheel. In my mind, this game is the spiritual successor to the original 1nsane. Of course it doesn't have any of the game modes (it is in alpha) but I've never had this much fun driving off road in a game before. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes driving off-road, and has an FFB wheel laying around. You dont need a G27 to enjoy the game, even a $50 Driving Force Pro would work great with it.In addition to all the above, the game has a strong, and quickly growing mod community. The first video I have listed below uses a Crown Vic police car mod that I downloaded from the official game forums.

								After 500 and a half hours of pure enjoyment, I believe it's safe to say this is one of the most robust soft-body physics simulation out there to date. I highly (almost offensivly) recommend this game to anyone looking for a in-depth vehicle simulation. The Devs push out an update once a month (I should mention some are delayed, but its worth the awesome content) which is quite rare now-a-days. I also should mention there is a great fan base with amazing forums, also can't forget the spectacular community mods that are out there. Cheers.Edit: I'm here to update my review as I now have clocked 700 hours! Yes that is correct, I managed to find something to do on this game for 700 hours exact. My original review still stands, one of the few games that fits all my desires involving automobiles! Amazing simulation an soft-body physics. I highly recommend this.			"

								This is one amazing game, and it is pushing the edges of soft-body physics. I've been playing this game since almost right after it came out. This isn't any arcade car crashing simulator, this is a PHYSICS ENGINE used as a car game. Think about this type of technology used to make fully destructible worlds in game games. Think about playing GTA 8 and crashing your car into a building to see it fall over. Anyways, I am getting a bit carried away, here are some pros and cons of this game.Pros:Amazing physicsPlenty of modsVery detailed mapsNice graphicsForumsOh wait.. this game is still in Alpha..Cons:Sort of un-polishedLess free-time cause this game is just too awesome...I recommend this game to anyone looking for a realistic car crashing simulator.If you're looking for an arcade car crashing game, I would recommend Next Car Game.Have fun crashing!

								Wow! I'm truly amazed at how detailed and realistic this game is. Ever since I joined BeamNG It's been mind blowingly improved and constantly recieving info from the devs. And you can do whatever you want, racing, or stacking semi's onto each other!Pros: Extremely detailed simulation.Very open world, nothing you can't do.Customization.A huge modding cummunity.Racing.Being able to do what ever you want.Cons:Early Access means bugs, but they're always quickly fixed.No multiplayer.

								TL;DR: Get it. DO IT.This is the game I've dreamed about as a destructive child, a simple child, melting my match box cars with gasoline. I grew up playing with Crash Test Dummies. I've played every system since Atari. I have waited decades for a game like this. Bunout series, Destruction Derby series, Vigilante 8 series, Route 66, and ""Next Car Game,""- Nothing compares to this. Yes, I know those games are different genres, but nontheless... You know what? Maybe I am overzealous. Or maybe, just maybe, this is what I've been waiting on for my whole gaming life. All I can say is, if this game wasn't touched again by developers, if this was the final product: I'd pay $100 for it. I may trade my Xbox One for it (Rare Replay included).  I was uneasy purchasing the early access but BeamNG.drive called out to me, I could not wait, and the positive reviews after the update were the final straw. I am 31 years old. Thirty one people. I may be too old to get one off when VR porn comes into full futrition, but at least I can say, I have experienced my gaming destiny: BeamNG.drive. Developers: I love you.			"

								Perfect game for any car fan, regardless of age. There's not a whole lot of fancy graphics, no lens flares, relatively simple smoke/dust effects, most foliage (except trees) are made of flat textures (which are pretty well done, you can't really tell unless you stop and zoom right in on the grass, looks fine if you're driving even at low speeds), and the shaders aren't modified to give a 'cinematic look'. So this game isn't an astonishingly pretty game. But you know what, that's okay.Each vehicle is intricately modelled, down to the point where you can see each individual part of the engine. You can see the butterfly valves on your supercharged V8 muscle car, you can see the engine block move around in its mounts slightly as you rev the engine. The level of detail is insane. Hit a harsh bump that bottoms out your custom, lowered car? Be prepared to potentially have your entire exhaust system ripped out of your car. Hit a sharp kerb at high speed? Might wanna watch your tires, they can pop, giving your car an unnatural feel. The physical damage in this game is brutally realistic, as each car is not 'hard-coded' with performance stats, health points, etc. Each INDIVIDUAL PART of a car makes up it's whole performance, much like a real car. Pop your front-right tire, and your car will start veering slightly to the right. Fit sport tires, you might be able to handle a corner slightly faster. Lower your suspension, you'll reduce body rolls and keep all 4 tires on the road better, resulting in better grip.It goes on and on. The soft-body physics overall are brilliant, the cars crumple, wobble, and react exactly how you'd expect a car to react.Maps:The maps that come with the game are very nice, and quite varied.Gridmap: A testing map, with an assortment of jumps, surface types (from sand and dirt to mud and water), slalom cones, objects to crash into and a few high-speed race courses.Port: A small map set on a port, a perfect map for Gymkhana or drifting fans, with all kinds of shipping containers, warehouses, and a few ramps along with it. Industrial Site: A medium sized map set on a seaside industrial area, it features a RallyCross track with multiple configurations, an offroad racing track laced with thick mud that will bog down your average rally car, but take a big 4x4 and you'll plow straight on through, and a more traditional tarmac race course. The industrial area also features many warehouses like the Port map, and a nice little circuit that races around it, featuring a jump over a small inlet.East Coast USA: Set in the East Coast of the USA (As the nae suggests), it has a medium-sized town, along with fairly well maintained roads, that go from the coast to snaking through the forest. Lots of dirt trails through fields and woodlands for rallying around too.Jungle Rock Island: On a Tropical Island, this map has poorly-maintained roads that call for terrifying high-speed driving along the coastline of this island. It also has many offroad dirt trails that run through the forest, and can quite easily end up getting you lost! There's also a few little rally trails, and industrial areas, quarries, and a port. Probably my favourite map.Cliff: Spawns you in at the top of a cliff, the only way around is down the cliff. Fun little map for just throwing stuff of cliffs and watching it arrive at the bottom as a mangled mess. Not much to the map other than that, but still fun nonetheless.Hirochi Raceway: A race-focused map, this raceway is GP-styled, with very wide, smooth corners, along with fast straights and chicanes thrown in. This map also has a few forest routes, that can take you on a narrow road through some forests, so any mistakes can be fatal.So, quite a few maps, with lots of variety.ScenariosThe game has a wide variety of scenarios, too many to list here, that cover multiple fun aspects of the game.These can range from tutorials, to shakedowns of various cars, police chases, races, delivery challenges, even a 'hyper-miling' challenge where you have to cross Jungle Rock Island with very little gas left in your car. There's even a demolition derby scenario for people to 'party play'.Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10, I'd like to see networked multiplayer (something the BeamNG devs might implement if their engine can support it) and a campaign mode (which the devs have planned pretty much since day 1 of the project)Lots more potential, the modding community is great, who make new maps, scenarios, vehicles, etc, etc. Definitely worth the buy, especially for car fans, IMO.

								// BeamNG.drive is a 3D Racing Simulator: //// Schuitje82 - Extended Review //When I made this review the game had been released in Early Access.There is no influence from the maker due to a free key or any other reasons.Title: BeamNG.driveGenre: Race, Simulator,Developer: BeamNG 	Release date: 29 mei 2015 (Early Access)Why I wanted it, and maybe you will too?===============================Personally I love race / car simulator video games.If it's a racing game like Forza or a Sandbox simulator I want to play them all.I've watched some movies and reviews about this game and wanted to know for myself what this game is all about.Yes it's a simulator and oh yeah.... you can crash your car and it’sreally AWESOME!Still, I wanted to try it myself and make a review about it.Core Gameplay:============This is a pure simulator, so if you are looking for a racing game, maybe this is also something for you.You have some different modes to choose from, like Scenarios such as Freeroaming.Scenarios are  for the people who like to have a goal while they play around with the simulator.I must say there are really very many modes made for you to try.For example: Road Race, Jumps, Full Circuit Racing, Rally Croos Long Courses, Destruction Derby (multiplayer) and much more!The Free roaming is really cool for the player who likes to drive around the levels the Dev's made for us.You can choose already from 10 massive levels that you can drive and play through with all the cars that are ready to pickup from the car list.If you think, “What kind of levels?’ for example:You can choose from giant cliff, Derby Arena, Small Island, USA; and East Cost, USA as a Raceway to go high speed.So these modes give you many hours of fun and in the future they will add campaigns for more ways to play.Last option and I think the coolest is the ""Add Content"" option.What makes this game really cool is that you can add your own levels and mods to it that other people have built for us.Check the MOD section on the online website to see all the crazy and cool things other people have made for this awesome game.http://www.beamng.com/resources/?ingame=2I geot excited after every page seeing what all people have made for this great sanbox simulator !!Graphics:========The first thing that makes this a nice simulator is the graphical part. (In my opinion.)Everything looks really amazing and that was the first thing i noticed about the game that made me want to try it.Not only the roads, but even the tree's a looking amazing. What appeals to me most is the car detail!For example the car interior, engine, and everything else looks really amazing,.aAnd let’s not forget about the damage that can be done to your car!If you crash into a tree, your car’s hood folds like a piece of paper.I think they did a really great job with this aspect of the game!The onOnly thing I think is annoying sometimes: with a small crash even when there isn’t any huge physical damage, your car can get stuck and not be moved / driven.Controls:=======I played the game with my keayboard as well as my Xbox 360 Wireless controller.I can recommend the controller because you have more feeling with it.For example, make sure to remember that  when you take a turn, sometimes your car brakes out and with a controller it is much easier to control and recover the car.I'm happy with the dev's choice for controller support because many games I play in early access does not support this.The cars feltels really weird in the beginning when I played the game, only after some time did I get used to it.Every car feels slightly different, which and still makes it fun to play and try every car that I can choosice from.They did a really good job with the different roads, likeand I mean is whean you go offroad racing.Multiplayer:=========Still this is a early access game, but there are some crazy co-op local co-op things to do.Like destructiiton derby, that is a lot of fune to play with up to 4 players local.I hope the Dev's can add online multiplayer modesmode to this, so we can all drive all together!.Overall:======This a really fun and well madegood and fun Car simulator where  you can have hours of fun!.TheGame game wais only released infrom 2015 and there are allready so many community mods we can try out!.It's a nice project with very much potential to it.... so Dev's keep up the good work.I give this Simulator a 9/10 score.A job well done !!== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==			"

Early Access Review
								Quick Summary:  BeamNG.drive was a surprise find for me.  It's an ambitious game that replicates realism and simulation on levels that other well known sim racers can't currently compete with.  It isn't without faults, of course, and there are areas where the immersion is broken.  However, I think a lot of this will eventually be addressed before the game actually releases.  There's a lot of fun to be had here, driving/racing enthusiasts should definitely give it a try.In-Depth:  The game is best described, in my opinion, as a sandbox driving game.  I hesitate to directly compare this to sim racing titles as BeamNG.drive feels more ambitious than that--it has racing, sure, but its scope is much larger.  Before I start going into the game further, my experience is based on playing the game using the following set up:Thrustmaster TX Servo w/ 458 wheelThrustmaster T3PA Pro Pedals w/ conical brake modThrustmaster TH8A ShifterRSeat ChassisPredator X34 monitorThe game detected my equipment fine, but did not automatically set everything up correctly by default.  With that said, I absolutely love how you can assign absolutely everything in the game to any button on your wheel or if you have a button box.  It also allows multiple mappings, so you can have keyboard commands simultaneously.  The overall UI is clean and easy to understand--it has a couple quirks, but overall very nice for such an early game.I have a pretty strong PC, and the game runs relatively well.  I'd expect for it to be even better optimized as it moves closer to actual launch, but its current state runs quite well.  I did have to run it in fullscreen or the game would barely run.  So if you are used to setting yours up as bordless windowed or anything like that, you may have to fiddle with some things to get it working properly.The game looks incredible.  Most racing sims really focus on the cars visuals, which makes sense, but track side visuals usually pale in comparison.  BeamNG.drive is much more even--the cars, interiors, and environments are all equally beautiful, which I'm a big fan of.  There are plenty of graphical settings, however, I mostly had everything turned all the way up to max playing at 3440x1440 and it was great.  I'm kind of blown away with how nice and even the game looks for being still early in development.On to the actual gameplay.  The game here is a bit split for me--at times (most of them), it felt like the most realistic driving experience I've ever had, but there were some times where the feeling was a bit off.  The few off times did seem to occur on paved surfaces, but it could also be the fault of my forcefeedback not accurately relaying to me what was happening with the car.  This is an area I think could use some improvement, the forcefeedback is present, but feels underdeveloped compared to the rest of the experience. (Assetto Corsa is my benchmark for forcefeedback)Now a bit more on why I would not directly compare this to sim racing games.  This game is so much more ambitious than that.  I would call this a driving simulator, not a racing sim.  There's a lot of variety here, and while it does have some racing, I was more impressed with its environments off-road.  I hope this doesn't sound like a knock on the game--I think it could be a great sim racing game if they focused on that, but this game is so much more.To the above point, there is a scenario mode which highlights all of the variety.  These scenarios are incredibly different from one another and provide a taste of what sort of possibilities there are for this game.  I won't go into them all, as there are quite a lot, but here's a couple:Car Delivery - Here you are driving a flatbed and have a sports car on the back.  You're tasked with delivering the sports car to its new owner.  You are timed and are required to deliver it without damaging it too much.Police Chase - Someone has robbed a bank and is making a getaway, you're tasked with stopping them.Van Jumps - There are some crazy jumps in this game, but the set you'll need to tackle with a van are some of the most difficult.This game has plenty more to offer including rally style driving, offroading, etc. There is also a mode that just lets you load up in a map and create your own fun.  You can spawn in multiple cars and objects, which allows you to set up some incredibly fun stuff.Now onto the game's main feature, it's soft body physics/damage.  This is by far in a way the most impressive thing I've seen in a video game in the past few years.  It's without equal to my knowledge, and adds a layer of not only realism, but also fun to this game.  It seems everything can be damaged, starting with the obvious body panels, all the way to individual axles, driveshafts, and engine internals.In closing, this game is very ambitious, beautiful, realistic, and fun.  There's a large variety of environements and driving surfaces.  This is a sandbox driving game at the moment and is amazing at what it does.  If you enjoy the chaos, destruction, and stunts of something like Burnout, or the make your own fun of any sandbox titles, you should definitely give this game a try. "

								- BeamNG.drive -Pros: -The best vehicle simulation game (In my opinion)-Best Collision Physics-Regular Updates-Includes multiple gamemodes such as-Mod Support (You download mods from the BeamNG website after login)-Huge Library of Vehicles and Vehicle parts that continue to expand-Includes Multi-Seat Mode (Allows you to play with up to 4 other people with controllers. No online mutliplayer currently)-Many maps to choose from-AI Mode: Allows user to program other vehicles easily with a Chase, Flee, et cetera.-Early Access: This game has some worth now, and might increase when the final version is released-In depth detail to vehicles (Mod Vehicles not Included)-New Campaign Mode-An official website with useful information if you encounter problemsCons:-Early Access: Since this is not the final game, there are quite a few bugs (Parts go through each other, or when tires pop an unrealistic hole occurs, etc.) (Honestly it is not that bad)-Graphics are not as pleasing as Wreckfest (You can do far more in BeamNG.drive)-The Engine can be damaged but you can't see itPLEASE NOTE: That this review isn't including modded vehicles, maps, parts, configurations, shaders, et cetera.I hope you found this review to be helpful._Driver7_			"

								This game is absolutely fabulous. I've played it ever since it came out, about 2 years ago in August. The very first version was completely different to what it is now but it has evolved a heck of a lot since then and it's fantastic to see. The game works fantastically and provides us with a very accurate simulation of vehicular physics, as well as free objects too such as walls, tires, wheels etc.This game doesn't have an objective, yet. However, if you were to play it, you'd immediately find yourself crashing cars in numerous different ways. Into other cars, through other cars, using the AI, throwing them from a cliff... The list goes on. The actual game itself is fantastic. It looks good and it feels good. The UI is friendly, simple and professional. It looks great and it works great. It's not something which will leave you feeling confused.There are lots of levels, open world levels, testing arenas, blank spaces and hilltops plus there is an entire modding community dedicated to making new, exciting terrains for us to use. The terrains look great, they're very well detailed and are huge! You won't be cramped here.Vehicles are a complete masterpiece. The original vehicles have a ton of detail and look incredible. Every single individual component in every vehicle is distinguished. You can see every strut, spring and shock absorber. When you aim the camera at the bottom of the vehicle, you will see the suspension arms and axles moving accordingly. You can see the leaf springs compressing and bumping against the bump stops. You can see all of this happening, in a game. The vehicles themselves are charismatic and each have their own unique handling characteristics from a small hatchback to a full on, mid-engined supercar. Or, you can drive a dual axle tractor unit. The list honestly is endless, as well as mods too. You won't find yourself short of vehicles to try. Each vehicle is individually customisable down to every last part. Do you want your car to only have a right door and no glass? No problem. Do you want your box truck to have engine tuning and 4WD? No problem. Do you want your pickup truck lowered to the ground and drifting? No problem! You can do it all.Finally, the game LOOKS incredible. Apparently, emphasis hasn't been put on to the graphics however if this is Beamng not trying, then they must be able!Don't be put off by the game's early access title. You may run in to some small bugs however their constant updates will make sure your gaming experience is fine. The game can crash, it can give you some painful times but they're not something that happens that often. Not in my experience and not in many other's either.I highly recommend this game, it's worth every penny.  "

								I have more hours then stated above since I bought this from the website before it was even considered to be on steam. A rough estimate is around 400 hours.The game is good if you are in to soft body physics type of games. (like rigs of rods)PROs:There is constant updates that add new vehicles, maps, a few bug fixes and stuff like that.It is a fun game to play if you have a few hours to spare or you just want to play something different for a change.The community is great for this game, with lots of people making maps[www.beamng.com] and mods[www.beamng.com] for the game. (never download stuff from modsgaming.ru viruses and stuff linger in mods)The crashing of cars is great and the handling is good.Game does not crash very often (once in every 6 months or so) unlike some other soft body physics games.CONs:You need a good PC to run this. (good cpu, gpu e.t.c)Sometimes vehicle crashes can be glitchy and will make the vehicle crash (as in freeze type of crash)The price: Its £18.99 which is a bit much for a game in early acess IMO. Its better then Wreckfest but still a bit much for my liking. I got the game for £10 or so when it had to be bought from the website which is a reasonable price for a game in early acess.modsgaming.ru thats all I need to say.Conclusion:The game is a good game to kill a few hours with and has hours upon hours worth of content when you download mods.Recommended8/10			"

								God damn this game is awesome, although I hesitate to call it a game by any stretch of the imagination. BeamNG.drive feels like it belongs in the ""Software"" section compared to the ""Games"" section of my Steam Library. Not a traditional game by any means, BeamNG.drive does its best to be the most detailed ""soft body"" simulator on the market. I've had hours of fun already just repeatedly crashing cars into the wall and watching them disintegrate in beautiful slow motion, makes the car destruction aspect of ANY OTHER GAME look like crap in comparison. So beautiful to watch metal deform and bend realistically and the guts of the vehicle's engine get ripped out from brutal impacts. If you like watching super slow motion crash safety tests and cars you will love this game.It's a pure sandbox more than a game, if you want races/ objectives you won't find much of it here, but what you will find is an expansive modding community that's added tons of levels and vehicles to the game, increasing its value significantly. There are also scenarios that you can race or just have fun trying to ram vehicles off the road. As long as you pick this game up KNOWING that it's a simulation and NOT a traditional game, you will find yourself enjoying it quite a bit. It's so addicting to just smash cars together, and eventually with the implementation of a ""campaign"" plus more standard racing modes I can see this game being an amazing product down the line.

								BeamNG.drive is an outstanding game, with an amazing dev team. Despite being early access, the completed portions of the game are very well done. Bugs and other errors are fixed almost as quickly as they occur, in part due to the wonderful community on the BeamNG forums. One of the best parts of BeamNG.drive is the community surrounding it. Over on the BeamNG.drive forums there are hundreds of mods, and plenty of support for problems you may have. The driving and physics simulation is outstanding, and is constantly being refined. Driving isn't just limited to roads either. Rock crawling, baja blasting, rallying, mudding, and even monster trucking is all possible.That being said, this game is still in development, and when buying it you need to remember that new features are being added all the time. The big updates usually break a lot of mods, and it can be a pain going through downloaded mods and checking to see if they still work.In all, I would highly recommend BeamNG.drive to anyone who loves cars, and would similarly recommend it to anyone who enjoys physics simulations.

								The review in pro/con form from somebody who has been here from the beginning.Pros and Cons in list form; narrative below list:Pros:+A driving sandbox.+Soft-body physics make for amazingly realisitc crashes and deformation.+Excellent official content+Very good simulator for any vehicle you can imagine+Frequent updates (1-2 per month), each with lots of additions (like new vehicles) and fixes+Vibrant community+Modding!. Mods like vehicles, aircraft, maps, props etc. created by the community at the game's forums.+Pretty good visuals (some cons though) Supports up to 4K resolution (to my knowledege)+Full controller support+Local multiplayer (like old school Gran Turismo same screen multiplayer)+In-Game terrain editor.Cons:-Sounds (the team is working on this as a current primary objective. I will change this when new sounds are in the game)-Gameplay aspects lacking. Scenarios are available but are quickly played.-The lighting visuals seem really weird to me. Headlights are useless at night. I recently saw a quote that said that ""the headlights are as bright as the sun with a cutoff"" proving that there is a lighting issue.-? The force feedback feels weird; it could be that I don't have it set right but bumps feel rather numb.+/-Requires a rather good computer to handle (unless you turn off collsion between vehicles)NarrativePros This is a very good simulator in it's current state. There are not many game aspects to it yet but you have some scenarios given to you such as races or delivery missions. Despite limited concrete gameplay, this is very attractive because, in freeplay, you have total freedom to explore any map you have (official or third-party) in any vehicle you want (official or third-party). As of this writing (12/30/15), updates are becoming quite rapid fire with loads of new content in each.  From the launch of the game in August, 2013 to just about a year ago, you could tell that the team was struggling; updates took, in the shortest times, 3 to 4 months with mainly ""improvements to physics"" and little to no content additions. However, for the past six months or so, as the team has expanded with several new, talented members, every update has included a new official vehicle, bugs that the community have reported have been hit head-on, and the team's blog and other official information from the team has been clearly given and is more interactive than ever before. I have a feeling that Beta stage is almost here (currently the game is in Alpha)Moving on, the game comes with a built-in terrain editor. I have experience modding the game via the built-in terrain editor, it is capable and very easy to learn even just by trial and error. The community is vibrant and boasts hundreds of mods, be them vehicles such as cars, trucks, aircraft, etc., maps, utilites, and other etc modifications. I highly recommend this game be used with a good steering wheel and pedal setup (my personal bias is towards the Logitech series of wheels).ConsPutting the fact that better sounds are being made for the game all around, in their current state, the sounds are mostly lacking excitement. I concede that they have gotten miles better in recent months to include recently new unique sounds for one of the vehicles and most recently suspension sounds. As I said above, ""gameplay"" aspects are lacking. There are scenarios but that is it. The team has goals of adding a career mode but it hasn't been said when yet. This is probably personal but I feel that the force feedback system could be better.That's all I got :)Personal notes:Keep your performance in mind. The game IS VERY CPU heavy, not so much GPU heavy. Keep that in mind. I may go so far as to say that anything older than 5 years old will not play over 30 FPS; anything under 3.0GHz will not play over 30FPS (with collisions on). My 6 year old 2.3GHz gets me 10-15 FPS with collisions on, ~25-35FPS with them off. Overall:9.5/10 from me; the updates are very intriguing these days! The game truly gets better with every update.

								UPDATE: It's been quite a while since I made my original review, and while the vast majoriy of what I said then still applies, there are a few things that have changed, all for the better! The game still has wonderful softbody physics, scratches still do not appear on the pain and the game still eats up a lot of my time. However, I can gladly say that BeamNG.drive now provides a much better driving experience. All the cars handle very realistically (not necessarily nicely however) as a lot has been overhauled. You now have control over tire pressure, tires will heat up, the engine will heat up, suspension has been completely overhauled and generally, the game handles a lot better. On top of that, there are several new official maps and vehicles, and lots of quality mods available. BeamNG.driver still isn't the best looking game on the market, and still has places to grow, but it's still certainly worth picking up and it keeps getting better and better!ORIGINAL REVIEW: As someone who's been doing small track racing in beat-up 4-cylinders since I was 11, I know a few things about damage modeling. I'm very picky with car games, especially ones centered around carnage. Beam.NG, is in my opinion one of (if not the best) soft-body car physics sandbox games out there. The damage portrayed is pretty darn close to the real thing. While it's not perfect it's as close as 2014 technology can really let us experience. Since it's still in Alpha, scratches and rubs don't appear on the side of the cars, but I certainly hope they will when the game is finished. However, while the damage modeling is wonderful, as far as a driving experience, BeamNG.drive doesn't deliver. If you want tight, accurate and realistic car control, look elsewhere. As of (Aug. 14 '14) BeamNG.drive isn't great to drive. The controls are sort of laggy, rear-wheel drive vehicles are near impossible to drive and the standard transmision is rather awkward. That being said, this game is still in developement, and I certainly recomend picking it up. As is, demolition derbies are sort of possible, but just messing around is tons of fun. I certainly enjoy it, and I want this game to become fully polished, so buy it and help it become the perfect driving simulator sandbox thing.			"

								This is a very enjoyable game. The devs have released many updates and it seems to have a very promising future. Though it is a good game, if you are looking specifically for a racing game this is not for you (yet) as there is no career mode or organizable races. The physics are the best I've ever seen in any game that I have played.Overall I give this game a 9.5/10 as it shows much potential to grow into something much bigger.			"

								I LOVE THIS GAME! I PLAY IT IN ALL OF MY FREE TIME ! I have 849 hours on record and 11.6 hours this week and counting. I love the variaty of vehicles and props and most of all obliterating cars! I'm a car geek and I stumbled on to this game and just loved it! I think i've had it for 2 years now. I just started making videos for the game itself, and and of course MODS. The modding community is outrageous and there are plenty of cars and terrains to choose from. If you get bored (I still haven't!) then definately check out http://beamng.com/resources/ ! I would recommend it to anybody with a great PC. The graphics are amazing on my home built PC, but If you have like, an HP or Dell that works to. I haven't tried on the Mac though. I think it has support. Yes, I have three computers and a laptop. ok, now i'm off topic but I would like to say that it is worth 24.99!  and last Dear devs, if you could add a minivan to smash, that would be great! BIG NOTICE: DO NOT DOWNLOAD ON A LAPTOP! I did and my laptop is really laggy now because it could'nt take it!  Get this game!

You do need a good computer to get a good frame rate but in slow motion it works just fine. The physics are very well desinged and it feels like it's not an early access game. Crashing the cars is very satifying but you can also change the cars appearance and performance. My favorite thing to do is doing police chases on a level I downloaded.			"

								This game is absolutely fantastic. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about it- apart from some minor bugs, which are to be expected from a game this early in development. I've watched BeamNG's development since when it was first announced in 2011, and I think it's safe to say that there aren't any games even remotely similar to it. It is truly one-of-a-kind. BeamNG has hyperrealistic physics, leading to an extremely lifelike driving experience- including crashes. The terrains made for the game are beautiful, scenic, and fun to drive through. The community has made hundreds of different cars and terrains for the game, each of which are unique in their own respect.One thing I will say: though most of the cars and terrains on the BeamNG Forums are high-quality, some cars (and occasionally terrains) can be found on external websites (known as ""Russian"" mod distributors) that do not utilize BeamNG to the best of its abilities. Often times they are car models ripped from other games and placed on the node/beam structure of an existing developer-made vehicle. As a result, the physics and handling are poor and they tend to look strange and unrealistic in crashes. Generally, use of such mods is frowned upon, as they require little effort to produce and they frequently fail to properly credit the original publisher of the mod they are based on. As a general precaution, only obtain mods for the game through the official mediums (e.g. the forums or the upcoming repository).BeamNG is a superb driving sim and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes sandboxes and/or cars in a heartbeat.

The graphics may not be Project CARS but like I have said before Graphics do not make a good game. That aside they still look visually stunning ! The physics of this game are great for both the casual racer and the enthusiast.works with most wheels , I use a G25 and some days I boot this up go for a drive along some coast and take some screenshot listening to some music. other times im rallying down or up a mountain in a sports car !

								If you're looking for a car game that foucuses mostly on driving and crashing physics and is way more fun than ""Next Car Game"" then this is for you, hours of fun when smashing the hell out of all the diffrent cars and drifting in this game is totally awesome as well as the maps. There's also some great mods for the game.			"

								BeamNG is a unique little soft body physics simulation gone car simulator which means it solves a lot of problems with driving looking wrong in other driving games. Things like cars having incredible shock absorbers when landing jumps is not present here. There's no magical forces like in other simulations and cars respond properly to impacts and hard landings. Miles beyond Nextcargame. This is at the cost of CPU performance. You NEED a good CPU for this game. your graphics card doesn't matter so much yetThere are a few things to be aware of; it is an alpha with few features and many bugs present. Currently there's no game as such. Just a way to play with the physics engine. Tire models aren't up to scratch yet so while driving is realistic(ish) all vehicles handle very lazily with a kind of unavoidable floatiness. There isn't a massive quantity of content either. What there is, however, is fun to play with.If you want a physics sandbox then buy it now. If you want a driving simulator then wait for it to become one. If you want a realistic bridge building simulator... wait for it to become that.			"

								BeamNG is not so much a game as it's just a big sandbox in the purest term. There's no real goal unless you choose to participate in one of the few campaigns or scenarios.What makes BeamNG for me is the fact that I can pick a location. Pick a car. Pick a loadout. Pick a colour and just do whatever I feel like doing. Roll a 3 wheeler? There's a car for that. Tear up the tarmac? There's options for that. Tear up low-grip surfaces? There's loadouts for that. Do all of the above at the same time? Go nuts. You'll likely fail but the satisfaction of seeing your front wheel fly off because you bottled a corner is surprisingly long-lived.For fans of: Cars. Smashing cars. Rally. Car physics. Fun.			"

								I love this game.Two years ago I played the tech demo of this game. If you want to try it I suggest you to download it from the original website, you can drive a pick up on the base map and see what the game basically is.Some days ago I saw a video from a famous youtuber where he was playing this game, and I bought it.This game is still in the development but there are many things to do. You can take a car that you want, like a 3-wheeled ""Pidgeon"" and drive on a test map to destroy it or on a real map like ""Utah"" that is giant and very well made.When you want you can play scenarios, that are missions where you have to drive a car you can't choose and reach some check points. This scenarios are stunts and challenges, and some of them are really hard to do.When you have played every scenarios you can go to the BeamNG website and download mods made from fans of the game, that can be cars, maps, scenarios and many others. A mod I especially love is the ""Auriga Heron 1927"", a vintage car with a V6 that has even a custom shifting method and is very difficult to drive. I love using it on the snow maps.If you like driving you should buy this game.(Sorry for my english, it isn't my native language) "

								Words can barely describe this game. If you're looking for the next racing game, this isn't it. This is a whole new, and amazing simulator. This game features real time deformation of the cars, with real time simulated car physics. Every crash will be different, every jump will land differently. This game, sorry, simulator, will keep you entertained for hours, if not days. You will constantly find yourself driving into walls, over and over, purely because each time you do, it'll yeild a different result, especially with the option of slowing down time to watch your precious sports car crumple and destroy itself. This simulator is constantly being updated and has a steady flow of work being put into it, the creators constanly update the players as to what their working on and what to expect in future updates. The price it's going for now is a bargain, especially as its supposed to increase in price as time goes on. Did I mention that there is planned to be a multiplayer feature? As if smashing into walls and sliding off roads into trees wasn't fun enough by yourself, you'll be able to destroy your friends' cars as well? Why have you not bought this game(simulator) yet?			"

To fix this you can obv turn down the settings but that causes some unpleasant foliage in the distance (trees/leaves are very blurry).

								Perfect game for any car fan, regardless of age. There's not a whole lot of fancy graphics, no lens flares, relatively simple smoke/dust effects, most foliage (except trees) are made of flat textures (which are pretty well done, you can't really tell unless you stop and zoom right in on the grass, looks fine if you're driving even at low speeds), and the shaders aren't modified to give a 'cinematic look'. So this game isn't an astonishingly pretty game. But you know what, that's okay.Each vehicle is intricately modelled, down to the point where you can see each individual part of the engine. You can see the butterfly valves on your supercharged V8 muscle car, you can see the engine block move around in its mounts slightly as you rev the engine. The level of detail is insane. Hit a harsh bump that bottoms out your custom, lowered car? Be prepared to potentially have your entire exhaust system ripped out of your car. Hit a sharp kerb at high speed? Might wanna watch your tires, they can pop, giving your car an unnatural feel. The physical damage in this game is brutally realistic, as each car is not 'hard-coded' with performance stats, health points, etc. Each INDIVIDUAL PART of a car makes up it's whole performance, much like a real car. Pop your front-right tire, and your car will start veering slightly to the right. Fit sport tires, you might be able to handle a corner slightly faster. Lower your suspension, you'll reduce body rolls and keep all 4 tires on the road better, resulting in better grip.It goes on and on. The soft-body physics overall are brilliant, the cars crumple, wobble, and react exactly how you'd expect a car to react.Maps:The maps that come with the game are very nice, and quite varied.Gridmap: A testing map, with an assortment of jumps, surface types (from sand and dirt to mud and water), slalom cones, objects to crash into and a few high-speed race courses.Port: A small map set on a port, a perfect map for Gymkhana or drifting fans, with all kinds of shipping containers, warehouses, and a few ramps along with it. Industrial Site: A medium sized map set on a seaside industrial area, it features a RallyCross track with multiple configurations, an offroad racing track laced with thick mud that will bog down your average rally car, but take a big 4x4 and you'll plow straight on through, and a more traditional tarmac race course. The industrial area also features many warehouses like the Port map, and a nice little circuit that races around it, featuring a jump over a small inlet.East Coast USA: Set in the East Coast of the USA (As the nae suggests), it has a medium-sized town, along with fairly well maintained roads, that go from the coast to snaking through the forest. Lots of dirt trails through fields and woodlands for rallying around too.Jungle Rock Island: On a Tropical Island, this map has poorly-maintained roads that call for terrifying high-speed driving along the coastline of this island. It also has many offroad dirt trails that run through the forest, and can quite easily end up getting you lost! There's also a few little rally trails, and industrial areas, quarries, and a port. Probably my favourite map.Cliff: Spawns you in at the top of a cliff, the only way around is down the cliff. Fun little map for just throwing stuff of cliffs and watching it arrive at the bottom as a mangled mess. Not much to the map other than that, but still fun nonetheless.Hirochi Raceway: A race-focused map, this raceway is GP-styled, with very wide, smooth corners, along with fast straights and chicanes thrown in. This map also has a few forest routes, that can take you on a narrow road through some forests, so any mistakes can be fatal.So, quite a few maps, with lots of variety.ScenariosThe game has a wide variety of scenarios, too many to list here, that cover multiple fun aspects of the game.These can range from tutorials, to shakedowns of various cars, police chases, races, delivery challenges, even a 'hyper-miling' challenge where you have to cross Jungle Rock Island with very little gas left in your car. There's even a demolition derby scenario for people to 'party play'.Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10, I'd like to see networked multiplayer (something the BeamNG devs might implement if their engine can support it) and a campaign mode (which the devs have planned pretty much since day 1 of the project)Lots more potential, the modding community is great, who make new maps, scenarios, vehicles, etc, etc. Definitely worth the buy, especially for car fans, IMO.

								I love realistic games, and this one brings it to a whole new level. This game PERFECTLY simulates real-life physics. There's so many things to do, and you can do anything you want. There's missions, tons of maps, and not to mention a huge selection of modded cars and custom maps. You can even go into the files of a certain car and give it 3000 horsepower if you really wanted to. They are constantly adding new things, and fixing all of the bugs. The customization level is ridiculous. You can drive around with only a frame, wheels, and your engine. Who needs a car body? You can tune your suspension, throw on a supercharger, and much more. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy tinkering with things, or even just driving. NOTE: It will take some getting used to, because the handling is realistic to real life. It's not any old racing game, it takes real skill. Plus you can use a controller. Enjoy ;)			"

Brief ReviewBeamNG.Drive is a fun sandbox game that simulates every aspect of driving extremely well. You can noticeably feel the difference between heavy cars and light cars, between a stock engine and a souped up one. It's so close to being not just a physic/crashing simulator but if the right mods come out it could potentially become the best Racing sim with many racing genres.Pros and ConsProsGood modding communityGame leading softbody collisions physics Surprisingly Good GraphicsVery good Audio (Crashing audio not vehicle sounds)ConsGame Updates (Not very often)Learning CurveAn EndingWhen I tried to play it like a videogame, things went predictably poor. It took some time for me to adjust to how the game wanted me to play, but once I did I found there was actually a deeper level of control over what I could make the cars do. Nothing felt unintentional or unexpected about the driving, just very precise with a high learning curve			"

								I always used to be sad when playing Halo as a child because you could only wreck the warthog in so many ways before it blew up. I also wanted more from crashing physics in games like Project gotham racing, Need for speed, and Forza. Ever since my friend told me about this game a while ago, I knew I would be playing this alot. I dont care about carrers and missions and stuff like that,  I like spawning cars and seeing how many ways I wreck a car or a group of cars. I always enjoyed seeing how stuff deformed and broke. This game brings out the inner child in me.I feel good when playing this game, and I feel like im at home. Every time I play this game it feels like im coming home from school and taking off my shoes and enjoying a snack. I can almost garantee you, that if you buy this game you will not be let down. It feels like seeing an old friend that you havent seen in a while. It just feels right.10/10			"

BeamNG.Drive has the weirdest name I've ever heard for a videogame ever.I can explain part of it, except the NG. You got me there.For reference, this is a car physics simulation game with some of the most true-to-life physics you can get.Anyway, back to the name. ""Beam"" refers to how the physics are simulated. The physics part of your car is built out of ""beam,"" these invisible lines that make the physical mesh of your vehicle. They can break, which is where the damage starts to occur. They don't show it in any videos above, but it's definitely a fresh take on physics.Like I said, ""NG?""""Drive,"" on the other hand, is self-explanatory.Give this game a try. I'll be honest, the sound effects are basically worse than gargling broken glass (idk), and the visual look of many of the cars can make you gag (i.e the in-game Volkswagen Golf). If you're like me, you overlook those facts and say ""OMG THE PHYSICS,"" unless you aren't a complete geek/nerd.Yes, buy this game. It's 25 bucks here, but look on their website! (HINT HINT, they have a humble store link right there that'll save you five bucks and still give you a steam key!) "

								Still Early Access, but this game shows potential!Having read a bit about the game, and watched the standard YouTube videos about it, I decided to give it a try. Now admittedly I haven't put in a whole lot of hours, because there still are some things that needs to be polished, before a final release is due.That being said, the game as it is now, is a lot of fun. The physics are unlike any other car game, which really is what sets this game apart right now.The handling of the cars is very unique, and not two cars feel the same. Depending on the type of car you have chosen, a simple task like driving down the road can become a challenge. I'll bet ya', you'll be wrapping your car around a few trees before you get the hang of the in-game handling.The game in its current state, already lets you do a bunch of different customization options, and I'm not talking about rims, speakers or the likes here, but stuff like removing parts of the body, removing a wheel, stripping the vehicle down to its core etc.All things that make the game kind of nerdy, but nerdy in a good way.The graphics are quite good too, and once you get the hang of controlling your car, you can start venturing into more advanced manuevers like handbrake turns, burnouts and whatever your heart desires.So for now, in Early Access, the game is for anyone looking to drive around some beautiful scenery, all while tinkering with different setups on your virtual vehicle, and just goofing around basically.

 My Beamng Drive Review First of all, Ive clocked well over 150 hours in this game :P it seems like a long time but when your playing beamng it simply flies by, it may not look like there is much to do but trust me, there is. Some nice things about Beamng Drive: The graphics are still really nice on lower settings.Alot of cars to play around with and create custom variations.A decent amount of dev made maps already in the game for you.Fun to just cruse around the maps and enjoy the sceneary! Some bad things about Beamng Drive:  The game is very resource intencive, but can still be played without recommended parts. Frequent crashes/Physics pauses due to some car bugs. Some (Almost all) mods are going to crash the game at some point. The Utah map is quite laggy due to size and amount of different hills.So, if you are thinking about getting Beamng Drive then you might as well, there is alot of fun to be had on this game and the amount of vehicles and variations is great, the cars are all very profesionally modeled and are unique to this game. Most of the vehicles are some sort of immitation of a real life vehicle. Mods There are an extreme amount of mods on the beamng drive forums and other websites hosting mods, there are alot of different mods including different engine mods, more vehicles, more vehicle variations and alot more!For me Beamng Drive is 100% 10/10, You have to expect bugs in physics games like these, they are made to simulate real life and usually dont have bugs at lower speeds... But high speed is still fun!			"

								BeamNG.Drive is a physics-based driving simulator. It is not graphics intensive, but you need a lot of RAM to run it smoothly. Because it employs soft-body collision dynamics, it is capable of producing unimagineably realistic, *ahem* ""accidents"". driving faster than 70 mph puts you in a bit of a bind, as the slightest turn puts you at risk of a nasty crash. A little side-game can be derived from these low friction coefficients that are prevalent throughout the game, known simply as ""The BeamNG Challenge"". simply pick a map, pick a car, and try to stay above 75 mph. it's insanely fun and difficult, and a great way to challenge your friends that are a little bit too tired of playing Rocket League with you. This challenge is just one of so very many things you can do in this game.All in All, BeamNG is perfect for just farting around with physics and cars.			"

								Wow I cant believe that it is soooo realistic!!!I have played Forza Horizon 3 for many many hours now and the driving physics are really great there, BUT BeamNG Drive is much BETTER! And not just because of the soft body, but also because it is not as arcade as forza 3 is! It feels much more like a REAL car because you can swerve back and forth very fast if you are too fast! Swerving is not happening in Forza 3 in over 100 hours of playing! But in this game happens the same mistakes which happen if I drive with my real car! As exampe if I turn too fast, I cannot stay in the trace if Im too fast, also MUCH easier and more arcade within Forza Horizon 3!Furthermore there are so many unexpected things can happen I cannot believe, it is a real happy car driving sandbox!!! Im really excited what they implement next within this great driving&destruction simulation!10/10, best driving game ver and I cannot believe! "

								Click on the video below and watch some of my other videos to get an idea of what is all to do in BeamNG Drive. I have over 50 videos of BeamNG, from wheelie school buses to forward and reverse wheelie cars. There's exploding campers and instant destruction. Probably one of my favorite games/simulators. BeamNG isn't really a game, it' more so a simulator for crash physics. It's an open world based game, with hundreds of car variations. There's offroad, there's drag, there's drift, dirt, rally, you name it and someone has probably made it. The physics for the game are quite realistic as that is what they are going for. You can watch the suspension on your vehicle actually do what it's supposed to as you crawl over the mountains. There's ramps, there's objects to crash into, there's challenging maps that the wonderful BeamNG community have made, as well as the maps from BeamNG devs themselves. If you like to crash cars, and see the damage physics, and to play with the gearing and testiing what car can handle what, this is for you. I recommend this game many times over, even if you get it to let it sit in your library, to play once in a blue moon when you don't actually feel like doing anything. Sit back on the couch, hook up to your tv and just enjoy crashing.EDIT: I've played quite a bit since I first wrote this review and would like to add some things I've started to notice that really irk me. These won't change my recommendation at all, but it gives somewhat of an idea of what to expect, at least if you don't have a high end pc. My main issue I've come to just hate is how every map you download will have a different FPS rate. It doesn't matter if one map is huge and another is small. The differences are crazy. I'll even have huge maps that have wonderful FPS, while small maps are low almost unplayable. It makes no sense to me, but that's only because I don't understand how this stuff works. Trees. I'd rather not even have them in game. I use the no vegetation mod because they add unecessary lag. They rarely act as a tree would in a crash and it's annoying. I've hit a tree at 60mph and my car didn't slide through it and start grabbing in the middle of the car. With that, I'd just rather them gone altogether.I'd also like to add, that don't get offset by people's bad reviews, Most of them are not about the game itself, but because their PC can't run the game which I don't get how that's the games fault. I've seen reviews where people say there's not much to do. Well, there is. You can customize any map. Just be respectful and don't upload as yours and give credit if you make a video. I have customized almost every map I've downloaded. Just hit F11 by default and it'll load into the map editor. You can terraform, you can add roads, you can add water, you can change the terrain to beach sand which acts like sand and will flip your vehicle. Mud is available. Ice is available. Grass. The things to do are endless. The reviews seem to be based off their own ignorance rather than the game itself. ""I can't drive without crashing"", not the games fault, it's yours.  If you think there's not much to do in this game, then you should take another look at it because I highly disagree.UPDATE 0.8 REVIEW UPDATE: Graphics-I need to add in that the most recent update is amazing.  I believe For my PC, GTX 750ti. Intel i7 920@2.67Ghz. 8GB Memory DDR3. Windows 10 Pro I'm now able to turn off the 'no vegatation mod, (which obviously removes the vegatation from any and all maps, excluding some greenery that is placed in a different way) and have up to 4 cars with a good 30 to 40fps whereas before the recent Update I was getting 15 fps with 2 cars. I usually use cars from mods, not the direct BeamNG cars.

 When people say there's not much to do in BeamNG except crash cars.EDIT: I've noticed a lot of negative reviews from people expecting a AAA title with zero lag. I don't know if these people understand computers at all, cause the steam page says a High end i5/i7. high end, meaning a good cpu. Then there's people complaining about the camera's, well there's multiple camera's to choose from and it involves doing it yourself, not being held by the hand like most games.

								A great game that defiantly is worth the money. It's much like gary's mod but for cars and is great with a controller. I like the physics aspect as well, you can simulate another planets gravity (the moon will leave you floating in the sky whilst Jupiter's will really force the cars body down).This seems like another brilliant sandbox style game it will leave you feeling great as you choose a seemingly infinite amount of fun maps and enjoy fiddling and changing your car. One of the games i've played where you can only have fun and you may experiece this game as a game that will never stop giving ideas to you because I did.			"

								Game is is nice for an early release.  Glad to see that updates are being published and the project hasn't been shelfed.  Pros:  -The games strives on realistic crashes and good graphics which I agree are amazing. -They just released an update which seemed to resolve the game ending abrutley at certain times.  Granted this is an early release so bugs are apart of the gameplay.  Cons:  -One thing that I hope they address is the physics of the game.  I.E. on maps such as the East Coast, I should be able to drive a car at 50 MPH without spinning out on a slight turn.  Having aggressive physics do make great crashes but the realism is lost a little.  I'm excited to see this game mature.			"

								I've been testing this game for months now, proud backer of the project.In its current state it is essentially a massive physics sandbox. I use it mostly to simulate car crashes and pileups, but the possibilities are endless with all the available mods and tracks to work with. Be aware this is NOT a finished product; clearly an alpha, but a fun alpha!Head on over to the BeamNG.drive forums for the latest content, beta or otherwise. The default cars are nice, but once you pump some custom vehicles and maps into the game it becomes a real treat. The Matrix Freeway and Riverside Expressway maps are my favourite, and there's lots more!I recommend this game to anyone who wants to mess around with vehicles regardless of the consequences. Better here than in real life, right?Enjoy the ride!			"

								As a fan of Gran Turismo 4 / 5, BeamNG.drive is very reminiscent of those great racing titles. The soft-body physics are incredible, and the feeling of weight and momentum is amazing. The combination of all these facts means that until they expand the non sandbox modes, all of my time will be spent going 110 down a narrow road and eventually wrapping my car around a tree or flipping it down the road, all in basically photorealistic detail. Controller DEFINITELY recommended for more precise throttle / steering / braking.Could really use in the future:-Multiplayer-Possibly global competitions / events ala GT5/GT6-Some sort of music / radio element-Replay editing			"

One slight problem is that some of the nodes can stretch in some cars when in a crash at high speeds with a lampost e.g.  What you should add is at a certain pressure on the node is it to detatch itself from the main body which will prevent this.

								This is the best vehicle simulator/game I have ever played. I have been waiting for this game all my life. I have been following Beamng.Drive since the very beginning and I have always been impressed with what this relatively small development team has managed to create. The game is open-source and mods are easy to make and install. Game play is fantastic, cars handle very nicely, and I love the variation in vehicles and environments. My graphics card is on the slow side (Nvidia GT 620), but I can run this game at fairly good FPS with low settings and lowered resolution for the heavily vegetated maps. There are some occasional problems, but the dev team works quickly to fix any major issues and the game is still in early development. I am excited for what this already amazing game will turn out to be.			"

								So I'm going to cut right to the chase. The Good: An extremely accurate physics engine that does its best to simulate real life as closely as possible.  ""Official"" cars included with the game destroy and deform for the most part as you'd expect they would (you get minor bugs here and there but this doesn't often happen unless you completely mutilate a vehicle).  The official selection of cars is small, but steadily growing.  You get a selection of cars, trucks and SUVs with varying trim levels and options that you can customize. They're all very highly detailed and behave as you'd expect them to behave.  In addition to vehicles, there is a wide variety of other machines and devices you can use to destroy vehicles (including a roller crusher, a rollover sled, a giant hamster wheel and a car cannon).  The environments provided are again few, but nicely varied and include sections of countryside, small towns, racetracks, industrial areas and more.  The really big pro here?  The game is totally open to the modding community.  There are lots of cars, props and maps available to drive, and they run the gamut from plain family cars to rally specials and science-fiction wonders. The modded terrains range from rally stages to highways to elaborate obstacle courses to who knows what else.  The official terrains are very well designed and pretty, if a bit lifeless.  They're also quite large and have a lot of little secrets hidden all throughout them--secrets that can often only be accessed by a particular type of vehicle.The Bad: Despite being in production for well over a year, the game is still in a very early state.  There are lots of features still missing (there is no multiplayer, AI is primitive at best).  And then there's the other problem--this game is a MASSIVE resource hog.  All the physics calculations are done in real time.  There are ZERO canned crash animations, unlike a game like GTAV.  GTA uses canned animations to save on CPU overhead and preserve framerate.  Beamng.drive does not.  Because of that you are going to need a very good PC to run this game on high graphics settings and keep a reasonable framerate.  Also, because of the early state of this game there...really isn't all that much to DO.  There are a few ""scenarios"", basically all time-trial races, but other than these there's no real point besides driving around and figuring out new and inventive ways to destroy a late 90s pedo-van.  Also, this is a car-based driving game with car-based controls.  There are working boats and aircraft in the modding community but the control scheme is not designed to accomodate them.  Because of that they can be very hard to handle.  Another point against--the game works decently well with a gamepad (The X360 controller is supported natively), but to take full advantage of it you are going to need a decent steering wheel and pedal setup.  DO NOT attempt to play this game with just a keyboard and mouse. So should you buy this game now?  Well that depends.  Are you the kind of gamer that enjoys driving games?  Can you make your own fun?  Do you like to break stuff?  I'd say if you answered yes to at least two of those three questions, you should give this game a good hard look.  If however you're the kind of gamer that needs direction, needs to be given something to do, this game probably isn't for you.			"

								First off, I absolutely love this game. It's amazingly fun to just mess around with, and try to make really interesting crashes happen. This is definitely the most realistic car physics simulator out there, but keep in mind, that's about all it is. The developers have added some fun little missions to do, but they aren't really that good and you don't get any reward or even acknowledgement for beating them, they're sort of just there so the game isn't a complete sandbox. That being said, there is much more in the works, such as multiplayer, racing, and many other fun things that I cannot wait for. This also is a pretty big game, I'd recommend having a good computer to get the game's full effect. (My $200 Toshiba isn't exactly doing it for me) There are truly some amazing mods, including actual makes and models (ex. Ford Crown Vic, Ferrari F50, etc.) and even rocket cars and planes. They are up there with the stock cars the developers put out, work just as fine, and in my experience, have no extra bugs or glitches. (Though I do have to point out, you would do completely fine without mods because the developers did an truly amazing job putting out a variety of different vehicles, including semis, trucks, drift cars, your everyday sedans, police cars, hyper cars, vans, off-road variants of trucks, and sports cars. Keep in mind though that all of these cars are by fake car companies, so if you are looking for realism, download mods.)The other cool thing about BeamNG is that it is super-customizable. You can change the cars, (ex. remove/change parts or switch engines) change the time of day, mess around with the gravity, use slow motion, (Highly recommened, crashes look awesome in slow motion with the amount of detail in this game) and even add in AIs to chase you around or crash into. This is another fun aspect of this game that I love, and I use the features mentioned above a lot.Minor problems I have with the game:-Engine sounds. Most of the engine sounds that are in the stock cars the game comes with are the same, which can be sort of disappointing to a car guy. You do get some different sounds with modded cars, but you still get mainly one droning engine sound, which doesn't really sound good either. (UPDATE: This has been addressed and there is now a great variety of engine and crash sounds)-Water. In most cars, even the modded ones, going into water that is a little bit bigger than a big puddle on a real road kills the engine. This is really getting nit-picky, but when I try off-roading in a car that wasn't specifically built for it, even on just a bit of water, the engine dies. (UPDATE: This has also been addressed, and when your engine is getting flooded, the game shows what percentage of the engine is flooded, so you can try and get out of the water before your engine dies.)-Crash sounds. Almost every single sound of vehicles impacting something is met with the same exact sound. It is a realistic sound, but it gets annoying after a while hearing the same sound over and over when you crash it. (UPDATE: As I said before, this has been fixed and there is a great variety of sounds now)-Lack of actual gameplay. I did already address this, but once again, if you are looking for something other than a sandbox, wait for the game to finish Early Access or go somewhere else, because as of now, this is almost 100% a sandbox. Although there are a few things missing right now, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with even a slightly better computer than mine and who just wants to mess around with cars and physics for a while. I have so far played this game for 80+ hours (Keep in mind I usually get around 15fps with my computer having -15 gb of ram) and I still have fun every time I open BeamNG. Updates are frequent and usually big, with either bugs fixed or new cars being added just about every time. Definitely buy this game if you want a sandbox, but you should wait a while if looking for real gameplay. Rating: 9/10			"

								I'm just writing this review because BeamNG deserves it more than anything on Steam. Don't look at my play time, I'm playing offline if I'd have to estimate it would be around 500-700 hours + like 300-400 on forum and like 100-200 watching it on YouTube, it is the only one game I bought on steam and this is the best spent money, I literally feel honored that I supported developers of this state of art software. It have it's flaws and even in far future (after final release) it will have some, but this is right now excellent driving or racing simulator I've became better driver IRL by this game, it can learn you how to brake, where to brake, feel when you're loosing grip, how to regain it and what to do when you are in dangerous situations. It help to form some subconscious reactions. It actually saved my friend's car, because after playing a lot of BeamNG he had learned some subconscious reactions and instead of falling in to deep ditch at high speed we just scratched pile of snow, he admitted immediately that playing saved us, as he just got his driving licence and didn't had any experience, and his beginning with BeamNG was well... difficult but after a time he learned a lot of PROPER reactions. Anyway it's going to have more features like realistic transmission system, brake's thermals, tire's thermals, new sounds for every vehicle, more parts, maps, cars, real campaign with Street Legal Racing Redline themed garage and tuning, possible even online multiplayer improved existing content and features way more optimization, better crash physics and lots more. It's still like 2 years to full release, but it's worth the money right now. But you have to own not bad PC (look at required specs) and you have to know that there's no goal right now, no multiplayer you choose what to do, and if you're not creative you might get bored after 5 hours of smashing cars in different way. TBH I just race on Hirochi Raceway and I try to master every vehicle, driving here is very satisfying, especially when you have wheel like G25 or better and you are doing good ;) My biggest goal is to not crash, this isn't crashing simulator it's very good racing sim, but when you actually crash you have to look at this beautiful soft-body physics result.TL;DR-It's very good racing simulator-Can make you better driver IRL if you use good steering wheel-Requires something better than potato to play it-Will became better and better with every update, but to final release I estimate there are bout 2 years left-Worth the money if you can set goals to yourself -If you look for proper campaign or multiplayer, you'll probably get bored after 5 hours of crashing and you have to wait a little to not get disappointed, it's not for everybody. Requires some common sense thinking and knowledge how cars perform in real life instead of NFS series to not scream ""cars feel to light"", ""cars feels like driving on ice"", ""cars are too weak"" etc. (IMO they are a bit too strong, when you compare it to IIHS or Euro NCAP BeamNG's cars deform less, seems to hold a bit better but it's a game, most peoples can't imagine that after crashing at 30km/h they can damage car to the point it will not move)			"

								The best thing you could do is type in BeamNG in the YouTube search bar and take a close look at that gorgeous soft body physics. It's just impressive how good the deformation of the carbody is! On top on that there is a good graphics quality, handling model and tuning feature. This game plays great with an Xbox One comtroller, but a keyboard and mouse is ok too. Even a force feedback wheel is not too bad (I tried it with my Thrustmaster TX), even though I prefer the gamepad. Besides that, the game has a small variety of modes - scenarios, free roam and career (multiplayer should come in some time). The career mode is not that interesting so far, but keep in mind that this game is in early access (Version 0.8) and still away from feature complete. The scenarios mode is fun, you can do missions/challenges. You also can install mods easily to get new scenarios, cars, locations, paints and some randome stuff.There is nothing similar on the market as far as I know. This is an outstanding game, worth to buy after you have taken a look at some videos.			"

								Who would have thought wrecking a driverless car would be this much fun! Even in its Alpha phase and total lack of objectivity BeamNG.drive is on point, but has plenty of room for improvement. Although the physics are the most realistic and difficult I have experienced, the wrecks and models could use some work. Getting snagged on a tree causes textures to stretch at times. Some parts of the vehicle are static and do not move when you wreck as well.BeamNG.drive can be best described as a physics engiune diguised as a driving game. Normally, I am greatly against games that have zero objectivity, but in this game's case I can make an exception. I greatly anticipate the improvements as they come rolling in!			"

								Honestly, I don't usually write reviews unless I am really happy with a game. I never play car games or racing games so this was a little bit of a risk for me. Best 64.5 hours in a car game ever. I play this with my brother, we challenge each other to go farthest without crashing. Also, we stage epic crashes. However, this game has it's fair share of bugs. One very annoying one is when the tyres burst and it turns into a glitchy, terrifying instability that moves by itself... It is very disapointing to do a cool crash just to get a massive instability and have the game reset your car to stop the whole game crashing. But, you know, it's a truely great game and I'm sure these glitches and bugs will be fixed eventually.			"

								Poor? Lacking a death wish? Then this game is the game for you! This game is for those people who want to see cars crashed exactly the way they want but can't afford to do that in real life. Basically, this game was made for Americans and terrorists.On a more serious note, I would like to mention that at the moment, it includes:  A sandbox mode where you can play around in many default maps, and many player-created maps,  A map editor which you can access by pressing F11 while not in full screen mode (Alt+Enter toggles fullscreen),  A Scenario system where you can play scenarios made by both the developers and modders on both stock and user-created maps,  Controller, joystick, and steering wheel support with a very easy-to-use interface for mapping the controls.Remember, this game is still in Early Access and features are being added to it all the time. In the menu, it's obvious that there are plans for a campaign mode. That'll be fun. Don't forget to Subscribe, leave a nice comment, and enjoy some of my other videos!    *Disclaimer: I am not a developer of this game, nor am I aassociated with the developers, I likely missed some important features of the game.

								As with any early access title, particularly ones that run Unity, it can be buggy at times. However, the game is really fun and has great potential for expansion. Also, the developers seem to have a genuine interest in making sure to add more content when the old stuff gets stale; not to mention the commmunity is very active. They are also very diligent; game breaking bugs are fixed very quickly.The game dynamics make it very realistic in terms of drivability and damage modeling. However, if you're looking for a dedicated racing game this is far from the best option. However, it isn't a racing game. It's a fun, screw around and make your own content game.Make sure you have a good computer though. On my build (AMD A8 7650 and GTX 950) it can be a bit laggy. But since that's about as low of performance as they recommend to run the game on...well there's a benchmark.			"

You can change everything from what brakes you use to even editing the terrian on maps. Spawn custom items into the map like walls, ramps, signs even a cannon.Game is actively updating, and they are doing a great job with the updates! Has tons of replay vaule, if you're the type of person who can really put themselves into the game you'll have no problem playing for hours.The default senarios aren't all the best, but you can always download more, or wait for future updates to add/improve them.Get this now, before the price goes up!

The full mod support for this game is joyous, and it means that hundreds of addon maps and cars are available for download - however, only a select few are actually worth downloading. The actual driving feel of the simulator is very realistic itself - I use a G27 wheel and it is very close to real life.

I have been there almost since the beginning, and the progress that has been made in regards to physics, handling, and optimization are truly significant. This is more sim like than the arcade style games you may be accustomed to, as cars feel like they actually have weight and proper driving characteristics. It is near impossible to play properly with a keyboard and mouse, I would highly recommend at least a game pad if not a wheel.

								Racing games are not our cup of tea, but after not playing these types of games for years we felt t was time to try playing them again.First this is not just about racing, it is also a vehicle simulator that shows the results of crashes if intentional.. There are challenges, competitions, multiple courses, a track editor, multiple style cars and engines to choose from and the ability to modify the vehicle.Second this is still a game in development.Third it is not a threat to any of the GTA games. They have their own draw.Fourth This game may operate much smoother with a steering wheel pedal combo.Lastly is the cost, although it is above the $20 mark, if you like racing sims you will want to add this to your collection.So everybody get your game on and get behind this steering wheel for a cruise.

Early Access Review
TL;DR summary:Overall BeamNG.drive is one of the best soft body car shenanigans simulator out there, and it's completely worth its price. I bought the alpha early on, about a year ago, and I'm still having fun with it now. If you like the physicsy simulationy type of sandbox game you'll definitely be impressed with BeamNG.drive and end up messing around with it for a long time (and that's not including the wide variety of mods available)!There's a racing mode and other new features coming out soon, and I hope they turn out as well as everything else.Regarding Next Car Game, NCG is more of a desruction derby focusing on wide areas and chunks of destruction with a ton of broken pieces flying around; it's more of an action-orientated game. BeamNG.drive is a realistic physics simulator sandbox. NCG and BeamNG.drive are both good at doing what they are designed to do, but in my view they're pretty different. TL;DR reviewy thing:Crash Physics: The physics are extremely realistic and efficient with minimal glitching; every crash inflicts different and varying amounts of damage upon each vehicle.Car Detail: The cars are detailed in terms of aesthetics (the detail of the exterior and interior of the vehicles) and mechanics (wheel torque, suspension, chassis integrity) with results extremely similar to their real-world counterparts.Graphics and Sound: The graphics are decent with no visual effect bugging as of now. The sound works for what it is but isn't made all that well; a sound overhaul is planned.Mods: The mods are plenty and great, very high quality. You can pilot airplanes and do the coolest trix.Controls: There are many controls and it is sometimes hard to press all the buttons needed to control vehicles. Vehicles can sometimes feel sticky or slippery.For those who are willing to take upon themselves the challenge of reading a huge block of text:Summary:BeamNG.drive is one of the most realistic car physics/damage simulators up to date. Utilizing a real-time soft-body physics engine powered by Torque3D, it successfully emulates breakable and malleable surfaces applied to cars. The physics demonstration that BeamNG.drive is capable of is nearly identical to real-world movement; footage of in-game crashes have been compared to real-world test crashes with minimal differences.Reviewy thing:Crash Physics: It's amazing how the physics are simulated, with every surface on every car bending and breaking differently in every situation (surfaces are warped in accordance to the surfaces they come in contact with resulting in unique damage, rather than calling up a stored ""damage model"" when a car hits something a la GTA car physics or the such). This is where the ""Beam"" of BeamNG.drive comes in. I'm not that knowledgeable about the details of the physics simulating but it can be thought of like a detailed, intricate grid on a surface with each point moving when it hits something. I have not encountered many bugs in the physics so far, but if pushed far beyond real-world limits the physics do cause model glitches. Sometimes meshes and textures will crumple and stretch weirdly after paricularly intensive crashes. For what it is, however, it works wonderfully and efficiently, even able to be run on a medium-powered laptop with some lag spikes only during intensive car mangling.Car Detail: Each car is crafted with a keen eye to their details; the mechanics of a vehicle and the aesthetics are both represented. Each car has its unique statistics, with varying engine types, suspension, handling, and et cetera. The handling can even be changed, with options for a sportscar-like experience, offroad handling, and other presets. (The actual in-game control handling can be changed as well, ranging from an arcade control scheme seen in most car games to a full, realistic ""driver's seat"" experience. However, as of now the control is sort of lackluster with a keyboard since the left and right keys make the steering wheel turn all the way to either side; the cars sometimes feel sticky or slippery.) The detailed aesthetics can also be changed, as the cars are modular and can have parts added and removed. This also ties in with the modding capabilities of the game, which I will get into in a bit. Because of all of the attention paid to making everything as realistic as possible, the seven vanilla cars each have their own unique feel and excel at different tasks (again much like their real-world counterparts).Graphics and Sound: In my opinion, there's not much to say about this aspect currently since the focus of BeamNG.drive is realistic physics simulation. The graphics are decent and look great when maxed out, but they're nothing special currently (as you can probably see in the trailer and screenshots). There are some post effects which help to smooth everything out a bit, and there are a spattering of particles here and there. The particles do add a lot of effect when used correctly in screenshots and cinematics. The camera following sometimes goes through the ground if a car is tumbling or spinning but overall works as it should, providing smooth views of third-person and first-person views (although there's no model actually driving the cars). That covers the basic graphics system, I think. The sound isn't as good as everything else, but it is clear and works its part. The engine sounds, tire screeches, and et cetera are the same in every situation on every car but the actual sound clips are clear and concise. In slow motion the sounds run in realtime and are very loud, but other than that I can't think of anything too jarring. There is some ambience as well, and it is decent. The developers are planning a sound overhaul, however, so I am looking forwards to that.Mods: The modding capabilities really expand the possibilities of BeamNG.drive, with more detailed vehicles, intricate maps, other fun and interesting mods. There are many high quality mods that have qualities comparable to the actual game. One of the most well-known modders on the BeamNG forums, DrowsySam, has even helped the devs with some things. Of course, as mods, they aren't completely perfect but as I said, most of them are top notch. There are even mods for planes, and althought the physics for those aren't as realistic and smooth as the car physics, they're still pretty awesome (the devs haven't had air travel possibilities in their mids yet so hopefully you can see how cool that is), I'm also not going to say too much about this, since you really just have to install some mods to get a sense of what they can do.Controls: The controls are a bit weird, with the arrow keys controlling vehicles, the numpad and a right-click-and-hold controlling the camera, and various other key combinations for respawning, changing gears (in manual control mode), switching vehicles, and activating slow motion to list a few of the commonly used commands. It works, but sometimes it is hard to access multiple commands, for example, when trying to record something (movement, camera angle, and slow motion for example).EDIT: Formatting and added something about Next Car Game.

Early Access Review
								Whilst I would recommend this game, there a few points I want to show.1) As a non-expert on cars it can be difficult when it comes to tuning when you have about 15 different sliders/values to change. It would be nice to have a few pre-sets I often found steering was difficult in a few cars (and I didn't understand what values/sliders to change to perhaps make it better) 2) This is a really fun 'sandbox' but to me it's not quite a game, if you want to spend your hours crashing cars a lot or zooming around then I'd say go for it. There's a local multi-player mode but if you're like me and you don't have friends in real life that will play with you then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯3) The price is expensive in comparison to what you're getting, just a suggestion but I would say about £10-£12 for this game max and you'd probably find you'd get a lot more sales.I'll come back to this game in the future and just have another looksie and see if these points mentioned have been addressed in a way. Overall this game is very advanced and the physics are really well done and when you crash the damage feels so realistic.9/10			"

								TrackIR support (just added) and dialing in the FFB has really brought the immersion to the next level. The game is also running very, very smoothly with very low input latency. Performance is easily 2x over what it was a year ago, let alone when they first put the tech demo on their website,Using high and low filtering at 30, slightly increased max FFB and overall ffb strengths and 600 sampling. Each car feels believably unique, even each variant. Right now, I consider the FFB to be excellent, better than games like dirt rally and iracing. The cement mixer is so much more immursive and alive than any ETS2+ trucks. The devs have consistently worked away at all core issues and have really made a pretty special simulator.  "

								A very fun physical driving game that does everything to crash your own car into trees, cliffs, barriers, other cars, water, explosives and from great heights or just make you a complete idiot and flip it upside down. With realistic physics, too. This game is highly customizable with mods including tracks and vehicles, whether it's a licensed car or something more original. Some areas are wide-open like in GTA and even one of the fans actually made an endless highway. Huge variety of props to smash or be smashed by cars. The AI system is good, but sometimes bots are a little stupid when it comes to multiple police cars chasing a high-speed Japanese car that looks like it's made by Porsche.In other words: go on and buy it.

								By far, my favorite Racing/Driving game at the moment. Amazing damage physics (as real as you will find), a promising future for the game play and content (Including an actual Semi to crush other vehicles with), and, of course, the open slate for modifications and level editors. I will admit, the controls are twitchy and keeping control is hard in this current state, but regardless, this game is a must have for any Automotive Enthusiast, no matter your involvement. The current customization may not be diverse, but it shows just how far they will take us into what you want your car to be. Truly, this is Automotive Heaven, it just isn't finished yet. Try the tech demo and feel for yourself:http://www.beamng.com/content/The biggest downside to this amazing game is the requirements to run it. I can run it on a smaller map with one vehicle, but even from that experience, i cannot wait to get a better PC, JUST for this game.			"

Slow motion + crashes = Recipe for a lovley crash.Overall: 94/100 Could improve things but amazing.Also the people who make this game (BeamNG) keep on updating it so if you want a game that is alive, Doesn't cost too much, Alot of mods, Realistic things. Then buy it now!			"

								I would like to pipe in and say that I absolutely love BeamNG Drive. There's nothing quite like it. It has its quirks, but as the game continues to mature, I find myself with less and less to complain about.Before you read further, let me advise you that you will need a beefy GPU for this game. I find it playable enough on my Nvidia GTX 960, and it's well optimised for what you're getting, but YMMV.Here's how I break the game down:+Unparalleled soft body vehicle physics model+Lots of beautiful, fully customizable stock cars that honestly just 'feel good' to drive+Awesome environments to drive around in+TONS of community content, most of which works and feels great. Installing mods is as easy as pressing a button.+The NG engine even supports aerial vehicles (No stock ones, but several quality mods for everything from bombers to helicopters)+Throw your car off a ♥♥♥♥ing cliff!!!! Reset, repeat.+Vehicles now catch on fire if you abuse them enough.+No huge races but the time rallies are a step in the right direction+Just go get yourself lost driving around in the jungle or desert. (If you just enjoy driving for what it is, you will LOVE this game.)-Requires a beefy computer. Not really a con if you have a quality rig, but buyer beware!-No multiplayer support (but there are rumors it's being worked on)Tl;dr: P̫͝͠r̛̲̤a̺̯̜̝̭͖͍i̶͟͏̙̘̭̱̹ş͎̀e̟͍̗̟ ̘̪̗̮̣̰̪ͅb̷̫͈e̸̡̢̼̼̜ ̖̜̯̝̹͔̝̰̮t̸̴̥̯̙̲͙͉͟ͅó̻̦̣̝̗̰͉̼ ̘̤͎͓͖̦͍͢͡É͏̲̗͢ͅT̮E̲̻̘R̸̵͈̟̳̭̺̪̜N̛҉̩̞͔̼͇̟̪̲A̺L̳̤̝̪̬ ̶̭͙̖̻̦Z͏̧̡̫͉A̧̮͙̕̕L̶̜̼̮̲̥̭̳͟G̨҉̴͙̱͖͕͕̰̙̞O͍̥͇̞̪͓͍ ͓̺̻̪͡f̼̝͖͍̰̟̤̺o̷̹̦̬̖͢r̴̴̛̻̝̩͈̯̜ͅ ̩̙̻̜̺̠̀t̵̛̗͎͚̬̠̝̥̕ͅh̘̰̫̠̗i̷̴͍̼̻̪͠s͏̴̢͖͓̱̞̺͎͍ ̧̯̺̞̯͇̭̕ͅq̨͉͇͔̪̝̀͞u̳͎̗̟̻̗͍̲̳ḁ̷̬͇̦̘͎̝͞l̻̱͡i̻̮ț̛͚̜̩̣̱̝̀͝y̨̳̭͉̠̥͓̝͡͠ ̧҉̹̣͖̖̙͍̘̯g̹͍͖̠̳͈̀á̷̺̹͍ḿ͕͈̖̫̙͚͜e̼͚̲̗͎̹͉͔.̘͖̝̻̹͎̪͟͡			"

								This is not a game in the traditional sense.It is however the most satisfying damage physics I've ever controlled in a peice of playable software.The 'scenarios' allow you to challenge yourself to various checkpoint based time trials against the clock. But this is only a sideline compared to free-roaming the maps in various iterations of a modest but broad selection of very well modelled vehicles.If the future GTAs, Project Cars or similar can wrangle this kind of powerful physics then the future is bright for ultra-realistic, satisfying vehicular gameplay.You shouldn't be turned off by the Early Access nature of the game. The level which the game is at currently IS worth £19 in my opinion. However this might seem steep to anyone who prefers a story-lead game with a much more led set of scenarios.8/10 - If the updates stay regular, WELL worth it.			"

								In BeamNG.drive you can almost destroy your car/vehicle any way you want from crashing it into something as fast as you can or taking a truck to go obliterate it.  It's only single player right now and hopefully multiplayer will be added around final release.  The physics can get a bit wonky and things will fall off your vehicle from no stress at all nearly. When you get stuck inside something, there is a reset button for your vehicle and it's great but if your stuck between a prop and a wall, it sometimes won't work. If you like realistic cars this game is for you, but you need a good computer to run it.  it's early access so things are supposed to happen that will be fixed like bushes acting as invincible blocks that can destroy your vehicle to shreds and invincible trees acting as spider web when you drive into them too fast.

								More of a test bed than a game in it's currents state. And I'm not sure it will ever be considered as an actual game with the limitations it hits with it's physics engine, however smashing cars into each other never gets old. If you prefur the destruction of cars and the ""What if"" tests. Such as what if two semi trucks sandwitched a coupe at 100mph. Then BeamNG is the game for you.If you want a racing experiance where you can compete for the best lap times, you're probabally never going to get that, however BeamNG has a lot of potential to be an extremly good Demolition Derby, and I hope they take that route other the racing route			"

Definatly better with high quality computers (learned that the hard way but still play it).

								Crap man.. Just realized I have yet to make a review! I have been a part of the BeamNG community since the game first came out as a pre-alpha back in 2013. And man, has this game seen some changes. It started out with probably 5 cars and a couple maps... Only 4 people were working on the game. But now several people from the community have started helping and turning BeamNG into what it is today. Amazing.Let me just say this is the best game ever. You can do absolutely whatever you want and then some. Just pick the game up. You wont regret it its super cheap. Also, this game has modding support, so youll never run out of things to do. Theres still tons of development coming your way with AMAZING developer. Go on, get involved with the community:)			"

								BeamNG.drive has a demo that you can download to try this game out that puts you in the slowest car on gridmap. I spent at least 12 hours with the demo before buying the full game.At it's core this game is simply great. My computer can't run most of the environments so I stick to freeroams on cliff and gridmap and it's just plain fun to smash cars in all sorts of different ways. My 8 y/o brother loves it too.Rather than waiting for a sale I paid full price for this game to show my support for the implementation soft-body physics. I hope this type of damage model becomes mainstream in the near future because it's simply incredible.			"

								Good stuff about the game below. Will update this as more updates come. Right now I'm guessing it's maybe 1% finished. The only content in the game are maps and cars (of which 99% is made by community). But the core is there. Also there are a couple of missions and races to try after the last big update.There are some amazing vehicle mods out there. And there are a lot of fun maps, too. Most people MIGHT get bored from the current state of the game though because there is almost nothing to do: You just load a map, choose a car, and crash it as you please. Or don't. You can drive around if you want. That's it. Oh you can add a stupid AI to follow you or run from you but that's about it. You can also add multiple AIs. They are also working on AI improvements as well.Now on to the good stuff: + I cannot emphasize enough how good the crashing mechanic is (flagship feature). It's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. The game's name derives from the fact that they are using the Beam technology on car design (I think it's their own engine). The cars are created out of beams. That's why crashes are so realistic and fun. Every beam gets deformed on its own, according to the applied force, the angle of the force, the momentum and♥♥♥♥♥♥+ Beautiful graphics. To my taste, this is cutting edge+ You can even mod your own engine sound+ Mod maps and cars, or download the ready ones+ Day/night concept is there (editable)+ Destruct your car in a variety of ways+ Multiple cameras (duh)+ Slow motion at your disposal+ You're in for a lot of laughs+ Or join the modding forums on the website and be surprised to find out that someone designed your dream car into the game. Now download and crush it.+ Career is coming at full release+ ♥♥♥♥in' A**The only con I can think of is the required system to play the game at it's full capacity. I'm sure they will optimize it further but right now as it is, the game needs a powerful computer to run. Especially when you spawn multiple cars to crash or enter a foresty area. When crashing multiple cars together, it might lag a lot on average computers.**It has a vast potential, and the devs are aiming for a free-roam, career thingy, in which you will be able to buy junk cars and reform them into racing machines or pretty eye candies, you will be able to complete jobs, missions, races, deliveries, derbies, free-roam, all of that.But that would be a long way off from now. They say the game will be in this phase for about a year from now. So buy at your own risk (not that it's a risk actually, there is just not any content right now).When this game gets finished, it might be the very first 'driving' game that I have given 10/10 my whole life. Because currently there isn't any open world 'driving' game with realistic driving concept which also includes careers and mods. There just isn't any. Any potential rival games that come close to this, either ruin it by sucking at graphics or by making it online, or by making it a linear racing game (don't even get me started on NFS series).So I recommend it for people who like to smash cars with the best possible physics available, and who like community made cars and maps, and a realistic driving.There is also wheel support with manual gears.

								I don't usually write reviews... ever actually. But I feel this game can't go without one. I've been playing this game since September of 2013 and it simply never gets old. There is a lot of talk about there not being much gameplay yet, which is partially true. It doesn't have a story mode or a campaign, (Not yet at least) but to be honest it doesn't need to. The normal sandbox mode is endless entertainment, and with the new addition of 'Scenarios', (Time trials and timed challenges) there is more playable content than ever. The scenarios are actually quite difficult and it will surely take many hours to complete them all. And on top of that, you can share your times with members on the forum to be put on a leaderboard. Aside from the scenarios though, it's really a game meant for imagination and experimentation. Just thinking of every way possible to wreck any car I want leaves endless possibilities. As a kid who grew up on racing games, I've always dreamed of a game where every action you have has an equal reaction. One where you actually have to drive carefully in order to succeed. And that's exactly what BeamNG is. You can spend endless hours on this game whether you're crashing cars, flying planes, (And even sailing ships, soon) offroading, stunting, and even content creating with the excellent mod support this game has. It may get boring after an hour or two of just driving around and exploring, but for some reason I always keep coming back to it. I'll admit, it's not for everyone. It requires patience, imagination, and a curious mind. But honestly, if you've ever been interested in doing outrageous things with vehicles that you could never do in real life, than this is the game you need to get. It offers a ridiculous number of possibilities with real-life outcomes. It's truly the most realistic driving game I've ever played.Pros:Insanely beautiful graphics.Lifelike soft-body physics.Enough maps, cars, and objects to keep you entertained for days.Multiple 'Scenarios' where you can test your time and driving skill.Very advanced settings so you can set EVERYTHING perfectly.Customizable UI with multiple interesting apps.Camera mode for easy, beautiful screenshots.Extremely realistic vehicles. The models/textures are nearly exact in every aspect.Working dashboards, gas tanks, lights, and trailers.Real-life aerodynamics, time, gravity, and physics.Crazy props to destroy your cars with.Realistic maps that can take hours to explore.Time trials on supported mapsAmazing forum community.Easy mod support from the talented modders on the forum.*Mods such as planes, boats, offroaders, machines, maps, skins, apps, and more.Relatively easy to mod yourself, if you have the time to learn.TRULY regular updates. It's a small team but they really stepped up.Cons:Takes a decent computer to run well.Probably boring if you aren't a little creative.Crashes often (But what can you expect when you slam a car into a wall at 300mph in a virtual physics engine that's early access?)I don't personally use a racing wheel, but I hear the game has little support for them. I'd look into that more if this applies to you.TL;DRIf you've ever wanted to see or do anything crazy with a vehicle that you can't do in real life, buy this game. It's one of the most good-looking games I've ever seen, and it's the most realistic physics simulator I've ever seen. If you are at all interested in it, just get it.*I'd like to make this very clear that I said ""on the forum"". Never download a mod that wasn't originally posted to the official BeamNG forum. Around the BeamNG community, a few Russian websites have become very well known for publishing false mods. They are simple vehicle models ripped off from somewhere on the internet and then slapped onto the jbeam (The code and skeleton that makes vehicles in this game crash and function) of an existing default vehicle. This results in, for example, a car that looks like a Lamborghini but handles and crashes like a Crown Vic. These mods could have viruses in them, and without a doubt will not function well. If you do insist to download these however, I believe I speak for the community when I say to not publish videos or pictures of them. Like I said, they don't function the way they're meant to and in short, just make the game look bad. I just thought I'd give a fair warning.			"

								As of 6/17/2015: EARLY ACCESS.In it's current state, it's more of a car accident simulator than an actual game, though there are a few pre-cursors to a career mode - a few challenges and such.   This aside, let's get on to the real deal here.     An absolutely hands-down realistic soft-body driving simulator, most likely more realistic than what you see in drivers training computer systems.  Not only can you shift gears (multiple transmission modes, arcade automatic, real auto, manual, manual with clutch), you can use signals, hazard lights, headlights/highbeams, and the signal stalks and shifter moves as you shift it - gauges work too and if you clobber the car so badly the check-engine light comes on!.  It's extremely well thought-out, and if you ever have played Rig-of-Rods, it's all the fun that was, and way way more fun.      Welcome to the ""Garry's Mod"" of CARS.  I can't really explain it better than that.  When you fly too fast through a corner, and understeer, and nail a tree, your car becomes a crumpled undriveable mess of mangled steel.  This isn't GTA, this is a real simulation @ 2000hz (hz=times per second), with thousands of bits for each car.  Due to this, you need a beefy CPU to run this game well and a decent video card to go with it.  Anything i5/i7 or Phenom II quad core or better should run this, and it should be playable on an APU setup or i3 setup without too much fuss, though you might slow it down if you use the commercial truck as it has considerably more points to process.    MODS:  Loads of user-generated content for both vehicles and terrains (maps, levels etc), are available on the games website once you purchase the game.  You won't be let down by this as myself I am a big fan of game modding.  This program also INCLUDES ITS OWN LEVEL EDITOR INSIDE!  Woohoo!  More fun, and it's pretty intuitive to use, your mileage may vary.      For it's asking price, it's well worth it.  While it's not yet complete, this is more an adults game or a mechanics toy.  If you love cars, and realism, do give this a go!  You can even get computer controlled AI opponents to use if you dig around through the menus and figure it out - though in it's current state, it's either basic pursuit or to FLEE.  Can be quite fun near a steep cliff!     You can even change things like GRAVITY (or reverse gravity!) or make it the gravity of the SUN *CRUNCH*.  Wind direction/speed and cloud cover/fog can all be changed - though I am not sure if you can make it rain (yet) or not.   There's no music yet, and the sounds are quite basic at this point, but there is enough audio feedback to know what's going on, and it will be worked on more.  The graphics are beautiful (I think it's the crytek crysis 3 engine - don't quote me on it though) - and entirely up to par with today's game environments - but still scalable to your PC.  I have a recent model i7 and a radeon 7850 2gb and it runs this quite well with next to no lag.  SSD recommended but by no means required.  Some user levels can be 2gb so if you don't like to wait, put this on your SSD.   Keep in mind, when the game updates, you will have to re-install your mods (this won't usually be the case post-release but in pre-release early access it is, so just be warned!).  Keep your favorite mods backed up.    All in all, it's a good program for adults, and something to show your kid WHY NOT TO DRIVE TOO FAST!    A great program for the soon-to-be-driving teen-age member of your family!  Best used with a steering wheel or analog gamepad, as it may take quite a bit of time to get used to driving with a keyboard - it's that realistic.AGAIN:  HAVE AN ANALOG GAMEPAD OR STEERING WHEEL FOR THIS GAME, it's an absolute @$^# to drive with a keyboard (but it can be done, but you will crash A LOT).  Use the 'Covet' if you have only a keyboard and GO SLOW.Fun times - whole-heartedly recommended - a well made program!  I seriously have nothing bad to say on this one other than the fact that it's NOT done yet (but it will be!).Update 11/9/2015:  Played a demo-derby scenario - most awesome demo derby ever since Destruction Derby for dos in the mid-to-late 90's.  This is available on the beamng website under mods - you must try it!  Also, races with jumps and Honda spoon Civics (""Covet"") and that's fun as can be.  You must give this game a shot, for 25 USD you can't go wrong!Update 12/2015:  Got a SCHOOL BUS vehicle out of the mods section on the game's web site, and a map with a large CLIFF.  Much fun & hilarity ensued.  Many pixels were injured in the making of that one.  Would bust the bus again 10/10.Update 1/1/2016:  Two recent updates have brought game version to 0.5.1, Two new cars, turbo and tuning systems galore, being able to mod the vehicle like you could back in STREET LEGAL, it's really becoming an awesome game/simulator.  More options now, more sounds (yay!), cars can catch fire, and the two new cars mentioned above (a vintage old 1950s car, and a 1988 import sedan) are pretty rockin' awesome.  Back to more fun on the large-cliff-map!			"

								BeamNG interview between me and myself.Me: So how do you like BeamNG?Myself: I love crashing cars!Me: There are many games where you can smash cars. What makes this game so great?Myself: Three words. Soft. Body. Physics.Me: Soft body physics? Can you elaborate?Myself: Realistic and unlimited vehicle body deformation. More than any game before it. Before BeamNG there was Rigs of Rods. Burnout 3: Takedown has the best vehicular damage in the Burnout series. But that game did not simulate every component of the vehicle. Carmagedon, Dirt, Grid, Flatout and Crashtime all have pretty amazing vehicle physics. BNG is just leaps and bounds ahead of everyone.Me: Would you recommend the game, even in the early access state?Myself: Absolutely yes! If your PC can handle it. This is probably the only thing holding the game back. The game is still a work in progress so at times the game runs great, other times not so much. There is a mod community already making vehicles for the game. These can be hit and miss as different versions of the game come out compatiblity changes. So if you find a car that just falls apart you might have to uninstall that mod. The developer content in the game is great so far. Constantly adding new vehicles, maps and scenarios to play. I just love to load up a map and play around with the many vehicle types. It's essentially a physics playground of vehiclular vehicle slaughter.Me: Wow! that is a lot to take in. Hopefully this answered some questions for the community looking to buy.Myself: Well if you want you can swing over to my profile page and check out some of the screenshots that I took in game.Me: Great. I will. Thank you for our time.			"

								It's not really a driving game, it's more of a car simulator. Like Spintires, but with a heavy focus on soft body destruction. The video below shows some real life car crashes recreated in beam.ng and it should really drive home what an impressive piece of software this is. Its fun to try things that would get you killed in real life and watch how a car would respond, but it;s also fun just tooling around in really accurately physics modeled cars and watch your pick up truck stall out on a steep incline, or shift gears too quick and throw a rod, or whatever. Also there are tons of things to download on the forums where there is a huge community of moders. It's not a racing game or whatever but it's a very cool thing and if you are on the fence I would certainly recommend it.

								A perfectly fine game to pass some down time and relieve stress.The developers are great, the modding community is great (stay away from the forums, they are cancer) and the time spent in game is great.Plenty of cars, varied maps and gameplay options to keep you interested for a little while. It can get boring if you can't think up too much to do since it's still just a glorified simulator. If you can find fun, you will be able to play for hours thanks to the freedom you have in the game.The graphics are pretty trashy, the game runs on an engine that for all intents and purposes came out in 2002. Most of the other games in the engine are 2d platformer games. It runs like a person with downs syndrome. I have 2 gtx 970s, and since the engine does not take advantage of SLI, it only uses one. I struggle to keep 60fps on some parts of some maps, and forget about that with more than one vehicle. This is on a mix of medium-high setting with AA disabled, and dynamic reflections set to about medium. For reference, I can run GTA V at 90+ FPS on ultra settings no problem. Looks worse than GTA V and runs worse than GTA V. Do not buy if you can't stand terrible graphics.The updates are somewhat frequent, there are probably about 30 people full time working on it and maybe they push an update a month an a half. Last update was october 4th, and the update before that came out July 27th. Each update usually adds a new car, and adds or overhauls a driving mechanic. The october 4th update added campaigns, with no new car, the July update added brake thermals, the update before that added engine thermals, and the next update will hopefully add new drivetrain phtsics.I'm rambling here. Its a good game.			"

								This is a great game.  I've always loved driving games that simulated damage and whatnot.  Need for Speed once used to do this, and I loved it.  Only when they started making cars only get a scratch for hitting a wall at 200 mph, did I start to lose interest.  BeamNG.Drive has revived the driving simulator for me with its amazing soft body physics, and fully simulated components!Ya know when you hit a curb in a car going too fast, and your alignment is all out of whack, or worse, you break something?  Yeah, that can happen in this game.  I'd highly recommend playing this with a bare minimum of a game pad.  If you have a Yolk and pedals, or a steering wheel and pedals, that would be even better.The roads aren't all smooth and perfect either, watch out for those potholes, they'll really mess you up.

								The physics and car deformation is solid and reliable, however I have encountered some pretty game breaking bugs, the developers have been pretty consistent with patchs and hotfixes. Their own created cars and models are a nice touch too and mod support just makes the game much better. Overall a great simulator but the driving can feel very chuggy and uncontrollable. Great simulator, above average game.			"

								This is a great game.  I've always loved driving games that simulated damage and whatnot.  Need for Speed once used to do this, and I loved it.  Only when they started making cars only get a scratch for hitting a wall at 200 mph, did I start to lose interest.  BeamNG.Drive has revived the driving simulator for me with its amazing soft body physics, and fully simulated components!Ya know when you hit a curb in a car going too fast, and your alignment is all out of whack, or worse, you break something?  Yeah, that can happen in this game.  I'd highly recommend playing this with a bare minimum of a game pad.  If you have a Yolk and pedals, or a steering wheel and pedals, that would be even better.The roads aren't all smooth and perfect either, watch out for those potholes, they'll really mess you up.  Even patches where the road has been repaired has a slight bumb, which at 80 miles per hour, is enough quite often to send you flipping end over end, ultimately wrapping your car around a tree!Drive dangerously my friends, it's a blast!

Early Access Review
Some of the finest physics I've seen.BeamNG.drive is a driving game/tech demo hybrid with an impressive amount of detail and surprisingly addicting. Having started as a proof-of-concept in the CryEngine by the former developers of Rigs of Rods - another very similar, more rudimentary game focusing on trucks and heavy vehicles, it has since switched to the Torque3D engine to handle the physics.There's no storyline or career as of yet. Updates have added a selection of campaigns to complete, such as a driver's license test and wrecking stuff up.It's a pretty game, for sure, but don't go nuts with the dynamic car reflections if you treasure your framerate. Rather odd post-processing artifacts, or that might be me just not knowing how to work with them. Crashes look a little bland without particles or extra bits flying out.Sounds remain fairly basic, with the standard game offering a grand total of two distinct engine notes without mods: an Inline 4 and a V6/V8. No soundtrack, either. The variety of impact, crash and general effects is increasing, at least.The selling point lies in the revolutionary soft body physics. At the expense of requiring an ever more powerful CPU to simulate multiple cars interacting with each other, you get what is possibly the most accurate car deformation, period. While it remains prone to clipping, gripping and other odd issues, 99% of the time it is consistent and logical.An ever expanding list of official cars cover more or less any stereotype conceivable, and if you can think of more, there's mods to remedy that too. You can drive a 4-wheel steering sedan, a pickup truck for your hillbilly rock climbing purposes, a surprisingly fun and nimble hatchback, a dangerously difficult 70's supercar, and many, many more. All of them, of course, have varying tolerances to crashes from whichever direction, but also a healthy collection of parts to choose from. Slap a stage 4 supercharger kit on your muscle car and rocket to terrifying speeds - and send your engine temperature shooting, your wheels screeching due to no grip, and your hapless car careening into walls.It is such a robust and well built engine that it can simulate airplanes and helicopters, lift and drag, and all sorts of intricate stages of mechanical failures like blown engine gaskets, fried piston rings, bent connecting rods, broken driveshafts, snapped axles, faded-out brakes, so on and so forth. It has taken a few years to get to this point, but man: it is the most impressive evolution of a game I've ever seen, from release until now.Mods further increase the game's variety, with aforementioned planes, helicopters, and varying flavours of land vehicles and configurations. Simple to install and remove (usually).Updates are somewhat slow to deliver, but when they land, you should expect a couple more cars, a lot more car variation, and several new, possibly experimental systems to improve the simulation aspects of the game. I dare say the devs have picked up significant momentum as of late, and they're eeking ever closer to proper LAN, or even online multiplayer. Until then, we have replays and AI control to bring our destruction derby and ""Slightly more sensible Crash Junction"" dreams to life.It is totally worth the money if you're a car/physics nut. It surely is deep in its mechanics, but the current content is a bit too thinly spread to easily warrant a purchase for anyone else; patience is a more wise idea when tackling Early Access titles, even better developed ones such as this.

								This is deformable vehicle physics at it's finest. It looks good and is enjoyable to drive. You can use a controller, wheel/pedals or keyboard for controls. Both the controller and the wheel settings are configurable. Vehicle customization is easy and intuitive while the track selection is just as pleasant. You can hop right in and go if You choose. You can play with objectives. You can even build your own vehicles with a little external editing. I have seen airplanes and boats that work perfectly. There are not many limitations with this one. I recommend this for the advanced vehicle tinkerer or modeler. I also recommend this to everyone who is into driving simulators and games as this is a perfect companion to anything you are currently driving.			"

								This is definitely one of the best racing games I've ever played.  Its fun, realistic, and creative, thanks to the dedicated mod community and wonderful devs who keep us updated on their website beamng.com/blogs/ with a weekly summary of their work.  I've put at least 20 hours into the game before it came on Steam, and I have no intention of stopping.  This game already has no ceiling to how amazing it can be, and there isn't even any sort of structure to the gameplay.  Its a simple load map, load vehicle, drive to your heart's content affair that is both incredibly relaxing and engagig.  I love making rally courses to run through without wrecking and just running through them over and over.  There is no time limit, no opponents, and no objectives.  Only you, the car, and the road.  The great bit is that each game is a new adventure because there aren't any rules as to where you can and can't go, leaving it up to you to decide how to explore and play with the environment you're given.  And then there is the main selling point of this game: the crash physics.  How the devs did it, I have no idea.  Watching your car get bent in half around a tree after a botched high-speed turn is a sight like no other.  For those of us hell-bent on obliderating our cars, there is a map called ""Insane Testing"" by Insanegaz on the mod forums featuring spikes, loops, giant stairs, huge drops, high speed cliff races, and all kinds of terrains to smash your vehicle on.  As well as being a great game to play, it is also a great game to mod.  The world editor can be accessed by pressing F12 in game, and it uses a simple and intuitive UI that makes it easy to create your own content.  On the coding side, everything is done in LUA, which is incredibly simple to learn.  Installing mods is as easy as downloading one from the forums, unzipping the package and dropping the folder into the appopriate directory within the game file (""Levels"" for new maps, ""Vehicles"" for new cars, etc.).Of course, there are a few problems with the game, but that is to be expected of a private Alpha build.  The engine sound is the same for all cars, and the tire screech is not pleasant either.  There is currently no multiplayer, although I expect that to come eventually.   At the time of writing, the dev team is in the process of crafting a massive update nicknamed the ""Race Update"" because it is to add a structured race system complete with laps, checkpoints, and working AI (non-player vehicles are currently a feature, and they do have AI, but only ""Flee from player"" and ""Chase player"", both of which are tons of fun already).  Some of the controls are a little obtuse (I'm sure they're just placeholders that will be changed by Beta), and there isn't any GUI for customizing your controls.  In fact, you have to find your inputmaps.dae file and manually edit things, which is a little annoying, but not a game-killer.  While the crash physics are amazing, the rest of the graphics fall a little short.  As a whole, the textures are somewhat lifeless and the lighting isn't advanced enough yet to add a solid tonal feel to the game.  BUT, the game isn't anywhere close to being done and I am quite impressed at the quality and sheer amount of fun present in this piece of software.			"

								At first I saw this game as a fun crash simulator. As I played more, I became fascinated at how realistic the driving physics are, despite employing a completely different paradigm to anything else. In the past, i've found physics based titles (not just car games) to have a plethora of silly physics glitches, making them difficult to play or impossible to take seriously. I bought a Thrustmaster T300RS Racing wheel recently, and despite having a dozen other car games in my collection, I find myself coming back to this one. It really shines with a wheel, and you'll find that the force feedback is a unique experience compared to anything else. Oh and the crashes are spectacular of course.Recommended.PROS+ Surprisingly nice graphics, looks almost raytraced at times+ Novel approach to vehicle handling that that is fun but realistic+ Industry-leading softbody physics+ Good controller support, with support for shifters and clutch pedals. I'm even using an old joystick as a handbrake.+ Force feedback for wheels is great when tuned+ Mod support; more vehicles, more maps, more funCONS- Poor performance on a 980 Ti a good bit of the time. 45-50 FPS in a lot of maps.- Needs some tweaking to get ingame steering wheels to turn 1:1 with your wheel controller- No multiplayer... yetNEUTRAL- VR support better be on the roadmap- Steam Workshop would be better than the current mod install system			"

								This game exists solely to show off the soft body physics of the cars.  That being said, it does it in spectacular form.  Its absolutely hilarious.  At this point, the game is in alpha, which they make very clear going in, so as it is at the time of this writing, there's not a lot of content.  I've also come across a couple of bugs, but its pretty stable as a whole.  There are several maps that are fully explorable, a handful of vehicles with different variations, and some scenarios to play with are available, but it's best to try and make your own fun.  The game supports mods as well, but I haven't been able to get any to work yet.  Its thoroughly entertaining overall, so I am excited to see what else gets added to the game.			"

								As an early access game at the moment BeamNG Drive does the job quite well as a simulation and physics based driving game. It has a pretty robust physics engine so a lot of the times everything happening on screen was just pure insanity but in a good way. I think of it as Goat Simulator with a car but with more to offer and hours of fun.It's the perfect time waster when I wanna sit down and play a game that has no boundries at all and it keeps getting better with frequent updates that add a lot to the game. I do reccommend you check it out even in Early Access as the $25 is perfect for the amount of content you're getting all together.

								It's actually pretty good. You do need to mind the system requirements though as the graphics look nice but hit your system hard especially on starting a session since the game loads the entire map and every little part on every car at once. As for the gameplay the collision effects are really well done and you can do whatever you want to. The sound effects really are poor and fake sounding though as most mobile games have better sound effects and the handling of the cars is unrealistically poor. But it does have pretty fun levels and challenges you can do to make you realize just how fragile cars are. Like oh you hit a rock at 5mph now your steering needs to be fixed. It's coming across like a vehicle based Gmod since you can also just mess around with physics. But like Gmod it does lack content at its base level and so mods and multiplayer are needed to really make the game great. Unfortunately the modding is not very streamlined and would be better through the steam workshop or a dedicated mod site like nexus. If you want to add real cars you need to search around for them on all sorts of sites and clearing the cache to fix texture bugs removes them you'll always need to keep backups. In the end it's just a fairly fun way to pass some time but the mechanics and sound aren't polished enough to get immersed into it. Because there is no real objective it's hard to call it a game. It's more like software with games in it and mostly challenges you make for yourself right now. Gotta use your imagination until it gets to the point where you don't have to.Overall it's pretty good for an alpha car/physics sim but nowhere near beta or release quality. I'd wait for proper mod support unless you are a car enthusiast in which case I'd suggest buying it whenever it is on sale.			"

								BeamNG Drive Early Access. I bought this game a while back and I finally got a Steam key. So here is my review. BeamNG Drive is a driving simulator but not really. I think it is more of a vehicle crash simulator. The crash physics are great and the driving physics are getting there. I really like it. The biggest thing that bugs me is the computer performance. Now, I may not have a gaming PC but I can play other games on medium-high graphics and have no trouble. But on this game, it struggles. A little problem is clipping and fall-through. Clipping is when I crash into another vehicle and the textures clip into each other. Therefore wedging the cars together. Fall-through is my term when a car falls through another car. For example, loading the hatchback into the box truck (of course I remove the doors). I drive the car in and it falls out the bottom of the truck. The bad parts are little enough where the good parts stand out. Overall, a great game. I recommend it.			"

								I love Beamng.drive. I just hooked up my Xbox One controller to it and I've been having a blast. There are so many community created maps and vehicles and such. Physics are amazing.Well, I was having a blast.Now, as of around the 23rd, whenever I am on the start screen, I move my mouse the slightest inch and my frames drop to 0. And then I wait. And then they go back up to 60 ish, way less than what I was getting before this issue happened, when I was getting around 300-500 fps. This only affects the menu screen, but then when I finally load into the map, it brings me to my second issue, below.I have since lost all my vehicles and maps, and whenever I go into the files to make sure they weren't deleted, they are there. But in-game, they are simply not there. Gone like they were never there in the first place. Again, it's a beautiful game, with plenty of things to mess around with, and create some painstakingly accurate car crashes, if that's what you want. The physics are accurate down to the smallest dent, and I'm waiting for the multiplayer so that we can all turn our cars and trucks into flattened pancakes of metal.I'm checking the recommended box, just because I know that the developers can easily get over this simple, but very irritating issue.Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Beamng, and I will play again.

								I played a lot of video games in my youth. But I put them away when I reached adulthood. But one day I saw the BeamNG Drive trailer and was impressed. And so for the first time in about 20 years, I bought a video game.  Yes, only a game this good could break my 20 year drought!This is seriously the best video game I have ever played! The game offers the rare combination of being simple yet profound. It's uncomplicated to play, but allows you to do so much. The producers continue to innovate with each new update, making the game better and better and more interesting. The graphics and maps are often visually stunning with incredible detail. Many of the maps are so interesting with so much to do, they could almost be separate video games themselves. Plus, I love how other people can create maps, vehicles and props for the game. I also love the flexibility the game provides. In free roam, you can make up your own missions and goals. As well, if you're short on time, you can teleport to any place on the map, rather than spend time driving there. One of the game's best features is the soft-body physics technology, which makes crashes exceedingly realistic. Plus, there are almost endless ways you can damage and crash your car. It never gets old! It's so powerful that rather than merely playing a game, you're having a new experience! Just be aware the game is demanding on your computer. A graphics card is recommended but not required, if you have a pretty good computer. However, a few minor  features in the game may not available without a graphics card.In sum, BeamNG Drive equals video games at their best. BeamNG Drive is the quintessential driving, crashing and racing video game and the gold standard. I believe this game will be the top video game of the 21st century. Don't miss out and give it a whirl!			"

								This review is based on the alpha version of the game, up to the date August 11th, 2014.If you like realism, destruction, and cars, this is the game for you. I'd like to begin by discussing what exactly Drive is. Drive is a state-of-the-art physics simulator that runs Torque 3D as the main physics engine. In this environment, every movement and input is calculted and recalculted over and over again as the game moves. So, as you come around a corner with your tail out, the computer is taking your car's weight, road surface, throttle, brake, gas, size of the contact patch of the tires, and many more variables into account every second. This allows the game to make an accurate representation of what is going on. Continuing with my example, if you nicked a bump in the road, millions more calcultions would take place, throwing the car around and whatnot. Another important feature that is simulated is air, which, for the time being, is being experimented with.""So, what do you do in this physics game?"" Well, most of us from the beginning have been obsessed with cars and destroying them, so, that's what we do. We take vans and drop them onto hatchbacks; we take hatchs, and put jets on them, and then run them into the wall at 300mph. We also create the game. Due to the producing company's small size (under 15 people total at last check), the community up until now has aided in adding content to the game in the form of maps, vehicles, UI apps (compass, speedo's, tachs, etc), and more. Others constantly push the game, such as accidently making a working plane and several helicopters that are flyable (albiet with primitive controls, depending on the model). As a gamer, having all of this content available for free is awesome. And it's usually good quality stuff that the creators have put hours and weeks into. And it's free. ""I'm a creator/artist/coder/computer wizz. How can I get involved?""I'm not sure how this'll work with the game porting over to Steam, but up until now, you would do whatever you'd normally create aand then put in the game. It's quite simple, and the game itself is built to be modded easily (the devs even have a wiki on how to do it). Modelors can make their models in any 3D program, export to COLLADA, create a ""JBeam"" file, and you're in. Obviously it takes more than just that, but it's a very straight-forward process that even a beginner could do successfully.""Should I buy this?""Yes. There's more in the game that can be covered in this review without getting boring, but it is an extremely well-done game. Even though it's only in alpha, it's a pretty good game. Tech support from the community and devs is great, and gme-wide issues are quickly resolved. The physics are great and getting better, the view is spectacular, and who doesn't like smashing cars into each other? Oh, and did I mention the DLC is free? The DLC is free.			"

Early Access Review
								If you love cars and all the physic's that go with them, then this game is for you. If' you're looking for the next racing game however, keep looking. BeamNG is the most realistic physic's simulatior I've ever played, is it perfect? Absolutly not. But it's very very good, among the best of the few games it compares to. It is so easy to turn on some music, or listen to book on tape and get lost for hours on end just driving around in your sandbox, racing, crashing, towing, testing or just exploring. Perhaps most importantly the dev's actually care about this game...One of the drawbacks to buying / playing early access game's is that it is often a gamble. A lot time's the devs become tired with their product and halt devolpment all together, leaving you with a hole in your wallet and a half finished product that'll never be more than that. That however, is not the case here. I owned this game for almost a year now, and throughout that year I have witnessed consistent improvements, patch's and added content. I cannot praise this game enough, I don't have the time to invest thousands of hours playing games like some people do. But I beleive this is my second most played game on steam...Only surpassed by Skyrim, and for the record BeamNG is closing fast on my Skyrim hours. The game has a decent arsenal of vehicles, ranging from your run of the mill work truck (which can modified to suit your taste) to Race cars, to Semi tractor trailers. And the fact, that this game is Steam Workshop compatible mean's that even more vehicle's and track's are just a click away!I'm trying to think of some potential ''con's'' to weigh in with all the ''pro's'' that go with this game. Personally I would like to see even more customization implimented into the game, such as the ability to tune gear ratio's in the transmission and fine tune things like aero dynamics. It would also be nice to be able to add specific upgrade's to your vehicle's engine. As it stand's right now, most vehicle's have Stage 1 Stage 2 and Stage 3 engine tune's and/or intake's that give you three stage's of horsepower/torque. But that's really just cherry picking on my behalf. Let's see what else, For those of you who enjoy playing with others...This is not your game. To my knowledge it currently does not have any form of multiplayer. No internet race's, I heard one time that it has split screen playability, but it's not something I've ever tried to use. I've heard some complaint's that this game only run's good on bad♥♥♥♥♥desktops, which is not completely true, however their's some truth in that statement. My current desktop was top the of line...Eight years ago, which my graphic's turned down a bit I can run most of BeamNG just fine. Howver, until I get a new computer I cannot play on certian level's...Like Moab, it's just to much for my old machine. On the side of sound, it's currently fairly weak. All vehicle's sound the same, a turbo I4 sounds excatly the same as a modified big block V8 in this game, so there isn't a huge veriety in that area, but hopefully that'll be improved upon in future patch's...Personally I just play with the sound off and listen to Reddit horror stories on Youtube while playing. With that said, It's time to tally up the Pro's and Con's.(Pros)AMAZING Physics.Reliable Devs who invest in their product to make consistent improvementsPotential to get lost for hours playing.Immense depth in level's, lot's of exploration to be done.Decent veriety of vehicle's ranging from Pickups to Race cars to Semi's.Supports Steam Workshop, meaning downloadedable vehicle's and tracks are just a click away.(Cons)Taxing to run at high resolution.Needs a little more depth in vehicle tuning.Lame sound effects.In it's current state I give this game a solid (9/10)It was worth every penny I spent on it. I hope you enjoyed this review! "

								Pretty fun simulator, so far with you can do a good amount of stuff and screw-around. Overall it looks great and is not that demanding on your hardware as long as you have a Nvidia 750 or better. Also they are obviously adding more and more to the simulator so if you see this on sale for less than $20 and you like simulators then get it, cause you won't regret it!			"

								This game is an excelent buy. It has hands down the best vehicular physics engine on the market. Few details are forgotten, the physics engine even processes the tork of applying gas/brake. With different capabilities like time slowing you can watch crashes in beautiful slow motion. Ontop of that it has mod support so you can make the game to be what you want. One of the best $25 I've spend on steam.			"

								This game has the most realistic vehilce damage engine and vehicle part simulator that I have ever experienced. Each vehicle has fully modeled out parts, including everything from the tires, to the interiors, to the license plates. These models allow for the game to deliver a fully satisfying damage engine that is true to life and unlike any other. The game now also features multiplayer and different driving scenarios.  Hands down this game is worth it! Get It!			"

								I played a lot of video games in my youth. But I put them away when I reached adulthood. But one day I saw the BeamNG Drive trailer and was impressed. And so for the first time in about 20 years, I bought a video game.  Yes, only a game this good could break my 20 year drought!This is seriously the best video game I have ever played! The game offers the rare combination of being simple yet profound. It's uncomplicated to play, but allows you to do so much. The producers continue to innovate with each new update, making the game better and better and more interesting. The graphics and maps are often visually stunning with incredible detail. Many of the maps are so interesting with so much to do, they could almost be separate video games themselves. Plus, I love how other people can create maps, vehicles and props for the game. I also love the flexibility the game provides. In free roam, you can make up your own missions and goals. As well, if you're short on time, you can teleport to any place on the map, rather than spend time driving there. One of the game's best features is the soft-body physics technology, which makes crashes exceedingly realistic. Plus, there are almost endless ways you can damage and crash your car. It never gets old! It's so powerful that rather than merely playing a game, you're having a new experience! Just be aware the game is demanding on your computer. A graphics card is recommended but not required, if you have a pretty good computer. However, a few minor  features in the game may not available without a graphics card.In sum, BeamNG Drive equals video games at their best. BeamNG Drive is the quintessential driving, crashing and racing video game and the gold standard. I believe this game will be the top video game of the 21st century. Don't miss out and give it a whirl!			"

								I think this game is amazing, being still in a alpha it has enough in the game already to make it fun not to mention it has a awesome modding community. But the as is game does have its problems. Such as car engine sounds (its the same sound for all the cars). And no controller support right out of the box so to speak. There is ways to get the controller support but its though a third party and its difficult to get it working. But the one major problem is the handling. Its almost impossible to keep the cars going in a straight line with a keyboard and mouse. its easier if you have a racing wheel like a G27 but not everyone does. Hopefully in the future they will sort all this out as the game goes into beta. I think there is a great future ahead for this game as long as the devs don't give up.			"

								I'll be blunt, currently the cars still slip slide around the place with ridiculously low traction, and this game has been in early release for an incredibly long time. That being said, I don't care. I just drive around, crash cars on occasion, but mostly set up scenarios for myself. Sometimes I drive the truck around like I'm making a delivery, other times I'm your stereotypical teenage loser in a crappy car with a loud exhaust. I never play this game for hours on end, but I will always return to it time and time again to just unwind and play around			"

								If you like cars and crashing cars this is the game for you. Beamng Drive is a soft body physics game where you can crash cars, throw cars off cliffs, bend cars, customize your cars and then crash them, or just test the suspension. Ive been waiting forever for a game like this to come out and i think it was worth the wait. I love this game to bits but there are some cons: It lags, (a bit) it can be pretty glitchy sometimes, you do need a pretty beefy computer to run it, it crashes sometimes but not to much. The pros about this game: its physics are amazing, cars are very detailed from the interors to the exterors, abunch of cars to choose from, the mods are awesome, there are a few maps to choose from, maps are detailed. This is a awesome game and if you have a pretty good computer and you like crashing cars or if you just like cars this is a game for you. Its totaly worth the $20.   :3			"

								Alright, so I've been following softbody physics games since rigs of rods and I was sceptical about buying beam.ng drive as I felt that although there was LOADS of potential it would never achieve it. I however, took the risk and it has been one of the best buys I have ever made. Yes, the game is in alpha and isn't perfect but it's great to muck around on, crash and tune some sick cars has brilliant crash physics ( and physics in general ) and has wicked graphics. So, to those questioning a purchase of this game, I recommend this game very much !			"

								It's actually pretty good. You do need to mind the system requirements though as the graphics look nice but hit your system hard especially on starting a session since the game loads the entire map and every little part on every car at once. As for the gameplay the collision effects are really well done and you can do whatever you want to. The sound effects really are poor and fake sounding though as most mobile games have better sound effects and the handling of the cars is unrealistically poor. But it does have pretty fun levels and challenges you can do to make you realize just how fragile cars are. Like oh you hit a rock at 5mph now your steering needs to be fixed. It's coming across like a vehicle based Gmod since you can also just mess around with physics. But like Gmod it does lack content at its base level and so mods and multiplayer are needed to really make the game great. Unfortunately the modding is not very streamlined and would be better through the steam workshop or a dedicated mod site like nexus. If you want to add real cars you need to search around for them on all sorts of sites and clearing the cache to fix texture bugs removes them you'll always need to keep backups. In the end it's just a fairly fun way to pass some time but the mechanics and sound aren't polished enough to get immersed into it. Because there is no real objective it's hard to call it a game. It's more like software with games in it and mostly challenges you make for yourself right now. Gotta use your imagination until it gets to the point where you don't have to.Overall it's pretty good for an alpha car/physics sim but nowhere near beta or release quality. I'd wait for proper mod support unless you are a car enthusiast in which case I'd suggest buying it whenever it is on sale.			"

								I have been playing this game for quite some time, months before this early access release on steam. I have to say, as a game in and of itself, it isn't great, but the destruction is very satisfying, and it is VERY fun to play around with different things. There are also plenty of mods on the internet, so you can add content, although it is not always stable. With that being said, I think this game should be bought because of the technology, and the possible implications of these same soft body physics in future games. If they really get this right, I think we could have some really incredible racing sims among other things. Don't get me wrong, though, I really do enjoy playing the game in its current state, but I think you should buy it for the possibility of some amazing games in the future with similar soft-body collision physics.

								This game. This god damn game. I have had this game for around 2 years, give or take a few months, and I have got my money back 10 fold. I have downloaded more mods than you can shake a giant stick at and never found it boring. With the steam release I have been more than impressed with the content, everything seems to be completely stable and one of the most beautiful games to look at, not only graphically but also physically. I have been so impressed with this game I have even bought it twice! When I lost my account a while back, I decided that I should help the developers out a bit and just buy it again! There are games like Wreckfest, which i own, but I have never seen content being added this fast and with this quality. Just buy this game. I would of recommended it more at it's old price, £9.99, but still at £18.99 it's still worth every penny. You may not like this game, you may not like it at it's current state, but just give it a go. Steam have refunds now so you can return it if it really isn't your thing, but I would recommend keeping it for a while just to see where it is going. I would also sign up to the forums of BeamNG, they have a really great community that I am proud to call myself part of. This game is going to places you cant even imagine. Get along for the ride.

The menus aren't great and some game features are a bit over complicated to navigate. There's no real multiplayer yet either. But the developers are very active and have layed out their plans for the future which looks to take care of all the issues I've had with the game. I highly recommend getting in on this game early.

The controls are a bit confusing too, but they are good, for people who use a controller, not if you use a keyboard, because if you do, sorry.Bad things aside, this game is incredibly enjoyable, and with mods it gets even better.

								I'll be blunt, currently the cars still slip slide around the place with ridiculously low traction, and this game has been in early release for an incredibly long time. That being said, I don't care. I just drive around, crash cars on occasion, but mostly set up scenarios for myself. Sometimes I drive the truck around like I'm making a delivery, other times I'm your stereotypical teenage loser in a crappy car with a loud exhaust. I never play this game for hours on end, but I will always return to it time and time again to just unwind and play around			"

								It's only in it's alpha stage, and it's already really amazing. The customization and the physics are crazy. It might not seem much, but if you're into crashing cars, being a crazy driver and going 70 mph on a road when usually you're supposed to go 45 mph (it also proves why you shouldn't do that in reality), and just have some type of interest in cars, then this game is for you.

								This review is based on the alpha version of the game, up to the date August 11th, 2014.If you like realism, destruction, and cars, this is the game for you. I'd like to begin by discussing what exactly Drive is. Drive is a state-of-the-art physics simulator that runs Torque 3D as the main physics engine. In this environment, every movement and input is calculted and recalculted over and over again as the game moves. So, as you come around a corner with your tail out, the computer is taking your car's weight, road surface, throttle, brake, gas, size of the contact patch of the tires, and many more variables into account every second. This allows the game to make an accurate representation of what is going on. Continuing with my example, if you nicked a bump in the road, millions more calcultions would take place, throwing the car around and whatnot. Another important feature that is simulated is air, which, for the time being, is being experimented with.""So, what do you do in this physics game?"" Well, most of us from the beginning have been obsessed with cars and destroying them, so, that's what we do. We take vans and drop them onto hatchbacks; we take hatchs, and put jets on them, and then run them into the wall at 300mph. We also create the game. Due to the producing company's small size (under 15 people total at last check), the community up until now has aided in adding content to the game in the form of maps, vehicles, UI apps (compass, speedo's, tachs, etc), and more. Others constantly push the game, such as accidently making a working plane and several helicopters that are flyable (albiet with primitive controls, depending on the model). As a gamer, having all of this content available for free is awesome. And it's usually good quality stuff that the creators have put hours and weeks into. And it's free. ""I'm a creator/artist/coder/computer wizz. How can I get involved?""I'm not sure how this'll work with the game porting over to Steam, but up until now, you would do whatever you'd normally create aand then put in the game. It's quite simple, and the game itself is built to be modded easily (the devs even have a wiki on how to do it). Modelors can make their models in any 3D program, export to COLLADA, create a ""JBeam"" file, and you're in. Obviously it takes more than just that, but it's a very straight-forward process that even a beginner could do successfully.""Should I buy this?""Yes. There's more in the game that can be covered in this review without getting boring, but it is an extremely well-done game. Even though it's only in alpha, it's a pretty good game. Tech support from the community and devs is great, and gme-wide issues are quickly resolved. The physics are great and getting better, the view is spectacular, and who doesn't like smashing cars into each other? Oh, and did I mention the DLC is free? The DLC is free.			"

								If you love cars and all the physic's that go with them, then this game is for you. If' you're looking for the next racing game however, keep looking. BeamNG is the most realistic physic's simulatior I've ever played, is it perfect? Absolutly not. But it's very very good, among the best of the few games it compares to. It is so easy to turn on some music, or listen to book on tape and get lost for hours on end just driving around in your sandbox, racing, crashing, towing, testing or just exploring. Perhaps most importantly the dev's actually care about this game...One of the drawbacks to buying / playing early access game's is that it is often a gamble. A lot time's the devs become tired with their product and halt devolpment all together, leaving you with a hole in your wallet and a half finished product that'll never be more than that. That however, is not the case here. I owned this game for almost a year now, and throughout that year I have witnessed consistent improvements, patch's and added content. I cannot praise this game enough, I don't have the time to invest thousands of hours playing games like some people do. But I beleive this is my second most played game on steam...Only surpassed by Skyrim, and for the record BeamNG is closing fast on my Skyrim hours. The game has a decent arsenal of vehicles, ranging from your run of the mill work truck (which can modified to suit your taste) to Race cars, to Semi tractor trailers. And the fact, that this game is Steam Workshop compatible mean's that even more vehicle's and track's are just a click away!I'm trying to think of some potential ''con's'' to weigh in with all the ''pro's'' that go with this game. Personally I would like to see even more customization implimented into the game, such as the ability to tune gear ratio's in the transmission and fine tune things like aero dynamics. It would also be nice to be able to add specific upgrade's to your vehicle's engine. As it stand's right now, most vehicle's have Stage 1 Stage 2 and Stage 3 engine tune's and/or intake's that give you three stage's of horsepower/torque. But that's really just cherry picking on my behalf. Let's see what else, For those of you who enjoy playing with others...This is not your game. To my knowledge it currently does not have any form of multiplayer. No internet race's, I heard one time that it has split screen playability, but it's not something I've ever tried to use. I've heard some complaint's that this game only run's good on bad♥♥♥♥♥desktops, which is not completely true, however their's some truth in that statement. My current desktop was top the of line...Eight years ago, which my graphic's turned down a bit I can run most of BeamNG just fine. Howver, until I get a new computer I cannot play on certian level's...Like Moab, it's just to much for my old machine. On the side of sound, it's currently fairly weak. All vehicle's sound the same, a turbo I4 sounds excatly the same as a modified big block V8 in this game, so there isn't a huge veriety in that area, but hopefully that'll be improved upon in future patch's...Personally I just play with the sound off and listen to Reddit horror stories on Youtube while playing. With that said, It's time to tally up the Pro's and Con's.(Pros)AMAZING Physics.Reliable Devs who invest in their product to make consistent improvementsPotential to get lost for hours playing.Immense depth in level's, lot's of exploration to be done.Decent veriety of vehicle's ranging from Pickups to Race cars to Semi's.Supports Steam Workshop, meaning downloadedable vehicle's and tracks are just a click away.(Cons)Taxing to run at high resolution.Needs a little more depth in vehicle tuning.Lame sound effects.In it's current state I give this game a solid (9/10)It was worth every penny I spent on it. I hope you enjoyed this review! "

If you are looking for a game that has great soft body car physics this is for you. Now with the game having such great physics you will need a decent PC to run it on Highest settings, mosty PC's will be able to run it on Low but some PC's wont be able to run it at all.Overall this is a great game and I think it's worth the money to get.

								I've owned Beamng Drive for a few years now, and the constant updates really make it a ""game"" I look forward to playing each update. The physics and graphics feel very realistic, and I even used Beamng to practice driving before I got a licence (and it actually helped). The fact that you can do everything with your car in the game as you can in the real world is truly impressive. Being able to turn on the headlights, blinkers, horn, in cab lights, as well as change the configuration of the engine and body (and have those parts affect the feel and physics of the car) is my favorite thing about beamng. With enough modding you can even put wings on your car and fly which is both hillarious and impressive that the physics engine can use aerodynamics to affect the drag and lift of your vehicle at high speeds. Finally the best part of Beamng is the community, constantly pouring out new cars and objects (even buildings) that can be destroyed as well as new locations to play in with plently of fun content to choose from. Beamng is certainly a fun experience and you may find yourself playing for long periods of time without realizing it.			"

								BeamNG Drive Early Access. I bought this game a while back and I finally got a Steam key. So here is my review. BeamNG Drive is a driving simulator but not really. I think it is more of a vehicle crash simulator. The crash physics are great and the driving physics are getting there. I really like it. The biggest thing that bugs me is the computer performance. Now, I may not have a gaming PC but I can play other games on medium-high graphics and have no trouble. But on this game, it struggles. A little problem is clipping and fall-through. Clipping is when I crash into another vehicle and the textures clip into each other. Therefore wedging the cars together. Fall-through is my term when a car falls through another car. For example, loading the hatchback into the box truck (of course I remove the doors). I drive the car in and it falls out the bottom of the truck. The bad parts are little enough where the good parts stand out. Overall, a great game. I recommend it.			"

								I love Beamng.drive. I just hooked up my Xbox One controller to it and I've been having a blast. There are so many community created maps and vehicles and such. Physics are amazing.Well, I was having a blast.Now, as of around the 23rd, whenever I am on the start screen, I move my mouse the slightest inch and my frames drop to 0. And then I wait. And then they go back up to 60 ish, way less than what I was getting before this issue happened, when I was getting around 300-500 fps. This only affects the menu screen, but then when I finally load into the map, it brings me to my second issue, below.I have since lost all my vehicles and maps, and whenever I go into the files to make sure they weren't deleted, they are there. But in-game, they are simply not there. Gone like they were never there in the first place. Again, it's a beautiful game, with plenty of things to mess around with, and create some painstakingly accurate car crashes, if that's what you want. The physics are accurate down to the smallest dent, and I'm waiting for the multiplayer so that we can all turn our cars and trucks into flattened pancakes of metal.I'm checking the recommended box, just because I know that the developers can easily get over this simple, but very irritating issue.Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Beamng, and I will play again.

								Super fun game. If you like crashing cars, this game takes the cake. But not only can you crash cars, you can crash the game... if you aren't careful (i.e. don't run too many mods, or vehicles at once). See, I had a bus crash into a bus, then the bus crashed into the wall, and then the game crashed.But no really, just buy the fricken game... It's awesome.			"

								One of the few games in which, while in the middle of a time trial/race, I can just say f*** it, and drive off a cliff completely satisfied.And as far as performance issues go, I can run it maxed out (without dynamic reflections, though they only dropped a few fps) at 1080p with only a few drops below 60fps.  Im using an i5 3470 and an amd r9 380 2GB. Besides, who is gonna say ""look at that grass texture"", over ""that rock wall never looked so promising"".			"

								This game defines the word ""physics"", it shows just how far devlopers can go and the developers of BeamNG.drive certainly have outdone themselves since the days of Rigs of Rods, these guys deserve every bit of money that they get from purchases because this is so extreme. I recommend this to everybody who wants to have fun smashin up cars witout risking your life.			"

								I have played this game coutless hours since alpha was released in 2013.This game had mod support from day 1. If you know your way around a 3D Program and learn how to implement your models into the in game engine, you can make pretty much anything you want.Some of the most innovative vehicles for this game came from the community, which is a cool thing in my opinion.The game is still in development and the potential of it is almost unfathomable. I expect more great things to come from the devs and the community.There is something relaxing about smashing cars into walls... but this game is about more than just crashing. I truly enjoy just driving around and with the race update coming soon (I hope multiplayer eventually) There is no doubt that this game will be huge.10/10 Best vehicle physics on the market.Next Car Game: go suck a donger.EDIT: Updated 2016 - This game continues to improve and the devs show no sign of stopping. This is one epicly unique game.			"

								This game may not be what you are expecting, especially as of now.The game is meant to be a simulator, and all ""game"" aspects are secondary to that.That is not to say that it isn't fun, but it might not be to your liking.Being more of a simulator than a game, that also means the driving mechanics may be nothing like what you expect.Ideally you would play with a wheel instead of a gamepad, and would treat the cars much like you'd treat a real one.I wasn't going to review the game until it got to the Race Update at least, but I don't think I'll change my opinions. I've owned this since Christmas '13 and it's mid-August. Development has been pretty consistent and I've seen it grow quite a bit in this short time. The community is still getting off the ground, but the move to Steam should help greatly. I've had quite a lot of fun with this prior to its release on Steam, and I am sure I will in the future.While I will recommend the game, I will do so with the warning that it really isn't for everyone.

								I've had this game for a good 1-2 years before they added it on steam and i love it. If you are the kind of person that LOVES crashing cars, then GET THIS GAME. The physics are unreal. They are incredible. Pros:- Incredibly realistic phsyics- Great graphics for a physics based game- Greats mods (maps, vehicles, engines, etc)- make your own custom maps- vehicles are great- TONS of options for your cars (not quite total customization, but you can change the colors, engines, type of car [i.e. make a care the ""off-road"" version of that car and much more], etc.) - shadows are great- modding this game without the steam workshop is very easy- it is in alpha state, and yet i have not had much trouble with any bugs. Maybe a few here and there but it's in good state right now- there are 5 motion options: Realtime, 2x slower than realtime, 4x slower than realtime, 8x slower than realtime, and 100x slower than realtime- car crashes are unbelievably realistic and awesomeCons:- You will need at least a decent computer to be able to play this game- shadows (at highest setting) take A LOT of memory and can cause, depending on your kind of computer, a 5-50 fps drop (since my machine isnt the greatest, i lose a great amount of FPS if i put shadows on high. I lose about 30-40 FPS)- i personally did not enjoy the default maps that came with the game. BUT there are AMAZING custom maps on the forums that you can download (mods)Final verdict: If you like crashing cars, get this game. If you love realistic physics in videogames, get this game. If you are looking for a racing game, this game might not be for you. YES this game IS getting a racing update, but i doubt it will be as good as other games that are made specifically for racing (forza, burnout, need for speed, etc.). But i hope the team at BeamNG proves me wrong on that statement :D			"

								I am very picky when it comes to driving/racing games. I like the feel of the cars to be realistic, which is exactly what BeamNG.drive gives me. The cars not only drive well, but the default terrains look spectacular, and the modding community is rapidly growing. None of this, however, compares to the stunning physics this game provides. BeamNG.drive allows me to see what would happen if I crashed a 1980s sports car into a tree, but without having to injure myself in the process. Overall, even though it is only in Alpha, this is the most polished sandbox driving simulators I have ever used.			"

								I refunded this game, but I'd recommend it.  The game is a lot of fun if you like setting up crashes.  The crash/soft body physics are a thing of beauty.  You can spend many hours messing around with crashes.The game gives you a lot of tools and tweaks, almost too many for the average user.  You don't have to use all the tweaks but it's nice they are there for power users.Why did I refund?  Well, I was hoping for a slightly more arcade like driving experience.  The game is a great crash simulator, but I think it falls a bit short on having fun racing/driving physics.  It does crashes better than any other game, but it's not really a racing game.  Next Car Game or even Crossout is a bit more focused on racing/driving.			"

								Let me tell you a story.When I was very young the darker side of my mind was very interested in cars crashing into each other. I thought it was so cool to see to cars slamming into each other and fly across the road. I was 5.During that phase I kept looking for a video game that would let me do that. All I found were animations, or unrealistic games.Later on, about a year ago, I saw GMOD on sale and decided to buy it, thinking it would suit my needs. I didn't.I was so dissapointed. Would I ever find what I was looking for?A few months later, I saw BeamNg through the corner of my eye on youtube and went to check it out.I thought it was beautiful. Within a few weeks of that moment I had owned the game.So, in conclusion, thank you BeamNg.Drive. You have fufilled my crazy childhood dreams(even though I am still a kid) by making an awesome game which is hours of fun.Now, on to the good stuff!PROS:Everything aboveSuper Realisticfully ModableCONS:You NEED a TURBO POWERFUL computer(I mean it when I say that) to run this game. I had to buy a $100 GTX 750 Graphics card to increase the preformance from 5-15 to 40-55 FPS. It STILL runs a little slow.Overall, this is the ultimate car game. Get it. GET IT NOW.10.5/10			"

								I have had this game since before it came onto steam,  back then the developement was pretty slow with only one a team of around 8,  since, the team has grown heaps, the developement of vehcles has picked up hugely, Along with the official content there is plenty of mods, though I can't say most modding of this game is easy due to the complexity of its soft body physics engine, when you get your head around it, its fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥about with the cares like put really wind wheels on a impressa equivelent vehicle, add a huge wing and give it an rediculiously powered motor.But by far the best is the soft body physics which comtines to improve, the satisfying ability to know  that the stunt you just did was probably bloody accurate, and when you just feel like wrecking cars or watching your car crumple when u drive far to fast.This game has capiblities far beyond cars, it'll be interesting what the future holds for a physics engine like this.only problem for most people as there is little to no campain, with only a few vanila senarios, which are check point races, this will be built on later but its sill early in developement.

								I know this may sound strange but I actually had to refund this game as my sound card did not seem to like the game or vice versa. It's a heavy game as well, even with my PC equipped with a 4790K and a GTX 970 I had FPS drops. The main reason I had to refund though was due to the sound being strangely intermittent, it would warp if that makes sense.Overall though I really love this game and if your PC can handle it and you love physics based shenanigans, buy it! I may have had issues with it but I really loved the game even though the issues were extremely distracting. Hopefully you will not suffer the same issues as myself and in the future, I am definitely going to be giving this game another chance because it is absolutely awesome!I just wish I hadn't had to have refunded it because this game deserves all the support it can get!

								NOTE: This is going to be my first review EVER.This game is just so amazing, it's one of it's kind, no racing simulator is the same or probably will be in many years. The amount of work that the developers have putten into this game is just mental, and i just can't imagine that how much they've done optimizing work to get it to run on todays hardware properly. It even runs on my I3, which is a very big surprise at least for me. But the game does have a few problems, for example the bugs and glitches. The game is usually pretty stable, but sometimes the game will just bug out for no real reason, this usually happens if you crash your car too violently (at least for me). And of course you need to setup all the settings and controls before you can actually play, it's a sim after all. Pros: -Physics-Variety of cars and maps-Customization of cars (Parts, tuning)-A lot of things to do, for example scenarios and campaigns-Graphics look good, even on the lowest settings possible-A HUGE mod community on their own website (http://www.beamng.com/resources/)-No DLC, the devs keep updating the game for free-The price is pretty affordableCons:-Can be unstable sometimes (Crashes, bugs etc.)-You'll need a pretty good pc to run this game properly, at least with many cars-New updates almost always ruin mods-Props should be easier to place-You'll need to setup this game and it takes time if you're playing with a gamepad (especially the PS4 gamepad) or wheel-No PS4 controller supportTL;DR: Get this game, if you like crashing cars but don't want to do it in real life.

								I crashed my car into a bridge.And a tree.And everything else.Be honest, this game should be called BeamNG.Crash.---First thing, the new campaign is pretty good. It is mostly crashing, but it uses some new automatic clever camera angles and slo-mo timing for you to experience the game like never before. All you have to do is .driveThe scenarios are good. I love the chase ones, because who doesn't like a car chase? There are plenty more modded scenarios once you go through the default though!Mods are great, pretty simple way to add them even though not steam workshop. You can also manually copy files into the mod area so check the actual forums as well as the mod repository.It even works with my steering whell, Logitech G29. Haven't tried it with the shifter though, but it was interesting considering I've never driven!Only issues are the occasional problem with an (outdated) mod, having to renable fullscreen when tabbing out, and no explosions ;)			"

								It's not a complete game yet, but I recommend it.  The game has evolved since I bought into it's Early Access; so it is not abandonware.The soft-body damage sim system is bloody fantastic and deep.  Not completely realistic, but fantastic.  I'm sure you've seen YouTube videos of BeamNG.drive crashe motages and cars tumbling down mountains getting all smashed up.  The only thing missing is the ability for cars to explode.  They never do.  All they do is sometimes catch fire if you rupture the fuel tank.While this is not yet finished, there is a very large selection of activities (scenarios) you can do.  Checkpoint races, jumping, stunts, destruction missions and other ways to take advantage of the game's unique and extensive soft-body vehicle engine.  There is plenty to do here; it's just not a complete game yet.  The game is also highly moddable so you can create your own scenarios and even 3D props and tracks if you know your way around a 3D modeling program.The game's configuration and control options are DEEP.  It works spectacularly with the Steam Controller once you can figure out how to configure it all.  Steering with the track pad feels great.  The only thing better would be a real steering wheel controller.  Some day!The game's graphics are not state of the art, but they are very crisp.  Let's say crisp but a bit dry.  It would benefit from some ambient occlusion, physically based rendering or other cutting-edge graphic engine elements.  If the game had the graphics engine of Rocket League or Mad Max it would be a very impressive thing indeed.  But what is here is very servicable.  The frame rate is silky smooth on my GTX960.  On the other hand the amount of trees and other foliage around the road is impressive.Now for the negatives.  The game has a beginnings of a campaign.  Appropriately named ""Rocky Start.""  The actual gameplay is fun.  It has the beginnings of an open-world map with activities you can choose with rewards.  Great stuff.  But the presentation...  It is disjointed.  They chose to use cartoonish, 2D flash-type animations to lead into each part of the campaign.  The art is flatly drawn cartoons.  The people...  I'm sorry.  They look like they tapped someone from DeviantArt.  Crudely drawn cartoons.  The animation looks very low-budget.  This directly contrasts with the actual game world where everything is dimensional, lush, detailed and obviously lovingly crafted.  The 2D art really brings the game down a peg.  And there is other 2D art within another part of the game that is far superior.  They should sack the new artist and use the first one.  Yeah it had the limitations of being 2D but it has style and looks much more professional..  Ugh.. Sorry.. as an artist it's just a pet peeve of mine.  If you aren't going to do it right, don't do it at all.Pros:+ Soft-body physics engine produces AMAZING crashes!+ Skill-based driving and racing.  Watch out for that rock on the side of the narrow road.  It will end your car!+ Variety of activities with a large range of difficulties to choose from+ Nicely crafted (fictional) car models+ Pretty well detailed environments to drive or race through+ Awesome stunts & jumps+ Deep control configurability / Great with Steam Controller+ Free-roaming and wrecking is relaxing fun+ It does not seem like it will become abandonware so farCons:- It's not finished yet (as expected for Early Access).- Graphics engine does not look as good as it could (yet?)- No explosions (yet?)- Ugly, low-budget animated intro segments that are thankfully skippable.

These things you crash have rad physics and blow apart in satisfying ways. There are lots of places to crash things and you can download more things to crash. Sound appealing? Get BeamNG.drive and crash stuff softbody style.			"

								NOTE: This is going to be my first review EVER.This game is just so amazing, it's one of it's kind, no racing simulator is the same or probably will be in many years. The amount of work that the developers have putten into this game is just mental, and i just can't imagine that how much they've done optimizing work to get it to run on todays hardware properly. It even runs on my I3, which is a very big surprise at least for me. But the game does have a few problems, for example the bugs and glitches. The game is usually pretty stable, but sometimes the game will just bug out for no real reason, this usually happens if you crash your car too violently (at least for me). And of course you need to setup all the settings and controls before you can actually play, it's a sim after all. Pros: -Physics-Variety of cars and maps-Customization of cars (Parts, tuning)-A lot of things to do, for example scenarios and campaigns-Graphics look good, even on the lowest settings possible-A HUGE mod community on their own website (http://www.beamng.com/resources/)-No DLC, the devs keep updating the game for free-The price is pretty affordableCons:-Can be unstable sometimes (Crashes, bugs etc.)-You'll need a pretty good pc to run this game properly, at least with many cars-New updates almost always ruin mods-Props should be easier to place-You'll need to setup this game and it takes time if you're playing with a gamepad (especially the PS4 gamepad) or wheel-No PS4 controller supportTL;DR: Get this game, if you like crashing cars but don't want to do it in real life.

								Very fun game. VERY realistic soft body physics, and overall vehicle mechanics entirely; Even down to handling, braking, etc. Each part of the car is clearly modeled as well. Lots of fun crashing cars for hours. Good mod support as well for extra cars, scenarios, terrains, etc.There isnt much to do outside of just aimlessly crashing cars, but there are scenarios for racing and such. There might be more to supplement the game later, since the developers are very active on updating the game. (Thank god for active devs!)Oh. You're going to need a fairly strong computer to play this game if you want 60+ FPS. "

								This game is absolutely incredible. The physics, the cars, the gameplay, the visuals, everything. I've always loved this game, and I've wanted to play it for so long. I got this game about 4 months ago, in fact, I only made a Steam account so I could play this game as soon as I possibly could. Of course, there are some that dont like cars as much as others, but those people would still enjoy this game, I'd imagine, as watching stunts preformed or things getting blown up would catch their eyes instead of the highly in-depth car customization. This game is definately my favorite on Steam, even if its Early Access, the whole concept in astonishing, and if this is just the start of this game, then holy cow, us BeamNG.drive fans are in for a treat in the future. 5 out of 5 star rating. Would definitely recommend this game to any friend.			"

								Do you love annihilating things? Do you love annihilating things in slow-motion? Do you enjoy slamming cars into walls? Well then this is the right game for you, there's no real point other than just destroy everything, but it's fun to find new ways to decimate cars. It's an oddly satisfying game and works wonders to reduce stress. Graphics are good but just make sure your rig can handle it, the framerate drops a lot in places like the forest, however it's buttery smooth in the less populated areas. My only complaint is that if you've already done everything then the game can start to feel a little repetitive, but that's just the nature of the game. Overall it's worth the money, just a bit of a shame that they only do small 10-20% discounts on it, regardless, it's still a good investment in my optinion. 7/10			"

								It's not a complete game yet, but I recommend it.  The game has evolved since I bought into it's Early Access; so it is not abandonware.The soft-body damage sim system is bloody fantastic and deep.  Not completely realistic, but fantastic.  I'm sure you've seen YouTube videos of BeamNG.drive crashe motages and cars tumbling down mountains getting all smashed up.  The only thing missing is the ability for cars to explode.  They never do.  All they do is sometimes catch fire if you rupture the fuel tank.While this is not yet finished, there is a very large selection of activities (scenarios) you can do.  Checkpoint races, jumping, stunts, destruction missions and other ways to take advantage of the game's unique and extensive soft-body vehicle engine.  There is plenty to do here; it's just not a complete game yet.  The game is also highly moddable so you can create your own scenarios and even 3D props and tracks if you know your way around a 3D modeling program.The game's configuration and control options are DEEP.  It works spectacularly with the Steam Controller once you can figure out how to configure it all.  Steering with the track pad feels great.  The only thing better would be a real steering wheel controller.  Some day!The game's graphics are not state of the art, but they are very crisp.  Let's say crisp but a bit dry.  It would benefit from some ambient occlusion, physically based rendering or other cutting-edge graphic engine elements.  If the game had the graphics engine of Rocket League or Mad Max it would be a very impressive thing indeed.  But what is here is very servicable.  The frame rate is silky smooth on my GTX960.  On the other hand the amount of trees and other foliage around the road is impressive.Now for the negatives.  The game has a beginnings of a campaign.  Appropriately named ""Rocky Start.""  The actual gameplay is fun.  It has the beginnings of an open-world map with activities you can choose with rewards.  Great stuff.  But the presentation...  It is disjointed.  They chose to use cartoonish, 2D flash-type animations to lead into each part of the campaign.  The art is flatly drawn cartoons.  The people...  I'm sorry.  They look like they tapped someone from DeviantArt.  Crudely drawn cartoons.  The animation looks very low-budget.  This directly contrasts with the actual game world where everything is dimensional, lush, detailed and obviously lovingly crafted.  The 2D art really brings the game down a peg.  And there is other 2D art within another part of the game that is far superior.  They should sack the new artist and use the first one.  Yeah it had the limitations of being 2D but it has style and looks much more professional..  Ugh.. Sorry.. as an artist it's just a pet peeve of mine.  If you aren't going to do it right, don't do it at all.Pros:+ Soft-body physics engine produces AMAZING crashes!+ Skill-based driving and racing.  Watch out for that rock on the side of the narrow road.  It will end your car!+ Variety of activities with a large range of difficulties to choose from+ Nicely crafted (fictional) car models+ Pretty well detailed environments to drive or race through+ Awesome stunts & jumps+ Deep control configurability / Great with Steam Controller+ Free-roaming and wrecking is relaxing fun+ It does not seem like it will become abandonware so farCons:- It's not finished yet (as expected for Early Access).- Graphics engine does not look as good as it could (yet?)- No explosions (yet?)- Ugly, low-budget animated intro segments that are thankfully skippable.

								Whenever I rage at a game, I get on BeamNG and crash some cars for a couple of hours to release some stress.  It is also a great time killer if you're looking for one.  It also has support for mods, giving you access to get more maps, cars, and even different sounds (the game gets boring after a little bit if you dont have any other maps/cars than the default ones).  Really the only downfall of BeamNG is how demanding it is on your computer.  So if you have a slow computer, get ready for about 5fps. 10/10			"

								Great game,Its a great game full of sillyness and randomness. Wanna squash a compact car with 3 trucks? Possible! Wanna fly your supercar 180mph into a wall? Possible! Wanna pull your car with 3000pounds of strenght into the air? Possible! Bored of all the sillyness thats in the game? Just visit their website and look through the couple of hundred of mods. 5 minutes later you got the mods you want and you can play again!			"

								I can't take myself seriously because of this game. I seriously love just throwing a car off a cliff and watching as it crumples up into a majestic metal meatball and bursts up in flames.This game is perfect for people like me who stress/rage alot. Better than any stress toy and you won't actually break anything (except your beautiful Chrome-colored Hirochi Sunburst).I would really recommend this game for anybody who loves cars or just plain mayhem.10/10			"

								Well...the game is just pretty much excellent.Best driving and vehicle physics simulator i've ever seen. Regular updates and friendly devs(which i must say a lot better than the bugbear). LOTS of mods and variety to play this little simulator. I can sometimes just imagine that im in the game and just driving around with my hirochi sunburst with ny plates or messing with a covet on JRI.It was worth the money even i'm just driving ramdomly with my ai toggled on. Highly recommended xd. "

								NOTE: This is going to be my first review EVER.This game is just so amazing, it's one of it's kind, no racing simulator is the same or probably will be in many years. The amount of work that the developers have putten into this game is just mental, and i just can't imagine that how much they've done optimizing work to get it to run on todays hardware properly. It even runs on my I3, which is a very big surprise at least for me. But the game does have a few problems, for example the bugs and glitches. The game is usually pretty stable, but sometimes the game will just bug out for no real reason, this usually happens if you crash your car too violently (at least for me). And of course you need to setup all the settings and controls before you can actually play, it's a sim after all. Pros: -Physics-Variety of cars and maps-Customization of cars (Parts, tuning)-A lot of things to do, for example scenarios and campaigns-Graphics look good, even on the lowest settings possible-A HUGE mod community on their own website (http://www.beamng.com/resources/)-No DLC, the devs keep updating the game for free-The price is pretty affordableCons:-Can be unstable sometimes (Crashes, bugs etc.)-You'll need a pretty good pc to run this game properly, at least with many cars-New updates almost always ruin mods-Props should be easier to place-You'll need to setup this game and it takes time if you're playing with a gamepad (especially the PS4 gamepad) or wheel-No PS4 controller supportTL;DR: Get this game, if you like crashing cars but don't want to do it in real life.

								Played for almost 60hrs now and i love it!. The almost endless modifaciton, setting and tweaking is amazing. The realistic shifting/converter slip from the gearboxes is by far the best ive seen in a ""car game"". And the fact that it is mod frendly gives it a 11/10. Been wating for something like this for years. Only real complaint, is the lack of variation of the engine sounds between the vehicles.			"

								I love this game! It gets boring sometimes but you can just go download mods. Graphics are pretty good, but the mechanics are brilliant.Make sure you have a decent gpu and a really good 4+core CPU. Seriously, my GTX 950 barely has to do anything to run this, but my AMD A6-5400k dual core cpu overclocked to 3.74 ghz is 24/7 pegged at 100%. The updates are making the game even more CPU intensive and now the menu's are just too laggy to play. In game driving around, it's fine, but if you want to switch cars or anything, good luck not wanting to smash your controller/keyboard.			"

								If you like to constantly crash cars into things and recreate police crashes, or having a semi truck mow down a sedan, or even just a head on collision with a wall, this is the game. The game's physics are something to aw to, yes it may get boring at times, but if you become tense from another game, or just need something to consume time, this game can fulfill. If you have ever thought about a car crash that you'd want to see what would happen and see how it plays out then this is the game. I played the game for over 35 hours without mods (mainly because I couldn't figure it out) and I had fun with the game every time. Once I figured out how to use mods, oh boy, the gameplay and replayability doubled. I also love the fact they are updating the game and adding new stuff, the new items progressively getting better. There are a few downfalls though, mainly the game's framerate but that can always be solved by reducing the graphics, I've found that the dynamic reflections basically kill the game's framerate. If you turn that off It will run much smoother, and if not theres many other settings to toy around with. The app feature is also a fun feature, being able to customize the UIs you see while driving, whether it be the car's preformance, to it's damage, to just the ability to make the car fly across the map with wind. I also love how if you make a single mistake while driving, the car will go into a fishtail and either, fly off a cliff or, hit a tree causing the car to now look like a U. The scenerios are fun, but they aren't forced apon you inorder to play the game, which is amazing. this game is the definition of Open World. Everytime I play this i'm finding new ways to crash, crunch and demolish each car, and since they finally readded the AI feature ""Chase,"" Oh man I can't explain how much more fun police chases have become. I've bought this game twice the first being before steam, and the one on steam, not because I didn't know how to transfer my key from the off-steam Beamng.Drive, because I wanted to support the developers of this game. I can't recommend this game enough to all car enthusists, if you love driving cars and crashing them, then buy this game, just buy it and slam a drift tune car into a semi truck or install a mod and attach a car to the front landing gear of a plane and fly, fly like a freebird.

								Let me start off this review by saying I've been following BeamNG since 2012 and bought as soon as the initial release happened in 2013. The dev team has been amazing in supporting and updating the game.Pros:Amazing physics, detailed car design, helpful dev team. The maps are absolutely beautiful also. Cons:The engine is a small bit unoptimized, but the dev team is working on it. Also, sometimes there is a while between updates but the past few have been very timely, and it seems a lot of background work is behind us.All-in-all I recommend this game, though it might not be for everyone. A majority of the game right now is a free-roam crashing simulator, though the devs have added a good many situations and races. Also, this is a state of the art engine. You'll need a fast CPU, and sadly AMD has an architecture stuck in the past. More cores do help, but your AMD will need to be clocked a fair bit higher than usual to keep the FPS other games do. A modern (4+ series) Intel needs about 3.4Ghz to play most of the cars, to keep even the most intensive at 60+fps you'll need 4.0Ghz. Like I said though the engine is being optimized.On the GPU side you can keep solid 60fps on medium with a 280x, and high will keep you mostly 60 but sometimes into the lower 50s. If you max the game with PostFX and reflections it will drag a 280x into the 20fps range and even a 290x has issues keeping up. This hasn't been as much of an issue until this update, so I'll update if it changes again.TL;DR smashy, you need a good computer. I rate 10/10			"

								Excellent game i love how we can use the vehicles for many things driving, doing stunts, crashing and taking photos of them.What i found a bit weird is that when i install a mod/addon like a vehicle or a map it doesnt load to BeamNG.drive for me, can there be a bit more information on how to add them to the game?Overall its an amazing game i recommend 9/10!

								Played for almost 60hrs now and i love it!. The almost endless modifaciton, setting and tweaking is amazing. The realistic shifting/converter slip from the gearboxes is by far the best ive seen in a ""car game"". And the fact that it is mod frendly gives it a 11/10. Been wating for something like this for years. Only real complaint, is the lack of variation of the engine sounds between the vehicles.			"

								This game has come a long way since I bought it before it was even on Steam. It has a proper UI, many, many performance improvements and lots of polish. My PC, which hasn't changed, could barely handle a single car, chases when they were introduced were unplayable. Now it runs smoothly for the most part. I don't play it much but the time I do spend playing this is enjoyable.The Driving Force GT steering wheel works well now. Couldn't even get a 360 controller working 2 years ago. I'm just leaving this review because I approve all the effort that's gone into this.			"

								Highly recommend this game if you are into cars and would like a pretty accurate simulation of them. That is what makes this game so much fun. Seeing what you can do with the simulation and testing the cars - usually by smashing them. The only thing I have against this game is, I wish that there were more cars by the Dev. I know that there are lots of cars you can add as mods, but It would just be nice if there were more right away when getting the game. The game works very well with an xbox controller and just the keyboard and mouse. This game is truely endless fun. Worth a buy!			"

								This game is by far my favorite driving simulator. Beautiful graphics and outstanding soft-body physics. The only things I can think of that this lacks are tire models and some graphics optimizations. It would also be great to have more cars that come with the game, and a bit more customizable parts for each car, but the customizations are made up through mods.			"

								Great game 93/100Pros: - Great, if not the best, physics engine. Destruction is very realistic and awesome. - Driving is realistic and fun. - Okay Modding + Easy Modding. - Not many updates but I do see them adding content or general updates every now and then. - Good offroading. - Fun at any framerate.Cons: - No Multiplayer. - I would like to see more vehicles be added to the game through the developers side, modding is okay but not perfect for this game. They did just release a new offroad vehicle that resembles a Jeep so it's good to know that they are workign on adding more vehicles to the game. - No aircraft or boats. This one I don't mind much at all or really care about but I think it would be great if they added planes, helicopters or boats into the game. - Sounds are, well, not the best. Some vehicles it fits while others it just doesn't. Mods do change some of the sounds but I think that the devs should work and fine tune the sounds a bit more. - Framerate can get low when you have a good amount of vehicles spawned in. For example, if I get 5-10 trucks on one map, I would experience a pretty high fps drop. It's not much of a gripe as it is fun at mostly every framerate, at least above 30. - Not a con but a recommendation, devs, please take out ""Free to Play"" from the game's tags. ;)System The Game Was Tested On:i5 6600k @3.5GHzGTX 1070 No Overclock16GB Deditated Wam240GB SSD			"

Although everything is not 100% realistic, it gets pretty darn close. The only thing that would make this game the best ever would be MULTIPLAYER!

								The first day I played, I selected a random map, I started to drive using the controller and 5 seconds later my car was broken. :C The next day I played, I rammed a small cube and my engine stopped working. The day after that, I set the gravity to negative earth and I was FLYING!!!! and then my friend sitting next to me set the gravity to sun and I had to restart the game. :C The day after, I raged because there was a mini ramp and I went up the ramp and I flipped the car onto it's roof and I stopped playing for 3 days. After the 3 days I finally came back and I got flipped again.I rate it 9.9/10It has very good graphics.It has really fluid animation.The physics are just brilliant.Overall, it is a really good game. I recommend it for people who love to smash up cars and like to be smashed in first person view.			"

								Okay, after owning and playing this game for the past two years, it's probably time to write a detailed evaluation.I use an Acer Aspire V5 with a crappy A10 CPU and 8650G integrated graphics. I play this game fine sometimes on low graphics, though I am not able to play at full time at all, just due to the specs. You'll get used to the latency and lag. Remember SSAO kills performance, and adjust other settings until desired performance is reachedThe driving feels solid to me. I have had no previous real life driving experience, but this game in my opinion responds better to input than Forza 5, similar to Forza Horizon 3, if you drive properly in this game. Remember to play in a fixed camera view, basically anything but orbit. This is because when the tires start slipping, you can detect and correct the slipping earlier rather than in orbit mode, where the camera is relatively lazy. Remember also specific reactions to drivetypes, like accelerating when an fwd car is in an oversteering state.Remember to use DELICATE TRIGGER CONTROL. The steering is 1:1 with your trigger AT ALL TIMES. It's extremely easy to understeer by turning too quickly, and to overcorrect after initiating oversteer. Also, the skidding sounds seem inconsistient with what's happening, and it's loud basically all the time, which causes you to overreact. Try to trust the visuals more than the sound in this game at it's current state.Once you get used to the controls, it's very satisfying. Just remember to be patient, as the controls require caution and delicate control for maximum enjoyment.			"

								When I bought this game in December 2015 it was really just a car crash sandbox and it was great then. Over the year there have been many updates that are bringing this closer and closer to actually being a proper game. It's the only thing I've bought Early Access and don't regret it at all, have more hours played in this than many other full games I paid full price for in the same genre. It does need a pretty good PC to run, my specs are i7-4790, GTX 960GT with 2GB VRAM, 12GB RAM and although it mostly runs at 60fps it does stutter from time to time and having more than 3-4 cars on the map at the same time really slows it down noticably. It's not a dealbreaker at all but I doubt it would run well on older/lesser systems. If you're on the fence about this one, pick it up!			"

								A fantastically made game, especially considering it's in early-access... my only real complaint is that although I have a GTX 970, a lot of the rendering (especially physics rendering) is done on the CPU (CPU is AMD FX 8350), significantly dropping frames. If there was a way to have more of the game run on my graphics card rather than my CPU, that would make this game so much better.As things are, 6/10 for performance9.5/10 for doing what it's marketed forAll around 7.5 to 8/10.

								Bought it when version 0.4-0.5 was on, and at that time I didn't think I'll crave something that badly as updates for this game.The most fun I had with cars in years. There are games that have some things designed better, maybe racing, amount of customization or multiplayer. But this game has the thing.Beautifully redesigned engine, allowing realistic driving and destruction, with constantly more and more content coming to simulate races and crashes almost flawlessly. And with near-future computer, ""it'll look better than Crysis"".A car sim that is all about realism.Oh, did I mention mod support? Yeah, this game has lots of potential, which is transformed into proper gameplay features.Highly recommend for any car simulator lovers.			"

								Beamng.Drive is the most realistic vehicle simulator to date. The crashes are ultra realistic, the damage is ultra realistic, and the physics are ultra realistic. And don't let the graphics card requirements turn you down, because this game really doesn't need that great of a card to run at max graphics settings. I'm running it maxed out at 60+ fps on my Gtx 560 ti 2gb phantom, so no need to buy yourself a Gtx 670 for this game. This game runs great on my pc, but the framerate drops to around 20-40 with 5 cars on screen at the same time, because the game still needs some optimizations. The more cars on screen, the more processor power your pc needs, because each vehicle is extremely highly detailed, and has lots of deformation points and breakables. Ever single vehicle is very advanced and detailed, so you need a very good cpu at the moment if you want to play with 5+ cars on screen. I have an Intel core I5-3470 3.20GHz quad core cpu, and it can handle around 5 cars on screen at once with playable framerates. They said they are gonna improve framerates later on. They want to make 7 cars on screen at once run smoothly on a mid range processor, so the cpu requirements will get lower with the updates. Another awesome thing about this game is all the maps and cars you can download for free. You can also make maps and vehicles and upload them to beamng's website for others to download. It's a lot of fun, and you can do anything vehicle related you've always wanted to do with no limitations! The game's map editor is also very easy to use once you get used to it. You can create cutom objects and buildings for the map editor too by using other programs like sketchup and importing your creations to beamng's editor. It is fairly simple and easy to do. Just watch a tutorial video or two, and you can make maps with ease. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to tell you if you feel the game lacks content, you can create your own content or download content for it that other people created. The game also gets updates, since it's still work in progress, so even if you don't download or make content for the game, you will still have a great time, although I reccomend downloading others's creations and making your own stuff for the game, because it makes the game more fun. This game is very realistic and very fun at the same time. Your car can even run out of fuel, but don't worry about filling up every 2 minutes, because it takes as long as in real life for the cars in this game to run out of fuel. Besides, you'll probably wreck the car before you can get a chance to run out of fuel, since one hard crash can pretty much total your vehicle. This game is a lot of fun, and very realistic at the same time. 10 out of 10. The perfect vehicle simulator.			"

								OKAY, rewriting review time. This game has matured so much since I've had it. I've played it daily, I've watched it grow, I've poured many hours into this game and interacted with the community. I taught myself many driving techniques with this game (with some mods so stalling a car is actually possible). This game was the exact game i've wanted since I was a little one playing Flatout 2 on my Xbox. Does it have problems? Absolutely. Do these matter? Absolutely not. I can't get enough of this game. The physics are satisfying, and feel real. I've yet to play a game that can make me cringe when I hit something as small as a trash can at low speed like this one can. The cars are unique and beautiful and every one is labored over to give it the exact characteristics of real life equivalents. They're fun, most imporantly, and I can't get enough of whipping the hatchback (Ibishu Covet) around a corner, or abusing the hell out of the Offraod version of the Pickup (Gavril D-Series). Even the level design shows detail, with maps being unique and having a variety of roads and ways to have fun, be it rallying through country in a small Japanese compact, or tearing up the streets in a souped up American Saloon, or ignoring roads and trails in a jacked-up delivery van. Yes, $24.99 may seem risky for an Early Access game, but these devs absolutely show promise. They constantly update the game, they constantly interact with their community, and I've even had conversations with some of the staff... They're great people, and they love this game like it was their child. They prioritize keeping the game updated, fresh with fun and new stuff, and fixing major problems. I can't tell anyone what to do with their money, but I can more than recommend buying this game to anyone who consults me on it. Please do yourself this favor. Quick notes about this game:-ABSOLUTELY USE A CONTROLLER OR WHEEL, keyboard is still fun but is nowhere near as great as the former two options-Fairly demanding, don't expect to have 10-car derbies with a laptop. Even my i7 4790k and GTX 980 only do 9 cars at once on certain levels before it becomes difficult to play-Bear with the devs, there are problems that pop up... With this in mind, do go to the official BeamNG forums for help, the community and devs always find solutions to these problems			"

Being in Alpha testing, seeing the amount of updates and improvements to the games engine as well as the graphics and cars/environments themselves really makes me proud to have supported the BeamNG developers mission to create the best, most realistic driving simulator to date from near the beginning.  Big step up from Rigs of Rods both graphically and physically.  Keep it up Devs!! And make sure you support the team, and the community, by visiting the official forum at beamng.com.

								For now (alpha review) it's not really a game, but more a car crashtest sanbox. In the years to come, this will be probably a benchmark for car damage modeling. Let's hope that GTA6, iRacing, Assetto Corsa etc. do something at least similar to this. If you're expecting something like a Codemasters racing title, this isn't for you.

								OKAY, rewriting review time. This game has matured so much since I've had it. I've played it daily, I've watched it grow, I've poured many hours into this game and interacted with the community. I taught myself many driving techniques with this game (with some mods so stalling a car is actually possible). This game was the exact game i've wanted since I was a little one playing Flatout 2 on my Xbox. Does it have problems? Absolutely. Do these matter? Absolutely not. I can't get enough of this game. The physics are satisfying, and feel real. I've yet to play a game that can make me cringe when I hit something as small as a trash can at low speed like this one can. The cars are unique and beautiful and every one is labored over to give it the exact characteristics of real life equivalents. They're fun, most imporantly, and I can't get enough of whipping the hatchback (Ibishu Covet) around a corner, or abusing the hell out of the Offraod version of the Pickup (Gavril D-Series). Even the level design shows detail, with maps being unique and having a variety of roads and ways to have fun, be it rallying through country in a small Japanese compact, or tearing up the streets in a souped up American Saloon, or ignoring roads and trails in a jacked-up delivery van. Yes, $24.99 may seem risky for an Early Access game, but these devs absolutely show promise. They constantly update the game, they constantly interact with their community, and I've even had conversations with some of the staff... They're great people, and they love this game like it was their child. They prioritize keeping the game updated, fresh with fun and new stuff, and fixing major problems. I can't tell anyone what to do with their money, but I can more than recommend buying this game to anyone who consults me on it. Please do yourself this favor. Quick notes about this game:-ABSOLUTELY USE A CONTROLLER OR WHEEL, keyboard is still fun but is nowhere near as great as the former two options-Fairly demanding, don't expect to have 10-car derbies with a laptop. Even my i7 4790k and GTX 980 only do 9 cars at once on certain levels before it becomes difficult to play-Bear with the devs, there are problems that pop up... With this in mind, do go to the official BeamNG forums for help, the community and devs always find solutions to these problems			"

								Amazing physics simulation.  Cars feel Real, not like sliding bricks, and deformation/crashing is top notch.  Being in Alpha testing, seeing the amount of updates and improvements to the games engine as well as the graphics and cars/environments themselves really makes me proud to have supported the BeamNG developers mission to create the best, most realistic driving simulator to date from near the beginning.  Big step up from Rigs of Rods both graphically and physically.  Keep it up Devs!! And make sure you support the team, and the community, by visiting the official forum at beamng.com.

								It's been almost a year since I wrote my first review for this game, and I feel it deserves an updated review.This is a good game. The crashes are fantastic to watch, and the physics are great. But this game does have a couple problems and improvements that could be made.Pros:-Looks good.-Runs fairly well, but isn't the best at optimization.-Physics are fun.-Crashes are fantastic.-Has a photo mode.-Lots of different scenarios and environments.-Good selection of props and vehicles, it even has a cannon.-Has a practice track.Neutral:-Physics are still a little strange, but has improved a bunch.-Looking/changing your key bindings can be a little confusing.-Menu is still confusing. Cons:-Still has bugs, including the occasional crash.-Controls are still wonky and aren't explained very well.Tl;dr, if you want a crashing/driving simulator, then this is the way to go. But only buy if you have a decently powerful machine and don't mind the strange physics and controls.			"

								For now (alpha review) it's not really a game, but more a car crashtest sanbox. In the years to come, this will be probably a benchmark for car damage modeling.

								One of a kind game! No other game is like this; Next Car Game kind of gets close but BugBear don't do much with it. BeamNG has a metric sh*t ton of mods allowing you to get tons of vehicles or maps etc. BeamNG also gets nicely sized updates relatively regularly. If you like cars and racing/driving games like i do a lot, then i can't recommend this game enough, and even if you don't really like racing/driving games, just crashing all of the cars into walls in slow motion is the most satisfying thing you can do in any game ever. Worth every single penny!			"

I can easily recommend this game for anyone whos looking for a fun game to pass time with, or for someone whos planning on taking a bit more seriously as a true hardcore racing simulator. This game is very resource intensive, so keep that in mind!  "

								Beamng.Drive is the most realistic vehicle simulator to date. The crashes are ultra realistic, the damage is ultra realistic, and the physics are ultra realistic. And don't let the graphics card requirements turn you down, because this game really doesn't need that great of a card to run at max graphics settings. I'm running it maxed out at 60+ fps on my Gtx 560 ti 2gb phantom, so no need to buy yourself a Gtx 670 for this game. This game runs great on my pc, but the framerate drops to around 20-40 with 5 cars on screen at the same time, because the game still needs some optimizations. The more cars on screen, the more processor power your pc needs, because each vehicle is extremely highly detailed, and has lots of deformation points and breakables. Ever single vehicle is very advanced and detailed, so you need a very good cpu at the moment if you want to play with 5+ cars on screen. I have an Intel core I5-3470 3.20GHz quad core cpu, and it can handle around 5 cars on screen at once with playable framerates. They said they are gonna improve framerates later on. They want to make 7 cars on screen at once run smoothly on a mid range processor, so the cpu requirements will get lower with the updates. Another awesome thing about this game is all the maps and cars you can download for free. You can also make maps and vehicles and upload them to beamng's website for others to download. It's a lot of fun, and you can do anything vehicle related you've always wanted to do with no limitations! The game's map editor is also very easy to use once you get used to it. You can create cutom objects and buildings for the map editor too by using other programs like sketchup and importing your creations to beamng's editor. It is fairly simple and easy to do. Just watch a tutorial video or two, and you can make maps with ease. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to tell you if you feel the game lacks content, you can create your own content or download content for it that other people created. The game also gets updates, since it's still work in progress, so even if you don't download or make content for the game, you will still have a great time, although I reccomend downloading others's creations and making your own stuff for the game, because it makes the game more fun. This game is very realistic and very fun at the same time. Your car can even run out of fuel, but don't worry about filling up every 2 minutes, because it takes as long as in real life for the cars in this game to run out of fuel. Besides, you'll probably wreck the car before you can get a chance to run out of fuel, since one hard crash can pretty much total your vehicle. This game is a lot of fun, and very realistic at the same time. 10 out of 10. The perfect vehicle simulator.			"

When comparing the two, it is evident that lots of lessons have been learnt and that each developer has improved greatly in their respective field, resulting in state of the art physics that simulate every single part of a vehicle/object with almost true to life accuracy (with accuracy and efficiency being improved as development goes on), near perfectly modelled fictional vehicles that each represent a certain type of vehicle, resulting in a diverse, albeit small selection (current vehicle list, [wiki.beamng.com] in-dev, concept vehicles list[wiki.beamng.com]) , and fantastic locations[wiki.beamng.com] that push the graphics engine, Torque3D[www.garagegames.com] to its limits. Currently, the Small Island map is my personal favourite mainly due to the recent overhaul that added so many little details. I hope Dry Rock is also updated in a similar fashion.In terms of gameplay, it is currently just a sandbox, but a planned update will bring timed races (no advanced AI YET) and online leaderboards to the table as the first step in the direction of given gameplay, but I still think the sandbox will be where the majority of the entertainment is.The game is very moddable, all sorts of vehicles can be added, including helicopters and planes, levels can be created in the in-game level editor, and LUA files that make up quite a lot of the code can be freely edited to tailor your experience to your liking or even add features. A feature that I quite like that has been created by the community with LUA scripting has been changing the engine sound depending on the vehicle that is being used. Mods should only be downloaded from the official forum's showroom and downloading from anywhere else will either leave you with some kind of malware or very disappointed.The current sound system is a placeholder to avoid people moaning about ""sound not working"" really, with a single engine, skid, and crash sound making up the entirety of the vehicle's vocabulary (can be modded though) and a few ambient background tracks. This will be completely redone eventually.The vehicle's handling characteristics can be quirky at times with some seemingly random veering at very high speeds and vehicles losing friction too easily, but the physics will be continuously improved and tweaked to ensure maximum authenticity. I can see this rivalling high profile racing simulators in the future.The game needs a fairly high end CPU (or more specifically, a CPU with fairly powerful cores) in order to run the physics smoothly. My i5 3570k can run 4 detailed vehicles smoothly, but those with certain AMD CPUs may struggle. Even though they have lots of cores, each core is quite weak. To run the game at max graphical settings, a fairly powerful GPU will also be required, but most semi-recent mid range video cards should be able to run it with lower settings fine. The tech demo will be updated soon so I suggest going to beamng.com and trying it out before purchasing.I've probably sunk hundreds of hours into it so it's safe to say that I've probably got my money's worth.I think that is all I currently have to say, but I'll probably remember something else in 5 minutes.TL;DR:  Physics, mods, don't complain if your ZX Spectrum doesn't run it at 120 fps etc.			"

								Don't forget: We are talking about REAL TIME physics simulation.A dual core CPU is enough, but it has to be at least 3 ghz. Don't cry about the game lagging on your i3, of course it will! i5 STRONGLY reccomended, laptops HAVE NO CHANCE.But if you have the PC to run it, it's awesome.			"

								Simply put BeamNG is amazing. If you are looking for a arcade racing game this is probably not for you. If you are looking for a car simulator with amazing physics then this is it. The graphics look a bit dated but the soft body physics more then make up for them. As for performance BeamNG is a demanding game, I have a 4 year old gaming laptop that struggles to keep a steady frame rate on most maps.			"

								8/13/2014got my alpha code in email because i had played it a while ago. last time i had played it, it was very similar, but a lot more buggy and had less content. that was probably 1-3 years ago, i cant remember. but i had only played it for an hour and got fed up with it before uninstalling it because it was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥.NOW, it installs over steam, has longish loading times (who cares though), the controls are kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for m+k but work if you're patient and learn to tap and feather the keys you can deal with it, and the graphics (artstyle) are fairly nice, but a little lacking contrast in the colors.The game runs fairly well, considering how much♥♥♥♥♥♥is actually being drawn on screen and how the devs implemented it (see: placing a bunch of objects on screen by hand). Which means: its really nice to explore and see the sights, but you need a powerful computer to do it. I'm running a 768mb 460gtx and a first gen i7. With all graphics up to high (except the garrys mod-esqe post processing) I get about 15fps while completely stationary in a forrest. with most things on lowest or low (lowest threshold until the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥due to flat meshes and NO shading) I can get up to about 55fps.there's a lot of pop-in for random tree areas and buildings, which isnt really a big deal but worth noting.the car handling itself is fairly difficult, because at low speeds the cars handle alright but once you speed up, the fps chugs randomly, the cars feel like they're on ice and makes crashes/flips inevitable. It almost feels like they're trying to make you crash. This is neat for showing off your crash mechanics (which i admit are incredible, i ripped out a part of my steering on one side because i high centered over a large rock and couldnt control that wheel much) you can ctrl+r to reload your vehicle and drop five feet away, but the location drifts a little to one direction each time and you can easily be stuck in a load-loop into a wall or trees or some other obsticle with no way out except to keep hitting reload unti you come out the other side. Pretty annoying, yet..... somehow satisfying when you're free.If I get a wheel or controller, a more powerful computer, and they keep adding content and fixing bugs, I'd say this game could be the driving sandbox (gta style raging/romping) equivalent of a walking-sim type game. There are jumps, trails, roads all around the island in grand touring style, big meadows, swamps, ponds, beaches, abandoned buildings a la ken block, and lots of things to smash your car on and have to reset. It would make a VERY nice exploration/relaxing/personal satisfaction driving sim with a high potential of adventure. My biggest desires for adds/fixes for this game are:1) customizable suspension and drivetrain settings to tweak2) them to keep adding more content because I like the style they're doing it in (the offroad 4x4 stuff is REALLY nice)3) optimizations ZOMG<---4) better color palette (its not bad, just leaves something to be desired and feels washed out when out in the open)6) more cars!!!7) the handling to not be so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (maybe this is just because im trying to control a sim driving game with a keyboard)8) better follow-view camera9) some extra motivation for playing it besides just screwing around (missions, characters, story, multiplayer, rpg, unlocking more content/vehicles/zones/parts/things, races, timetrials)10) the ability to get out of the car and do other things, gta style)Right now, the game isnt worth much if you dont like driving around irl or in gta games. I dont know much about the pacing of the dev, but Im going to go ahead and say they're slow as ♥♥♥♥. In a few years, maybe this game will be really cool. But, until then, its very much in alpha and has been for a long time. If this is your thing, cool, if you can't entertain yourself by driving around and exploring in a very buggy game, steer clear of this one for now.sound: 6/10 (nice directionality, but all cars sound the same and stuff isnt very dynamic. great ambience. not too buggy.)graphics: 7.5/10 (if you could get it all to run at a decent fps with no pop-in or stuttering, it would be VERY nice.)menus: 5/10 (lots of options, yet somehow still lacking options. average to bad organization. very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loading times.)art: 7/10 (cool, sterile, matrix like maps. really cool idea of loading up a world feel. surprisingly immersive. ""cozy"".)playability: 4/10 (sub average. frustrating experience driving around on the roads, but very pleasurable 4x4 experiences.)value: 6/10 (the ability to drop in with no strings is a double edged sword. easy to get into, easy to get out of once it crashes.)overall: 6/10 (its a slightly above average early access game with a lot of potential. whether or not the devs will realize their own potential is a whole different story. I'm going to learn towards ""yes, but not in any near time in the future if ever"") "

								BeamNG game should definitely be in the steam library of those who love cars as much as they love trashing them. You can spend hours driving 1 of the 11 vehicles available around detailed environments. The game also features AI and supports multiple vehicles to satisfy your deepest demolition needs. UI is highly customizable and easy to read . Recently implemented scenarios are an excellent addition for competitive players. BeamNG also has an excellent forum community and is highly moddable. If you wish to explore, you can choose out of 10 available levels to play in Free Roam. More content is being added into the game roughly around each month (depends on content). With this game you will never get tired of watching the car of your choice crash into a wall at 60 mp/h in slow-motion.			"

								This game even though it is unfinished is great even in this state,the detail of destruction is apsolutely amazing and the driving physics are almost perfect.This game simulates the bending of metal on the car in corners,it simulates the bending and folding of tires at sudden acceleration,since the last update it even simulates the turbochargers based on their size and how they would work in real life.The stock vehicles and maps are amazingly made for this game,and the mod support is great too,so if you get bored of the realism of this game you can just download a 6000hp pickup truck and watch it tear itself apart as it is trying to travel in a straight line.This game is not perfect,it is sometimes unstable and it can crash when least expected,also the framerate doesen't depend on your graphical settings it depends on what vehicle you are using and which map you are on,so the game's engine could use some tweaking with that,since it uses only one CPU core per vehicle,no matter if the vehicle is a three wheeled crapmobile or a eight wheeled monster truck it still gets only one core per vehicle,so make sure you check the sistem requirements before buying			"

								Good game, but I wish you have the option ingame could revert to the slightly older physics that in my mind were better than now, because they didn't care about your radiator and some other things that now break and kill your vehicle.			"

								Simply put BeamNG is amazing. If you are looking for a arcade racing game this is probably not for you. If you are looking for a car simulator with amazing physics then this is it. The graphics look a bit dated but the soft body physics more then make up for them. As for performance BeamNG is a demanding game, I have a 4 year old gaming laptop that struggles to keep a steady frame rate on most maps.			"

								I've had this game for a while now and I have been thoroughly impressed with it. Crashing cars in any game is fun but in the case of BeamNG.drive it is outrageously fantastic. The game has an incredible physics engine and beautiful graphic detail which delivers some of the most realistic gameplay I have ever come across in a driving simulator. The variety of vehicles within the game is also very well rounded and with the different mods that can be added on to the game, that variety extends even further. The game isn't without it's flaws which is to be expected with an early access title, but as it is right now, BeamNG.Drive is a great game and is definitely worth a play.			"

								Amazing. Just amazing. The physics are so fun to just play around with, especially when you hit a row of 10 cars with a 18-wheeler or crush them with a large dumptruck. Or roll them all of a huge cliff and watch them slowly turn them into weird balls of metal.10/10 would crash again "

								This game horrifies me, utterly and terribly. I'm on the last of a fifteen checkpoint trial. I slide around a corner doing twenty-five. My eyes widen in terror when I see a tree clip my back wheel, bending it all to hell and making the race impossible to finish. *presses ""R"" to restart for the tenth time*Let me just say, this game is hard. Your car will feel slow and clunky and will squash like a bug at seemingly stupid slow speeds. It is just about as realistic in that regard as it gets. Like any racing game, there are fast and slow cars. Except they all break equally as easy, so don't think going faster is always better.And as for so many people saying the cars feel like they're on ice, ignore them. If you've ever driven on solid ice, you would know that you can't get going more than a few miles an hour in a decent turn before you're going sideways. A car is held in place by four little patches of rubber each about the size of your hand. Once you break sliding friction, you're boned.Also, for anyone turned off by the fact that this is a ""crashing simulator,"" I would also disagree. The fun is in the trials. The launching your car off a four story cube in the test world gets boring after a while. There are something like 15 ish trials right now that range from small circuits to long rallies to silly stuff like seeing if you can jump four ramps in a row or make your way down a six-hundred foot cliff. There will be a campaign mode integrated eventually.The game encourages smart driving (knowing the limits of your car, how fast you need to enter turns, when to accelerate and when to brake). You don't need a steering wheel or pedals, but I'm sure they'd be fun.The only issue I have with the game is its checkpoint system. First of all, they're huge and kinda ugly. Secondly, if you try to switch out your vehicle with another mid-race, it screws everything up.I don't mind this one, but the sound is kinda awful. Engines sounds are cool, crashes are just okay, but the tire squeeling is horrible.This game is fun for what it is already, and definitely worth the money. The devs do decent sized updates about every month now and release bug fixes several times a month to deal with whatever they broke in the patches and/or fix other small issues.I never write reviews, but I figured this would be the one. Just goes to show how great I think this game is.			"

								If you buy this don't expect much. As with most early access. Or you will be disappointed.I can't say yea get this game. But if you want a crash simulator then maybe.The driving physics are just terrible. It does map to a wheel now. So at least it has that now. It works with an xbox 360 controller fairly well.If you total your car you may have to restart the game, because it just spawns the other car right next to it. If there are trees or other cars you will spawn inside them.The game is not very  playable as it is. Its ok for about 10 minutes or so at a time, but after that it crashes, or you will just get bored. I am not sure the developers mission. The progress has been really slow since I got the game. I expect in the end for the game to be playable, and hopefully at the sim level for driving experience. As for what kind of sim it will be, I am guessing a crash sim involving all terrain situations.

								I recommend this game to anyone who is in search of a crash simulator, a driving simulator, a game with realistic In-Depth car customisation or just a way to pass some time if you dont want to bother loading into any other game.So far I have played almost 80 hours of this game, which is a fairly high amount for me and actually more than I have played GTA V. I have installed quite a few mods and lokked deep into the vehicle customization.Just a few things you can do in the game:-Simulate crashes with (on my PC) up to six vehicles (which can have a rudimentary AI)-Just drive around and relax-Create your very own dream vehicle from models roughly resembling real life cars-Race around various tracks included in some of the maps-Finetune your suspension in terms of ride height, spring stiffness, track width and more-Install dozens of mods, some of them with incredibly high quality-explore the detailed maps, find all the secret passages- ... and quite a lot more!As far as I can tell, the game runs very smoothly until you spawn to many cars (6 on my PC), it looks great even on lower graphical settings and has a FoV-Slider so TotalBiscuit will be happy. Extremely high velocity/force impacts don't look that great, but are still a accurate depiction of what would happen to a similar car (despite some parts clipping through others bended textures/Jbeams etc...) Aside from that crashes in this game are almost worthy of next generation car testing. E.g. brake thermals and cooling liquids and other stuff gets simulated.Stuff you should know:Though it's possible to play this game with a keyboard you will have a hard time controlling especially the stronger/older car variants. This is because a keyboard limits you to full throttle, none at all and hard braking. The best option would be a steering wheel,but a contoller also works just fine. The game has force feedback compatibility in general, however this doesn't apply to my ancient  SpeedLink wheel.There is a experimental replay feature, but it's still a buggy mess. I guess it will be fixed very soon, look out for that.Which brings me to my next point: The game gets updated regularly (a major content patch comes out every 1/2 months, of high quality, with bugfixes, optimisations and like I said, content). BeamNG also has a very nice and helpful community.What I don't like as of now:-The sounds (which have been described as placeholders by the devs) are plain horrible, but they said that they hired a     sound effects guy in the last devblog.-The particles are not all that detailed and plenty compared to real car crashes-The game tends to bug out sometimes, nothing major, but it's there and its annoying			"

								This game is going to be great! KEEP IN MIND GUYS THIS IS A BRANCH OFF THE IDEA OF ""RIGS OF RODS"" one of the best physics games in the world! this game will be the same but better only because the physics engine is cryengine! and ofcourse not to mention the fact that the detail is done very well! All you guys need to do is add an area for people to make vehicles such as, airplanes, helicopters, trains, motocycles, and even truggy veicles with soft wheels for people who like to pull trailers around to stress test vehicles. WE ALL LIKE TO LOAD TRAILERS AND WITH OBJECTS OVER SIZED AND TO HEAVY! I Want to see the impossible with the game! the race feature is great! thats something rigs of rods couldnt do correctly. YOU GUYS CAN DO THIS! IT WILL BE ABSOLOUTE! please do this like rigs of rods cars in any mod fashion or form will be accepted whether its finished or not! ... 5 future stars.3 for all the hard work you guys have put in to it now.

			My BeamNG.drive experience		

Not the best quality but it gives you an idea.BeamNG.drive really is a nice game. I personally adore sandboxes, just because you can do whatever you want. The fact that you can download mods makes it even better, you are actually encouraged to install mods and expand the possibilities to the max. I don't have a drivers license, so I can't say much about how the verhicles handle in comparison with real ones, however, I know enough about physics to say that it is pretty damn good. For example, when you brake slowly without slipping instead of completely burning your tires, you will actually brake faster because the braking force is higher. When you accelerate when your vehicle is flying through the air, you won't see your actual speed because your tires don't touch the ground. Next to all those details you can also place small apps on the screen that show engine info, like the force from the engine itself, the force from the tires, windspeed, weight, G-force, etc. etc. The game does contain some minor bugs, but because it is still an early access game, I don't mind.Overall: 7,5/10			"

I am so happy to  see how far it has come over the years and I can't wait to see what the dev team have for us in the upcoming years. The game has loads of custom content ranging from skins, vehicles, scenarios and even fully set up maps. Some mods are full of awesome quality some aren't. What I'd like to see later is Steam Workshop support.			"

								""The pinnacle of technology, in a sandbox like game.""Beamng drive is modder friendly, which is outstanding, considering it is in an early Alpha state which generally leaves it to be unsupported for modders and the like. The fact that they have an entire website practically dedicated to mods makes the game much more content free and full.The use of scenarios in the game allows users to have an experience that they wouldn’t otherwise have. The constantly expanding game mechanics and car list increments with every update and keeps the game fresh.If you thought the cars were good, you should check out the maps; each map looks stunning and you can tell that each update the developers put months of effort into the map. The ever increasing game mechanics is mind-blowing, from racing around with basic brakes that cause bake fade, to damaging the piston rings and overheating oil.Whether or not you like realistically driving, or like crashing a dragster into a truck, this games has lots of features, and the updates just keep coming.In conclusion, this is probably the best game I have ever come across, rivalling, in my opinion, need for speed most wanted 2005 and burnout 3 takedown. I can't recommend this highly enough.			"

								My BeamNG.drive experience:


YouTube™ Video: BeamNG crash compilation 

			Views: 197		

			My BeamNG.drive experience		

Not the best quality but it gives you an idea.BeamNG.drive really is a nice game. I personally adore sandboxes, just because you can do whatever you want. The fact that you can download mods makes it even better, you are actually encouraged to install mods and expand the possibilities to the max. I don't have a drivers license, so I can't say much about how the verhicles handle in comparison with real ones, however, I know enough about physics to say that it is pretty damn good. For example, when you brake slowly without slipping instead of completely burning your tires, you will actually brake faster because the braking force is higher. When you accelerate when your vehicle is flying through the air, you won't see your actual speed because your tires don't touch the ground. Next to all those details you can also place small apps on the screen that show engine info, like the force from the engine itself, the force from the tires, windspeed, weight, G-force, etc. etc. The game does contain some minor bugs, but because it is still an early access game, I don't mind.Overall: 7,5/10			"

								This game can be sumarized in a couple words.HIROSHIMA (He-Row-She-Ma):The United States, with the consent of the United Kingdom as laid down in the Quebec Agreement, dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.In the final year of the war, the Allies prepared for what was anticipated to be a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This was preceded by a U.S. firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945. The Japanese, facing the same fate, refused to accept the Allies' demands for unconditional surrender and the Pacific War continued. Together with the United Kingdom and China, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese response to this ultimatum was to ignore it.On July 16, 1945, the Allied Manhattan Project successfully detonated an atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert and by August had produced atomic weapons based on two alternate designs. The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands.On August 6, the U.S. dropped a uranium gun-type atomic bomb (Little Boy) on Hiroshima. American President Harry S. Truman called for Japan's surrender 16 hours later, warning them to ""expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth."" Three days later, on August 9, the U.S. dropped a plutonium implosion-type bomb (Fat Man) on Nagasaki. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed 90,000–146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000–80,000 in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.On August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies. On September 2, it signed the instrument of surrender, effectively ending World War II. The bombings' role in Japan's surrender and their ethical justification are still debated.			"

Early Access Review
								I will madly not admire this game, that it in early access it not strongly introduces stunning emotions of driving by the car. Entirely in principle it is possible to see it also in other games. For example emphasis is put on system of damage which looks not bad, but not at the top level. In my opinion it would be possible to impose more grounds on the car and by that there would be even more realistic specification of damage (if has gone to that and to place emphasis on damages)The schedule in a game at the good level but after all could be added a variety of landscapes and infrastructure of the current route. Infrastructure needs to be finished in my opinion seriously. To pay bigger attention to other moving objects in a game less static routes.In general this very original and unusual game which I very much hope will be brought to perfectionAs the car simulator from my point of sight - a game is made perfectly! Management in a game is made excellently!Я не буду безумно восторгаться этой игрой,с учётом того что она в раннем доступе она не сильно привносит сногсшибательных эмоций вождения автомобилем.Всецело впринципе это можно видеть и в других играх.Например упор сделан на систему повреждения которая выглядит неплохо, но не на высшем уровне.На мой взгляд можно было бы больше наложить полигонов на машину и тем самым было бы ещё более реалистичная детализация повреждения(если на то уж пошло и  делать упор на повреждения)Графика в игре на хорошем уровне но всё-таки можно было добавить разнообразие ландшафтов и инфраструктуру текущей трассы.Инфраструктуру нужно на мой взгляд  серьёзно доработать.Большее внимание уделить другим движущимся обьектам в игре и меньше статичных трасс.В целом эта очень оригинальная и необычная игра которая я очень надеюсь будет доведена до совершенстваКак симулятор автомобиля с моей точки зрения- игра  сделана великолепно!Управление в игре сделано превосходно!

								Awesome game it has great physics, graphics, You can change the enviornment (gravity, time, fog, and more) you can do so many things with the vehicles, including crashing and burning. And even better if you really want a Zr1 Corvette in the game or Pagondi Zonda, then search the mod section and you will likely find it. If not then you can design one your self! If you have mastered and know the currently avalible courses like the back of your hand then you can get more!I really Love this game even while in Alpha and i highly recomend it. Check if your computer can run the demo and If so, then i encourage you to get BeamNG.Drive			"

								So much destructive fun!This game features soft body physics. Which means when you crash your car, it bends and smashes realisticly. The game also supports mods and controllers for even more fun!Beautiful graphics, even though my machine can barely run it on max (I set it to medium-low).The cars are detailed from the mechanical inside, to the inside, and to the outside. So are the levelsOverall: 10/10 (Seriously)			"

								***Updated review***The developer has fixed a tons of problems with this game and now I can honestly recommend this.This is really fun car physics simulator and this game has the best and most detailed damage modeling what I have ever seen. Also this game have very rich modding community there is lot of vehicles and maps what you can get - and even better now like 98% of that stuff works with the game. And it´s really fun to smash cars. So if you are a creative person and love cars, you can easily spend weeks with this game just messing around. And if you want to photograph cars, you can do it, or if you want smash a taxi with a bus go ahead and try it. There is even aeroplanes modded for this game. Also by editing files you can tune up cars and add engine options etc. But you have to know what are you doing.			"

								This game needs a lot of work (the sound is terrible at the moment, sounds like something out of a game from the 80's), but the physics and controller support are amazing!This game is in alpha, so I am sure (hopeful) it will get better, but the promise of a game that is everything it promises is... promising :)I look forward to seeing this game further developed into the next level of racing sim.On a side note: the choice (or lack of choice) to use cars that are close to real, but not brand licensed works very well and unless car makers start giving away rights to their vehicles, I don't car if I am driving something with badges that are not ""real"" (so long as a ""Mustang-like"" of some generation is eventually included). Looking forward to seeing a LOT more cars.			"

								Now I have owned Beam.ng now for about 1 - 2 years and let me tell you from experience, it is incredibly well put together.  I decided to take a gander at the negative reviews, and noticed one common thing about them.  They all have barely over (if not under) one hour spent on the game.  I will now proceed to break them down.One common hatred towards beam.ng is the car handling.  People keep complaining about the difficulty steering and such, but remember when GTAV came out, and how different the driving was in that game?  It took me at least 3 hours to stop hating it and get used to it.  You cant judge how cars handle based on an hour of gameplay.  It alone took me 5 hours to finally master ONE of them.Another complaint was that people hated how fun it looked on YouTube and couldn't seem to replicate the things that they saw online.  Well guess what?  you heard it as a kid, and you're hearing it now.  PRACTICE.  MAKES.  PERFECT.  I seriously don't want to know how many hours youtubers like WhyBeAre have spent on this game, but i can guarentee it's a lot.  I don't know half of the different featurers that this game possesses and I have spent 42 hours playing this game.So if you're a guy who looks for the TL;DR...If you're a whiny little kid who doesn't want to take a Softbox physics simulator seriously and just wants to hop in the game as fast as possible and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, then I reccomend Gary's Mod.   Otherwise, have fun absolutey destroying the cars in this incredible game.			"

								This game has an extremely addictive personality to it allowing you as the player to interact with the physics of each and every vehicle within this game.I well and truely reccomned this game to anyone that's interested in soft body physics of cars.Also this game features an immaculate representation of time passing, allowing the player to unlock what is not seen by us in the event of a vehicle collision or accident because our eyes and brain can only see at 25-26 frames per second (this is why 60fps and above is good) the mechanic of this game lets you slow down time to a maximum of x100 letting you see the whole crash from start to finish with superb deformity of the cars in this stunning simulation of the soft body physics of cars there is a gravity control machanic letting you choose the gravity on a slider or by clicking the presets given which starts at the sun and finishes at pluto going though each and every plannet in our solar system there is also luna gravity too but only featuring The Moon though.All in all this is a fornominal game and simulation and i've already clocked in 13.8 hours into this on steam but off steam its most likely embarrisingly longer because it's such an inriching and infinatly pleasing experience cars being crashed, crumpled and smoshed either by other cars or just by driving them into walls and not having to explain to insurance companies and loosing your possible future offspring's inheritance. anyway this review is definatly not bias and rambley at all and i think you should buy it for 20 quid on steam because its amazing and cool and stuff. lel			"

								Well what can I say, I’ve had this game since early 2013 And it has finally been released on steam. It’s fair to say that this game has taken a while to get this far and it’s still far from finished, to the point were with any other game I'd criticize it, but with a team so small and so much potential I really can’t.This game is truly brilliant with the best damage models/physics engine ever and fairly good graphics. The only problem is that their is currently very basic AI, no missions/races and no system for buying/repairing cars.But at the end of the day, I get to destroy stuff.(if you see this a few years singleplayer races and such will have been added so it will definatly be worth buying)Update 17/10/15 The AI has improved hugely and there are now a variety of missions including car chases and time trials.

								You will not find a game like this anywhere else. You cannot compare this with 'Next Car Game', they are completely different games. 'Next Car Game' sacrifices it's realism for a better racing experience, whereas BeamNG.drive focuses completely on realism. The developers plan on adding a career mode with various gamemodes such as races and delivery missions. At the current time, even without these missions, this is by far my favourite ""racing"" game.			"

								It would be very awesome if you could make a ""Low End"" version of beamng.drive that can run on stock laptops (laptops with no dedicated gpu and with 4gb ram or less) without lag (at 30 or 60 fps)and make it available in beta programs! I have 3.89 gb of available RAM and 59mb of graphics memory (dedicated) and i have to play beamng on lowest settings and disable collision and i still run it at 15-20 fps.			"

								0.4 hrs on record... on steam. Had the game before steam and I really enjoyed the concept, the physics in the game are pretty amazing. For me, the game was a bit resource intensive and demanded a bit from my pc. I really don't have the greatest hardware so I can't say this will be constant between all PCs, which it more than likely won't be, but it did seem to need a bit to play smoothly. Other than that and at the time the vehicle selection was lacking, the game is great, graphics are great and the simulator is really fun if you love crashing vehicles into things and going on loop-d-loops			"

								What I would love, is if they had an update which added a BUNCH of new skins (that dont break copyright of course) for super cars like the Sunburst, Bolide, and maybe even the SBR. And the skins would be racing skins and the update adds pre-made races where you can chose the skin and race against the CPU's. Regardless, it is a VERY good game, and it has one of the best physics engines out there. I'd recommend this to any car lover out there.			"

								Nobody can say should you buy this or not because first of all its a early access still so the game isnt finished yet but hope it will be soon.PROS- Crashing!  Crashing seems really good if you have seen real crashes- Cars. You can choose in Early access many cars not just few like many other sandbox games gives us.- Car Tuning.  In some cars you can tune them a lot! it makes it really interesting :)NEGATIVE- Driving :(   Sadly the driving isnt really good and you lose your grip REALLY easily. driving in a normal road 60km/h and wosh you are in the tree next time..- Scenarios.  Scenarios becomes negative just because the driving.. some Scenarios are really fun and cool but when you get a road what is jumpy as hell.. you just cannot keep your car straight it just keeps going to the tree in no time.- AI.  The bot driver mostly these Scenarios where you are a Police this AI can be smart or just really really stupid.. there isnt much where you versus bot is but I hope there will be more..Yeah this game isnt now or never will be made for Racing or do missions etc but I hope :) its a good start and I believe it will be good in the end.. 7/10 would cry more but tired			"

								Awesome! Though the title says that Beam.NG Drive is in Beta testing, it is definately worth the money! As there are many pros to this game, I would like to point out the only con of this whole game. I would DEFINATELY RECCOMEND this game for people who have computers with a 4.0 or over graphics processor on their computers. I have a 4.0 on my graphics processor (I obviously don't play lots of games on my PC), and unfortunately I lag a lot on maps other that the empty, infinite one, and the testing area with the half pipes and stuff. <-- (Sorry, I forgot the names of the maps..) Anyways, for a lot of reasons I would actually definately reccomend this game to people with (fairly good) computers.			"

								I know what some of you are thinking, ""this is basically a tech demo, how can you have fun enough to equal $25?"" My answer to you is this; ya just do.Although it is a very bare-bones ""game"", somehow Beamng manages to pull me back in every once in awhile. I cant even really explain it, but Im not really sure I have to, because from my experience, the physics engine really does live up to the hype. The way the metal twists and bends freely, the way the tires burst if you land hard, the way the reliant robin constantly gets scratches all over because it is the worst thing ever concieved by man...And the thing is the game isnt even close to being a polished product yet, which means there will most likely be so much more added by the time the release is official.In short, get this game, because its freakin awesome.

								I've got real addicted to this game but there is one problem I spotted, if you spawn a car near trees, it may spawn inside of the tree.In the next update, could we get a system that allows you to spawn the car in the place you want?I'm not saying the game's bad or anything, it's good. I got a car to follow another car when that car was fleeing from the car following that car. I know, that makes no sense at all. But the game is great.The main problems I sometimes have are:-I mostly can't switch to another car with the tab button,-I sometimes spawn inside trees (As I mentioned earlier),-And sometimes the circular menu thingy dot cursor thing (End me) keeps aiming at the wrong thing and choosing the wrong thing to what I want doing.Now these problems I want fixed.Overall, the game does have  nice performance and realistic physics which makes me get addicted to this game, all I do is break cars apart.If I was to give it a rating out of ten, it would be 8/10.

								I LOVE THIS GAME! I PLAY IT IN ALL OF MY FREE TIME ! I have 21 hours on record and 1.6 hours this week and counting. I love the variaty of vehicles and props and most of all obliterating cars! I'm a car geek and I stumbled on to this game and just loved it! I think i've had it for 2 years now. I just started making videos for the game itself, and and of course MODS. The modding community is outrageous and there are plenty of cars and terrains to choose from. If you get bored (I still haven't!) then definately check out BeamNG.com/mods! I would recommend it to anybody with a great PC. The graphics are amazing on my home built PC, but If you have like, an HP or Dell that works to. I haven't tried on the Mac though. I think it has support. Yes, I have three computers and a laptop. ok, now i'm off topic but I would like to say that it is worth 24.99! and last Dear devs, if you could add a minivan to smash, that would be great!			"

								What a great game, I have been playing since it was in beta way before it ever reached Steam and probally have a good 200 hrs on it then. The realism just gets better and better as the updates come out. That brings me to another point, the dev team is great with listening to the community and has regular monthly updates. This game has come very far and can't wait to see how far it goes.  10/10			"

								Three Reasons Why You Should By This Game:Amazing physics you wont find anywhere elseScenarios you wont find anywhere elseGo to 1But in all seriousness, this game really is amazing, why buy a brand new Ferrari, when you can download one for free?Why go listen to some dumb old car dealers when you can pick out cars for yourself?Why spend money on a plane ticket when you can do amazing tricks in a stunt plane, with no license!Why pay 100s, or even 1000s of dollars on a new paint job, when you can do one for $0?                                                                                                                                                                                                     This game generates genuine laughs from my whole family, even my dad, who hates video games. Literally, best car game I've ever played.In all this game's awesomeness, I would like to see one thing added. It would be really neat if you could add an NPC option, your enable or disable it, and it would provide NPCs for all the maps. So you could crash, or try to get passed traffic. It would be really fun.THANK YOU SO MUCH DEVELOPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU HAVE MY THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█████████░░███████░░░░░░░░░░███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒███░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░░░░░███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒███░░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░░██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░░░░█▒▒▒▒▒█░░░██▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒███░░░░░█▒▒▒█░░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒▒▒██░░░█████████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒███████████▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░█▒▒▒███████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░████████████░░░█████████████████			"

								This game is one of the best games I've played!! It's so realistic, you can choose from many car models to play as, you can set the AI for other spawned vehicles. I love to use the ""Chase Me"" AI option, as it makes other spawned vehicles chase you. And I LOVE the car crashes, it looks soo realistic, like what you might see in real life!			"

								Searching for a game in which you can do virtually anything you can do in a real car and much, much, more?Ever seen one of those accident animations made by road safety insitutes and such, and wished it was a game?Ever wanted what a racing game would be like if your vehicle took damage just a real car?Ever wondered, what would happen if I load a Ferrari in a box truck which is towing a caravan and drop that whole thing off a skyscraper onto a compact car on top of a police cruiser on top of a school bus?If yes, try BeamNG.drive, chances are good that youˋll like what you see.It is easily the most accurate and fun vehicle sandbox you will find. The dynamic physics and deformations are unique, you can run the same vehicle into the same obstacle as often as you want and never produce the exact same accident ever.Also, this game does ""Early access"" very right, updates just keep coming. With that and a vivid modding community (off Steam as of now though) you are not going to run out of new toys to play with any time soon.The only thing I really miss is a proper replay function, and the slow motion fuction needs a bit of tweaking as it sometimes glitches out when switching between vehicles.

								Hi Everyone! I promised one of the people at BeamNG I would give an honest review of BeamNG.drive an honest Review so here it goes. As you can see I have put 37.2 hrs to date actually playing the game but what you can't see is the 100 or so hours I have used in resurching diffrent aspects of the game as well and here is what I have found. For those of you that don't mind doing the reasurch involved and have a better then basic understanding of computer modeling and softwear This could be the best game in the world to own but if your like me and just want to do all the things you've seen on videos and have a imagination that keeps you up nights trying new things but can't quite figure out how to make it happen then this can be quite frustraiting at times and your not alone. Little things like picking up a car and placing it into a position all the way up to building new ramps or objects to run into or over can be quite nervracking if you don'tknow or can't figure out the map editor. Many of the YouTube video's show some pretty awsome stunts but even fewer of them will tell you how it's done. I have spen't hours looking for good tutorials but unfortunetly they are few and far between and they are often incomplete or just plain outdated and don't work withe the ever increasing number of updates. Unfortunetly when using the map editor or any other editor (they have a list) if you don't know what you are doing and are unfortunite enough to know how to get rid of it. You may find the same problem the next time you load the very same map So if there is anything I may suggest is you Back up the game the very first time you load it as well as copy all your mods to a outside folder so they can all be added at the same time should you need to reinstall the game. This was a nother lesson I leaned the hard way.    On the brighter side this game isn't finnished not yet and BeamNG.drive is constantly being worked on by a group of dedicated and carring induviduals from diffrent countries around the world and I've been around long enough to know that anything ever built good takes a long time to perfect. There is so many cool parts of this game and if they keep going at it with the dedication they have exhibited thus far I haven't a doubt someday thier are going to be even larger groups of gammers playing BeamNG.drive and withing they had it there game library a lot sooner. Even if your just an old Hightech junkie redneck like me It's still a lot of fun. As for you You Tubers that like to make BeamNG.drive videos when your showing something that might be new to some of us,  It's ok to show how you did it, not everyone knows what you might know so please pass the info along. THX			"

								The most advanced-physics game I've ever seen where you can try over 10 pre-made maps, and over 100 cars that you can edit and paint to match your style! Mods are easy to install and can add all sorts of new features, like new cars, maps, or even planes and boats!!! You could call this a simulator, or a highly-destructive game where you fly burning cement trucks off cliffs! Either way, it's really fun and totally worth the money, but I warn you that it does take a computer at least half-desent!			"

								I waited to post a review for Beam.NG because for a while, it was more like a tech demo than a game. I still considered it one of the most fun games I'd played, but it was cumbersome for anyone that wanted to just play a game. The early versions could require as much work as play at times, and obviously a project this ambitious had some problems with performance and optimization.Now between the mods and the actual Campaigns and scenarios built in, I feel comfortable recommending it without reservation. There is plenty of content right out of the box, and the game seems to scale for lower-end machines much better every time an update drops. I simply cannot speak highly enough of this game at this point. Once you dip your toes into the released content, I challenge anyone not to beg for more.Luckily, there is an tremendous mod scene. It's not built into Steam (for reasons beyond me, it's discussed on the forums and the official website). https://www.beamng.com/resources/ Do yourself a plethora of favors, there is a giant banner that will walk you through the incredibly simple process of adding mods (At the time of writing, there is no built-in manager. Just download and move to the corrrect folder, the game detects them on start-up). Also, anything tagged Alpha or Beta is official content that is just not finished or released into the full game. I have barely scratched the surface and try to stick to official mods for compatibility reasons.If it runs poorly, wait it out or request a refund :/ I'd recommend a gamepad or wheel for driving but you'll need KB+M for the interface. The latest patch even made it possible to work the UI over Steam Link (360 controller only), as long as I wasn't trying to go to the moon. If it seems too much like work, spend 10m on YouTube and find a decent beginner's guide (the official site also has plenty of great info). I literally cannot think of a complaint about this game, unless it being made so well that it becomes esoteric counts. I don't count it.			"

								Searching for a game in which you can do virtually anything you can do in a real car and much, much, more?Ever seen one of those accident animations made by road safety insitutes and such, and wished it was a game?Ever wanted what a racing game would be like if your vehicle took damage just a real car?Ever wondered, what would happen if I load a Ferrari in a box truck which is towing a caravan and drop that whole thing off a skyscraper onto a compact car on top of a police cruiser on top of a school bus?If yes, try BeamNG.drive, chances are good that youˋll like what you see.It is easily the most accurate and fun vehicle sandbox you will find. The dynamic physics and deformations are unique, you can run the same vehicle into the same obstacle as often as you want and never produce the exact same accident ever.Also, this game does ""Early access"" very right, updates just keep coming. With that and a vivid modding community (off Steam as of now though) you are not going to run out of new toys to play with any time soon.The only thing I really miss is a proper replay function, and the slow motion fuction needs a bit of tweaking as it sometimes glitches out when switching between vehicles.

								One of the most detailed collision/physics systems of all time. The cars tend to feel a bit floaty, or too lightweight, as once you hit 60+ mp/h its like traction on your tires becomes disabled. This isn't a racing sim. This is a driving sim. Larger, more detailed environments will bring this game to life, as well as other drivers (either real or AI). Cars are quite customizable, and there's a ton of options for you to play with.I also spent almost all of my play time crashing my car or driving off the cliff level in first person view.			"

								Concept is very good, but developers are not very nice or good. BeamNG is all about crashing, crash physics and visual damage is 99% real-life like. Here is my BeamNG vs Real Life comparison video 


YouTube™ Video: BeamNG.drive vs Real Life - 120 mp/h Crash Test in Slow Motion (Game vs Real) #2 

			Views: 297,798		

			Part #1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wC3eN7GPlE Part #3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VijxfRkQHw Side by Side comparison of BeamNG Game vs Real Car Crashing into a solid wall at 120 mp/h...		

Very accurate, but developers constantly break things and try adding nonsense that nobody cares about. This game is not about driving or racing, if you want a racing game, play Next Car Game Wreckfest or Need for Speed series, BeamNG is all about crash physics. Developers need to add demolition derby option.99% of people who play this game, play it for the damage and crashes.I do recommend this game, but just be warned ... game is buggy and glitchy and developer support is very poor.2 years ago, developers PROMISED to have demoltion derby events out, now 2 years later (almost 3), they have removed the option to have basic demolition derby, very disappointed in this.Don't get me wrong, game is cool and concept is unique, but progress is slow and developers do what they want to do, they do not listen to the community at all.A good game is not a game where developers do what they want, but a game where developers listen to majority of their customers and fulfill their ideas.

								While traveling to California to race against The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) for the Piston Cup Championship, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) becomes lost after falling out of his trailer in a run down town called Radiator Springs. While there he slowly befriends the town's odd residents, including Sally (Bonnie Hunt), Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). When it comes time for him to leave to championship is no longer his top priority. ''would car all over again''			"

I like the physics aspect as well, you can simulate another planets gravity (the moon will leave you floating in the sky whilst Jupiter's will really force the cars body down).This seems like another brilliant sandbox style game it will leave you feeling great as you choose a seemingly infinite amount of fun maps and enjoy fiddling and changing your car.

								Let me start by saying something that would have interested me before buying -- This is not a realistic driving simulation -What do I mean by this? Every part of the car is physically simulated, each part can break off, be bent etc. It's a very complicated and fairly realistic simulation. As such the behaviour of the cars is entirely dependent on this physics simulation being near perfect - but although it is very good, it is far from perfect.Every car massively understeers, even at low speeds I know from experience driving a car every day to and from work would be absolutely nowhere near breaking traction. In the AWD cars they easily oversteer because of the lack of control at the front wheels. I believe this is due to slight instabilities of the physics simulation - I have seen the front wheels spasming under load and as such they do not maintain friction like they would in a real car.So it's a great physics simulation which is a ton of fun. The damage and crashes are great. But it doesn't come close to being a good driving simulation like DiRT Rally.I recommend this game, but not if you are after a realistic driving sim.			"

								TL;DR Break cars, break trucks, break the physics engine, break logic. Development is alive. Modding scene is alive.Some people aren't happy with the 30$ price tag... I say don't buy the game then... don't buy any game if you aren't willing to shell out 30$ for a game, but you can some how afford the 900$ rig to run it on.====Cons====*Cars handle like they are buttered up*Acceleration acts like you are a lead foot (unless using keyboard controls)*Advanced controls (like slowmotion and free cam) are tucked away behind a *show advanced controls* button in the controls menu====Pros====*The cars can wad up like a ball of paper*There are some pretty cool mods*Seems to run fine on some potatoes (big lag if using multiple cars or big mods)*If the physics engine wigs out and crashes, the game does not crash, it will simply reset the vehicle it was simulating at the time. This is a godsend.*You'll get better used to the ""buttery cars"" I mentioned above after a few hours of play.*The UI is clunky but becomes easier to understand after just an hour or so of play*The hud is completely customizable with many gadgets you can place, remove, move around, and resize to your hearts content! (You can also select wether they show in the ""driver cam"")If you were looking for a serious driving experience you won't find it here. This is a sandbox smash 'em up at the moment. They do have a campaign and the likes in the works right now though. So maybe check back later.			"

DO NOT BUY THIS IF your hardware is low / Med quality .  i have a real good PC and i get about 8 - 12 FPS . but i just need a graphics card in my case .7/10			"

								This game is an inbetween buy. (Please read before downvoting)It has very, horrible things, and very, very good things.I know it's in the early access, but it's been that way for like 3 or more years?I'll start with the cons first.-No option to flip your car. You have to manually drag the car and try to flip it over, or pull it out of ditches.-When crashing or resetting, your car can get stuck inside of objects and underneath the ground, so you have to manually drag it from the ground, ripping off chunks of it and then resetting it, it's just extremely clunky.-When just driving and cornering you can bend parts of the vehicle, thereby making the steering tilt one way or popping the tires .etc.-Some of the maps were built by absolute morons. The giant ""test"" map with all of the ramps and things has a random tree next to the jumps, a huge random wall for no reason, there is no end to the map, basically you drive until the textures run out and then it's just nothing. There is a halfpipe-tube thing that has a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing blocks in the way, so you can't drive straight, you can only try to avoid them and drive half way up the pipe, getting stuck in them and breaking your vehicle so you have to reset it, drag it out of it, reset it again, and then try to get out.Personally I also think this game is a taaaad bit expensive for what it offers, but I love it anyway.-- This game has a lot of bugs like this, which make it frustrating at times.PROS:Amazingly good physics and crash detail.Very good car details.Great mod support.Very fun for just a sandbox car game.-Have fun with this game!

								1. buys sexy new car2. wrecks sexy new car3. realize how awful your sexy new car is4. be happy that you wrecked your new sexy car so you can buy a new sexy car5. life completebtw this game rocks you should totally buy it!! :DSerious Review:PHYSICS:Awesome. Spectacular.This game runs on an engine called Torque3D, and based off my time that I've spent enjoying this game, it's really good. The crash physics are awesome. The suspension simulation, the physics, everything, is perfect.CONTROLS:Has decent wheel support. I think the forcefeedback could be improved, but beyond that, it's awesome.The handling of the cars is just right. Perhaps not the best in the world, but it works really well. The cars feel heavy, the steering of cars isn't too arcade-like, it feels just right.GRAPHICS:Pretty. Moving on.MODDING:It's very easy to do. The developers have made a mod section of their website to easily find mods instead of using the forums. I guess it works, but I don't know why they had to put more load on their servers when they could have simply created a steam workshop. Other than that, you'll never need anything more than winrar it seems. All I ever need to do is just drop files into a folder named ""mods"". It's incredible.It's a fun game to play. Worth the money.			"

								The game looked pretty cool but it is actually not as fun as it looks. Maybe in the future it will get better but for now i don't think it is worth it. The mods aren't so safe unless you go on their own website and it has very little mods. Also mods are a big part of the game and I want it was disappointing that the mods i wanted were risky to get.Pros:- The physics/ destruction is awesome- There is a slow motion mode- ModsCons:- Most good mods aren't very safe to download- Not much replayability even though there are mods- Only about 21 vehicles to start with as of now			"

								While I love the damage, the actual driving struck me as pretty appalling. If a real car handled like this you'd take it straight to the garage. I find it incredible that in this day and age most driving games still haven't got past that central pivot physics that bears no relation to how a real car moves. It was there in the original Colin Mcrae Rally and it's still going strong in this game.			"

								In my honest opinion, this game is quite good and has alot of potential but is rather overshadowed by other competitors. This game is mostly for people who enjoy the physics engine more than racing as other games like Forza Horizon 3 offer the same amount of content AND alot more, including multiplayer. All around, my recommendation is to save up for Forza Horizon 3 as its quite a bit more content packed, it uses real brands/cars and it has great multiplayer.			"

I enjoy racing games on occasion, but I like racing moreso with my friends, which you cannot do here since there is no multiplayer.The UI is my biggest problem, it was very clunky and the controls for spawning, despawning, repositioning, etc. were not very intuitive and I found myself going through the options menu multiple times.They physics are very fun, while somewhat unfinished, but that is to be expected from an early access game.I refunded the game, although if improvements are made I would like to try it again.

								I'm honestly a bit disappointed. Read a lot of good about this simulation, but although I did not expect that much content, there is honestly not much there. The car simulations are good, but there is really not much to do or achieve. The menu is just horrible, can mostly only be controlled with a mouse although it's better to drive with something else of course. The scenarios feel fiddly, incomplete and sometimes get stuck without any reason. The camera and games (especially the slow-mo that takes forever) feel incomplete. So all and all I didn't enjoy myself and found nothing to do after 1.3 hours.There is a lot of potential, especially for couch co-op with minigames, racing and what not, but right now I didn't find any enjoyment after the first hour.

								If you looking for a crash game, this might be it...As for a driving game. This isn't what i hoped for....Destruction models are impressiveBut the driving models need some more polishThe next car game made me take a look at this, and it's not comparable, NCG had less destruction but was fun to drive. This was a bit of the opposite.But the developer is feedback hungry and that should result in improvements (read the comments)			"

								no matter how many times i report the game crashing, i never get anything back. you keep updating the game and you are just killing people that don't have the worlds best computer. you should at least listen to your crash reports and be able to disable stuff like campain and other stuff that kills computers.

								Developers keep hindering the fun out of the game for the sake of realism, to some extent the realism is a very fun part of BeamNG however now i'm left with a fustrated feeling when i can't disable something because it gets in the way of having fun and that's why i play games.Engine thermals, they're great and i think work pretty well besides vanilla radiators cannot handle the power of some of the vanilla performance parts and there is no option to turn it off so you can mess with a stupid build or just do fun stuff for the sake of doing fun stuff.Brake thermals/efficency, Actually love it because the developers put pads in the game that i've been unable to kill meaning it's never affected my fun, if i wanted to do stupid things i just put in the best pads and i go have fun, if i want to roast some brakes on a hillclimb car then i put basic ones in. awesome system.Powerterrain improvements, This update is awesome and for the most parts i can't find faults (now i've worked some out aka Throttle/clutch assist). High and low range transfer cases combined with locking diffs is epic for some rock crawling (Edited the manual transmission LUA to disable the scripted gear breaking) however once working out how to get my old shifting style back i've found the game just breaks my gears when i shift without the clutch (i use a controller not a wheel/pedal setup) and this happens fairly quickly, neutral dump on some stock tires and two or three times the gear breaks however if stage three turbo 200BX running 14' slicks at 10PSI and sit there dumping the clutch constantly in first the gearbox doesn't care, enough power dumped into the transmission and grip in the tires to pull the car up onto it's back bumper and it's fine, but i can't go from N to 1 without clutch 5 times (while applying throttle) before it breaks.BeamNG is a good game, I'll probably still play it when something new comes out however i'm finding it harder and harder to have fun, i used to sit and play for hours on end and love every moment but now i play it for a few min and get bored. I get it, making it more realistic can be fun and the such but so can turning off all the serious stuff and driving a 1000hp grand marshal to 400klm/h till the tires expload.In a nutshell i can no longer reccomend BeamNG because it's becoming harder to have fun it, atleast for me, everyone is different.Another edit/update.Developers seems to be so stuck in their ways they come across as stuck up and ignorant unable to understand the simple concept of ""♥♥♥♥ realism, I want to have some fun."" not only that but with my experance in the automotive trade I both have an understanding of how things work and have actually seen/done some of this in real life. for instance shifting without a clutch seems to be sacrilege and inturn (though old mate Nadeox1 did offer a solution) responded to in a smartassy way, refer to screenshot.) Another point to note is the Surprise!No audio for 'gear grinding' is present at the moment.comment by Nadeox1, there was no supprise... it's actually right there in the post where he quoted me, I know this, this just looks idiot and childish from someone who's supposed to be a game developer?.also in previous posts i've complained about the fact that simply shifting from n to 1st without a clutch would break a gear (a gear not a suncro, the gear would be usable but the synchro would be distroyed) however i can dump the clutch with 1000hp and grippy 14' drag slicks on a stock 200bx transmission and there's apparently no problem but oh no when i change from N to 1st without a clutch while idling ""gasps"" the gears get distoryed.... -Insert crickets for Diamondback's reply ""Of course gears do not break with the clutch. Why do you think they would?""Does noone seem to understand what i'm saying?, not even people developing this game and are so focused on ""realism"" don't seem to understand some of the basic concepts of a manual transmission. ontop of that, several times i've said dumping the clutch would cause transmission dammage but they keep responding with ""There's no clutch dammage yet"" I'm not talking about dammaging the clutch it's the ♥♥♥♥ing gears breaking that's stupid.http://imgur.com/a/ktZkJ(This review is baised souly on the Vanilla game not encluding mods as I'm reviewing developer content not user created mods)			"

								Fun game, Great Devs (check chat of this review as proof) although a very steep learning curve and in my opinion frustrating camera controls it will grow on you.Edit; I cant get used to the camera controls, to be honest they're the worst camera controls i've ever had to use. Hopefully they will fix it soon, but with the camera on a grid without being able to pan left or right, zoom in or out while trying to move objects/vehicles makes freeroam worthless. Which is my next big deal, you cannot place vehicles or props. They are fixed, you can only move them forward, backward up and down. No pitch, turn, etc and when moving the vehicle via f11 mode, the terrible camera controls coupled with what youre holding stuck on the forward grid means it takes 30 minutes to move a vehicle 20 feet when it should take 10 seconds. Great game but until they fix the camera controls, and improve/simplify moving objects/vehicles Ill have to put the game down. Wouldn't recommend it if you're wanting to do freeroam. When everything is already set up, the games fun as hell. But atm the ""sandbox"" part doesn't work. I should not need to stretch two hands over an entire keyboard, then have to use another none existant hand to hold down every button on my mouse and repeat this 30x just to move an object 20 feet.I know the dev said you'd get used to it, but seriously man. The camera controls and how to place objects just doesn't make sense.Camera should be easily manipulated or atleast have remapping or a tick box As for moving objects/Vehicles all it needs is a CLICK AND DRAG option when the game is paused. Q and E to rotate left or right. Or Alt arrow key... Anything... Think of the game Besiege, it should have camera controls like that. Idk I really want to enjoy this game but its unplayable			"

								EDIT: Apparently as of 11-26-16 some of these things have been fixed, but I don't have the game anymore so I cannot give an honest-re-review until I purchase it again some time. Consider this an archived review... read the comments along with it to get the whole picture.I feel kind of bad giving negative review of this as there has obviously been a ton of work put into it, but after less than 45 minutes of toying with Beam.NG I was already wondering how I was going to get any more enjoyment out of it before it has significantly more content added. I actually asked for suggestions on the forums and people basically told me that it must not be the game for me... as if I wasn't missing anything.First off, the soft body physics are impressive. Some times the way a car looks after being smashed seems a bit off, like its made of clay rather than metal, but I haven't seen such free-form vehicle destruction in any other game.Sadly I think the very physics that make this unique are what bring about the worst negative point I can think of: NO REPLAYS. Apparently, due to the complexity of the physics, its unreasonable (or impossible) to have the game track and record the movement of all of the individual components of the car for playback later. I understand this, but this in itself basically makes a game that is currently based entirely on looking at crashes feel highly disappointing.  If you manage to do something really memorable, you have no way of watching it again from a different angle. The early access nature of the game also means that, in this case, the engine is the main focus, not the gameplay, so its actually very complicated to do basic things to bring about different situations in the game. Adding AI cars is not simple. Vehicles\objects with extra controls aren't explained anywhere in the game, and you'll have to Google them to figure them out.The modding scene is active, but its all based on a forum and is quite difficult to figure out what on earth you should be downloading, what is compatible with the current version, etc. Its an impressive physics engine, and the graphics are good, but currently the lack of content and resulting repetitive nature of things (only one engine sound for all vehicles last time I played it, and no objectives other than a timed lap) along with the lack of a replay system make it a very tough sell for me, and I've been crashing cars in games since ""Hard Drivin'"" for the Sega Genesis in 1989... which had a replay system. I hear that there is more to enjoy here with mods and custom tracks and such, but at this point it takes way too much time and effort to find things (scouring forums) to do in the game, and the best part (the crash, the whole reason for the physics engine) is over in a split second with no way to re-watch it.If the game leaves early access and the reviews reflect that there is more gameplay to be had, I'll probably buy it again as it has a ton of potential, but for $25 right now I can only recommend it to those with a lot of time and patience for modding and tweaking, who also have high end CPUs and a desire to smash things over and over and over.If a replay system is even remotely possible... even if it means a reduction in physics complexity... I think this game needs it. I honestly think that this will massively hurt the game's future.			"

								The physics it uses for car crashes are phenominal, the soft body engine is incredible. It truly is a huge advancement in game phycics. However, as fun as it is to repeatedly crash your cars in delicious 60 fps slow motion, You find it a bit repetative at times. The amount of cars to test on is limited and mods are painful to get working and there aren't many. (Steam workshop pls). The campaign and missions take an eternity to load and are fairly repetative. One of the biggest problems I have with the game is the in game editor, I can barely move cars around and setting crashes up and AI is incredibly complex. The game is still pretty early into its development so I make this review with hope that improvements come underway. At this stage in its development, i'd say this would be great for a game engine, like Euphoria. Having soft body slow motion crashes in racing games and things like grand theft auto would be great, but if beamng can be made into a truly fun and entertaining game, that would be great. I appreciate all the work you guys have put in and anxiously await the future.			"
