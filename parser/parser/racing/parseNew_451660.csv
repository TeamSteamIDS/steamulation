												I like trucks.I dont like this game.Ok, for real. This game is so bad that everything explains itself when you check the date in launcher. build 1.094, Jan, 07, 2006.When you boot up the game you get greeted from an Installer. You need to install the game from yourself. If you just click next it will install under Program Files(x86) and you need to start it from hand from there. The Steam folder hast just the trucker.exe in it, which is just the installer.So you need to copy everything over to the Steam folder and replace/rename the old trucker.exe ....yay, we can start the game from Steam and clock gametime/idle cards for it.Next is that the max resolution is 1280x960.And no Steam Overlay of course.Game runs choppy, not acceptable for an 2006 game :emofdr: the driving itself feels like :poop: too.You cant play in window mode either, alt+return doesnt work and no setting for it.I wont write a detailed review, thats enough. Just dont buy it. Buy some McChicken for it, way more value.			"

												This is a review of Steam's acceptance system more than anything. How does this get accepted!? This game runs like absolute trash, maximum resolution is 1280x960 with a 32 FPS cap! On Steam, it downloads an external installer, then actually downloads the game. I feel like my copmuter now has several viruses!			"

												I have no problem with old games, in fact i love games of the 1990-2000 era, but come on, this game doesn't even run by itself, it puts an installer and links to it..Then you launch the game and realize it doesn't handle controllers properly.Then you start the tournament and you realize how laggy it is.I've played only some minutes and found the gameplay to be too bad to be enjoyable.. especially with keyboard only.This game is not playable..

 This Game has been supplied by a dear friend of mine. Truckers is a Steam Game, released on the 12th of August 2016. Forwarding on after it's release it has gained 5 Negative reviews as of the 23rd of October.  Do not let these people fool you.  Truckers, an innovative Racing game. Upon playing Truckers I've had memorable experiences, from bashing my truck into a debris block and the police wavering to me and crippling my race timer, to figuring out how to digitally use the brakes. The game has replay value along with multiple options for customization letting you be your own Trucker to your own trucking content. The gameplay is solid with excellent drifting mechanics and an immersive first person dashboard view from the truck. All in all the gameplay is up to par with the modern day Forza series and even The Crew. The soundtrack. The soundtrack is memorable with a certain rhythm to it that just brings back the 70's Nostalgia fields, excellent music for the title screen and introduction, this leaves me with an over-all great impression of the game. Not much can be said, as I can only suggest you listen for yourself. The Graphics. The graphics are superb, excellent anti-aliasing and lighting, realistic particle effects of rain and even modern AI of trains this game leaves a very realistic impression, even putting my current GPU (A GTX970) up to it's money. The textures remain high-res at all times, it's merely developer magic that they compressed these nice decals to such quality.  Over-all Truckers left me with a memorable experience that I will carry with me the next time I head on out to the big road in the big world, and Truckers resembled that feeling perfectly. Truckers received a 10/10 in every mark and is over-all a modern day masterpiece.  "
