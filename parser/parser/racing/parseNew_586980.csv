												It's fun.You can explore around and do funny things.It's basically low budget GTA.It needs improvements and multiplayer.			"

												Really nice open world arcade racer with the russian touch !!Yes takes place in typical russian city and bourgades, graphics are really nice and spicey, lots of little details here and there.Nice slight blur effect, nice textures and some cool music too.You start the game by just wandering in the city, grabbing any car you can, and then go do races. You earn cash and can buy cars etc.Overall game feels vibrant, colorish and is great in atmoshpere.Other great point : The price.What i would love them to add : achievements and trading cards, if you read devs, thanks.

												I think this is a very cheap and this game is very good for its price. This game is a very good russian simulator or maybe a russian Grand theft auto. Buy it if you dont know what do you want to buy. this is a very good but a littlebit stupid but good graphics, and good cars: lada, mtz more. BUY IT!For developers: give guns to this game (FPS guns, to the character like an fps shooter) If you guys put weapons to this game, this is going to be AWESOME!!!!!			"

												Quite a cheesy yet interesting game i do like the physics , it looks like one of those android games you can get on google play but i do enjoy it , its very cheap as wellpros: Arcade Style racing game very easy it feels familiar in handellingit has numerous modes 4 distinct modes, Death race, Normal 1 lap race or sprint,  and time attack, and missions  marked by the big M for macksterOpen world and you can get vehicles off the streets or you can buy some right at the far end of the mapgood graphics for unity and an indy developerfeels like my gmod sandbox partiallyLove the ai perfectly programmed to mimic russias driving habits i find it quite funny.any car you have nicked and you like it can be saved in the garagehint there is a supercar hidden in the game that can spawn in the streets thats the best car in the game so far.Quirkiness: It has badly translated russian to english if the devs want a guy to fix the ui i could so it says good english.cons: The already customized cars you can get on the streets you cannot change the colourfiddely controls to buy upgrades no sound to say you bought the upgradeOne car dealership and one repairer/bodyshop not good needs moreoverall:I am overall impressed that madout city  done by a small team or one dev has been done very well I commend the person who has done madout city cheap and Funi expect to have hours of fun on this and its low on hdd space as well only 133 mbFuture development for devs take noteMultiplayer,(recommended but hosted on steam multiplayer servers)More Garages to Repair your vehicle spray your vehicle etcprehaps release some performance shops to futhure enhance your cars modified and unmodified i would like to extreme tune the lada 2101More customization for vehicles start off with a range of spoilers at the bodyshopThe garage you start with needs improvement and rear wall at the garage with a hole for your player to go in and then grab your carYour unique car liveries need to save when you right click and click car_paint because everytime i save it and get it repaired it reverts back to the old livery.(well i did get the supercar which is already tuned)if performance upgrades where released to make your car go faster i would so be nicking that lada in game the lada 2101 and fully tune it with performance upgradesneeds some hardbass like a true slav.for people reading my review: Go buy it and see for yourself guys and gals its actually worth it			"
