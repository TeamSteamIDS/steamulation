												As someone who has done a lot of mechanical work on their cars over the years, I am happy to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is accurate in many ways.  However, it does lack a number of key components of any wrenching session, such as...-The ""This Bolt is so Badly Rusted and Seized That No Amount of Breaker Bars, Impact Wrenches or Penetrating Oil Can Help You Now"" puzzle;-The ""DO YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?!"" EZ-Out Bolt Extractor Mini-Game;-The ""Dropped a Nut in the Engine Bay and it Didn't Hit the Floor"" experience;-The ""Broke a Thousand-Dollar Part While Attempting to Fix a Ten-Dollar Part and Now I'm Inventing New Swear Words"" vocabulary game and its companion, ""Throw the Wrench Across the Garage in a Fit of Rage""; and-The ""Desperate Run to the Parts Store Five Minutes Before Close"" racing game.Oh, I almost forgot about the ever-popular ""Roll to Hit Your Head on Everything Between the Floor and Ceiling"" skill check.  Come to think of it, that's exactly why this game is pretty enjoyable - all of the wrenching without any of the frustrations that come along with it.  In all seriousness, it could use a couple things (for example, removing an engine whole instead of piece-by-piece, then tearing down the engine on a stand outside the car), a bit of polish here and there and, of course, more cars and more customisation (performance parts, tuning and engine swaps would be great!), but overall, CMS 2015 stands well on its own as it is.

												I come from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and found that it (CM Sim 2014) was enjoyable but once I beat the game for the first time and played some of the DLC I felt like I didn't have a reason to pick the game up. When I heard about Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 being in crowdfund mode I was hesitant to put more money down as I felt like it'd be the same thing. A decent time waster until you beat the game. After looking at what they had so far I started to get excited for the title and immediately pledged enough to get the game when it was released. I received my code earlier today and began playing it. The menu is completely different and I found it to be fluid and well designed. It immediately gave me a good vibe. I quickly and eagerly created a profile and began playing. As soon as I started working on the car I automatically fell in love with how it felt. In the previous title it felt like the menus were slow and sluggish. It felt like a burden just to check my inventory. In CMS 2015, that's not the case. The keys are simple and understandable yet pay homage to the original title. Taking off and putting parts on was a breeze. I found myself immerse and even at times swearing like I was working on a real car. Not even kidding. At one point when it told me I had to replace a Piston I was like ""Man forget this game!"" yet I quickly dove into the top end and just started taring down and enjoying it. It's immersive and easy at the same time. I played for 4 hours before I could even test drive a car, but it was worth the wait. I've messed around with the Auction house and that's a great perk. I gave myself a budget and immediately surpassed it because, well 'because I can'. This game feels endless and fun. Fluid, good looking and immersive.I was how ever, disappointed in the fact that when you purchase a car on the auction house, you're required to put back what was on it. For example, I couldn't put a dual carb intake when I took off a single carb intake. It was disappointing as I am a big mechanic head, I love to be able to upgrade rather than replace. I was equally disappointed at the lack of aftermarket body parts. I was hoping for a hood scoop or two, but unfortunately nothing. These aren't game breakers though. I will still enjoy this game daily. Hopefully, they will update the game with either a DLC or a base patch that will allow you to do a motor swap in the auction cars. TL:DR version: Game is fun, fluid and immersive. Way better than 2014 and in my opinion, should be in any gear heads library, or just anyone who wants to play a good car game. Looks great as well!If you enjoyed this review please consider going to www.frostythegamer.com and following the website. We're still setting it up but I'll be posting new reviews soon!			"

												I almost gave thumbs down... but the game is well-made and it's very relaxing to play it.I learned a bit about car parts, but this game could have more information about parts:-what they are for-if they break what are the consequence and symptoms-how can we damage those parts (so we don't do it IRL)The game is nice, but If we learn more about mechanic this game it would be much cooler.

												This is among the few simulator games such as Euro Truck Simulator and farming simulator that actually does a good job. Game runs smoothly, has minimal bugs, well designed and is fun.Pros:+Manage your own car garage+Nice textures and models+Test driving+Garage customization+Minimal bugs and glitches+Runs at 60 fps+Developers are actively working on improving and adding features to gameNeutral:~Needs more cars (coming soon in dlc)~Would like to see more cables and parts under engine hood (bit empty atm)~Different engine types would be interesting (diesel, hybrid, older style engines, vans)Cons:(Remember the developers are actively working on this game)-Career mode could use a few more features (ranking, economy, business decisions)-Some UI improvements can be made (selling and buying multiple parts in tedious)-Main car parts are in cars however fuel lines, brake lines, radiator pipes, electrical cables etc are absent			"

												I own an American muscle car custom garage... so the content in this game is something I'm familiar with.  I'll say that, yes this is a game... and a good one.  But, it is a casual sim and not so much like a Falcon flightsim.  For example, changing the brakes on a car is one thing, but in this game you don't have to spend time bleeding brake lines or... running brake lines or electrical lines.  In real life, gremlins in the electrical systems (wiring harness, fuses, etc) are what takes up so much of my time.  In this game... they're not even there... really (unless you count ignition wiring).  That could be a blessing or a curse because I hate testing 2 miles of insulated copper wire with a multimeter just to figure out why a car has a mysterious parasitic power drain.  In this game... you're either blessed to not have that tedium or let down without having that real sim experience.Overall, it is a fun GAME.  Little to no bugs.  I only wish the market allowed me to reference my parts list from the build order so I didn't have to go run under the car every time I forgot what suspension part I needed.Overall, I rate it an 8/10			"

												I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work. If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.			"

												A view from one who both enjoys driving and also swings spanners for a living.TLDR version - A very basic introduction into light vehicle components that feels like it needed another 3 months before release. CMS 2014 is more realistic in many ways - sideways evolution not revolution.Graphics are decent, sounds are reasonably realistic if simple. Music is passable for the first half hour, then gets turned off. An ingame jukebox with your own mp3 folder linked would be great.Into the reason why we play games - gameplay. The main suspension types (live axle and independant) are well represented along with engine choices. What is lacking is any customisation. Once you've put together 20 or so cars the excitement fails and you feel like you're grinding toward a goal you can't see. You cannot change parts from one car to another to improve horsepower or weight like Redline Racer 2 or similar (incidently a very good car modification game but very buggy).In my case, I was grinding for 9k experience, the point in which you can buy parling spaces to get cars from the auctions.I hit 9k, spent my 50g then went shopping at the auctions. Bought an absolute beater for far more then it was worth and took it home. Stripped, rebuilt every component I could, replaced everything else and then looked for a place to market my rebuilt ride.That's strange, I have no auction option...that's right. You can only sell the cars you buy for a set sum dependant on condition and model, not feed it back to the auction where you bought it. You get paid a minor 'restoration bonus' and actually end up almost even steven from where you started, which considering you've just spent the better part of 30-45mins rebuilding this thing is.....disappointing to say the least.This seems to underutilise the potentially exciting platform of the auction. Why couldn't we walk the lot before the auction, checking out the cars beforehand or even meet other bidders?Also on bidding, it seems a very simple but random process - you're not sure why one model car sells for more then the same model in similar condition because you're literally given no information on each unit. Zero. Can't even pan around to see how many panels are missing.Another lost oppurtunity is the test track - this could have been much larger and give the player a challenge or at least a reason not to on-sell a car but alas no. Mods are enabled so the community will probably come to the rescue but they shouldn't have to. The pan speed is excellent however not being able to do anything while draining oil or lowering/raising a car on the hoist is immensely frustrating, can't even check the job sheet.This game is worth money. How much though? To someone like me who already has a sound knowledge base on car mechanics, maybe $5-10. The content there is well done with no bugs I can see which is a pat on the back. I understand it uses DLC and I've bought a couple already, but misses clear oppurtunities to shine using platforms already existing in the game and offers little direction or encouragement to continue either doing customer jobs or rebuilding auction cars. You will get bored at less then 20 hours.If you want a better understanding of cars, this is a good start at least in names of components and different types of suspension. Some little AVIs on how the different suspensions compare to one another in practise would be great to better educate those who wish to play this game as a learning tool.A good crack at a title, but over far too quickly with little replay value.EDIT   -    After playing the 2014 complete version I must say there appears to be more tangible goals at least on the Tuning and 4WD addons, in addition to 2014 having more realistic graphics and engine components (actually has intake from filter housings to throttle bodies unlike 2015). Unfortunately 2014 has slow component removal speed and slow mouse speed and still has limited content..  The best CMS would be an amalgam of the best attributes of both with casual/hardcore mods with more complex components and tuning/mix match options			"

tl;dr pros & cons list:I recommend you buy this game if you love cars, or want to learn more about cars!Pros:Awesome leap in graphics, game function, and quality from its sequelEasy learning curve, it guides you through what to doA good educational game for learning car partsIt's a learning experience for newbies to cars in general, like myselfA fantastic developer that keeps up with its communityNew content and updates are still coming out since it's a relatively new gameThere's a large variety of vehicles with several different engines and/or arrangements, but variety isn't introduced much until you get more XP which makes senseI'm going to list a lot of cons to balance with the pros, but don't misinterpret it, it's a fantastic game.Cons:Dubstep music on the radio, can easily be turned off howeverThe game holds your hand almost too much once you become proficient and want a challenge, since it doesn't let you mess up assembling the vehicleThere's no tutorial about how to play the game really, but it always shows you the controls and is really easy to figure out for the most partIt isn't a challenge if you're a mechanic, surprise surpriseIt doesn't show you how the parts actually work in the vehicle, if you're looking to learn about thatNow for the non-tl;dr review:It's an incredible leap in quality from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, and I'm pleased to say it's a full fledged sequel! Everything is vastly improved, especially the graphics and game mechanics (pun intended). They've also added the ability to buy auctioned vehicles, allowing you to fix them and sell them for profit, among some other big new things. The developers are actively updating the game and listen to the requests of its fanbase which is always a great thing to see. I love a dedicated developer that keeps up to speed with its community. Also, there's a growing multitude of cars available to work on, engines have variation most of the time, and while the game has no tutorial, the learning curve is easy to get over once you figure the parts of a car out. It gives you a very easy start, then slowly gets more and more intricate as you become more proficient in your tasks. It actually gets pretty challenging sometimes.A lot of people wonder about how realistic it is, so I will go over that in the next paragraph:I'm no mechanic, so I have no real-life depiction of how realistic the game actually is, but I got an opinion from a friend of mine who really is a mechanic.The original Car Mechanic Simulator is what initially sparked my interest in how cars work, and now this sequel helps me expand on that. Hell, it got me so intrigued I went out to my car to see if I could take the air filter out! I even watched some YouTube videos on mechanics principles. I really didn't care for cars prior. In fact I knew nothing of cars. Thank this game for inspiring my love in vehicles! After talking to a mechanic friend, he does say the game lacks realistic difficulty because in reality, knowing which tools to use and finding out what is broken is only half the battle, and it holds your hand through putting things back together, as well as taking things apart in the right order. In real life, it's far more possible to forget to put something in the car, or to lose a bolt inside the engine which apparently sounds painful to a mechanic. He said you can't simply pull out some parts like the game does, too, such as a gearbox. Also, the engines it has you work on aren't as wildly varying as real life cars. My car engine has many of the parts the game has, and thanks to the game I could identify a few of the things which felt very satisfying since I had literally no knowledge of it prior. Everything was arranged differently than in the game, though. It's possibly true that the game isn't quite spot-on realistic, however there's nothing I know of that's better at teaching you the parts of a car and how cars work. With the incredible leap in game quality in just one year, I wouldn't be surprised if it'll be marginally closer to real life in the next sequel. I'm not IGN and I give this a 10/10, so that should say something! It was well worth the 16 dollars I spent, as you can't put a price on education and inspiration. "

												So I loved 2014 - Thought it was great but a bit limited.2015 brings a lot more to the game and it's great!... However...The Title credits say its from Poland - I've never been there but working on cars for 30+ years, rebuilding, repairing and modifying, this game is a first for me - I've never had to remove the ENTIRE SUPSENSION to change a block. If that's the way a mechanic in Poland has to do it, they'd never make a profitable business down under. Just saying.Other than that I love it. Well.. The music is a bit not my scene - Radio needs a Metal station.			"

												The whole process of repairing a car consists of apparently flying around a transparent car, clicking on rusty parts to make them disappear, and then clicking on their location again to make the shiny replacements appear. After reading its many positive reviews, I expected so much more from this game, especially in terms of realism and educational value.I expected part descriptions, detailing what they do and how they work, not just what they're called.Maybe it's my own fault for once again letting ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" convince me to buy a game I had some interest in, without researching the game's contents more thoroughly before placing my order, but here's what I imagined (apart from what was already mentioned): - Seeing the required tools in action, and maybe being able to upgrade those tools.- Part damage models. Apparently, rust is the only danger to any part, even rubber ones.- A garage management aspect, complete with running costs and equipment purchase/maintenance.- Timers on accepting contracts.- (Generous) Timers on completing accepted contracts.- Cars actually moving and not teleporting between positions.- Fewer loading screens. Way fewer.- Customer satisfaction, raised by completing repairs on time and without performing and billing unnecessary work, leading to repeat business and word of mouth advertising.- Some purpose to money (examples above)These are just off the top of my head. I was also disappointed by the poorly designed interface (e.g. not being able to close a menu with the same key that opens it) and overall extremely slow progression with no other goal than to click on the same parts on different cars and save more money, for... cars in the parking lot?I'm glad a lot of people enjoy this game, but it's not for me and probably not for people with similar preferences, which is why I wrote this review.

												If you like cars and working on them, this game is crazy addictive. Very well done. However, some quality of life improvements need implemented.-Load times are atrocious. On a modern machine, simply ridiculous in length. This needs adressed.-The newest DLC is excellent, however, the 1/4 mile needs an option to toggle between manual or automatic, or even a launch control(I realize the older cars don't have this). If you are simply keyboarding, launching a 600+HP vehicle is a terrible chore of finesse. 1/4 mile times will even drop(versus stock, slightly tuned, max tune) until you can find that sweet spot of gear manipulation just to end tire spin. Even then, times are foolishly off what they should be.-No option to toggle KPH to MPH. Small complaint, but important.-When tearing a car down, a lot of the screen is wasted space. They need to implement a menu of items and % you already have in your inventory for each part removed. Maybe something as simple as a top 3 % listing to cut down on menu swapping time. This would fit nicely into some of the empty voids on screen. Whether it shows on part removal or part replacement mode. It would improve gameplay ten folds...-Repairing items at a 90% cap is nice, but when an item is above a certain percentage, say 90-99%, breaking it shouldn't be so simple. Sometimes randomness can cause 100% of these items to break for a LONG stretch. Not a huge deal, but could be improved. Again not huge, but can be very annoying.-New DLC issue, Superchargers/intake can block distributor cap clip on the back side. Real pain even zoomed in to remove or replace.-Load times.-More variety would make it more consuming. Parking lot for customers cars waiting to be fixed(similar to a real shop). More bays. Perhaps even a staff at a certain XP level to allow more projects with less hands on; your staff does basic jobs for you(such as simple exhaust repairs/brakes/etc..) More money sinks. Custom build jobs(This may or may not be in newest DLC,if so disregard), not just repairs. Not everything needing worked on is broke. A lot of customers want a built/modified/improved car out of a perfect performing car.Overall this is an amazing game despite my minor annoyances. Amazingly fun if cars are your thing.  Would recommend to any wrench turner who plays games.			"

												Who doesn't like cars? From a beautiful Ford Mustang, to a luxury Bentley or even an eco-friendly model. Everyone likes cars, unless they don't. And being part of that gang, I thought it would be a good idea to try out this new game, and share my experience with the world.It's a never ending battle of making your cars better and also trying to be better yourself.Dale EarnhardtWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Car Mechanic Simulator 2015.GameplayFirst of all, let me tell you something. This game will screw you with the amount of screws you'll have to unscrew and rescrew during your mechanic career.As a garage owner, your objective is, as in any other game, to make money, which will be used to upgrade that same garage, as well as to buy parts for other cars, and even to buy cars.After accepting the first job, there's a list that tells the player what's wrong with said car, and, obviously, it's up to the player to open up that car and find those parts, and replace or repair them. If you choose to replace, you can just order the piece you need online, however, if you choose to repair the piece, you'll save money, or you’ll end up breaking it.As the game goes on, and the player gains experience, which can be used to get some scanners and faster tools, those lists indicating the problem will cease to exist, and it will be up to the player to use everything available to find the problem and fix it. Plan B, which let me tell you, always works, is simply to dismantle the entire car and check every single piece, but that does take quite a while, as you can imagine.I didn't know the difference between a spark plug and a crankshaft, but now I do! So fear not if you don't know anything about the mechanical side of cars, or even anything related to cars, because you'll learn it all.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 will bring out the mechanic in you that you never knew existed. Trust me, I'm (now) a mechanic.Pros Incredible details; Plenty of pieces, from rubber bushings to spark plugs, CMS2015 has it all; The difficulty ladder is really well designed, and the player won't feel a difference when the harder repairs come by, if anything, it will feel easier with all the practice; Some interesting tools available to help discover what needs to be fixed, from testing paths, to electronic meters, there's a nice variety to use and abuse; Intuitive job objectives that help the player to find out where the problem is, without having to dismantle the entire car (even though that's the fun part!); Nice variety of cars, with more being added in the future; No game has as many screws as CMS2015; The auction house allows the player to buy a (almost) ruined car and resell it, after it has been worked a bit, for profit.I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the ""Cons"" listed below improved in future patches/updates, but I do feel the need to point them out as they're somewhat disappointing.Cons Long loading screens, even if you're only going to visit the auction or the parking lot; The ""damaged"" details are feel very poor, since there's no broken or bent, just rust (the more rust, the more damaged the piece is!); The shadows are a bit off, especially around the lifter (I'd also like to point out the lifter doesn't appear to actually be holding the car, it's just sort of floating there).VerdictI'd give it a 8.5/10, which could easily be a 10 if the graphic quality and effects were a bit better. Nonetheless, it's a fantastic game and undoubtedly a must for any fan of the genre. Do note that the team is still active, and I'm sure the quality of the game will increase even further.Note: Despite looking quite similar to real cars, the vehicles available in game aren't actually the real ones, and it would be sweet to actually be able to work on a Ford Mustang and such, but I do understand it being extremely difficult to apply due to licensing issues.

												Decent for what it is, but marred by poor interface choices and odd limitations.  If you're a huge fan of this type of simulation, ignore everything after this and buy it anyway.  Interface awkwardness seems to be common in this sort of game.  I don't know if it's lack of playtesting or what.  ""I"" opens your inventory, but doesn't close it; that's the Escape key.  All the menus are like that.  After you buy cars at the auction, they are sent to your garage's parking lot.  Naturally, you can't go directly there from the auction.  You have to go to the main workshop (loading screen), then to the garage (loading screen), send the car to the workshop, then go back to the workshop (you guessed it! more loading screen).  I still can't think of a reason not to let me just summon the car to the lift like I'm a wizard since that's effectively what's happening anyway.  Even if it takes a single loading screen, one is better than three.The decision on what parts are seems pretty arbitrary.  Things that are just one part: Rear differential, starter motor, the entire transmission.  On the other hand the distributor cap has: ignition wires, clips to hold the cap on, the cap, the rotor, and the housing.  I'd love it if I could work on the bigger complicated parts at the workbench, or use an engine lift to pull the blessed thing out whole instead of raising and lowering the car over and over.I think the biggest disappointment for me is that it only feels like half a game.  You fix cars, but there really isn't any point to it.  Sure you get XP and money to fix *different* things on *different* cars.  It's all without any goal to it.  This game would be much improved if it were mated to a racing game.  Then I'm making money to fix up my car, buying auctioned cars for parts to my car, and using the garage to improve my car.  But nope. I'm just pulling bad parts off of a car, hitting them with a hammer until they are fixed or ruined, buying replacements for the ruined ones, and putting it all back together.  Or rather I was since I no longer play the game.			"

												First and foremost: I LOVE THIS GAME. I also loved Gearhead Garage back in the 90's, and I have a background in auto repair, so I maaaaay be biased.Having played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, I realized that this team was putting together something very special - something that rekindled a love I haven't experienced since my Gearhead Garage CD stopped working. CMS2014 (last year's game) reminds me of the CD-level release of Gearhead Garage - no auctions, limited cars, and somewhat... unfinished, I suppose. CM2015 (this year's game) is the entry that I think the developers wanted to make. It feels alive, very much so, and it feels like it has this wealth of potential just waiting to be tapped. I am honestly excited for this game in a way I'm not often excited about games.The ProsDevs are highly active in the community. Seriously, check the Steam Forums for this game, and they're engaged with players. They are actually keeping a community-created list of wanted features (and are honest about what they can't/won't include, too). VERY cool to see this from a dev team!Gorgeous graphics. The details in the textures are really nice, and the individual parts shine here. It may not break any monitors or redefine any genres, but it definitely is something my graphics card makes veeeery pretty.Customizable ""home base"" (garage). Maybe it's just a ""me thing"", but I like making it my own place.VERY detailed (and, from a parts sales guy's perspective, accurate) parts - assembly and ""fit"".Smooth Gameplay. There's definitely a rhythm you can get into, and it makes this game easy to lose hours in.The ConsSoundtrack. While I do enjoy the genre, I turned the in-game music volume down to 20 (instead of 50). This made it much easier to bear, even enjoyable. Customizable music has been suggested to the devs, and is definitely something they should pick up.Learning curve. It's a bit steep to get into the game, though if you have some background in cars it's easier. A piece of advice? Switch between the view types, particularly View 3, which shows you the condition of parts. You can take a test drive to find the condition of suspension parts.Clarity of Gameplay Direction. It's honestly more exploratory than explained to you. Poke things. Explore your environment. Open doors, play with objects... Honestly, a lot of learning is done by experience here, which either lends to the idea of a garage mechanic or breaks the game for you entirely, depending on how you look at it (I don't mind it, but I have a background in this area, so...)Honestly, it's a standard initial release as of April 24 (2-3 days after release), so the content isn't massive. There's 17 cars now, one more definitely happening, and a menu entry for ""community content"" that isn't active just yet. If this opens itself to modding... this game could easily end up being 800+ hours on my account. I absolutely love it!			"

												This game has ruined simulator games for me, forever. Not in a bad way, mind you. This game is the absolute epitome of what a simulator game could be. It is dynamic, engaging, has a super-supportive dev community, and has a list of stuff they are patching in that lists nearly 100 user submitted ideas.  It's a puzzle game that is varied, and not super-difficult, yet it's not easy either. It's dead easy to get into, but engaging enough to let you spend hours and hours on. The DLC is more like nifty add-ons, and not core pieces of gameplay, and you could enjoy the whole game perfectly well, even if you didn't buy them. I really can't give this game anything else but a solid, and well-deserved, 10/10. As far as simulator games go, devs of other games better sit up straight, and start taking notes. This could potentially be the game that blows the whole market open, and bring in a new world of simulation sub-genres to whole new audiences. And on top of all this, it is hugely informative. I have learned the internal workings of a car, through component parts of small engines, from 4-cylinder junkers, all the way to supercharged V8 Overhead Valve muscle cars.Get this game. It's a steal, at $20. It's totally worth every single cent. This is the game, for which, I will forever compare other simulator games to. And yes, all of the others pale in comparison.			"

												I'm going to college to become a technician at a Subaru dealer in Colorado. I'm starting school with a very minimal range of knowledge when it comes to repairing cars. Don't get me wrong, cars have been apart of more than 50% of my daily life. My life revolves around cars, but if I wanted to be a Subaru tech, I needed the knowledge. Now I don't have the money to purchase broken cars, and fix them, but I've had to do a few things on my Subaru that really upped my knowledge (Timing belt + Water pump, Serpetine belts, Oil changes, etc...).I began searching for ways to further my knowledge; I found this game on the automechanics subreddit and it has actually been very helpful. The game itself isn't realistic in the sense that it could be a training tool for a mechanic (The bolts are incredibly unrealistic. 3/4 of the cars you work on are rusted to hell, rusted bolts should not come out that fast without penetrating sprays); but it's a fantastic tool for figuring out where certain parts of the car are. Don't know how to access, or find the pistons? Now you do. Do you not know how to diagnose certain problems with the car, without a scan tool? Now you do.I'm gonna make a pros/cons list of this game.Pros:- Very great tool for gaining knowledge of part locations- Gives you a general idea on how the car works- Graphics are amazing- Game is actually pretty fun, even if you don't want to be a mechanic- Wide selection of partsCons:- Not realistic in terms of truly repairing a car- Not a lot of variety in cars. I'd love to see semi trucks, busses, wider selection in Wagons, Sedans, SUVs, etc... "

												It’s a decent game, but it’s not a real sim and its very repetitive.Why it’s not a sim (at least to me).  When I think of a simulator, i think everything should be how it actually is irl (or relatively close to it).  This game is just that, a game. Parts of the mechanic part they got right, but read on for what they didn’t...There are other reviews saying its repetitive, but I though hey, it’s a game about fixing cars... you are going to repair the same issues many times.  But it goes far beyond that. Every modern v8 - exactly the same engine.  So if you are working on the challenger knockoff or the bmw knockoff, they are identical motors.*edit* even though modern v8's in all vechicles are identical, you can't supercharge (swap) them when they are in a truck.My other gripes;Parts are invented, the 'press in' splined hub 'bearing' that is in every car... it’s actually part of the hub (the part you bolt your wheels to) and cannot be removed.Part names are made up.  in game; rear suspension arm 'x'y'z', = irl; trailing arm, rear upper/lower control arm.I really bought the game because when I played the demo there was a 'mods' section on the title screen, making me think, hey user mods for this game should be awesome!... yea... there's 1 mod... and it’s a track...Auction- no cars go unbid on.  There is always ai to bid you up on everything, and not just a few times.  The ai bids you up 20-30k in some cases.  Example; wanting to buy a GTR (not the Nissan version, some made up GTR) go to a few auctions to see what the sell for when im not bidding.  30k-42k. seems like a decent price.  go to a fresh auction and start trying to buy one.  Lowest I have gotten one is 53k highest was 62k, where is my 30k GTR?Rex, when I’m not bidding 32k.  When I’m bidding 50-60k.Overall, then game has a lot of potential but it’s not at all what I had hoped for.I would still recommend the game if you know nothing about cars, as this will teach you a lot (just don’t pay attention to the names of the suspension parts).

												While fun at first, the game gets very repetitive and, frankly, boring after some time. I believe this game will only be fun to someone who doesn't know much about cars and their maintenance.First, I played on normal difficulty - dropped it quickly, too easy.Then expert difficulty - still too easy. Incidentally, removing parts of the user interface is just annoying, and not difficult (e.g. money and xp).The devs would need to do something about it to make the game more challenging. Call it master difficulty:  Re-assembly is way too easy with assisted ordering and highlighting. I mean, if you forgot to put something in - it should stay forgotten. And if you're finishing an order, game shouldn't kindly tell you that you've forgotten some crucial part somewhere. A true mechanic should face the consequences! Be it money or warranty work.  Damage/wear model is too simple, just rust or certain belt marks. And there should some kind of 'fog of war' for rust, otherwise it's too easy to spot rusty parts.  Want to get really technical? Lay out OBD in full: fault codes, oxygen sensor data, fuel trims, air data! And graphs too!  Out of all different engine liquids, there's only oil now. Well, should be more, with level checks, certain type of damange (leaking), etc.  Greases? A good portion of car mechanics is about greases. Of course, this one is hard to implement in a game reasonably.  Car problems are a bit random. IRL physical problems are often localized: i.e. you struck a wheel on something - a wheel and local suspension parts would be affected. And IRL engine problems are often conceptually connected: for example, a low level of engine coolant would lead to overheating, worsening oil state and inducing piston wear, etc.  Payment should reflect the work required. My impression is that in CMS 2015 your bonus (i.e. profit) depends on the part costs, and not on work required to get to those parts.Also, I've seen CMS 2014 having repair order comments like ""I lent the car to my wife, and now my suspension is ruined!"" That was a nice touch, pity there's nothing like this in CMS 2015.			"

												I played this game for a night, a while ago. As a mechanic in real life, I enjoyed the game and figured I'd check back in on it eventualy. Such a great base for a game but a couple small things would really bring it forward and keep the game play fresh. I guess I need more on the management side of it.Fun way to learn some things about cars, although perhaps the game would be harder for people who don't already understand vehicles.I'd change my vote if they had addressed some of the player's complaints to simplify and complicate various parts of the game.As you level up, it would be nice if you have someone who brought the car to a lift and took the wheels off. Or you could provide orders to someone to keep a job moving or put a job back together after you finished the difficult part of it. Or have a rookie who can do the oil change for you. An experience mechanic RARELY finds himself performing basic services.Parts ordering: 2 years and not a single improvement has been made. With experience, I should be able to get parts on the way or make a check list as to what I need and then go to the computer to have it ordered. I thought the tablet would do this and it doesn't.Typically a mechanic has a list he hands off to someone, and they get the stuff on the way. Would love to see this.I'd also enjoy the challenges of delayed payments, as in the vehicle does just magically fly off the lift and cash goes into the account. You could have your assistant call to inform the customer the car is done, bring it to the parking lot and let you know your ETA on their pick up.Perhaps I just want a little bit more logistics challenge and less repetitive motions on♥♥♥♥♥♥like wheel removal and waiting on long vehicle load times every time I take a customer. Again the game is an awesome concept but could be tweeked for slightly less pointless repetition.			"

												This is one of the greatest kickstarter games I've ever seen. I played CMS 2014 to remind myself great times when I was ""wasting"" my life in Gearhead Garage but unfortunately it was only like demo version of it. CMS 2015 is completely different - whatever was good in 2014 is still here but many features were developed further. There is more cars, more parts - more of everything. And finally we can go to auction and pimp wrecks to collect them or for sale. Graphics are brilliant for such low budget product. You can do OBD scanner tests, test drive or measure electrical performance of various components. It's a perfect sim for all moto-fans. Recommended and Kudos to polish developer.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has become one of my favorite games to play, I just can't quit playing it. The main thing that makes this game fantastic is that it is extremely educational. I began mechanically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and actually learned a whole lot about the functions of a vehicle.Pros: - Beautiful graphics.- Good car selection. (clearly knockoffs, but you can take a good stab at what they represent)- Plenty of parts to disassemble and reassemble.- Doesn't just hold your hand and tell you every move to make. (Some may not consider that a pro)- Is definitely realistic, and now I can trust myself to change sparkplugs. :pCons:- I learned from this game that the key way to identify a messed up car part is to find the absolutely rusted-over part, and remove it. I believe that if the creator(s) were to create cracked, dented, crushed, and other affects to try to identify, that it would be a little less cheesy, and a lot more challenging.- No trucks. I will live until this issue is fixed though. :)- No transmission repair. I feel as if the game has very in-depth repair abilities, such as being able to gut out an engine and lift the whole thing out, but as far as gearbox operations, you don't get to jack with the transmission at all, you only have to replace or repair the gearbox as a whole without messing with the transmission or the overall mechanism inside of the gearbox itself. (I STRONGLY DESIRE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS)9/10 Absolutely recommended, would be 10/10 if it weren't for a few minor things like what I mentioned above.			"

												I highly recommend this game, particularly for the educational element.  I got this game in a Humble Bundle, and after recent adventures with doing a bit of DIY with replacing my IRL car's fuel pump, I wanted to try out this sim game.  I'm now 31 hours in across 4 days.  This game is very, very addicting (at first), but extremely grindy.  Each part installed counts as 1 experience, and it's not until 9000 experience do you get to start building/selling customs.But there's a specific reason why, this game is very newbie friendly, and as you gain the in-game experience, you become more and more familiar with parts, ""feel"", damage appearance, what tests to use to identify what, what part is likely damaged when a customer reports an issue with X, and what is most ""cost efficient"" when repairing a car.You have very few diagnostic tools in the beginning (these have to be leveled up for, 1000 exp gets you 1 upgrade point, or one tool), so you are forced to do the diagnostics with visual identification and on a test track.This game is not for advanced mechanics, or people looking to build/race customs.  It is very much for people who don't really know much about cars to learn (at a basic level) how a car is put together.Prior to this game, I had a very rudimentary knowledge of how a car works, the most advanced thing I've done IRL is install a new fuel sending unit in an old Sentra.  From playing this game, I've learned names of a lot of different parts (you do the same repairs enough that you end up remembering them), and learned how to identify when a car is suffering from issues at different parts across the board.Once you reach around 5000 exp though you may get bored, I stuck it out and went to 9K to see what building a custom was like, and while it's fun, you can't do too much with them except compare performance with other players in the Steam forums, or sell them back to the shop for extra money.I will likely buy the DLC when it goes on sale, but for now it's a bit too much $ for what is offered.Also, get the car name mod from one of the guides, it converts the in-game names to their IRL counterparts.

												I received a job to discover the cause of knocking in the engine compartment of a truck comparable in size to a Ford F-250, sporting the conjoined twin of engines known as a V8. I spent 45 minutes removing piece by piece of the engine block until I had reduced the thing to just a chassis and its suspension, and still I couldn't figure out what part was causing the issue. I started taking the entire truck apart, and about an hour in, I discovered that the air filter compartment's lid was busted.I made $20.Surely, this is the most realistic car mechanic simulator in the world.

												I won't claim to know everything about cars, I would struggle to fix a car if someone gave me a step by step 'Fixing a car for dummies' book. That said, this is a good start for anyone remotely interested in fixing/repairing/replacing parts. While there are some things I could criticize, like the 'instructions not clear enough - private parts stuck in engine block' tutorial, it's quite easy to get into and play with little hand-holding. The part repair system could use a little work imho, the paint shop seems a bit redundant at times, the auction camera needs a bit of fixing, and some other small things.Overall for a game of this style, having that balance between a gearhead's game and a general indie style game is hard to get right. This game gets it right. It has enough depth and detail to actually make me stop and think about what I'm doing and what steps I should take to complete the repair, but not too much that I have to call my mechanic friends/family and ask them what I need to do.The game is easy to get into and very fun to play, again balancing gameplay and detail/realism. The number of times I've had to replace a crankshaft after I've already taken apart the clutch housing and reassembled it......There are a few things that needed work, but mostly just quality of life improvements that could be changed/added in a patch. No major problems to speak of.I wish some of the 2014 features were there, like the sense of progression from a garage to a multi-car shop, or the 'replace the missing parts from my new used car purchase'.Yes you will replace brakes a thousand times, yes you will change thousands of filters, yes you will find the same problems coming up time after time. This is the life of a mechanic. Cars need brakes, cars need new filters, mechanical things break, and often times it's the same things that break. I would recommend that you see the 'monotony' as a more realistic representation of how it is to fix cars in a shop. Your car will need new oil, it will need a new timing belt at least once in its life, it's just a fact to live with.The thing I personally like, having recently gotten to that point, is once you can purchase a parking garage and go to the auto auction to purchase broken down piles of scrap, and turn them into like-new beauties to sell. The trailer/intro video shows this, starting with a car that may be missing half of the body, trying to repair as many parts as possible to save money, and buying what you can't fix. By the end you can decide whether to just replace the really bad parts, or completely renovate the body, engine, and suspension to brand new quality. It adds a sense of accomplishment to the end game (which some may say is desperately needed after changing 1000 brake pads), and keeps you playing.TL;DR: It can be boring, but it's worth it to anyone even remotely interested in cars. Just buy it. (Though if still in doubt - wait for a sale, $20 USD may be a bit steep for some)			"

												This game is a wonderful mix of an intro to car components and a D&D dystopia.Instead of making different parts show that they are worn and broken using a variety of techniques, the game uses only one. RUST.So imagine we are handed a relatively new car that has some suspension problems. We pop the car on a lift, take a look at the undercarriage, and we find pristine parts, right next to others that look like they've been randomly touched by a rust monster. This makes the game into quite the amusing ""find the rust"" quest.Added hilarity comes from antique muscle cars. I've opened the hood just to find an engine that must have been submerged in the ocean for 100 years. You want me to fix your engine? The engine block is made out of rust! There are a whole 5 push rods and two spark plugs that are in sensible shape! But the customer is the customer, and we get to disassemble the entire engine, but 40+ new parts, and somehow put them together, with new pristine parts next to others that somehow, despite being quite rusty, do not need a change. Yes sir, I'll only change 5 pistons, even though the other 3 are at 30%. I am sure you want to pay for another mechanic to rebuild your engine again in a year when those old parts fail, right?The game's biggest issues today are the fact that the game refuses to list the defective parts when I am in front of the computer, ordering replacements, so I either have to use paper, or just make multiple trips to the in-game parts store (Just imagine how long that would take IRL if a mechanic did something like that). The second issue is that the game wants you to replace the broken parts with newer ones that meet specs, but it has to be in the exact same position. So, say that we have an 8 cylinder engine, with its 16 pull rods. 5 of them are broken and need replacement. the rest do not, but they are so used they are not good as replacements. We also have to change the crankshaft, which involves removing the engine heads where the pull rods fit. So after we disassemble everything, and put on the new crankshaft, and put the engine heads back, then comes the game of trying to figure out which location to put the new pull rods, as we've already taken all of them out. So I end up pushing O a lot, and seeing if, after placing a new part, the game actually thinks it counts as a repair. if it doesn't, I have to take the part out again, and then put an old one, Repeat until you find all the new replacements, or just give up, and purchase all the parts new.Overall, it's a fun game, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Highly recommended.			"

												Probably the best sim game there is in fixing cars. I work as a mechanic in real lif and this game is a good way to learn the parts, how they work and kind of shows you how to fix them. My friends have played this and said they feel they've learnt more about cars. Plus being able restore cars and turn a profit and also having the ability if you buy the DLC to tune the cars and do drag runs. Probably one of the best car mechanic sims i've played and i recommend buying this game.			"

												Playway has really done a great job with this one. I enjoyed CMS2014 but they managed to build on that and improve it in almost every way. And all with Kickstarter and a low pledge goal. As the name implies you run an auto shop repair business. But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities. There is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts.Test driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts.All in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan.

												I've played this game a little bit, and don't get me wrong, the premise of the game is great. It's a barebones, basic simulator of what it can be like to work on cars. As a schooling technician, this game is a fun time waster and it has just enough vagueness to keep it from feeling like actual work.However, this game is a DLC generator. There has not been any actual progress on the game in a very, very long time. They will add one or two cars with very little variation between the previous vehicles in the game. A new engine model but that's kind of useless when it's all visuals. In the early days, they talked about adding all sorts of features, only to later tell they were limited by the game engine in what they can do. It really bums me out because this game had SO much potential to be ""more than your average simulator"", it had potential to be something great enough to be raved about, but I do not see the effort being put forward to improve the game anymore. It's just a DLC of a couple cars every few months. Because of that, I find myself playing other games more often than this one these days.This game is a good game to play and zone out while doing so (if you really understand the cars) or an interesting abstract puzzle game, however I can only recommend it to someone so long as they know that actual improvements or content is pretty much gone with the wind at this point.

												I love this game. Period.I don't know much about cars, and even though I always enjoyed car tycoon games, I never really got into any ""mechanic simulator"". Until now. This is pretty much a 3D puzzle connected with company (car garage in this case) management.You get to repair the cars, earn money, and then improve the garage. On top of this you can purchase old, ruined cars on atucion, and bring them back to life to either sell them, or... have your own collection. And yes - you can test drive the cars (which is sometimes necessary in order to know what's wrong with a car).I really enjoy this game, and can absolutely recommend it.			"

												I recieved CMS 2015 in a Humble Bundle, frankly I was pondering not even activating it on my account since I have zero interest in cars in real life. However, I figured ""hey why not?"".I was pleased to find a very addictive experience that I hadn't expected. Though the flaws began to show themselves soon enough. After enough ours patching up the same cars over and over again I wondered why there wasn't more to the game. That's when I discovered the DLC page. Basically all the fun mechanics in the game are tucked away as DLC addons, such as being able to buy your own cars, clean them up and then either store them or sell them for a huge profit. Even the (in my view) BASIC feature of being able to swap out engines was unavailable unless you purchased a DLC pack.Not sure why all of these Simulators feel like they have to cut out vital components in their games or not add them at all until a later date so they can release them as DLC is a must. Frankly it's kinda annoying getting a game only to find that you have to buy 5+ packs of additional content to get the full experience.Even so the options in CMS 2015 are limited, I bought nearly all of their DLC because I found the game far more engaging that I thought it would be. However, I must be honest and say that I've got quite a bit of buyers remorse after that.At first I would've given CMS 2015 an 8/10 but after noticing the chopped-up nature of the game, the lack of features to keep you engaged... I'd say this game isn't worth more than a 5/10 at most.			"

Slightly generic in the sense that ""all V8s are created basically equal"", but still lots of fun.The one downside is the HORRIFICALLY UNFORGIVABLE loading times.

												This game is basicly a open free play at game start. Your abilty in the game is outstanding, you gain experince points, having thoses points makes it possable to get things, you can take jobs or reject jobs, you can not only do auto repair, but go to the auction and get cars to restore. The game is not a auto training simulator, there are no software training simulators for auto mechanics, you would need to see a tech school for that because it is hands on training. How ever the diganostics on the car for a failing part is on the mark for the most part of what got broken and needs to be replaced. If you never worked on a car ever, here you will get to see what the parts names are and were they go, so yeah it could be said you will learn the very basic bases of auto mechanics.If your a mechnic who likes to play around with car repair games, a person who is into cars, anyone who is adicted to cars, I would recomend this game. Check out the guides section in the fourm and look for ""Auto Repair Manual Class for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015"" Why this guide? Because at the very end of the guide at the bottom it has Tutorial Videos of the in's and out's of what is expected in the game and maybe of intresst to you to see what is going on in the game! They are sectioned off with titles on each video making it possable for you to choose what you want to see. Some vids may have more than one part, there was alot to cover.. Hope this helps..			"

Somewhere along the history of video games, a beautiful little too-weird-to-live yet too-rare-to-die niche genre was born. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is smack-dab in the middle of this genre, and can be described as a zen-like puzzler that is an incredibly slow burner. This game will require many hours from you, and will satisfy and reward you the whole way.Essentially, you manage a mechanics garage. The whole thing. You answer calls, take jobs, and fix cars (among other things). You can repair parts, or order new. You can let jobs pile up, or solve one at a time. Each job is very much a puzzle. The better you are, the quicker you advance. The more you advance, the better swag/tools/speed/etc. you get. It has RPG elements like that. The music is great, too.Pros:+Utterly addicting, in all the right ways.+Beautiful graphics, and great music to fit.+Metric tons of gameplay in here. +If you are familiar with automotive anatomy, it will help some, but don't let that scare away people that are unfamiliar: its easy to learn.+Controls are smooth and intuitive after the first 20 minutes or so.Cons:-This is the kind of game (I think) that is best chipped away at an hour a day or so (probably like EuroTruck Simulator). Its a slow burner. You need to invest alot of time to really get somewhere. Not necessarily a 'con', but you should be aware. It isn't instant gratification.I got it on sale, but I think its worth full price for most people (if you are looking into it, its probably for you). Its amazing and beautiful how video games can be brilliantly built out of mundane and simple ideas.Peace,			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Every one of us knows about cars to a certain degree. Well, we know which brands of car we like, what shape we like, what features they have and mostly we love to drive them (must be a minimum of 16 years old to do so). That is probably the extent most of us really know about automobiles. Well, Thanks to Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, you will expand your knowledge of one of the biggest inventions of the nineteen century!Car Mechanic simulator 2015 is a car simulation/ racing / puzzle game. In this game, you are going to take control of a very busy garage. Your phone is going to ring constantly and you will receive a lot jobs to repair cars (mechanics and body work); engine, brakes, suspensions, gearbox, axles or the body of the car. After you accept the job (you will have a full description of the job), you will have to get your hands dirty and reach the part to be replaced. You can’t really miss it, it will be rusty (red). One of the interesting aspects of the job description is that you have to make sure that all parts you replace are of a certain condition (eg above 70%). Well, if you buy the part it would fine but sometimes you might decide to use the repair table to save some money. Let’s say you decide to replace the faulty part with a brand new one and decide to order the part using your desktop. You will have five suppliers and one bank. Each supplier will be a specialist and the bank will be here if you need a loan. At the end of each job, you will earn money (thank god for that, you see the price of some parts. . . pretty steep) and experience points. As you gain experience, you will be able to accept bigger jobs and each time you reach 1,000 XP you will be given an upgrade point which you can use to get better tools or customize your garage. Xp will also give you access to upgrade you garage with very important features; such as a paint shop. If you feel the urge to take a break from the chaotic work, why don’t you take a car for a spin or go to the auction (you must upgrade your garage with a carpark before you can go to the auction). The layout of the garage is well designed and you can see everything a garage has to offer – car lifter, tools, garage doors - but no calendar (you know those calendars that have picture of a woman without much on sitting on a car bonnet looking rather suggestive).The graphics are really good and the controls are a combination of keyboard / mouse and are easy to use and understand. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning, too.This game is really impressive to be honest with you. Whether you are a petrol head or not, it is really enjoyable to play. It might be a bit repetitive, but it’s fun! Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Good graphics-	Garage is very well laid out and can be customized-	Easy to follow jobs in hand-	Plenty of content and DLC-	Great soundtrackNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	No achievement or trading cards-	A bit repetitiveCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a well thought-out game.8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon.			"

I have thouroghly enjoyed several new aspects of the game. The fact that the camera is easier to control and doesn't snap or go to awkward angles like it did in CMS 14 is a huge plus for me. I also love that you can take a motor alll the way down to the block and rebuild it. Heck you can strip the whole car down and rebuid, I'm loving how in depth they have gone with this new release. I only see the game getting better as they update and release DLC. If you love getting your hands dirty, at least virtually. This game is for you.			"

												""CMS 2015"" is like ""CMS 2014"", only it's shinier and has more stuff to do.  I'm admittedly not very good with cars but yet still enjoyed my time with it.  ""CMS 2014"" featured static levels whereas this one seems to throw random jobs at you, which you can either take or reject on a whim (which is great).  I would have liked some sort of difficulty gauge on how hard jobs are before you accept them, that is...something to tell you that you have to take 15 parts off the car as opposed to 2 before getting to the part you need to replace.  Some may be able to say, ""oh, that's just a catalytic capacitor radiator thingy...an easy fix""...I can't do that.  A color palette box in the showroom would have been nice too (instead you have to toggle through colors), but this is minor.  There's lots of play time to be had here, especially if you don't know what you're doing.  An easy recommend!

It can get repetitive after about 16h (I played more than 30 already and still have lots of fun), but it is actively developed and almost every week (and sometimes even more often) there is something new to see in the game and also after you explore all the content available at the moment game is still relaxing and fun so I find myself running it just to play for about half an hour, fix a car of two, and relax a little. I highly recommend this game. It is very well done technologically, constantly improved in terms of gameplay and replayability and has very good support and contact with the developer. Almost every thread on steam forums has a developer answer, and some of the suggestions were implemented in the game in literally few days from being first posted.

Load times are sometimes long especially when the garage is full of cars but understandable since there are probably many parts the game is keeping track of.

												Good game. It does what it was designed to do very well, if you like cars, and sims. I found it pretty relaxing taking cars apart and putting them back together. That said, here's a summary of what I think are the strong and weak points of this game:Pros:Unique idea (to me anyway), running your own garageNicely rendered cars and mechanically logical design/engineeringFun upgrades to your workshop can be added (e.g. custom colors from your spray booth)Cons:Greater role-playing elements would make this good game greatDon't really see the purpose of the ""test track""Limited toolbox upgrades -- I have so many upgrade points and can't do anything with themMinor grouse -- slow loading times, especially to auction, parking, garage, etc. surely this can be improved?Music was driving me batty after a while, but you can shut it offGets repetitive after a while, especially without new cars, challenges, etc., which meansLimited replay value, unless you find taking cars apart relaxing, like meI know there are more cons than pros, but the weight of the pros is higher than the cons. I had fun. Worth getting -- even more so if on sale.7.5/10 "

												I'm on the fence about this one. I think Car Mechanic Simulator is a tremendous first step, however it ultimately fell short of what I was hoping for.The game boils down to an interactive set of 3d car models. These models allow you to disassemble and reassemble engines, drive trains, and so on. This is definitely neat, but in itself only has so much enjoyment before things get repetitive. The illusion of running a repair shop almost works but the finer points of running a business are completely lost. There are always more customers waiting, no matter how long you take, or how poorly you did. Diagnosing problems seems almost trivial, just look for rusty components as you wrench things apart. I want to like this, but I ran out of challenges a while ago. All that remains is the grind of XP and money.This game needs more of something. I would personally love to see engine tuning and performance simulated to some degree. Other options would be expanding the business model of running a repair shop, or perhaps adding more realism to the repairs themselves. A broken part isn't just a rust texture after all.			"

												I owe a lot to this game. I grew up not knowing a thing about cars. I picked this game up on a whim, and it got me over my fear of messing around with my semi-broken car. I learned where things typically are, and what they do in a car. I have saved myself and my friends and family probably hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in vehicular repair. I even managed to fix a broken lawnmower by extrapolating from what I learned here! Using this as a general guide and supplementing knowledge with YouTube channels has, in my mind, made me somewhat competent when dealing with these things. I am by no means a mechanic or an engineer, and this game will not give you the didactic knowledge that is required of those professions, but it has taught me fundamentals. Fundamentals that are worth far, far beyond the asking price of this game/virtual tutorial. Words cannot describe how much  I appreciate the experience that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has given me. I can't say it is particularly ""fun"". I could see how you would have fun with it, but the overall management experience of it is, in my humble opinion, a little weak. That isn't the point, though. If you have any interest in working on cars, you owe it to yourself to get this game.			"

												This game is truly what every gear-head has been waiting for. Virtually running your own shop - with a few things missing. I would LOVE to make a few suggestions for the next release so that it would suite not only my own preferences as a Diesel Mechanic, but those as a gamer. Pros:Smooth, flawless gameplay. No bugs worth remembering.BEAUTIFUL textures. The ability to diagnose with different tools. Decent car variety (for what the game is)Auctions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Build for profit!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pick what jobs you want to do!Immersive gameplay.Cons:Some things that should need bolts or nuts, don't have them. Making removal easy.Random pulleys.... (really urks me that the belt is being bent in a way for no purpose other than aesthetics)No A/C Systems in any cars (would be a fun thing to troubleshoot)What happened to intake hoses/tubing?Driveshaft removal in something that is rear-wheel drive is WONKY.ignition coils can only be seen if you hover over them (possible bug)Body work system is weird, sometimes get a work order for replacing panels for a vehicle with no paint job, but panels are same color as car. (wtf?)Music........ oh my god the ♥♥♥♥ing music. Suggestions:Advertise this product more for a bigger budget on the next version (you guys are onto something)More varieties of things to diagnose and troubleshoot (like oil/coolant/fuel leaks)Add nuts/bolts to things that would typically be bolted down to an engine (like an intake on the older V8)Employees?Don't let this series die.... please........ pretty please..... 2016?!?!

Product received for free
Fixing cars without a messDo you like cars? Or are you interested in knowing more about car parts? Or are you just looking for a relaxing game where you dismantle stuff and build them again? Whatever your reason is Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 let's you do it wihout a mess.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a fun, relaxing game where you fix and tune different kind of cars for you to earn money by fixing them or by selling them. As the name of the game may suggest it's quite realistic in terms of being a video game. You can fix cars, test drive them, use different kinds of equipement to look for problems in the car. Do not expect any kind of sick street racing with this game because it's pretty much just fixing cars. But a fun game at that.There are some things I have to criticize though about the gameplay and the game itself. The loading times are absolutely horrendous. No matter how powerful computer you got the loading times will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The other things that I had problem with the early-game gmaeplay. It takes quite a long time to reach even remotely interesting jobs. The first cars you'll be fixing in the first 4 hours or so will be very easy and won't earn you enough EXP or money to make them worthwhile doing. But you are stuck with them. But fortunately after a couple of hours the gameplay gets more interesting in terms of getting longer and more difficult jobs that actually make you think what you need to fix first. Unfortunately I can see people stepping away from the game in the first couple of hours because of the boring fixing jobs it offers.Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a very fun game. It may not be the most difficult one but it certainly is a change of pace compared to other games on the market. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 actually taught me more about car parts than anything else to this point. Certainly I'm no master mechanic just by playing this game but it certainly gives a bit more clear image of how cars work and what parts there are inside them. Fun and relaxing experience suitable for everyone.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here! "

												This game is absolutely relaxing. If you played and liked CMS2014, you will DEFINITELY love this game.Pros:= More parts! this means more detail in the disassembly and repair of cars= BEAUTIFUL! The graphics may not be GTA V, but they are certainly delightful!= OWNING cars! This is a feature that pretty much everyone wished was in the last game.= Active devs! The devs are on pretty  much EVERY DAY to help diagnose bugs and help players have a better experience.Cons:= It's a simulator. This may not be your type of game= Very detailed. While this may be a pro to some, it can quickly become a con to those who don't know cars.= Slow. Not in performance, but gameplay. It may take some time to diagnose a car, and then even more time to fix it!Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly is mine!8/10 from me!~ WireBound			"

												i loved cms 14 and this blows my mind. my father is a fanominal technician and i want to be just as good but better. im 16 and this has taught me a lot. if someone is talking about a part i now know what that part is. in my opinion they should add more customization towards parts on cars. i would love to be able to take out a old crappy engine and put in a higher performance engine. same with other parts. i think that would be amazing. they should also add the 1/4 mile mode again. i loved tuning the cars just right so i can complete the order.these are just suggestions so if anyone agrees with me please like my review10/10			"

												You don't have to be a car enthusiast to enjoy this game.  If a 3D puzzle/forensic/tycoon game hybrid appeals to you, you might like CMS 2015. I call AAA to jump my battery, and my eyes glaze over when people talk bout cars, but I was surprised how much joy I got from buying a rusty junker, taking it apart, and either repairing or replacing all of its parts to make it practically brand new.------PROS____+ Gentle learning curve. I felt like an idiot for the first couple minutes, but even after just the second repair job, I felt a rewarding sense of growth in my abilities.  I don't like working too hard for a game (there's real life for that!), but I get bored when games are too easy, and CMS 2015 hits that sweet spot between boredom and frustration.+3D puzzle/forensic/tycoon game hybrid.+ Great music. If you end up buying this game, make sure to walk over to the radio, turn it on, and flip the stations.  I'd pay for at least one of the tracks they play on the game's radio.+ Active developers as of 4/2015. They seem to respond pretty fast to reported bugs, patch minor gameplay updates that significantly improve the gaming experience, and actually post upcoming plans for future updates.-------CONS-------+ Longer loading screens than I would've expected, but nothing too frustrating+ Getting enough experience points and money to get to the more fun parts of the game (going to auctions to buy a junker and build your own car/s, upgrades for work efficiency, etc) might take a bit too long for impatient gamers.

I understand there are legal reasons and expenses. That is literally the only flaw I have on this game.Awesome game. 9/10			"

												I got the game with all DLC on the sale. I liked the business idea in the gamedescription and as it was on sale, I was like, lets try this!However, now I reached a point where there isnt really much to do and some features that dissapoint me:Managed to unluck all shop options (paint, testing, parking etc.). Once I got the parking, I bought some cars and only just fixing the body could get me some good profits, if I got the car at the right price. Bought 2 cars I totally rebuild with new parts, one with tuner and performance parts, which I kept. Took it to the dragracing and found out I be racing just myself. So exciting! Also modding the looks of your car is pretty dissapointing. GTA V, which has this not as a core part of their game, offers more paint, rims and other options to change the looks of your vehicle than this game.So now, I dont need money as I got everything, modding a car isnt interesting as I can choose one or two different bumpers and painting a car kinda sucks (no preview and can only paint a car in 1 color, no decals).Buy this game if:- You like replacing carparts over and over againDo not buy this game if:- You like business sims- You like to pimp cars "

												821 HP Tempest Magnum cuts a 10.390 with best launch achieved using a keyboard. 10.440 if I start in 2nd.Also after building the thing to hell I noticed in the loading art a DOHC V8 is being dropped into the magnum (but I can't do that, only OHV swaps).Tips from a beginner:- 9000xp is a grind, but the game gets a lot more fun once you have a garage and can hit the auction up- Buying a 1/5 star auction score and restoring to 100% perfect seems to rack up faster profits than answering the phone (or at least it is more interesting)- Save your cash for 9000xp+- Repair upgrades will save you quite a bit of cash, max asap- Carb and EFI tuning: get 2-3 bars lined up then work the last one to 18% while incrementing the 2-3 together9/10 will be doing more (haven't even began working the DOHC V8's yet, 50 hours in, 400k~ cash as of this comment).For the devs: the 10/10 would come if I could swap nearly any engine into any thing without having to modify the game files (with some sensibility, but a V8 maluch sounds like a blast). Also more modding and tuning options would help (11/10 if I can turbo or twin turbo anything). Most under carriage do not seem to collide the exhaust in any way with the drive train, so customized exhaust could be possibility too? 12/10 for addict DLC that includes all of this.			"

												I'll recommend this game because I had fun playing it and it's a better game than I could ever make, but just beware this is far from reality (more of a game than simulator). After a while I got annoyed with some minor things: The loading times in this game are absolutely terrible, as others have already mentioned. The sound effects get old pretty quick (sounds like breaking glass every time you remove a bolt or part), can be fixed by turning your sound off but I'd rather have more variety. The jobs get repetitive, but this happens in real life too (90% of the jobs I received were brake and timing related) The automatic mouse centering is pretty annoying every time you open a menu It lacks a lot of realistic parts to be a simulator (transmission gears, more body options, missing almost every electronic part besides the ignition and battery, torque specs, etc) but I suppose someone could fix this with a mod or something. No Steam achievements (could be some for fully restoring a car, completing certain number of jobs etc) Everything ""damaged"" is rusted so it's pretty obvious to find the problems without running any diagnosticsI didn't do much with the 1/4 mile strip since each time I went there it was terrible on keyboard and the loading times just weren't worth it. The only thing I ever left the garage for was the auctions and even those just ticked me off. Who would want to pay $50,000 for a rusted piece of garbage that they're only going to get $70,000 after fully restoring it? They should make the bidding system a bit more realistic too..Other than that I liked the game, the DLC make it much more enjoyable once you run out of things to do. "

												The game itself isn't going to really teach you much about cars or trucks that you can take and apply to the real world. You will learn some basic names and functions that are pretty basic so I wouldn't really call it much of a sim. It doesn't take long to reach the maximum level and money isn't a real obstacle once you can afford to buy, repair/upgrade, and sell your first vehicle.Where this game becomes a gem though is how relaxing it is. It has good music and decent graphics that you don't get tired of looking at. Everything is straight forward and not hard to figure out. More and more options and car varieties come out to keep you entertained. Where the game is now (May 15, 2016) is pretty great. You have a drag strip (super cars struggle a bit here) and a Dyno setup to help ""tune"" your car to maximum performance. You have a small but nice variety of cosmetic options to make your car more valuable and unique. This plus all of the original features gives you a game you can sink a couple of hours into here and there to build up your personal collection and your bank account.All in all, I would give this an 8/10 atm. The game is great, don't get me wrong. Hardly any bugs and plenty of fun. But it could always use more. More cosmetics, more cars, garage expansions, and possibly some sort of multiplayer whether that be in the form of racing or a collection showcase. Either way it is definitely worth the money, and getting all of the DLC when it goes on sale is a must!			"

												CMS 15 was the first title I played in the series and so far It's incredible fun. At first I was skeptical because I'm not all for simulators but to put it in short, I called in to work to play this non stop for 14 hours. Evidence enough?The huge plus for this is that the developers actually listen to the feedback and it's astounding. For instance, they released an update on Monday 4/27/15 that introduced tablets but unfortunately that followed a few bugs that altered the quality of the new features and within 8 hours of reporting the bug they had already released a hotfix.Overall, it's a great game and is worth every penny!

												Read the reviews, felt a tad let down that as an early adopter of CMS: 2014 there was no incentives given for adopting CMS: 2015 early, however I overcame these feelings and decided to give the game a go.If you enjoyed 2014, 2015 will not fail to keep you entertained. Only played the classic mode thus far and it's still brilliant. It's nice to get a list of items that you'll need to replace given to you. I also appreciate that far more parts are now removable and will need to be replaced.I do not recommend this game to anyone that can't appreciate a decent ""mong out"" style game. Anyone that found EuroTruck Simulator 2 enjoyable should find this to be a blast. If you couldn't appreciate the simple beauty of that game, this one will lose your interest quickly.			"

												Fun game, it teaches you the basics in car mecanics without having a ""proper"" tutorial. Being such a visual game you get to understand different engine types, transmissions, suspensions, drawbacks and advantages to these and how they can affect the design of each car.There is no end objective but after about 25-30 hours you'll have all the upgrades , 10 more hours and you should have all the parking spots and finally another 10 to fill them up with the cars of your dreams... so if you end up buying this game at a steam sale with all the dlc at about 25 euros for 50 hours of fun+learning something that'll be a bargain.edited: sports =/= spots			"

The level of detalisation is enough to get you tired of repairs.Pros:- lots of parts;- there are at least three generations of car design in the game, each with own features;- there is some good music;- it's not complicated and plays easy.Cons:- some processes are not very intuitive, e.g. engine swaps (it works onoly with Performance DLC although there are parts for engine tuning in the core game, and there isn't any explanation or warning about that);- it has some skillpoint grind to do for upgrading the garage;- instruments on the dashboard are just textures;- driving physics is simplified, it doesn't give a real feel of the vehicle.

												Wow, finally a developer that looks at all of the weak points of a previous title and improves upon them - this game has exceeded my expectations so far (only 1.8 hours played at time of posting).I was so excited for this game when I saw it announced on Kickstarter. I didn't even think twice, of course I backed it, 2014 was such a great game. The idea of Car Mechanic Simulator is a very easy one to understand - I absolutely love tinkering with my real life car so naturally you would think this game is made for someone like me who is looking for a cheaper alternative to modding real cars, I would actually disagree with that. I find that this game has a wider market than people first think - the hunt for that last broken part and the race to get the funds for a bigger garage or that new part for the car you picked up at auction last week adds both puzzle and RPG elements that a lot of gamers will be familiar with and will enjoy.The game itself plays incredibly well and the new menus are gorgeous, very simple and straightforward, the controls have also been fine-tuned leaving the finished product feeling much better and in turn even more fun to play.Anyone that has played 2014 and liked it, even just a little bit, should definitely pick this up - let's keep supporting the creators and hopefully we will see another new game with some more incredible new features in 2016!The only thing that slightly holds this game back is the lack of customisation that you can put into the cars you pick up at auction. I would love to be able to fit my 20 year old rusty hatchback with a 5.0 litre V8, upgrade to a twin exhaust (or even quad!?), a wide body kit, slam the suspension, tint the windows, even possibly convert it to 4WD! Oh, the possibilities... Perhaps I'm just expecting too much, or maybe I've just been playing too much Need for Speed... Who knows, either way, I would bet money that we will see improvements like these in either future DLC or the next release.Verdict - As much as I really want to give this game a perfect score, it has to be 9/10 based on the lack of customisation for your auction bangers. Still a fantastic game that I will play until my eyes bleed.			"

												First of all, this game, although basic in some situations, is a pretty good game if you like working with cars or want to know a little bit more about how a car is put together. There are a few problems with this game though, some major and some minor problems.For example: The time it takes to load a car into your workshop after you accepted a job, bought one from the auction or made a test drive in it is long, and sometimes longer than I like.The second major problem is that there isn't much of a story with each job. I've played CMS 2014 and in that game you get to see a little story about why the car is in the garage in the first place. In CMS 2015 you just get a list of parts that need to be fixed (in the beginning, later that list of parts is mostly gone and you just have to look for the broken parts) and that's it. This makes the game a little less personal in my opinion.The third  major problem involves the dlc's available. For some reason, the delevopers thought it'd be a good idea to put the content from the dlc's in the game before said dlc is purchased. This way, the delevopers look like a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that just want to make as much money as the can.And now some of the minor problems:- The engine sounds aren't very... uhm... realistic...- even if you buy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car from the auction, the only parts that can be missing are the body panels. I'd like to see something like various parts missing from a car whilst it's still able to be put in the shop.- you can only give your car one color if you paint it. It'd be nice if you can put stripes or things like that on a car and give them another color.- you have to buy every part you need individually. If there'd be an option to select how many parts you want that will make it both easier and more realistic.So the game's pretty good as far as basics are concerned, but there's just a couple of things that make the game less realistic. Still, wheter you like realism or not, this game is pretty fun.			"

												This is a great step forward for the game compared to CMS2014. Massive improvements to graphics, tons more vehicle parts to work with, and a whole new approach to issuing missions makes this a major overhaul to what was already a pretty good game. Despite some worries about hardware, I've been running the game at 2560 x 1600 with maxed out settings and see a solid 60fps.The idea of having jobs issued by telephone, with the ability to pick and choose your workload, really works well for me. My son and I picked out a couple of interesting looking jobs, loaded them up on the lifts and started plugging away at the pile of problems. The whole process felt very smooth and intuitive. A nicely structured tutorial at the start (very simple, just a few text popups and some easy initial missions) helped greatly.It's still not as easy as I'd like to navigate around the inside of the vehicle, but since the real thing is even harder I can't complain.These guys have put out a great game, and they even managed to do it on-schedule. If they hit their published targets for DLC I'll be even more impressed.Right now their software is massively underpriced in the Steam store, there is no way this game should be priced so low, so jump onto it asap.

												This is really fun, a massive step forward from the previous game. I'd really recommend it to anyone who had gotten the older version of this game, and anyone else who is interested in a semi-realistic mechanic simulator like game. You can repair other peoples cars, you can go out and buy your own car and fix it up and then sell it, and the DLC (disclaimer: I don't know how many will be) is Free! How could anyone complain about that? Would i recommend it? Yes! Would i play it for days on end? Definitely.Does it have a lot of replayability? Not really, its very repetitive, but then again - so is the job itself in the real world, so i'd have to say that's just another level of realism. Lol.			"

												I played CMS 14 and enjoyed it. And only having a brief play on CMS 15 there's a lot of improvements that have been made. I maintain this is a great tool for those who want to get to know parts and the very basic mechanical knowledge on a car.Having been a grease monkey I know working on motors is just not that easy. (if only!) There is a steep learning curve, heck, my first job was an engine block replacement! Which meant everything had top be undone, gearbox out, clutch & flywheel out, both manifolds. All fun. Mind you, I have yet to experience pistons and con rods that don't need unbolting from their bottom bearing caps before removing. . (little oversight by the devs there! - but nothing major)I love the way you can take multiple jobs, but that could lead to confusion if you don't check the job sheet. I also like the fact that as jobs go on, you have to check & diagnose the faults yourself. Something to look forward to and be a little challenge. This game, I feel, will just eat away hours, and it's intended not to be stressful, but really a chill out game, like ETS2 or similar.All in told, if you like the idea of messing about with cars but don't want to get your hands oily, then this is ideal.

												Its a really fun game! Cars and mechanics are fun. But after around 24 hours it gets a bit repetitve. But I hope that in future updates new stuff will be implemented. I suggest you buy it on sale because 20 bucks without dlcs is a bit much. I recommend it though			"

												Firstly let me just say that I have been wrenching on actual cars, motorcycles and marine engines for many years and I truly enjoy it. I also have really enjoyed mechanic simulators in the past, Street Rod was a staple of my childhood.Secondly, If you're *really* into car mechanic simulation, buy this, when its on sale. This is better than Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, but still not a great game. If I had to use one word to describe this game, it would be Tedious. It takes a very, very long time to unlock the more enjoyable parts of the game (9000xp for the garage, are you kidding me??) You'll find yourself repeating the same monotonous, mind numbing jobs to build your xp before you can unlock things like the ""test track"" and the Garage, where you can store your own cars bought at auction. Speaking of which, the XP system leaves much to be desired and appears to have been thought up in 5 seconds with no play testing whatsoever. Remove a part? +1 XP. Install a part? +1 XP. Finish a job? 100XP. That's pretty much it. I guess you could get 9000XP by removing and installing the same spark plug 4500 times. Replacing a piston should generate orders of magnitude more xp than replacing an oil filter. You select the job you wish to take by clicking on your desk phone. It lists 4 jobs, 2 of which always require vastly more XP than you have. The interface can be painful to operate - Press I to open inventory.. but press Escape to close it? How about the parts catalog, which is listed in alphabetical order and does not have nearly enough subcategories. An alphabetical list for engine parts with photos is ridiculous. The repair bench is a button press. That's it. Remove part, attempt to repair, you'll either make it better or make it worse. Boring mechanic. There are definitely lots of parts in the engines, which is great, but the selection of which parts are 'wrenchable' and which are not seems completely arbitrary. Why are there 4 clips holding the airbox together, and like 4 bolts to the entire gearbox? Also please don't force the player to lift and drop the car a bunch of times to work on the engine... some parts are removable from the top, some from the bottom. Why can't I just remove the engine and put it on a test stand?I realize this review is a bit discombobulated, but then again so is this game. It just seems like a lot of values were randomly selected, and not much thought was put into vital gameplay mechanics and interface design. 5/10.Better games in this genre from years past:* Street Rod 1 / 2* Redline Legal Street Racing * Gearhead Garage			"

												I'm going to start off with that this isn't the best game in the world, nor should you ever expect it to be. That's not what this is about. However, my friend and I found that we absolutely could not stop playing this game for hours at a time. It may seem like it could get very repetitive but, giving both my friend and I are are car fanatics, it just seems like we could have enough hours under our belt by the time we get bored of the game, if that ever happens. It's your chance to build a shop at your own pace so you can customize your cars. Also, it's worth getting the gold edition, the DLC cars are great!			"

												Far above and beyond CMS 2014.Still lacking a little in some areas but is constantly being improved by the Dev's.I could go into detail but I think plenty of other reviews have done a good job of that already.The game reminds me sort of like being a puzzle game in a sense.You're given a problem, such as 'there is a rattling noise in the engine;'And must find out the cause and remedy it.Which usually entails replacing a defective part, in my case with the rattling, it was the clutch bearing.The game starts off easing you in, allowing you to know which parts are needing replacement/repair and givingyou the option to highlight them as well.Later on however you won't know which parts are wrong but are giving hints. (""Steering is wobbly"")And you can put the car through various tests which can help you discover what's wrong.Drive the car on the Test Course and you might find out the suspension is bad.Use the OBD Scanner on the car and find out about any electrical problems.Etc.Later you can get into auctions and re-selling cars and stuff; but I won't go into detail there.(mostly cause I haven't reached that far myself yet lol)The bottom line, if you liked 2014, or somewhat liked it, get this game it's so much better.If you like the idea of mechanics but are on the fence.. I would recommend the game still however if youwant to be certain maybe watch some LP's on Youtube or something.			"

												I can't stop playing this game! I've got nearly 300 hours on it!I recommend this game to anyone who likes cars, and especially anyone who wants to learn more about them. It's not the most realistic game, as a lot of parts are repeated through car models, but nevertheless, you can still learn a lot.This game also had DLC, which is pretty good, but it's not free DLC, and in my book, that's a bit rude. I already spent money on this game, so I want all of it!I give this game:Competence/10			"

												I watched a gameplay video on Youtube for this game and it grabbed my attention instantly. I am a forty something nerd and geek and I enjoy anything to do with mechanics and technology and this simulator looked like the perfect thing for me, to the point that I even updated my desktop pc to handle the graphics.The game has not dissapointed, I am hooked. I haven't modded the game to increase my XP or money, I have worked through all the telephone jobs I needed so I could unlock everything and start my own car collection. Playing the game this way has shown a great balance of having to earn the money in order to collect the cars from the auction house and renovate them just as you would in real life.The future potential for this game is exciting, hopefully with a few more DLC licenced cars and maybe other vehicles, a track or two to drive around or being able to upgrade your vehicles with a full engine swap and tune, drive conversion, suspension upgrades, also adding bucket seats and a roll cage to create a perfect race or drift car.If a new kickstarter campaign was initiated for these additions I would certainly invest.......

												the improvement from this game from the last game is quite honestly astounding, in the last game you could pretty much just do the basic stuff, this game you can quite literally strip the car down till it is just the body shell and rebuild it from the ground upthough if you buy a game for the ""story"" you wont get much here But this does indeed feel like a sequel to the last game first game you could only work on one car at a time, while this game you start the game and immediately have the ability to work on 3 cars at once using 2 car lifts, and juggle the cars around so you can have it on the lift if you need to replace running gear or have it on the floor when replacing or repairing the body panelsthe game at the moment is very stable and in my 30+hours playing at the point of this review i have not had it crash on me yetthough that being said the bar for entry is pretty high it is recommended that you have at least a basic idea of where the parts are as there is no real tutorial that for instance shows you where the wheel hubs goand once you get to the later part in the game when you can go to auctions and buy and repair cars then resell them is the time you really appreciate the amount of parts that are needed... especially if you plan on restoring a vintage V8 (there are two versions, one with overhead cams, and one with overhead valves) where you need to buy 16 push rods and 16 rocker arms all makes a pretty big dent into your bank accountalso in this game there is the customisation options, that you can ""purchase"" when you have got enough experience (you get experience for everything thing you remove and put back) and this can unlock diagnostics tools in addition to the OBD scanner of the last game, but also a multimeter and a compression tester, or ""efficiencies"" like the faster unbolting, faster removal or faster manual checking or options to customise your shop, also repairing makes a return, but unlike the last game repairing doesn't cost anything but it does have a percentage of success (you start at 40% chance and can upgrade it to a max of 90% chance) and you can if your lucky repair it to like new condition but run the risk of completely failing and ruining the part making it irreparablethen you look at the game and see with the amount of detail that they put into this game, the improvements to gameplay and a game that takes up just over 2GB  on the disk (probably be more when the DLC is released) well you wonder why some other games can't make this level of improvement as well, when you think about that 2014 was released the beginning of last year plus 3 DLC's for the game this game probably tool them 6 months to make, which like I said at the start is astounding "

												CMS 2015 is a fun game! It sports better graphics, a slicker interface, improved controls, a deeper career mode, and a better gameplay experience over 2014. In order to unlock additional content (i.e. slicker vehicles, shop improvements, and abilities) you'll have to turn the wrenches a lot longer in order to gain XP. This isn’t entirely a bad thing, as I feel it keeps you coming back for more. The jobs seem to be more varied in both, substance and tasks in order to get you through. However, you’ll see a lot of the same types of vehicles, early on, just in different colors. Despite that, I honestly can’t find much more to complain about. I think the devs did a pretty good job with this outing, and I look forward to seeing what they’ll add to it.			"

												Hours Logged - 44Okay so I promised myself that'd write an honest review of this game, but only after logging a fair few number hours in order to sure what I was writing is accurate.The game is a vast improvement on the 2014, more polished, more complicated (Love stripping an engine to find a mystery fault), and a lot more room for potential.I've logged 44 hours for this game and I'm not even bored, in fact I'm actually finding myself getting more enthralled due to the auction system, and the refurb jobs I currently have in the parking garage.So in summary:Pros:-- The game will always keep you guessing, even after you have got all the add on's for the garage.- The auction is brilliant, nothing more satisfying than buying a wreck and doing it up.- The cars you work on well rendered and have actual real world issues.- The test track is worth its weight in gold.Cons:-- The game needs more depth in regards to cars available.- I've got an over abundance of XP points and nothing to spend them on.- More DLC as the Youngtimer pack introduced what seems to be a Fiat 500.- The garage itself needs to be open to change, maybe allowing us to move stuff around.So in conclusion, this game is good but needs a little more refinement to make it great.4 out of 5JB			"

Easily among the best games I've ever played. Hard grind, decent sense of pacing as well as the ability to set your own goals instead of a clearly defined ""end game."" Great♥♥♥♥♥♥ although the DLC pricing and whatnot is a bit weird, so I suggest getting the Gold edition for a better experience at a cheaper price. Normally I wouldn't suggest paying for DLC but I feel as if the devs deserve it this time around.One more thing: the game is perfect for people who don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about cars such as myself, but I couldn't suggest it for people who don't find repairing♥♥♥♥♥♥and learning about a machine enjoyable. This is a certain type of game for a certain type of people. But if you have any sort of interest when it comes to anything involving cars, then I fully suggest getting this game.Easy 9/10, only thing that would put it over the top is simply adding more content. There's a ♥♥♥♥ton of places you can take this concept and I feel as if the devs adding as much as humanly possible would in the end make it a perfect game, and I don't think I could say that about any other game.

												TL;DR: All in all, a very enjoyable game for anyone, but especially for petrolheads. :-)I would recommend this game to any petrolhead/car fanatic out there. This is a very refreshing game, since it's the only one of it's kind that I know and it's very casual. For me, it's also a nice way to learn a bit more about the anatomy of cars  on top of the knowledge that I already have (and the fact that the game is translated to my native language also helps a lot, since I'm not too familiar with the English names for various parts). That's probably the downside, you'll need some basic car mechanics knowledge to get going. The tutorial isn't really all that explanatory, so if you're not familiar with the basics, it could take you quite some time to figure out what parts you actually need to replace and that can be frustrating.But, if you have some basic knowledge you should be fine. You can pretty much pull apart anything until there's just a skeleton standing. That's what makes the game so cool, there are no limits in what you can and cannot do. There are no set time limits for repairs, so if you feel like completely disecting a car, go ahead and do it!The XP points system keeps the game challenging. You need to unlock certain features to make your life as a mechanic easier like an OBD scanner to read the on board computer for any errors or better tools to be able to take out screws more quickly. The more XP you get, the more challenging jobs you can accept. And with more XP also come sweeter cars, since when you've built up a name for yourself, people with luxury cars also start finding their way to your garage.			"

												Have to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is one of the few simulator games that actually does a good job, the graphics are great and runs smoothly even on high settings, have not encountered any bugs yet and is great fun to play.Pros:- Not encountered any bugs.- Active Developers.- Can customize Garage.- Can manage your own garage.- Great new test driving track.- Nice models and textures.- Nice background music while you tinker away with your cars.Cons:- Missing some key components from the cars such as fuel lines, brake lines, water hoses.- Small UI upgrade would be nice, selling/buying multiple parts can get a bit tedious.- Career mode could do with a couple more features such as business decisions, ranking and economy).Suggestions:- Could do with more cars, vans, pickups etc (Bikes?).- A bit more detail under the hood would be great wire, cables etc.- A bigger variety of engine types would be a huge bonus (petrol, diesel, hybrid).- The ability to upgrade your garage, as in starting from scratch and buying bigger property and equipment.- Being able to buy and add fuel lines, brake cables and water hoses to vehicles.- More customization options for vehicles such as:	- Size of alloy wheel	- Tyre sizes	- Full range of aftermarket exhaust systems/backboxes (varying shapes and sizes)	- Aftermarket air filters/ Induction kits.	- The ability to add turbo chargers and superchargers to cars.	- Adjustable ride height on suspension.	- Different paint types (metallic, matt, pastel, pearlescent).	- The ability to have engine parts chromed.	 - and finally different body styling modifications:		- Spoilers.		- Sideskirts.		- Hoods (carbon fibre, scoops, transparent etc)		- Window Tints.		- LED Lights.		- Variety of wing mirrors.		- Vented front fenders.- A couple of extra test tracks would be great also.Just some suggestions as food for thought though what you guys decide to do is obviously your choice along.

												Very good game. Probably the only game in which i have a higher FPS in the game than i do in the menu. Very good game, simple and easy to learn. As a real life training mechanic it is fairly realistic but obviously its been made a lot easier and appealing than in reality (and a lot less painful lol). Very good game, would reccomend.			"

												This is a very enjoyable and well made game.  Fix cars for customers to earn money, customize your shop and improve your skills (tools), and eventually buy junkers at auction to restore and sell or keep.  It is great fun and no interest or knowledge of mechanics is required.			"

												I find it hypnotic and keep coming back for more.  Very well done.- Many car types included, especially if you purchase the (low cost) DLC- Paced as fast or slow as you want, never rushed- I prefer this to most sims; having no trace of tedium/grind found in most other sims- It's mostly a puzzle game for mechanical engineers.  Although even as a newbie to cars, the game helps you a lot, and in the meantime you'll learn a lot about how cars work- There is test driving of vehicles but no ""racing"" or multiplayer- The most fun is purchasing vehicles at auctions (fixer-uppers) and restoring them for profitable resale.  Take the extra used parts you gathered from these vehicles and repair customer old beaters for almost no cost to you (also very profitable)There is some degree of financial management / budgeting aspect in the game but it's minor.  Given the pacing and profitability of jobs coming in, I have never needed any financial help, and only noticed after playing for 80+ hours that there is a bank loan function!			"

												Very addictive game. Although it doesn´t have IRL problems, like tightly rusted bolts/nuts, no need for tool change, no diffrent motor oil types... But after busy day at work ( yes, i´m mechanic), you just sit and click parts, stuff, etc. and no dirty hands.			"

												Good step up from 2014, some nice featers like 2 car lifts, better test track and an auction house where you can bid on cars you restore, even has a parking garage for I think 12 cars, I have six waiting to restore then sell on.  The missions are better, seems to make you work more.  Overall good fun.The only down side is the cars, well lack of cars.  There are 14 and they are not great, never even heard of them until now, think they all polish.  Guess Ford, Nissan and the rest did not want us gamers mucking around with there cars.  Also it seems to many items fit all rhe cars like only a single type of park plug, brake pad, brake calipar, clutch parts, even the drive axle is the same for all rear wheel drive cars.Another little bug bear of mine is hardly any cables or tubes, a few but even large tubes that would join the air filter to carbs are missing, this lets things like the air box, battery seem they are just floating in mid air being not joined to anything.  Was hoping this version of the game would have had more detail at all levels.  Its just odd that clips hold the air filter box on yet the exhaust parts just plop on and off with a mouse click, nothing to unbolt.  Just seems things have been left out as they did not have time to do them and you can see this with some items, as an example, there are three types of oil filters then on the other hand only one type of fuel filter and only one type of battery, the list goes on.Overall I am happy with this version for the cost, I just hope they spend less time in the pub and more time rendering 3d models to add to this game, even if they just changed the colour of similar items (they did with the oil filters) to make it seem there is a lot more to choose from would go a long way.

												QUICK EXPLANATION!So far I think that the developers did a great job, because of the following points:More optimized than CMS 2014.Better system than CMS 2014.I am not a mechanic myself, nor am I becoming one I think, but what I do think, is that this game could be used in school educations to learn them how to start a car repair.VERY USEFUL GAME!

												I liked the first car mechanic simulator (2014) but mostly gave up on it pretty early due to not being comfortable with both the interface and how the camera worked in-game. I'm happy to say this years version is just so much better. I've been playing for hours now (ignore the low hours played stat - Steam was down earlier so I played in offline mode) and it's a very entertaining game. Improvements such as the multiple bays, car auctions, upgrade paths - among many others - just make it a more complete game and I am very happy that I backed it on Kickstarter from the start.I'm only around 15 jobs in and the difficulty has been going up steadily in terms of type of repairs that I'm now being tasked with but - and this is a big but (ahem) - you're left to play the game at your own pace which is perfectly suited for this type of game. I'm having a blast playing this and can't wait to see the later parts of the game once I unlock them.For the price of £14.99 this game is a steal if you have any kind of interest at all in the basic workings of motor vehicles but I wouldn't expect to become a fully-fledged mechanic after putting a few hours into this. Although, having said that,  it's very likely your basic car knowledge of what parts go where will improve dramatically. I used to work in the automotive industry but in the administration side so this game appealed to me for that reason as well.As a comparison the nearest thing I can compare CM2015 to is the ancient Gearhead Garage that Snap-on bought out many, many years ago that was a fun, albeit simple, game repairing and doing up cars to flip at auction and make money. I'm hoping this game further in will vastly improve on that little gem from way back.Highly recommended. Well done to the developers.			"

			What was the owner doing?!? An interesting job replacing 2 pistons and a turbocharger! Steam Store Link for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015: http://store.steampowered.com/app/320300/		

Farming Simulator, Bus Simulator, Construction Simulator, Grass Simulator, Goat SimulatorThere has been a lot of crappy simulator titles filling the steam store page over the last couple of years, but I was quite surprised last year with coming across Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.The Development Team at Play Way and Red Dot Games were really interested in a lot of the community feedback on the forums and wanted to implement a lot of their ideas by working on either DLC or an update to the game for the fansDue to funding requirements, they reached out to the community on kickstarter, where they did finally get funding to complete Car Mechanic Simulator 2015I was one of those backers and am very happy with how it has turned out!The production value is definately a large increase on the previous 2014 title witha lot of polish put into the game.Each car part is lovingly crafted with a beautiful attention to detail.Even without switching into the Part Examine Mode, you can tell which parts are severely warn by the amount of wear or rust tarnish on the part.In examine mode, most parts can be visually inspected without requiring the advanced tools needed, but in the case of Electrical Parts, you will need to purchase the diagnostic tool to be able to check or repair the parts.Later on in the game, you can also purchase a paint bake house and perform panel work as well as a testing line to assist in finding where that annoying little rattle is coming from.It starts you off in your Garage with the phone ringing to inform that a new job is available Selecting the phone gives you a list of availalble jobs, being able to accept or decline as you see fit.So Grab your Imperial Shifter Spanners, Left Handed Screwdrivers and attach your silencer to your rattle gun! It's time to get busy!Most of the initial starting jobs are simple tasks with parts lists or problem information attached. Like replacing filters, brake pads, Suspension Bushes, wheels and oil. Moving up to the more advanced areas like replacing Turbochargers, Pistons, Muffler Bearings, Crankshafts, Bottles of Boost and Timing Gear.The workshop is fitted with 2 Hoists and a central area, giving you the room to work on a couple of cars at the same time. This also allows access to other areas of the car as there is only so much you are able to do from the top of the engine bay.Repairing Cars are the main focus of making money, but you can also sell the old parts that were replaced for a little extra money. Once progressed far enough in the game, you have the ability to go to market and buy cars for your own overhauls and sell them at auction. A fantastic distraction on the side of increasingly difficult fault finding and part replacement.If you have ever been interested in cars, mechanics or even wonder how they all fit together this is a fantastic sim to get you into and learning all about the ins and outs of engines and suspension.And Maybe, Just Maybe, you might also realise that a few parts I mentioned don't really exist.

												It's fun for the first hours, then it gets very repetitive and there is no challenge here, besides finding the rusted parts and replacing by shiny ones. Your money has no purpose, you almost can't assemble the parts out of order by mistake (at least on normal difficulty), if you know how to fix one car, you know how to fix them all, you can't expand your business nor your garage AFAIK...Oh, so much potential. Such a disappointment. It gets pretty boring after sometime. It's a puzzle game with cars, but very limited and all looks more of the same. I'm glad I got this in a cheap bundle.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a great game. The game isn't super realistic but it is definitely fun. You learn to read the problem list and the parts required to fix them. There is a little bit of depth and after a few hours you will be able to take the entire car apart and put it back together without too much trouble. The real fun beings when you start to find the most efficient method of repairing a car and taking the extra steps to tune them early on in the game. I bought the base game and soon all of the DLCs. Totally worth it. They bring great variety to the game and getting the DeLorean was totally worth every penny when I finally got to work on one.Anyway, if you like a straight forward sim with a variety of parts and cars this is the best one out there as far as I can tell IMO. 4/5 Wrenches. :P			"

												This game is way more fun than it deserves to be. That is a good thing.Will you learn how to repair a real car? No. But it will give you a rough approximation of where certain parts are located in a car and a general idea of what they could look like. It's essentially a puzzle game. You are told the car has a noise in the engine, you need to find and repair the specific part. As you play you gain access to more testing tools so you can check the current durability of items without needing to fully disassemble the vehicle. But let's face it, eventually you will fully disassemble a vehicle for the fun of it, because you can.			"

												This is great game if you wanna learn something about cars (how are they made, how it all works...). The translations are kinda weird, because they were made by ""Poles"" (?;Google).

For disc brakes it's called ""Brzdový třmen"" Hope someone from the devs sees this.			"

I was on the fence about this game since it seems like a lot of new content is DLC, but here's hoping they can provide some nice free stuff in future updates (here's looking at you devs!)Couple of thoughts in just about an hour of play.  Wish I could re-bind keys.  Also, the camera angles while in (dis)assemble mode are a bit rough to get used to.  I wouldn't mind maybe a 'free roam' while in those modes instead of clicking a part to get closer to the view you actualy want!			"

As an auto mechanic, there's obviously a number of things with this game that aren't accurate when it comes to the trade.But when I get home, I usually want to crack a beer and spend a few hours mindless restoring cars (and since the new performance DLC, make them fast).If you're not very automotive inclined, then this is definitely a good starting point for learning where things are in relation to the rest of the vehicle. I enjoy it, recommended with the performance and tuner DLC. I would highly recommend picking up the game and all of it's DLC when on sale.			"

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 ReviewCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives those unfamiliar with cars to familiarise themselves with the subject, but quickly runs out of fun.GameplayCar Mechanic Simulator is an immersive experience for the player, taking in account many important details to fixing cars.  Going into this game, I was expecting to be able to fix some sports cars or exotic vehicles, perhaps tuned ones.  Unfortunately, the game has a major issue with pacing.  I've fixed several cars already and still I've been limited to not only fictional, but very mundane and ""nomal, uninteresting"" cars.  I do have the maserati DLC but it took forever to unlock and from what I know, the Masterati's are the only true-to-life brand available to the player.  Despite my complaints towards the game's pacing, I have great respect for the amount of content and detail that the developer has been able to jam into this little game.  The player is able to take each vehicle out for a test drive, before and after mending them.  Each problematic or faulty component is conveniently highlighted in red and are usually very easy to spot.  Although CMS'15 lacks a rich tutorial, it makes up for it as the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master.  The goal of the player is not to simply complete each contract, but also to master the game and learn the car's components and their connection to performance.All in all, though CMS'15 isn't too much fun, it's definitely a rich learning experience and as a motorhead, I enjoyed learning more about the design of cars through the use of a car mechanic simulator.Pros+Immersive+Extraordinary detail+Enjoyable and forgiving learning curve+Very educational+Great visualsCons-Incredibly slow pacing-Fictional vehicles (understandable)-Tedious at timesRating: 7/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.

												""Simulation"" is perhaps a misnomer, but this game is still a lot of fun.  The vehicles are varied, but there isn't much variance in the engines, suspensions, or braking systems.  There are what I would call ""factual errors""; i.e., cars apparently built in the 60s or even 50s having front disc brakes and electric fuel pumps located in the fuel tank.  A nice addition would be the inclusion of a ""Hard"" mode, where the player must use a specific bolt pattern to remove and replace cylinder heads, remove leftover gasket material, and deal with fluids like coolant and oil when changing timing chains.  7/10			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a niche game. If you are the type of person who likes to be given a task with little to no info and are told to solve it, this game is right up your alley. However, if you are looking for an action oriented game with constant movement and excitement, this isn't for you. Pros -  - Huge improvement over the last game. More cars, music, customization options, everything.  - The detail in the cars and garage are very impressive, and each car, while having similar builds, are different from one another - Very immersive. Hours can slip by before as you work on cars - Very accesible to everyone, you don't have to know a ton about cars to play this game Cons  - - The music. Even though it has more music than the previous, it still is a bit shallow in number of tracks. Also, they're all dubstep, and if your not into that (I am) , you might have to play with the volume off - It is hard to play for extended periods of time, and it can quickly become Bolt Unscrewer Simulator 2015  "

												Good but a bit repetitive - Another relaxing game if you like to have something else to do while you watch TV or listen to the radio/podcasts in the background. Essentially, you're given a few different 3D jigsaw puzzles which have to take apart, find out which parts are broken (which appear corroded for some reason), replace/repair said parts, and put them back together again (the game shows you where they go). Optionally, you can perform diagnostic tests on vehicles to make finding broken parts easier, rather than find out for yourself by removing them from vehicles - But I think that also takes away the tiny ammount of challenge that this game has to offer.It also has XP and Levels to lengthen the content. Earn XP by completing repair jobs on vehicles, and unlock different cars, perks (more diagonstic tools, faster unbolting) and more complex jobs.There's not a lot to this game and it doesn't demand much of your attention once you've learned the basics, although it's nicely animated and does a good job at showing the very basics of car anatomy. You probably won't learn more than that from playing it, though. It's not an educational tool, if you're expecting it to be one.			"

												There's something like mindfulness about taking apart a piece of engineering and putting it back together.A full-bodied simulator true to the name, very engaging. In some orders you don't get a list of what needs fixing and you need to run diagnostics, test drive the car, or just take it apart and look, to find what you need to replace.Recommended to anyone who's mechanically inclined, and even if you're not, you will probably find enjoyment in its presentation and gameplay.

												For the asking price, the game has quite a bit to offer. Also once modding is in place, it will be even more worth it as you'll be able to just download new cars for your shop. It's a bit slow paced at first, but once you get your upgrades it's not too bad. If you ever played a game called ""Gearhead Garage"" and you're hoping this is something like it, it's that and then some.I also contacted the developer on twitter and they stated they're interested in adding more tracks to the game for driving your cars on, as well as race modes like drag racing through DLC. If they keep to that promise, this game will have no issues selling tons of copies.Hopefully for 2016 they bring in co-op and even more content, considering you can't really work on 3 cars at once, it would help a lot.

												After playing Gearhead Garage for years and years (the mods really added to the replay value) this game came up on my radar. Of course I was sold at the very moment I saw it. When I got it and played it for a couple of hours I already noticed that I missed certain thing in comparison with Gearhead. After giving it more time, it quickly lost it's ""magic"". With Gearhead released so many years earlier and it being an example where the developers could (and should) have looked at, Car mechanic Simulator comes over as a watered-down version (in every aspect) of gearhead. All the DLC is not helping.I often find myself booting up gearhead garage where it should/could have been Car Mechanic Simulator; this says enough in my opinion.Don't get me wrong: it was fun for a bit, but it just didn't last.I'd like to rate it neutral instead of positive or negative, but when I have to choose, I'm afraid I'll have to rate it a thumbs down.

												Ok, this is not going to be a pleasant read, nor will it be flattering for the developer.To begin with, I'd like to point at the interface. It is, simply put, horrible. No consistency between key mappings to open and close any given window. There is no way to reconfigure keybindings. And, before I forget, there is the horrible way of trying to unmount car parts by precision rightclicking or else you're screwed.Adding to the frustrations of having to deal with the interface, comes the marathon running you have to do between computer, car, and/or other things. The oil collector can is always placed as far as possible away from the cars (in the customer lounge area (!!!)), and you cannot run. Yes, I'll redact my statement about marathon runs, this is like walking a marathon.The level of detail on the car parts is pretty much in the middle. Not bad, but not good either. Completely mediocre, in other words. Trust me when I say this, I've spent countless hours rebuilding my first car from a wreck to a car that was safe to drive. This is a game, and I acknowledge the need to simplify some things, but the interesting parts of a car is completely left out, such as the magnificient gearbox. The gearbox is an entire minigame in itself (or as Haynes' manuals say: Please don't do this, you'll regret it!), and to see the gearbox being an atomic (that is undividable) part, I find myself grossly disappointed. Furthermore, the joy of the differential is also left alone. Then there is the joys of timing belts and chains, timing gear adjustments, the wonders of camshaft misrotation, valve clearance measurement and trimming, valve seal gasket changing, cylinder head gasket changing, piston ring changing, oil pump maintenance, PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) box changing and overhauling, flametrap changing, etc.. The list goes on forever, and all these fun activities to be had under the bonnet are missing. The game itself gives you a chance to experience how it is to unscrew/fasten some components and that's it! The joy of badly fitting replacement parts (such as the timing belt cover) is nowhere to be seen.But I digress. Let's move on. Music, or should I say the complete lack of it. Yes, they have some sounds in sequence that some call music present, but it is annoying at best. Having to listen to it non stop gives me a bloody migraine. On top of that, after researching a little, I find the developer chose to use Creative Commons music, i.e. royalty free music, and that explains a lot. Especially one song is really abrasive to the ears, and I find myself screaming to the computer whenever it comes on, mostly because the girl is atonal and can't sing without missing 7/10 tones. Even my neighbor rang my doorbell and wondered when I was going to shoot that cat. When I buy a game for 20 dollars, I feel ripped off when I discover the game developer was too much of a frugal git to include proper music, and went for the royalty free♥♥♥♥♥♥Get this game as a gift for someone you hate. Do not buy it for yourself.Good grief, I thought this was a mean reddit/3+1 chan (steam censors their name, wow) joke, but it seems to be meant as a commercial game.			"

												This game DOES go on sale quite a bit, so definitely pick up while that's going on if you're thinking about getting it. For under $10, it's a decent buy. I definitely would not buy for $20 though. At the same time that this game improves upon a lot of the downfalls of CMS 2014, it still lacks a way to stop the mind-numbing process involved in getting to the good content of the game.  After playing for two hours, I'm still grinding through basic jobs in hopes of eventually getting to actually work on my own cars.I'd say the music has improved but still is an extremely repetitive playlist. They can't be more than 20 minutes long, if not less. **UPDATE** One new song was added since I wrote this. Probably a 25 minute playlist now. You're better off muting the game music and playing your own.If you haven't played CMS 2014, then it will be more likely that you enjoy this game since you won't notice how little it has really changed. It has definitely gotten better since then, but I think that maybe some more time developing should have been used.Basically, I really think that this game still needs work; but it looks like the developers are really looking for support from the community to do so gradually. That's fine. While it definitely is a finished product, some aspects of it just look very cheap. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good game. Not to mention it's pretty much the only mechanic sim out there right now. It's just that I feel like it still falls short of being a great game. It's almost feels like I bought an early access game without the label on it.I don't want to say this about the game because I know that the developers have worked very hard for this, but I really wouldn't be able to pass off pretending to fix virtual cars as a fun activity to anyone.  You're really better off watching informational videos on YouTube on how to perform the tasks you'd be doing in the game and maybe practicing on a real car than playing this game. Although it may feel like it has some educational value, you don't really need more than basic car knowledge to get these jobs done. Let's be real.I really don't agree with how little experience points you get from jobs that require you to diagnose several different systems and repair them. To even be able to access all of the new features of the game, you need to get a parking garage which costs 9000 XP. Over 20 jobs later, I'm only at 4000 XP. At least there's a bigger variety of problems to fix, unlike CMS 2014, but it's still just wayyyy too much. Why isn't the garage paid with money instead of experience anyway?All this aside, the game gets good support and still has updates and DLC coming, so there's hope all of this gets fixed eventually.

												This game is super cool. First auto simulator for me. I own a broken down cool car of yesteryear. I have done some work on it and found it to be very satisfying. To get more into cars and increase my knowhow, I have been watching Youtube car repair channels. In one of the channels, the presenter mentioned this game so I gave it a shot. This game is awesome! Granted I like cars to start with, but I think that anyone with even slight mechanical inclinations would enjoy this game. Pros: figure out where all the parts are; learn how to do a brake job; learn spark plug replacement; get to see how different cars are built (worked on I4 SOHC, I4 DOHC, and then a two cylinder air-cooled rear engined buggy clone) attractive graphics; realistic without getting your hands dirty; good gameplay. Cons: music tracks are good but are few in number; only two hours in but I haven't yet dealt with electrical items; may get repetitive if you do not like cars. I am two hours into this game and I love it. Worth every last cent of the twenty buck price.			"

												This is a great game for those who are interested in cars (or just like to tinker with systems.) But let me state (and mind you I'm not a mechanic or a gearhead by any stretch of the imagination) that this game presents a simplistic and reductionist version of a car. If you don't know jack about cars you might walk away thinking you know how to fix a car. ""It could be the tie rods connecting the front left steering knuckle"" you'll say to your girlfriend as you look at her car when in reality your guess is just as good as anyother layman. Now the mechanics (ahem) aside, the car restoration bit is what keeps me in it. That sort of ""Now what have we got here?"" feeling you get when a new old beater comes into your ship. It's sort of exciting to be a kind of mechanical detective finding and fixing problems on an old car. And if you're unscrupulous, you can take older parts you have lying around and switch them for newer parts on a car sent into your shop for repair. Outfitted a whole Rino Piccolo with parts I looted from cars sent in for repair.Overall 10/10   Would definitely loot cars for their sweet, sweet gearbox components again.			"

												Very addictive.  Would be very grateful if it were possible to have a 'buy all parts' button or at least a visible list of parts required on the computer/tablet as it's furstrating having to keep chcking back to see what else you need or when you buy the wrong part.			"

												My final in auto in high school was rebuilding an engine. I got saddled with a guy that wanted to do all of the work himself so we would get an A in the class. I watched. Without much interest. He did everything, I got an A in that class. And learned absolutely nothing. I have always wanted even an iota of auto knowledge. This looks promising. I performed two filter replacements. Something I actually know how to do in real life - woo! And now I am learning how to remove a flywheel - never even knew what that was before tonight. I think I am going to enjoy this game immensely.EDIT - Devs, wow. Great game. Seven hours in and I know I need to check or replace the ABS if the brakes are bad. I know if the car is noisy, I need to look at the exhaust manifold, the muffler, and the catalytic converter. I know absolutely nothing about cars.This game is amazing.			"

One suggestion for the inventory problem, try allow 100% items to group maybe. I.E Value push rod x20 or something like that. Also can we get a longer test track or a little scenic road to test the cars on, thanks?			"

												This game is way better than I thought it was going to be. It actually feels like your running your own little shop. Doing small jobs that pay good money. Eventually getting harder and harder but the money paid out is well worth it. I was blown away on how pretty this game is. The graphics are amazing! I'm 15 hours in, and enjoying every minute of it. Very cool game with a very upbeat soundtrack. The only flaws are the camera can get a little annoying at times and the music loops a lot. I give this awesomely made game a 9/10 and would highly recommend buying it.			"

												I have played both of the car mechanic simulators, and I have to say, this one is better in every single way. And you can't ever complete this one, because jobs are unlimited and randomly generated. This game is very addictive, and it feels a lot like euro truck simulator 2 but with fixing cars instead of delivering cargo. This is not one of those crappy simulators you usually see on steam, this is amazing like euro truck simulator 2. Also, you can modify the colors of your workshop, buy attachments like a paint shop, a test area and a parking garage where you can store your car collection. You gain exp from working on cars, and with it, you unlock more cars with more problems to work on, more attachments to buy for your workshop, and you get upgrade points to upgrade your character, and to get tools to help you identify problems with cars. There's a lot more cars in this one than in 2014, and they are much more detailed with much more parts. This time you can work on the cooling system, open up the engine block and replace pistons or the crankshaft and the crankshaft bearings and everything. This game has insane amounts of detail, and the graphics and textures are mind blowing. The reflections are also really nice. The game also runs really smooth, and you don't even need the recommended graphics card if you want to run the game on Ultra graphics settings. I run it on Ultra very smoothly with my GTX 560 TI 2GB Phantom graphics card, so yeah. I honestly have never seen such gorgeous textures and reflections in a game before.  Well, Gta V has nice reflections, but still, this game is gorgeous too. In this game you can not only work on the parts of your car, but also on the panels, like doors, fenders, bumpers, lights, etc. Also, this game has tons of free DLC coming out, and they look like they will be amazing! The game's soundtrack is pretty cool too, even though I'm not really a fan of dubstep, I enjoy the game's dubstep soundtrack. It gets repetitive after a while though, because there's not a lot of songs in the game. I would like it a lot if they add more songs, and perhaps also a custom radio thing where you use your own music for the game's playlist. At the moment when I feel like using my own music, I turn off the game's soundtrack in the options menu, and run my playlist in the background, but I think it would be awesome if they added an in-game feature to use your own music, so you don't have to turn off music in the options each time you want to listen to something else. This game is also well worth the $20, and I highly recommend you buy it!			"

												Usually when I see Simulator in the title of game I avoid the game like the plague!  More often than not, the classification of ""Simulator"" is abused and misused by developers hoping to cash in on a weak Genre with very few good games. I am very pleased to say there's actually a game in here! This does not play like an early access game. It feel more like a finished game they keep adding stuff to, and I personally love it. However would I title it a ""Simulator""? That's a bit of a stretch. But overall, it's still a nice game. I have very few complaints about the game, mostly with some of the odd steps you must take to complete a job, like completly removing the exhaust manifold to remove the front exhaust pipe for example or your HAVE to remove the Starter from the top, not the bottom (on some cars). Also the total lack of gaskets in the game is perplexing, this is a simulator - where are the gaskets? But overall I would recommend this game to car lovers, mechanics, and simulator players. There's game to be had here!!Things I would like to see added before final release:Ability to fix body partsAir wrench upgrade option.GasketsOption on/off for auto mouse movement (game moves mouse at certain stages and get confusing)Customization items for car parts - UPDATE - Feature added to game but as a freaking pre-release DLC, thanks for showing your love for your supporters (sarcasm). It's a sad sad day when Alphas get Alpha DLCs. Pickups (there are no pickups in game) - UPDATE DLC ADDONTire options - UPDATE DLC ADDON UPDATE: 6/26/16Came back to check up on this title.. looks like they added a few of my wishes to the game.. but.. yep, as ♥♥♥♥ing DLC.

												If every now and then, you like to get your hands dirty mechanically, but just don't have the opportunity. Then this can work as a quick fix (though not always). Mechanically pretty accurate, though obviously simplified in some aspects. If you don't know anything about cars, this will definitely help you understand suspension and engines a bit better. Being an Electrical Engineer, I think it would be great if they did an electrical and electronic expansion or something.			"

												As someone completely devoid of knowledge in mechanics, I can tell you that CMS2015 has taught me a LOT. It isn't as deep as it could be but it still can give you a basic notion if you play it and keep a tab open in your web browser to further study what you see in the game. I even managed to replace my car's air intake and air filter by myself =D .Basically you have to fix your customers' car, stripping down the car until you find what the problem is. You can use a number of tools to ascertain which parts are faulty or you can drive the car down a test track. You will have to purchase or attempt to fix the part by yourself, replace it and build it up again. You can also buy used vehicles and restore it, but it gets kinda pointless since there's nothing to do with it apart from photographing it and selling it. It's very casual and gets repetitive fast but still very fun to play. Recommended  for mechanics wannabes =P			"

The Gameplay makes lot of fun and its easy get in fast and upgrade your garage until you are able to buy and sell your own cars. The only thing i am missing quite strong is the possibility to upgrade / pimp the engine of course or body parts.As future addons i wish i can have a bigger test circuit or race track  and some more custom options.The amount of different cars is quite okay but can improve over time. The Price for this Game is very  okay as long the addons dont cost extra.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 isn't an expensive DLC for the previous game. It's a big, standalone product with lots of interesting changes that diversify the gameplay and eliminate the feeling of being shown what to do at specific times. We get many new parts and cars, and a sensible experience system smoothly introduces the player to new things. And even if there's still some boredom here and there, the sequel looks just fine.			"

												Its a good game, but there could be some improvements made. Less detail in some areas, oil draining for example, the margin for where the drain pan is small, make that bigger. The way you disassemble and reassemble, you should be able to take off multiple parts at one time. A parts cupboard or something similar would be good to store repaired and used parts rather than have all parts mixed in together. A colour palette for the paint shop rather than a slider for hue etc It takes ages to collect XP. More toolbox upgrades. Timing and carb tune up options. Tyre options. A dyno tuner as well maybe. Trade cars with friends maybe, or race them. Theres so much more that can be done with this game. For now Im giving it 6 out of 10, only because there is so much room for improvment, I hope the creators keep working on this game to make it better.			"

However, my friend and I found that we absolutely could not stop playing this game for hours at a time. It may seem like it could get very repetitive but, giving both my friend and I are are car fanatics, it just seems like we could have enough hours under our belt by the time we get bored of the game, if that ever happens. It's your chance to build a shop at your own pace so you can customize your cars. Also, it's worth getting the gold edition, the DLC cars are great!			"

												Not as good as it should have been. The game is super grindy and has no real end-game. CMS14 had persistant customers and tuning that wasn't behind a paywall. My customers would wreck their cars or come back for additional work. In CMS15 all of the jobs are randomized. None of them make any sense. No one comes in for a set of front brakes, just one caliper, one set of pads, and a rear drum. Broken crankshaft, but everything else in the engine is fine. For some reason oil is simulated (like in CMS14), but coolant and gear oil are (still) not. The grind to unlock the parking lot to start buying auction cars is real, and you can't make real money with the auction cars until you have all 9 ranks of tool upgrades. At that point, the only thing to earn more money for is more spots to park cars that you can't tune or upgrade without shelling out more real $$ money.The models are a lot nicer than in CMS14, but the gameplay has gotten worse, and the DLC Simulator is real. Avoid this one and future titles.			"

												Honestly the only way I can think to make this game any better is to add realistic sound effects and mechanic actions. I want to hear the painful shattering of knuckles hitting steel by accident and the curses spewing from my tobacco filled mouth out of pure anger and agony. Another thing that I think needs to be added in conjunction with the afore mentioned agony is having the option to throw your tools in anger damaging the vehicle in the process only adding to the pain. Also there should be a frustration meter that runs all the time that rises from things like your wife calling to talk about something you don’t care about at the time, or ever. With these features missing I would have to give this game a, 9 out of 10. Just needs a little touch of true mechanic life.			"

												Some major points.I can say for certain the core gameplay is pretty decent. Informative for someone like me who only knows a few part names and has made few repairs on their car. There are a number of additions that i feel should defintely be included though. More fluids, electronics repair, part descriptions, better damage indicators rather than generic rust, and just listening to engine sounds to diagnose problems quicker - to name a few. This isnt a simulator, rather a collection of minigames based on the reality of auto mechanics.The progression and experience earning rate is dreadfully slow, though. It does feel like hours before i got to my first 1000 Xp and chose my first measly upgrade. Load times are pretty merciless. I really wish they would focus on smoothing it out rather than other features.Most importantly though; the DLC. Why on Earth would you release a ""Gold""/complete version of this game that collects all of the downloadable content if you're gonna release another new dlc pack after, separately?? That's total lack of respect for your customers. I cant see why they wouldnt include it in an update, at least for those have the Gold version like me.This is an ethics issue that i cant forgive them for. I can praise the simple repair aspect of the game but i wouldnt recommend this on a account of poor professionalism from the developer.			"

												I can't really say how accurate these games are because I know♥♥♥♥♥♥all about cars, but this is a definite step up from the wonderfly fantastic Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. This one is way more in-depth and like the previous one, it's fun and make you feel like you actually know what you're doing :P			"

												Would not recommend for the following reasons:- Totally lacking in challenge. You cannot assemble parts in the wrong order, you cannot return an incomplete car to a customer and money was never a constraint.- Very simplistic. Engine components are absent for simplicities sake. Once you've played the game a bit even the most complicated tasks take under 15 minutes. Broken components are identified by their heavy amount of rust (even on brand new vehicles).- After a few hours of gameplay the game becomes very repetitive.- Way too much part crossover. SUV, sports car, sedan all share 80%+ the same parts.I continued to play after I stopped enjoying it as I was hoping that buying cars in auction & restoring them to build a garage would be fun. I turned out to be even more tedious than the early game as EVERYTHING is damaged on every car. Why not just sell the body then if you have to strip everything every time anyways?The best way to fix this game would be to add some proper variety. Working on the ""youngtimer"" DLC that comes with the game shows what good DLC could do. The parts are entirely unique and vehicle assembly is different from every other car.The problem is the cost of DLC, it would be another $35 to add content that needs to already be in this game to recommend. I would suggest waiting until an ""ultimate/complete edition"" packages the game with all DLC for a reasonable price.			"

												Simply put... no, I do not recommend this game.The game itself is not bad. Let's talk about the developers instead.The developers are pretty terrible. The game is lacking in substance, and instead forces the player to be fairly repetitive, and the developers arent... developing the game. The game gets updated maybe every 2 months, but nothing seriously important is ever added. These developers would rather spend these two months pumping out DLC than adding to their own game. Features they have even promised months ago have yet to appear. The game isnt bad, and in the hands of a developer that would rather create a functioning game than DLC riddled trash, it would be a good game. "

												Previously being a mechanic this game is highly accurate to a degree, a big step up from 2014 was the ability to completely rebuild an engine, while building the engine in car is more of an easy approach I recommend they have a system for the next game where you can pre build the engine before installing it, it would be much easier and save you all the hassle of constantly going up and down, to pull the heads off, main caps and then finally getting the pistons out. While the systems and jobs are quite accurate and in depth I think they could have implemented more diagnostic tools, the scan tool is a cool tool but if they could implement a fully functioning scan tool where you can look up and clear DTCS I think that would produce a whole new level of experience in the game for experienced players. After pretty much going through the whole game in expert mode its a fun challenge that keeps you glued to the screen. Overall a great game for what it is, and has a lot of potential.			"

												I definitely love this game. Even with not as many possibilities as I want to have.I would like to see in the future for example boxer engines (like Subaru or Porsche have).Some things are not as detailed as they should be. For example hooses from air filter to throttle or air filter to turbo, then into cooler and ended at throttle again. Something like that. There are a lot of things to improve, but still... Its fun to play this game. Maybe in the future we will have some user mods that can add those features.There might be some showroom as well for restored cars from auctions.Resume? Definitely worth to buy this game and spend some hours to play. After few hours there is some kind of stereotype, but there are some DLCs that can extend a time to play.Thanks for nice game			"

												Successor of the indie surprise CMS 2014 this game is a diamond in the raw. Insta-buy for fans of 2014.Exactly why it's so addicting to repair stuff I don't know, I never even changed a tire in reality.Repair, get money, upgrade your stuff, repeat -that's it.A meditating game to relax when you don't want brutal action.Oh and don't expect to be able to change your gearbox at home after playing, life doesn't work that way. :)This game is still quiet raw, I'll keep buying it year after year until they make it perfect. Hints for the devs->How about web radio support like in euro truck simulator 2? Also trucks and motorcycles, more music.More ingame joke stuff like in the first game the clients' description of the damage. More test drives.Game crashes often with Nvidia when trying to minimize/maximize. Faster loading. THX.			"

												After the first few cars that come into your shop for repair, you've got the concept down. After you unlock a few of the basic skill unlocks, there's nothing you can't really solve. After you're able to buy cars at auction, that's it. You've reached the end game. By that point you're stripping cars down to bare metal and replacing them piece by piece, car after car, making unneeded profit on a hugely routine exercise. There's no real change except for which cars you choose to restore, and sell. The money will never go towards anything but buying and restoring more cars. After you've done one or two, you've even unlocked all the points you need for the garage visual updates, and will have points to spare that you don't need. Buy car, fix, sell, repeat forever.And so, I recommend this game. Which feels weird to me.It's super repetetive. The DLC is kinda nice and not stupid-expensive, but doesn't add enough to be a game changer. Even the recent addition of Expert Mode hasn't really changed anything, as I've done enough of this to not need the non-expert prompts as to what to do next. But I keep going back and doing that repetition.I guess in a way it's soothing, or at least I find it so. It's not like you're accomplishing much, but after a lot of (clicking only) effort, you've finished a nice rebuild of the car and can sell it and get it out of your workshop. Why does that seem good? I don't know. I can't say.My biggest wish is that it went a few layers deeper. Like if I had to fix it all down to a new level of detail: not just replacing the headers, but how about all the gaskets too? Or the interior needs fixing (all cars, no matter how jacked at the auction, have perfect interiors). Or if I want to get a small, cheap car, and throw a turbo and lowered springs on it and sell it that way. It's weird. I can't make myself hit the ""No I don't recommend this"" button because I enjoy it, but there's so many caveats and missed opportunities I feel I should hit it. I guess, in the end, it's a 3 out of 5 stars that I somehow can't stop playing.			"

												As a car enthusiast in real life and a player of nearly all car related video games, I instantly fell in love with the Car Mechanic Simulator series thus far. CMS 2014 was amazing, but CMS 2015 is something entirely new. The amount of things the player can interact with in CMS 2015 has more than doubled than those from CMS 2014. You can now customize your garage any way you want to, have 3 cars in your garage at once instead of just 1 and work on them whenever you like, the auction house where you can buy a junker and fully restore it anyway you please, etc. Truly a classic for any car lover to spend hours upon hours playing!

												Awesome game. It won't teach you to be a mechanic - but you will tinker with the basic components of how a car works.In the game you will have to find and replace damaged parts, and as you become proficient at this you will have to start diagnosing whats broken. You can also try repairing parts to save dough. To make life easier, you will buy a variety of tools to test the car to find what's wrong, to make repairing go faster, etc.This game is a huge jump from the last version - and so if you like car games you should buy this for two reasons: a) it's a good game and b) the developers are really showing their skill and passion for this series; so they really deserve some support.+ decent graphics+ innovative gameplay+ excellent improvement over the last version+ interesting DLCs at fairly reasonable prices- sometimes confusing upgrade system - could use more cars- body work not has comphrehensive as engine and undercarriage systemstl;dr; if you have even a passing interest in cars, repairing them, etc - this is a great game.

Is that because your going to add those car or are they there for something to do. Also wouldn't mind seeing an improvement to paint like some strips and decals. And maybe one other thing being able to put dual carbs on the Tempest Magnum,Bolt Hellcat,Bolt Reptillia and maybe even a engine swap in these cars.			"

												+Good graphics+Good optimization+Fun for a while-----------------------------------------Lack of contentIt's almost impossible to keep playing it when I've done everything I can in this game. And there's not much to do except keep repairing/replacing shıtso I can improve myself and repair/replace shıt faster until the samething gets so boring.-Not really a good game as a simulation/ not realisticI would recommend this when it's on a sale, not the original price.

												A game that for me seems to be fairly theraputic at times, unbolting bits and bobs. An improvement over the first in terms of functions and variety of cars but I do feel the game lacks a end goal in it's current state. Maybe a revised career mode where you move up trough garages and such. Still plenty of time for DLC to come out and maybe the next iteration such as Car Mechanic 2016 may have this kinda career mode :)			"

												Endlessly fun if you love precise repetitive engineering type simulations.  There is so much potential for expansion with this game but as is still worth a buy (as long as you understand there is no racing, no comptetion, etc. it is a simulator of fixing cars.)			"

												The game in all is one of the few games that actually make me glad I am choosing to become a car mechanic in my future. This, although with a lot less of the frustration really working on a car can bring, is accurate, but only to an extent. As said by many people, it’s missing the human factor to it. From the “I can’t touch anything or I’ll have to clean grease off it” incident to the “I’ve lost the one screw and will have to replace the whole part” mistakes. It’s also missing the whole electrical aspect of cars; it would be cool if they could have cars that you would work on that showed you just what the working of a smart car is like.  I would hope that in future updates it will allow:-More car customization, such as different paint jobs (which can even be a part by itself where you have to paint each stencil/layer yourself)-Ability to work on the interior of the cars -Ability to go to car shows and drive the car around and get awards and money -As many car types as you can think of from all different car companies (Can give the ability of the player to load all or just some of the cars they want to work on) including different engine types -Create a customer system where people come in and have their cars fixed within a certain time span (have the phone for people who have bigger projects and have the schedule on computer) It's unrealistic that people would wait to have their car fixed while I'm out at auction and fixing my own cars or just goofing around-System so that you can sell cars to not just people at auction, but do trades as well-Allow players to expand the shop, adding more lifts, open floor areas, and have the ability to hire people in your own shop to help with buying items, fixing parts, testing and painting cars, even buying /selling cars, and even having them take care of a project by themselves -Different modes for players to choose from, such as casual (which is basically what the game is now), a career mode that would start with your business only getting a few costumers, would grow depending on the player’s judgment, and would have ways of advertising and seeing how well you are doing -Ability to add mods (which would help add new cars and different aspects while keeping the game itself simple and giving players the option to expand-Broken parts are not all rusted; parts can have breaks, malfunctions, be clogged but unnoticed until it is actually inspectedThe game as it stands is a good time consumer and definitely helped me distinguish that not every part is called “that round doohickey” or “that thing” due to that I have to look up every part individually by name in order to order a new one. It’s a great educational tool that is easy to work with and understand. What I find absolutely amazing is that even with my slow computer I can run this game with no problem with high quality and only minimal lag with ultra high quality with the only problem just being mouse movement is slowed. I like that it is realistic in the aspect that if you spend all your money on a car you won’t have enough to buy parts to get more money or fix the car and will eventually have to chop shop a car. What is nice is that the game is still being updated and actively worked on. It’s a game where sometimes I can’t stop until I’ve made enough money or until I’ve gotten down to only one customer but then I realize that I have parts to fix, then that I should sell some things, then that there is another customer. But wait, it’s a different car I haven’t worked on. Now I have to find the parts that need to be replaced because they are located everywhere or it has a V8 OHV engine and all the rods and rocker arms need to be taken out.  But then I’ve made the mistake of once again not going to bed when I wanted to. It feels like a Billy Mays commercial… “But wait! There’s more!”Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is an amazing game. I would even be willing to pay for updates such as the ones I’ve listed because just one of those alone will bring hours of more fun, discovery, and things to learn about.			"

												Very complete and real simulator! They should encourage kids to play this at school, learning so much. At the beggining is tricky and if you don't have at least some knowledge you will end up deasambling the whole car and assembling it again. As long as you know how an oil change is done and you are familiar on where some parts are located you should be fine. And if you get stuck in a job o get frustrated you can abort it without any penalties and then try different car jobs. After playing bread simulators, goat simulators, survivals of all kinds... I think this is the most and way far best simulator I ever played. 10/10... Of course if you are not a pretolhead or not interstead in mechanic or learning this game is not for you.+PROS:+you get jobs+you buy car parts+sometimes you need to examine the car and find out what is wrong with it (far more easy than it sounds)+remove/place parts one by one, screw by screw+get paid+buy tools and upgrades to improve your job+as more experience you make the more challenging and complex the game gets and more FUN+awesome electronic/EDM background music+no bugs found yet, exept once I removed a part and got it twice which is nice.+repair parts+sell parts+and more (yet for me to discover)-CONS-you can get stuck on a job, but you can quit it and recover-some parts are so small and difficult to find sometimes but thats part of being a mechanic simulator-needs patience-need to be intersted on cars or the science behind them (specific audience) "

												The visuals and gameplay mechanics are really good, once you get the hang of them, they feel very natural. At it's core the game is about finding faulty parts and replacing them with new parts. The challenge comes by not knowing which parts need replacing, and finding them using different techniques and tools you unlock along the way. There is also an auction system where you can buy cars, repair them, then keep them or sell them for a profit.One thing I really wish they had is some description of what each part does in the car. I have the basic understanding of how an engine works, but even the smallest blurb would have been helpful and a nice addition to the budding mechanic in all of us.Now for nitpicking, would it have killed them to put in a buy button to the work order? As of now you have remember the required part, switch to your tablet and find the part to buy. How about an indication of whether you already own the part? Instead you again have to remember the part, switch to your inventory and search it up. Sure, it's a simulator, that's part of the game, but it does get quite tedious and distracting when you have to search 20 different parts individually.Lastly sit down and be ready, unlocking everything is quite a grind, though personally I don't mind, I find it oddly meditative.

												A great, very simple game. It takes a short bit to get used to how it works and what issues go to which part of the car. If you're very car savy then this will be a walk in the park for you and it'll just serve as a fun simulation to work on some sweet rides. Others, like me, who just know how to change the oil in our cars...if that, will actually find this educational as well as fun. A game like this could have easily been too complicated for people to enjoy, but they hit it right on the button. The graphics are nothing to complain about either! The only complaint I have is that after awhile you start to see that a lot of the jobs are quite repetitve. It would be nice to have more variety of issues to solve with the cars. Thats pretty much it. 9/10 Great game			"

												The game itself isn't terribly difficult to master, and the gameplay and UI are good.  Removing and replacing parts on the cars is easy enough, as the game usually lets you know what's in the way or what you need to remove first before you can proceed.  There's a lot of room for improvement within this game, but it looks like the developer is on top of things by offering additional DLC and tweaking certain areas to make things better.If you're an actual auto mechanic and are looking for ultimate realism in this game, don't get your hopes up.  It's not going to have every single bolt, nut, washer, and other parts.  It does simulate a lot of the meaningful pieces of a vehicle, though.  The differences between the vehicles in terms of engine and suspension types also adds to the complexity and challenge of the game.  If you're a casual petrol-head who enjoys the puzzle of taking apart a car down to the chassis and rebuilding it from the ground up, you'll like this game.			"

												A ton of reviews about this game tell you it doesnt help you learn about cars, and though its not the same as under the hood experiance, before I played this game the most I knew about cars was how to pen the door, start the car and drive, with the amzing ability to turn on the winshield wipers and blast music. This game taught me a ton about under the hood andbody work. Now I don't feel like such an idiot when the guys and girls I know lift the hood and start their car talk. that added with the fact that its simple and at times fast to work through a car, and the variety that comes with DLC make for an interesting and informitive game. No, you might not be able to build a car from the shell after playing this, but you will certainly feel like you can, and that's something a lot of games wont do. It's awesome and unique and I don't see myself getting tired of it any time soon. There are a few minor things that personally would make trhe game better, but its a great experiance regaurdless and I would definitely reccomend this to people.			"

The only problem I have is in the stores of the game there are some part that are there but they don't have a car to use them on. Is that because your going to add those car or are they there for something to do. Also wouldn't mind seeing an improvement to paint like some strips and decals. And maybe one other thing being able to put dual carbs on the Tempest Magnum,Bolt Hellcat,Bolt Reptillia and maybe even a engine swap in these cars.			"

												Very complete and real simulator! They should encourage kids to play this at school, learning so much. At the beggining is tricky and if you don't have at least some knowledge you will end up deasambling the whole car and assembling it again. As long as you know how an oil change is done and you are familiar on where some parts are located you should be fine. And if you get stuck in a job o get frustrated you can abort it without any penalties and then try different car jobs. After playing bread simulators, goat simulators, survivals of all kinds... I think this is the most and way far best simulator I ever played. 10/10... Of course if you are not a pretolhead or not interstead in mechanic or learning this game is not for you.+PROS:+you get jobs+you buy car parts+sometimes you need to examine the car and find out what is wrong with it (far more easy than it sounds)+remove/place parts one by one, screw by screw+get paid+buy tools and upgrades to improve your job+as more experience you make the more challenging and complex the game gets and more FUN+awesome electronic/EDM background music+no bugs found yet, exept once I removed a part and got it twice which is nice.+repair parts+sell parts+and more (yet for me to discover)-CONS-you can get stuck on a job, but you can quit it and recover-some parts are so small and difficult to find sometimes but thats part of being a mechanic simulator-needs patience-need to be intersted on cars or the science behind them (specific audience) "

												The visuals and gameplay mechanics are really good, once you get the hang of them, they feel very natural. At it's core the game is about finding faulty parts and replacing them with new parts. The challenge comes by not knowing which parts need replacing, and finding them using different techniques and tools you unlock along the way. There is also an auction system where you can buy cars, repair them, then keep them or sell them for a profit.One thing I really wish they had is some description of what each part does in the car. I have the basic understanding of how an engine works, but even the smallest blurb would have been helpful and a nice addition to the budding mechanic in all of us.Now for nitpicking, would it have killed them to put in a buy button to the work order? As of now you have remember the required part, switch to your tablet and find the part to buy. How about an indication of whether you already own the part? Instead you again have to remember the part, switch to your inventory and search it up. Sure, it's a simulator, that's part of the game, but it does get quite tedious and distracting when you have to search 20 different parts individually.Lastly sit down and be ready, unlocking everything is quite a grind, though personally I don't mind, I find it oddly meditative.

												Awesome game! Kinda slow to start but it gets better. would be awesome if it was multiplayer. you could have a friend join your garage and turn wrenches with you. or be able to hire computer employees to work on cars while your away from the computer. they could have  a certain skill level that can be lvled up the more you have them do things. would also be cool if you could manage your own garage by setting prices(if to high you wont get customers). if you made this game multiplayer it would be that much better! you could build cars and race them. if you damage your car during the race you could come back and fix it. this game is alot of fun and could have so much more potential. there could even be car shows every now and then with other players. or even sponsors?? to many ideas and now im just rambling,			"

												This review assumes you know Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and it's game mechanics - either from playing it or watching lets plays etc.If you've played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, this is a lot like that - a bit too much to my liking actually. It feels like what 2014 should have been, yet not a big enough step forward for a brand new game. I still recommend it because there aren't many games like this out there and it's got a reasonable pricetag for the value you're getting.This game is a bit more detailed than 2014, but shares all of it's good parts, so I'll just talk about things that I was a bit disappointed with:What I find is really lacking is a sense of progression. There are unlocks you get with experience but it feels a bit tacked on and not like a core game mechanic. I'd love to have either a story like in the similar Nintendo DS game ""Touch Mechanic"" (which is by the way a lot of fun) or a more extensive way of upgrading your tools and garage - i.e. starting in a small garage and buy better ones later on.What I think would be nice to have is a less strict assemble and disassemble order - allow me to make mistakes, for example get the order wrong in which I put together parts if I'm not careful. Let me interact with all the parts as I see fit - i.e. let me stop mounting a part mid-way and continue later if I want to - don't just completely remove it if I stop.The body-parts system is shallow - you take off and mount parts without so much as touching a screw. Similarly the painting system is just picking a color and pressing a button - I would have expected to spray the car myself.What I still hate since the first Car Mechanic Sim game is buying parts - it's a dumb waste of time to look up each part on a pseudo web-page - allow me to bulk order all parts that I found out need changing!That all said, if you like the concept of the game or the previous Car Mechanic Simulator, this is the game for you - there aren't many like it out there.For a future Car Mechanic Game I'd wish for these things:A physics system - no magically disappearing and reappearing parts - let me unmount them and physicalls move around the garage. It doesn't have to be as sloppy as in Surgeon Simulator, but something similar in concept would be fun.Also it would be great if one could unmount whole blocks of parts without taking it apart piece by piece.

												Well, its a great game. For me, need a faster way to get XP, too much slowly. It takes too long to get that update point or to unlock new parts for your garage. More cars of course, but is not bad the number of cars in the game right now. Fix the loading time please! MOST IMPORTANT: Add a portuguese version (brazilian one)! Its already too much players from Brazil that suffer with the different languages. Keep with the great job!! And hope you (developers) assist your fans/players, changing what we want.. Thanks!			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 does exactly what it says on the box, giving you the experience of being a car mechanic. As a simulator it’s exceptionally well done, capturing many of the aspects of car repair whilst not being as unforgiving as its real world counterpart is. However some of the more interesting parts of the game are hidden behind the levelling system which is too basic and takes far too long to get anywhere meaningful making it very easy to put the game down and forget about it. I enjoyed my time with Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 however if you don’t have an interest in cars or simulator type games then you probably wouldn’t find much more to love in it.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/05/11/car-mechanic-simulator-2015-well-theres-your-problem/ "

												A great game. A huge upgrade from the 2014 CMS. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:- No storyline from what I can tell, unlike CMS 2014 where it was set up.- Classic muscle cars, my favorite.- Better camera than 2014.- Body modifications/jobs.- Basically a huge upgrade from 2014 CMS, I could list so many more things. Maybe take a look at the CMS 2014 trailers for a preview of the upgrades?Cons:- Uh, plastic rims don't rust???- When taking off a driveshaft on RWD vehicles (Bolt Reptilia, Hellcat, Magnum, etc) it is a little difficult to get a good angle, the best way to take off the drive shaft is to click the middle muffler and then unscrew the driveshaft.- No free roam as of now. You can get a parking garage and collect cars, but to be honest, whats the point of collecting cars if you can only drive them around an old factory test track? I would absolutely love to be able to drive to the Auction house/garage/test track myself. If the player doesn't have a car to drive there, they could just fast travel, what is in the game now.Overall the game is great, it's just the little tid-bits that make or break the game. I can see a lot of potential for more things to be added, such as free roam, the ability to put old engines in new ones, switch out a V4 for a V8, etc. A great simulator nonetheless, PlayWay is a great dev. If you're not nessecarily a car guy, and maybe don't know your way around a car, it might be a good idea to try out CMS 2014 first, maybe pick it up on a sale.Honestly CMS 2014 & 2015 are two of the few simulators that actually simulate, and don't run like sh*t.I'd also like to mention that the devs update the game rather than making the game a cash grab. They balanced the game, are planning to add more cars/features, and more.Definitely worth the $20.			"

												I've played this game almost to the point where I have nothing left to do but I still can't get enough. I personally work in a shop not near as nice as this one but even though this isn't nearly as detailed as a real car I still love it. I can't wait for more DLC to come out. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves sim games, mechanically inclined or not. You do not have to know anything about cars to play it. It may even teach you something. It kind of generalizes most consumer cars into a few categories of different engines and running gear. The parts being exchangeable between cars is nice it makes you worry less about finding the right part and more about working on the car. Fun fun fun. Casual play style, you don't have to pay attention as there is no time limit, so you can get up and go do whatever and come back exactly where you left off.			"

Parts that need fixing need to be more than rusted. Rusted isn't always what's wrong with things. It would be nice to see some diversity, cracked, dented, barely hanging on haha. 2. It would be nice to hire people to do some of the more mundane jobs.3. Would be nice to customise your cars interior4. A race track would be a nice feature.5.

			Welcome back everybody, it's been a while I uploaded video here. Car Mechanic Simulator was just released and here is the first impression and gameplay on ULTRA settings.		

Ok well let's start quickly by saying if you played CMS2014 you will love this game, if you didn't play CMS2014 you will still love the game ;)I played lots and lots CMS2014 and couldn't wait for this game to come out.So what is the main difference between CMS2014 and CMS2015?Good quesion, but easy to answer.Everything is different ;)Lets start with graphics. Briliant, Absolutely superb graphics to the last detail. 5starNext, gameplay. Gameplay its similar to CMS2014 but improved a lot ( specially camera movements ) everything its a lot easier. 5starNext, parts. Car has A LOT MORE parts specially engine is absolutely design to the the last screw. Unlike in CMS2014 you can take whole engine apart, so you looking at more than 200+ parts per car. but I will try to take car apart and confirm this*. 5starThe garage and whole enviroment looks so real it will make you speechless. 5starYou can buy very cheap cars on auction and repair them put them together and sell them making lots of profit.And off course you can upgrade you garage tools and to get more cars in at once.Does game have any cons/something what needs improving? So far I haven't find anything bad ;) sorry my fault, I found 1 word in tutorial what supposed to be ""by"" and it was ""my"" so only this so farFinal verdict? 5 star game so very good price with absolute superb graphics and gameplay with lots and lots parts and you can use to learn bit about cars and engine ( kind of ) gives you idea what is where and roughly how to repair it :DI hope this is good enough to change your mind and you buy a game and enjoy it ;) Good luck and have fun			"

												Great game, almost like the real thing! It misses the wiring, hoses, seized bolts, stripped bolts, busted knuckles from slipping off that bolt and hitting another part, swearing, and interactions with costumers that would argue that the car is just low on blinker fluid. But after a long day of that, the lack of those things are welcome and refreshing.But really it is a good game if you are interested in working on cars, then it can be educational and entertaining. My only problem is that you can't restore cars without the parking lot, there is enough room in the shop if you only do one costumer car at a time. "

												A ton of reviews about this game tell you it doesnt help you learn about cars, and though its not the same as under the hood experiance, before I played this game the most I knew about cars was how to pen the door, start the car and drive, with the amzing ability to turn on the winshield wipers and blast music. This game taught me a ton about under the hood andbody work. Now I don't feel like such an idiot when the guys and girls I know lift the hood and start their car talk. that added with the fact that its simple and at times fast to work through a car, and the variety that comes with DLC make for an interesting and informitive game. No, you might not be able to build a car from the shell after playing this, but you will certainly feel like you can, and that's something a lot of games wont do. It's awesome and unique and I don't see myself getting tired of it any time soon. There are a few minor things that personally would make trhe game better, but its a great experiance regaurdless and I would definitely reccomend this to people.			"

												I love this game. In the begining it can get repetative; but it's completely worth it to be able to restore your own cars from the body up; just so satisfying.  Having said that I should tell you that I am in no way a gear head; I only have...had a mild intrest in cars, but I do love to figure out how things work and this game fulfills beautifully.  I Recommend for anyone who likes cars as well as people like me who just like to take stuff apart to see how it works.			"

												This game is absolutely astonishing. I can't begin to tell you how much you can learn from this game. I generally have always had great interest in cars, and with this game I am much more intelligible when it comes to what's underneath! Now I look at cars everyday and I keep thinking how I should be able to replace this and that part. I really recommend this game, it does require patience, but it's great fun!			"

												Great game, almost like the real thing! It misses the wiring, hoses, seized bolts, stripped bolts, busted knuckles from slipping off that bolt and hitting another part, swearing, and interactions with costumers that would argue that the car is just low on blinker fluid. But after a long day of that, the lack of those things are welcome and refreshing.But really it is a good game if you are interested in working on cars, then it can be educational and entertaining. My only problem is that you can't restore cars without the parking lot, there is enough room in the shop if you only do one costumer car at a time. "

												The gameplay is addicting, even for a person like me who knows (or knew, I guess I should say) literally zero about how cars work. A true gearhead will see more lasting value to the overall product. As someone who enjoys deeper gameplay elements, however, I feel there's something lacking. You the player simply work on cars to make more money, which leads to easier and faster methods of working on cars, and that's about it. I would have really liked to see a career mode in which you eventually own and operate a living, breathing shop with budgets to manage, employees to hire/train/fire as appropriate, and perhaps eventually build a nation-wide chain of shops if your business acumen is up to the challenge.In other words, great core mechanic mechanic (so happy I got to say that) that has lots of room for expansion as an overal game concept. Also maybe throw in customer interactions, crappier computers, weak coffee, deadlines for getting work done... the list could go on.			"

												As someone who knows hardly anything about the inside of a car, it seems very accurate. The names of the individual car parts are accurate.Whilst playing through the game you will learn teh very basics of the car parts, what they do and how they work.The overall game is great for people new to cars who want to learn and play at the same time.With enough time playing the game I would probably feel comfortable enough changing the brake pads on a car and possibly adding new oil.One major problem I have with the game is the loading time. If I have two cars in the garage and load up the it will take a good minute to load the game, then the first car and then finally the second car.When taking jobs, loading in the cars also takes quite some time.It can become quite boring waiting for the cars to load and it's the one thing making me want to close the game down and play EuroTruck Simulator 2 which quicker loading screens.

Graphics are OK, maybe a little outdated but not that much. UI is simple and helps you a lot if you know nothing about cars. It's fun. I understand the complexity but it would be great if the devs updated the base game and DLCs with more parts, aftermarket and/or even a mode to tune your own car. I don't know if more cars are unlocked with more XP or if what the game shows at the beginning is all there is. A couple more cars wouldn't hurt, still, like I said, understand the complexity of adding a car. I don't regret buying it. It's not an action or racing game. It's a game for when you want to think a little and if you like to tinker with stuff. Highly recommended!			"

												For the oldies among you who remember gearhead garage and buying some piece of... metal.. and then transforming it into a work of art, this is the new better version of that. Yep it has an auction room, garage and a test track (although I dont like the test track at all). You can paint your car any colour you want (doesnt seem to be any decals to apply though). On the whole a great game when you want to take a rusted heap of metal for a couple of thousand and turn it into a great profit. It can be a bit tediuos at first as you can only repair customer veichles. Once you get your parking though and a little capital... oh yeah. Nothing like a 100% castor rex standing in your garage, painted and ready to sell..I like this game very much and hope to see more content added in the future. I would especially like to see a better test track.			"

Good game for $5This is a good game for if you want to play a game while listening to a podcast, because it doesn't require a very high amount of concentration. I wouldn't want to play it just by itself though, since it can get a bit tedious. For someone like me, who's unfamiliar with the inner workings of cars, the game basically functions as a puzzle game. I recommend getting this game at a discount, since it's not worth its full price, but for $5 it's a nice time-waster of a game.			"

												As many others I got this game as part of the recent Humble Bundle for next to nothing so it's always going to be hard to complain.All in all this is a fun and mildly addicting game, but it does have numerous drawbacks.Pros:Good for the methodically minded (the game at its core is a puzzle game really)Noticeable progression.Everyone likes carsCan teach the basics of car engine layouts etc to the mechanical noviceCons:Can get very repetitive.The order that parts are attached/detached is basically nonsensical compared to real life.There's no simulation of wiring or piping etc in the engine bay other than ignition distributors in some models.Lots of features are locked behind grindwalls (you need <this much> xp to unlock the paint booth etc)The more interesting stuff (namely performance tuning) that adds a lot to the game is paid DLC as opposed to an addition to the core game.Most of the cons I can see were game design choices to allow a more casual market and I understand may have been necessary			"

												I can't explain why I like this game so much. I can't tell a toyota from a honda. But there's something about taking a car apart, removing a broken part and putting it back together that just feels good. If I had one complaint, it's that after several hours it can get rather tiring to have to remove the same parts over and over, but after awhile the game introduces new cars at random that keep things somewhat fresh.

												It's good but it needs some help. I work on cars for a living and the game is ok but not in depth enough for me. We've all had run ins with European simulator games and they usually do the basic and the modders take over from there.

If you can get it on sale I say go for it, otherwise wait until mod support comes and see what they can do to make this game great.			"

												This is a game for wanna-be petrol heads like myself, it is a very in depth game and is a puzzle for most of the game, you do pick up on stuff later and where things go and how things operate, it also quicker if you use the tutorial at the start, unlike me.After you get used to it, it is just a grind for experience to unlock new aspects of the garage, it is very enjoyable if you are like me and justwant to rebuild cars and test them and mod them.However some DLC's are recommended as the game isnt AS MUCH fun as it would be ""stock"" (Bad dum tsss) for example, I recommend getting, the youngtimer, tuner, performance, and SUVs, as you get more to do and more things to play with.

												I'm torn on this one - the game is somewhat addictive - until the repetitiveness starts - after a few dozen hours you have restored every car, know which faulty part causes which problem, have built your 'dream' car out of the available cars, have your repair skills maxed out and so on.I bought this game in a humble bundle with the youngtimer DLC (that ***** Maluch) included and bought the Trader pack and the performance DLC in a steam sale. In my opinion, the DLCs are a huge bad point of the game: some integral parts of the game must to be bought via DLC and even those are somehow incomplete. For example the performance DLC allows engine upgrades, but no suspension and brake upgrades. What's the point of the car upgrades anyway because there's only a dragstrip and nothing else.So you often get the feeling that parts of the game are missing. Another example: what is going on with car interiors? You strip a 1-star-condition car down to the naked shell, yet there's a pristine interior in it in which you can click around on named items, but no function.A last word on the car-brand-DLCs:DON'T! You pay about 6€/$ for a mere two additional cars and nothing else per DLC.Long story short: if you get the gold edition in a steam sale for less than 15€/$ or so, I'd recommend it, otherwise avoid it.

												Came essentially free with a humble bundle of other things I wanted. Was initially interested in the game and the concept as I have an interest in vehicles, but playing it fixed this. I gave it a couple of weeks and came back to it just in case, but this did not help any.Anything remotely interesting (instead of replace this list of random parts that makes no sense) is locked behind a massive grind, paid DLC, or both. The controls are clunky and poorly thought out, my initial assumption was that the keyboard controls were gimped in favour of controller compatability, but it doesn't even register a controller.If you received this with a humble bundle and haven't activated it yet -- don't, it's not worth hitting ctrl-c.If you are considering paying for it, definitely don't.

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon. "

												I've turned wrenches on all sorts of things, from lawnmowers to helicopter gunships.  While this game isn't a ""perfect"" simulator by any means, it's actually pretty fun and semi-realistic.  There could be a lot more to it, but for what it is, it's actually a great time-waster or way to just kinda sit back and relax.  If you have experience with working on vehicles, you won't find this in the least challenging, but then, it's not really about challenging, is it?  It's fun, as long as you're not expecting a real brain-twister.  As for people who don't have much (or any) experience in working on cars, this is actually a really good way to learn about how things are attached to each other and roughly how they work.  There's a ton of detail being left out, but it's really all about the major parts and being able to customize stuff / repair stuff.The most fun part of the game for me was when I got up to the point that I had enough money to turn my repair shop into a restore shop.  I don't take repair orders anymore.  I go to the auction, find a car to refurb, completely restore it, and sell it for a heafty profit.  It's a great non-frustrating game to tinker around with.			"

												I wanted to learn more about cars in a fun way. This game does that.I like doing things myself, and learning how things work. I change my own oil and brakes, but looking at the car all the parts were just a mass of inscrutable metal shapes. After playing this game for some hours, I suddenly saw all the parts for what they are. Running Gear. Sway bar. Tie Rod. Tie Rod End. Strut. Coil Spring. There are individual parts, and they have names and purposes.ConsThere are very few interesting decisions in this game.  There's no strategy elements like managing prices or over/under charging, no honesty level, no sales or marketing or competing with other mechanics. The process of repairing cars never changes. There end game is buying cars from the auction, repairing, them then selling or keeping them. Load times are awful for what the game is. The upgrades are boring. The UI when selecting parts can be finicky.I feel like it was a real lost opportunity that the game doesn't offer information about each part. I know I can go hit Wikipedia, but it'd add so much to my experience if I could just right click the timing belt and learn it's function, maybe origin and evolution. What is the difference between a carburetor and fuel injection? Why did older cars have a middle muffler? This would add a lot of resource to the game.Pros If you're looking for car knowledge, this is 1000x more interesting than reading a website or book about cars.It doesn't turn you into a mechanic, but takes the mystery of automobiles and brings them into the realm of the knowable.Your fingernails aren't black for days after.

												Its fun but repetitive,Would be way more playable if add free mode where you can just switch parts as you like.I guess in long term it could be a good game, but its just such a bummer that I spent my entire first hour repairing only two makes of cars in a very similar manner.			"

												This review is based on the inclusion of the Total Modifications DLC.Edited Mar/17My original review was a positive recommendation. After many hours of play, I recommend you only buy if on a good sale.It's very simple, like Sid Meier's Pirates or Sims Medieval. You follow instructions and click stuff. There's no skillset involved, no character/avatar visual or animations connected to your activities. That, in itself, is alright. I've put many hours in building/racing custom rods. It's too simple after awhile and all the bolt removal will seem like tedium. The vast majority of jobs are ""heavy""; like a collision repair center would deal with. [engine teardowns combined with suspension, exhaust, gearbox and brake systems overhauls] Many engine types are not interchangeable; even between like models.You have to play a mini-game for an oil change which costs you $100 if you lose. [actually, it's just unrealistically difficult to position the Oil Drain correctly, under the engine]The gamebreaker for me is the Repair Bench. It's completely random. You click on a part that needs repaired. Your success rate is based on a random number. At my level, I am supposed to have a success rate of 90%. In actuality, I have only a success rate of somewhere between 60 and 70%. [something is screwy with the math] If a repair fails, the part is completely lost. The quality of the repair is also generated randomly. An item might go from 16% to 100% in one click. It's just as likely to go 16% to 19 to 45 to 78 to 100%, requiring 4 clicks. [1 of which will probably fail]The ability to repair rather than purchase new parts should improve the profitability of ""flipping"" vehicles, but this system is a liability. I have to save my game prior to making repairs because the math is wack. It takes about 90 secs to get back to my original point in the game, on a reload. I've had 3 out of 4 fail, more than once. Imagine having an order to repair 6 panels and half were destroyed in the repair process. The auction house needs work. This is your only source of vehicles to purchase. Most look like they were dredged from a swamp, somewhere. They are offered with a 1,2,3 or 4 out 5 stars rating. This affects the entire vehicle. You can't buy a car with a bad motor and good panels. If the car is rated a 2, every part on the car will be less than 40% quality, meaning all parts have to be repaired [see above] or replaced. I wouldn't mind this so much, if I coud get a vehicle at a decent price. But there's a ""shill"" bidder who drives the price of every vehicle beyond what I think it's worth. I've watched bot bidders get ""deals"". I've seen cars go through with only 1 bid. The instant I get in on the bidding, it's 40 % higher. I always have to pay more for a vehicle than I want, but it's the only way to get a car to build. When you've finished your build, you can sell it for a fixed price determined by some obscure method. You can't sell it at auction.Added 3/17 - 2 other things I should add. Though you can customize your shop. you cannot clean the floor. It is covered with stains and oil puddles. I'd be ashamed to work in a shop as unkempt as this. The second item is the advertising placed in your shop. Although it dresses the shop up with some color, it is advertising, nonetheless, aimed at you, the player. A recent update, did little for gameplay but updated the adverts in the garage. I'm just sayin'.If you get it cheap enough, it's fun building/racing cars. Just don't expect a lot of depth.			"

Wid da sick muscle car you can get some good wheelies like Charlie the fat plum on the YZ, get me fam? alright the game has some bare cars, with DLC's its even better, still havent got to test them all since im poor and live in Diggy but hoping to get them since they go cheap on sale, just a shame you cant find it in British Heart foundation.Also RIP Toms grandad, true manny on the map 0161.

												As a car modder myself,  it's a fun game to play. Well it won't make you an expert mechanic, it can help you learn the basics. The game can get repetitive, but the DLC's have been a good refresher and I'm enjoying the last Total Modificiations with drag cars, slammed cars and engine swaps. It keeps me coming back to play more. This is definitely a step up from the 2014 version.			"

												Well where do I start? It can be huge fun and it can a bit frustrating if you want to know how to take an engine apart in a simulation get it. It is a knee deeper in technical terms compared to 2014. Less duct work but diagnostics is harder. Still it is fun taking a whole engine apart replacing one piston, you can do it time and time again. The great features I like are :Engines are done superbly to the detail.Body work a new feature also includes a paint job. Not bad. Auctions - I love those I am already building a full garage of carsThe developers - I´m not sure if it was me but they fixed a very frustrating issue of having to go to the computer when you want to order a spare part by adding a tablet. Cars - many of them resemble the real life ones I found even the one I own. You can get from old american muscle cars through japanese cars, german premium cars, SUV, to classics like Maluch and that one is in real detail I had some fun getting that to work. Dear developers hand on heart do you own it? Music - quite original I like dubstep hehe :) (not just dubstep there of course)Workshop expansions - nice you can unlock a testing rig and a paint shop. Practical details - clock showing the current time for example. And as for most games there is also a huge space for improvement, according to steam forums all the things I miss in the game (tuning, proper race track, multiplayer etc.) are being worked on.			"

The engine / suspension detail in this game if pretty accurate to the real thing.Having striped a small block 350 chevy engine myself I can honestly say this game has nailed it in terms of the processes you have to go through to rebuild an engine.The only thing it is missing is the - Cursing at stripped and rounded bolts, Being covered head to toe in oil and other crap, The yelling at sezied parts And the luanching of tools after hours of frustraion! hahahaOther than that 10/10 love it.I can't wait for extra dlc's with more cars variants and more complex engines v10's / v12's / flat fours and six's / inline six's *possibilities are endless*			"

I quite enjoy not being told what parts are in need of replacing and have to dig in the car, or use your tools, to find what's wrong. Even the tools, test drive, and test path doesn't tell you what's all wrong, and I, weirly, enjoy that!My tutorial went like this: ""Here's your first job! Here's wat's wrong! Have fun!"" And that was it, I had to find it! This game doesn't hold your hand and show you want's wrong, you will need to find it!10/10!			"

CMS 2015 is what i was waiting for, i'll be honest in this review.being a car enthusiast, i think CMS 2015 is great, for someone who enjoys cars and likes tycoon games, this is perfect. but, for someone that has a certain knowledge in cars and mechanics, this is somewhat easy. i think that they should add in CMS 2016 or hopefully in a update, difficulty levels. and more complicated problems, (Gaskets, Valves, and actual breaks, or option to disable the way that the parts look rusty depending  the life% of the part. Graphics Quality is great for the price but yes, you should buy this game. it is enjoyable. Buy parts, repair, collect.  and i'm not there yet, but body fixing is also a great idea. like buying used cars, fixing them and re-sell them. great idea!Will buy the 2016. especially for that price. cheap/good/fun/			"

												I got last years game and decided to buy the 2015 version straight away. It's a good game!. Sometime a job will come along in the game and your be taking a lot of the car apart just to find that one faulty part. A basic knowlegde of cars is needed but you will learn fairly quickly about how to take the parts on and off and in what order.  Everything in the game is very decent or better, the sound. the graphics, the gameplay and so far i haven't come across any bugs. There's quite a few extra 'help' in the game like the OBD scanner or a test brake/suspension place in your garage but they cost one experience upgrade which is 1,000 XP in the game, It takes quiet a while to level up, so there's no way your get everything without some hours put in. My biggest problem with the game is the repairs list. You can only see what you need to replace on a list while near the car, once you go to the computer to buy new parts that list is gone. It can be very annoying traveling back and forth to the car to see what you need or you have forgotten. I do know once you unlock repair the items on a bench yourself, you won't need the list as much but i feel the repair list should always be available by pressing O, no matter where you are. Overall i'd give this game a 8/10.			"

												CMS 2015 basically takes the 2014 version and improves it. They have different vehicles but more of them and somewhat more detail such as body panels, radiators and fans etc that sort of thing. I have enjoyed playing it though imo there doesn't seem to be much of a challenge financially as it's pretty much a continuous upward climb towards riches. At 9000 xp (7ish hrs for me) you unlock the abillity to buy cars in various conditions and fix them up which is fairly rewarding and has greater financial risk/reward if you don't manage your funds.All in all I wish the game was more detailed (ex. piston heads don't require removing bolts from underneath to remove, many bolted parts are simplified, no fasteners on body parts, only fluid you deal with is oil, so no coolant, trans, gas, wiper fluids etc all omitted, no hoses, no tuning, no interior parts, no glass repair etc. However it is still a fun game, and somewhat educational though simplified.TLDR; If you are interested in car mechanics you'll like this game, it isn't ultra detailed but it has enough to be fun and challenging at times. Do not expect 100% accuracy to real life.			"

												This game surpasses the original by a large margin. There are a few annoyances, such as:1. Needing to make sure you put replacement parts in the exact spaces they should go. for example, rocker arms. There are 16 of them on a vehicle, if you need to replace 3 of them, you may need to remember exactly where the 3 brand new ones are supposed to go.2. Insane amount of XP required to buy the parking garage, so you can buy cars at auction to flip. 3. Getting some jobs, where you need to paint the the car, even though you still need one or two thousand XP in order to unlock the paint shop.4. A few very minor bugs which happen where it doesn't let you work on anything, because it doesn't think you are looking from the correct position on the car (like looking in the engine bay, to work on the engine).5. Dumbed down some of the dual parts. such as suspension arms, you buy one type of suspension arm, and it works on both the right, and left side of the vehicle, which should normally be impossible.The positive definitely outweigh the negative on this one though. You can take apart far more pieces to the cars than the original game, the parts website has been upgraded with some search filters, and a functioning search box, to find exactly what you're looking for, continuous game play, and you decide what jobs to work on, and when. If you want to work on random job, just go to the phone and pick one of the four options, or after you get your parking garage, you can buy a vehicle at an auction, fix it up, and sell it for a profit.

												Being early in the release of the game and with dlc on the way, this game has impressed me and got me hooked, waiting for more...The detail of the cars is amazing, and while I thought it would be boring, I found myself hooked playing it for the last 4 days.  Troubleshooting and repairing vehicles is recreated in this game, however to a slightly limited scale. If I had to nit pick problems with their product here, it would be only that it is too basic. The idea that you canrebuild a car with a ratchet and socket is unrealistic, and I would like it if they added usable hand and power tools in the future. First and foremost in my mind should be a torque wrench, where you have to look up torque specs and sequence (could be done using the computer?) and having to set the torque value on the wrench and torque in sequence. welders and paint guns could also be neat to use when doing body work or painting. I think automatic transmissions would also be a must add.Im sure some of these features will come in time, but as of right now, im fairly pleased with the game. Id recommend it to any car guy or gear head in an instant.			"

One cool thing to add may be an Engine Hoist and Engine Build Stand to allow for out of car builds and placements. Also color customization for more parts ie: Rims, Tinted windows, Brake Calipers, Grilles, Engine Covers, along with other things. I know its a mechanic sim but mechanic Customization sim?? May add some more variation. Also the 1/4 mile track and tuning would be cool to bring back. Over all, GREAT GAME!			"

												Being one who had purchased Car Mechanic 2014 and felt like i had wasted my money.  I was highly skeptical about the 2015 version.   After doing a lot of reading of reviews and such i took the plunge and went ahead and purchased 2015.  I gotta say I am quite happy I did.  Love the changes made to the game.   My only complaint would be lack of cars.  Hoping in the future that will be changed with DLC as well as mods.  But overall I am loving it.  I would would have to say this is a must have for anyone who enjoyed games like Gearhead Garage one of my all time favs.			"

												I played CMS 2014, and it missed features and was way too easy. CMS 2015 is what i was waiting for, i'll be honest in this review.being a car enthusiast, i think CMS 2015 is great, for someone who enjoys cars and likes tycoon games, this is perfect. but, for someone that has a certain knowledge in cars and mechanics, this is somewhat easy. i think that they should add in CMS 2016 or hopefully in a update, difficulty levels. and more complicated problems, (Gaskets, Valves, and actual breaks, or option to disable the way that the parts look rusty depending  the life% of the part. Graphics Quality is great for the price but yes, you should buy this game. it is enjoyable. Buy parts, repair, collect.  and i'm not there yet, but body fixing is also a great idea. like buying used cars, fixing them and re-sell them. great idea!Will buy the 2016. especially for that price. cheap/good/fun/			"

												I got last years game and decided to buy the 2015 version straight away. It's a good game!. Sometime a job will come along in the game and your be taking a lot of the car apart just to find that one faulty part. A basic knowlegde of cars is needed but you will learn fairly quickly about how to take the parts on and off and in what order.  Everything in the game is very decent or better, the sound. the graphics, the gameplay and so far i haven't come across any bugs. There's quite a few extra 'help' in the game like the OBD scanner or a test brake/suspension place in your garage but they cost one experience upgrade which is 1,000 XP in the game, It takes quiet a while to level up, so there's no way your get everything without some hours put in. My biggest problem with the game is the repairs list. You can only see what you need to replace on a list while near the car, once you go to the computer to buy new parts that list is gone. It can be very annoying traveling back and forth to the car to see what you need or you have forgotten. I do know once you unlock repair the items on a bench yourself, you won't need the list as much but i feel the repair list should always be available by pressing O, no matter where you are. Overall i'd give this game a 8/10.			"

												CMS 2015 basically takes the 2014 version and improves it. They have different vehicles but more of them and somewhat more detail such as body panels, radiators and fans etc that sort of thing. I have enjoyed playing it though imo there doesn't seem to be much of a challenge financially as it's pretty much a continuous upward climb towards riches. At 9000 xp (7ish hrs for me) you unlock the abillity to buy cars in various conditions and fix them up which is fairly rewarding and has greater financial risk/reward if you don't manage your funds.All in all I wish the game was more detailed (ex. piston heads don't require removing bolts from underneath to remove, many bolted parts are simplified, no fasteners on body parts, only fluid you deal with is oil, so no coolant, trans, gas, wiper fluids etc all omitted, no hoses, no tuning, no interior parts, no glass repair etc. However it is still a fun game, and somewhat educational though simplified.TLDR; If you are interested in car mechanics you'll like this game, it isn't ultra detailed but it has enough to be fun and challenging at times. Do not expect 100% accuracy to real life.			"

												This game surpasses the original by a large margin. There are a few annoyances, such as:1. Needing to make sure you put replacement parts in the exact spaces they should go. for example, rocker arms. There are 16 of them on a vehicle, if you need to replace 3 of them, you may need to remember exactly where the 3 brand new ones are supposed to go.2. Insane amount of XP required to buy the parking garage, so you can buy cars at auction to flip. 3. Getting some jobs, where you need to paint the the car, even though you still need one or two thousand XP in order to unlock the paint shop.4. A few very minor bugs which happen where it doesn't let you work on anything, because it doesn't think you are looking from the correct position on the car (like looking in the engine bay, to work on the engine).5. Dumbed down some of the dual parts. such as suspension arms, you buy one type of suspension arm, and it works on both the right, and left side of the vehicle, which should normally be impossible.The positive definitely outweigh the negative on this one though. You can take apart far more pieces to the cars than the original game, the parts website has been upgraded with some search filters, and a functioning search box, to find exactly what you're looking for, continuous game play, and you decide what jobs to work on, and when. If you want to work on random job, just go to the phone and pick one of the four options, or after you get your parking garage, you can buy a vehicle at an auction, fix it up, and sell it for a profit.

												Incredibly fun game providing a good load of knowledge about car mechanics - instant fav!I remember playing Street Rod on C64 a long time ago where I could tinker around the car in a very limited way and I loved it. I'm interested in classic cars (now we have the second classic in my family) and that involves lots of real life mechanical repairs and/or adjustments which made me really curious about how to deal with certain mechanical problems. I'm extremely happy to have this game and getting a better overall view of the whole picture through it. Now it' much easier for me to approach towards any upcoming problmes of my classic :)CMS 2015 is literally an interactive learning material combined with game elements. Great thing, don't miss it!Update: I got my first complete restoration finished: a ""Bolt Reptilia"" (which is a Corvette literally) - it was a frenetic experience. Taking it apart bit by bit, remove every single part possible and rebuild it to a shiny 100% condition is just like a pilgrimage. The chrome is fantasic under the hood! And also I guess this is how far the game can go really but repeating this over and over again is a joy.			"

												As a car modder myself,  it's a fun game to play. Well it won't make you an expert mechanic, it can help you learn the basics. The game can get repetitive, but the DLC's have been a good refresher and I'm enjoying the last Total Modificiations with drag cars, slammed cars and engine swaps. It keeps me coming back to play more. This is definitely a step up from the 2014 version.			"

												I know nothing about cars other than my general knowledge of mechanical engineering. Cars were never an interest to me, and if something is wrong with my car, I always take it to someone to fix- never would I do it myself. Not even an oil change.That introduction aside, I LOVE this game. Even without that real-world interest level, this game is polished, sharp, and always has you eyeing goals in the future without holding your hand.  How rewarding it was when I was first repairing some more difficult issues, and without knowing where some parts were located, stripped down the entire engine of a car looking for those parts only to have to reassemble the whole thing- and get it right! It really is a great balance between simulating the work of a mechanic and gamifying it so that it's not quite so world-dreary and labor intensive.I am quickly banking cash and gaining experience with excitement, as soon in game I'll be able to buy a beat-up car at auction and fix it up to resell for huge profit as a side project in my garage.If you don't know cars, but enjoy simulations, progress, and have a bit of a mechanical-puzzle oriented mind, this is a very, very well done game and I highly recommend it. I may not be a mechanic after this, but at least my eyes won't cross in ignorance when someone says ""catalytic converter"" to me at the garage.Side note: I love the music in this game too. A great mix for working away at the cars in game.			"

												This game is fun and a good tool for locating and replacing parts of a car.  I have some experience in auto repair and other misc. hardware as I'm a maintenance mechanic for the USPS.  Since I'm no expert in repairing cars and I like to learn, I enjoy this game and I've learned quite a bit from the repair jobs I've done so far.At the time of this review I'm only a few hours into it but already I notice some things I would like to see added for extra realism.  For example, hoses (air, radiator and others) battery cables and other major wires, various fluids like washer, brake, transmission etc. and gaskets in the engine would be a nice touch. Something else that would help with the immersion would be to have different size wrenches and sockets with ratchets to use on different size bolts and nuts. I think it's important to have a lot of different parts for the different cars as most cars take different parts in real life; at least for the larger more important parts.  That would be nice to have to look up the make/model in the computer to get the right part. :)  Honestly I don't think it wouldn't be that hard to add that if only they added part numbers to the car part inventory.  Finally I would like to see options of stock, upgraded and high performance parts so you can upgrade the cars you buy.  Overall though the game has potential to take many hours of fun and learning.  Recommended.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. You can get rid of almost every part of your car, test your cars, sell them, even go to the Auction House and buy rusted, busted cars. The best part: Fix them and sell them for a WHOLE CHUNK OF MONEY. Also, there is a Garage, Paint Shop, and Diagnostic Test for your cars when you have enough XP. Store your cars in the Garage. Paint your cars in the Paint Shop. Test your car faster on the Diagnostic Test. I'd recommend this game to you. This game may seem a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth the $19.99 you have to pay. I'd buy it if I were you.			"

												Game is okay, spent some time with it and not too shabby though the features beyond picking and placing car parts is extremely limited. Processes in the game become obsolete as you gain money (get to the buying cars stage and you never have to go back to diagnosing or repairing other people's cars, just get yours to 100%). 4/10As far as advertising/exploitative marketing practices go, steer clear of obviously lacking expansion packs. The new Bentley pack has 5 reviews that share similar timestamps, similar usernames, no time played on the game, and all positive statements. Buyer beware.			"

												This is a fantastic game. If you like to work on cars.If you played car mechanic sim 2014, you know what you're in for, but now engines are detailed. Pistons, Crankshafts, Pushrods, Camshafts, all can now be disassembled. There's also bodywork that can be fixed, more engine configurations, This is essentially a direct upgrade of 2014. There's now an auction mode, and the devs have been stedialy releasing content as the game goes along.The only negative is you still can't rotate the camera on an axis.If you like working on cars, This game is worth a buy.

												It's even more realistic than Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. There's no hand-holding, but that said... it's FUN! Yes, you may have to do a Google search for a part here or there on your first few jobs, but it's an excellent learning tool to develop a basic understanding of critical car components.The controls are incredibly intelligent and easy, and the ability to buy upgrades every 1,000xp is an excellent addition.I really hope they do a Car Mechanic Simulator 2016, and I hope they go even deeper than before.This is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played.

												Not accurate and too easy.This game seems to be aimed at people how dont know anything about cars, the type of people who wouldn't play this.this game is lacking many features, there is no wiring, no abs sensors, the engine bays are pretty much empty, no wipers or wiper moters, no interior lights, no exterior light bulbs, no fuses, no airbags or other SRS systems, no MULTI-METER no oscilloscope you can only use 2-post ramps, and you cannot open the gear box to work on the transmission you just have to replace the whole unit, same goes for all other parts they cannot be taken apart, there are many other things missing but it would take me all day to list them.BUT, for somone who wants a basic game its not bad, the graphics are pretty decent but the gameplay is lacking and I hope that a new verson of this game comes out where all the parts are present and where you can strip parts to work on them. Bare in mind I played on the harder mode the game offers so I'm going to imagine that the easy mode holds your hand.But I'm still recomending the game as it's clearly intended for children who would be overwelmed by too many parts.

												9.5/10!This game is a 100% upgrade from the already good Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. I played a few hours and realized, It has hardly any loading screens! Also the variety of cars is a step up too, Plus the many more detailed parts that have been added its like your working a real car. In this installment of the series you can have 2 cars in your shop at a time (3 If you know how to do it ;) You also can paint cars and replace the body panels as well. So what you waiting for? Go grab a copy.(PS: I have played the game for 7-8 Hours its just I play offline and steam doesn't keep track that way.)			"

He was a total gear-nut, and his idea of a great evening (or morning, day, night, ha) was to take a coffee out into his garage and poke around his vehicles.I never did aquire his love of mechanics, I instantly gravitated to the computers and electronics, being born in 1971.This game may get me a little closer to working in my own garage, just like dad would have wanted to see. Even a little demystification goes a long ways.So thanks!			"

												So I've recently been playing My Summar Car (GO BUY THAT)... And coming from that to this, everything just felt a bit too simple, a bit too automated and a bit too 'spoon fed'. I'll admit I haven't played this for long, but I've played it for long enough to see how it could get repetitive.The thing that immediately turned me off is how everything is just automated. I feel like the experience would be a lot more immersive if you had to physically move parts, and generally if the jobs you recieved were longer as a result of this, but more rewarding as a trade off.If you're looking for something similar, but will give you something that has more of a sense of value than an XP/Cash number by the time you're done with it, check out My Summer Car.

												It's fun to hear the problem of the car (""rattling noise from the engine bay""), diagnose it regarding to the problem and then fix it. Also you got to upgrade your garage with a diagnose-track, a lot of utilities (OBD-Diagnose, multimeter, pressurepump,..) and you can even buy and sell cars later in the game. You learn some things about the parts of the engine, the chassis and so on. It's quite well made and more or less comparable to real life situations.BUT The game just advances waaay too slow, it includes a lot of grinding for experience-points and you see yourself just fixing the same thing over and over again just to get that paintjob-room and in the end it's not that special.It's also not really rewarding as it just takes too much effort to also get the little things. + I'm really tired of changing the f-ing tyres (haha).I paid 4€ for it, I would say I'd recommend it for that price because it kept me busy for one day but after that I couldn't really motivate myself again to continue.But as the normal price is 20€ I can't recommend it at that point.

												The game is nice, enjoyable, fun and I really like the level of details being just right without being way too much nor not touching base. The fewer screws from the last version is surely welcome as is the much better graphics. The bad however vastly outnumber the good about this game.The absolute worst thing is the repetition. I bought the game for the promise of buying broken cars, fixing them and selling them back but guess what, that requires 9000 EXP and 50,000 USD to unlock. EXP is gathered snail-slow, 100 per fixed car and 1 for installing or uninstalling an item. That's 10+ hours for me and I'm still on 6,500 EXP doing the exact same thing on each car over and over again. In a way I guess the developers knew there isn't much variety in the game itself so the flooded it in a way that it needs forever to get you anywhere.I have a decent computer and still the game takes 15-20 seconds to load a car! I'm not talking startup time, each time you take a job, that's the waiting time before the car appears in my garage. Taking the car for a test drive, same wait. It's really frustrating.Taking off the wheels is driving me crazy. I am aware that most car fixes need the wheels removed but the game takes it to a crazy level. If there are 4 steering/suspension problems in a car, rest assured each is on a different wheel. Same thing for timing belts and things that require a lot of unscrewing to reach. 2 pistons on a V engine? Almost certainly on different engine-body parts. Again I think this is intentional to make the game play longer for lack of original content.Overall the game is good, I welcome the mechanical simulation part, quite nice but the game content itself is very short if the repetition is at least limited and the game should be priced according to this criteria, the current price is a highway robbery for the actual content.

(Again, I'm sure it'll get patched)Some annoynances that'll amplify in the late game. Such as trying to memorize a rather large order list on the computer.Very much a niche game.Overall, this game is an easy buy for me. The price, the devs, and the quality speaks volumes to that. HOWEVER, I caution anyone thinking of buying this game to do your homework first! It is a point and click style. Very Niche. And nothing you learn from the game will help you fix your own car.

												WOW - talk about exceeding expectations!I was very reluctant to buy this game so close to it's release.... the screenshots and description sounded great, but I was quite honestly - half-expecting to be disappointed.  It was a pleasant surprise to discover that this game was not only bug-free (at least for me, during the 30ish hours of gameplay) - but also a LOT of fun!The game is a very good high-level simulation.  It started off a bit slow, and there really wasn't much of a tutorial (at least not that I experienced) but the game is very intuitive.  I love the fact that you can upgrade your tools (although there is a limited number of options and once I maxed it, I wasn't sure what to do with the extra exp points).  The upgrades are actually useful (i.e. quicker assembly/disassembly of parts, increase chance to repair parts, diagnostic tools that tell you the ""condition"" of parts in the car)  I also loved the fact that you can go to the auction house and buy cars which you can then fix up and either collect or choose to sell.  There is something very satisfying about buying an older beater covered in rust and dents and restoring it with shiny new parts.  You can also ""test drive"" your cars - which I also thought was neat.TLDR - Great simulation game that smoothly delivers what it promises in the description (which is a rarity these days). Seems to be bug free and has a very intuitive UI - although I found I had to ""discover"" most of the things myself since there didn't seem to be much of a tutorial.  This is a real time-sink and I've caught myself a few times now going to the auction house, buying an old beater and meaning to restore just a portion of it... but once you start and then see another rusting component that you just have to replace (and have gotten so quick and good at it)... it really does draw you into spending far more time than planned.... If being a mechanic was this much fun and satisfying (and no grease on my hands) then I could see being a mechanic ;-)Definitely worth the price tag, and I hope that they intend to build upon this game (it seems to me like there are some areas in the game that were left intentionally empty - maybe for future expansions?)I'm happy with this purchase and will be keeping my eyes open for more games from these devs!

												This is a fantastic game! Very addictive. You just want to fix one last problem before you stop playing. But after you fix it, you end up going on to the next issue. I decided to test my knowledge a little and ditch the tutorial. I didn't do too bad, but I messed up when I first started playing. They should be more specific in the description of the issue. The first problem I addressed in game was the front wheel hub. Well, teaching myself how to play, this simple task took a little longer than it should have. After getting the front wheel and suspension all taken apart and getting to the wheel hub, I realized it was for the other ♥♥♥♥ing side (-.-)12/10 would recommend and I will be investing a lot of time into this game. If you like mechanical stuff or are just interested in seeing how cars work, do yourself a favor and get this game.			"

												Huge improvement over 2014 and I like the fact that you can now have three cars in your garage at once instead of one. Its also nice that there is no more loading screens after you completed a mission and going on to the next one. I also like the new Visual Tuning DLC Pack so it is now time for a Performance Parts DLC Pack and also bringing performance tuning back like in 2014 and a DLC where you can do a 1/4 with the cars and a 4X4 pack like in 2014. But other than that great game. Its also nice that you can now buy upgrades for your garage. The only thing that is a downfall for me is that you cant work your way up to having better garages and that you use one garage all the time and also the fact that you need 9000 XP Points before you can sell cars on auction and lastly that it seems like all the wiring has been removed from the engine bay and that the parts are no longer connected to each other like for example the air filter is no longer connected with a pipe from the air filter to the engine etc. 8/10 :)			"

												Ca Mechanic Sim 2015 is one of those games that you don't think you'll understand or do well at simply because you only know the basics or nothing about cars.  This game is very easy to pick up, and has things to help show you what you should be doing.  The game goes on forever, however, the missions do get repetitive, and after unlocking everything, there's nothing left to save up for.CMs 15 is probably one of my top favorite games.  It's really relaxing and fun to just mess with cars.			"

Next time you make a simulator could you include everything that is missing like brake lines, electrical wiring, speed sensors, knock sensors, computers, chips, o2 sensors, wheel speed sensors, brake fluid, tranny fluid, diff oils, torque specs, sequence tightening when necessary like on engine heads ect.**PLEASE ADD SLI AND CROSSFIRE COMPATABILITY**			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a great game if you like to tear apart cars and then put them back together! I really like CM15 more than CM14 the graphics and abilities are much better in CM15. If you would like a somewhat insight to what it's like to work on cars, this game is good for that although it is lacking some parts such as gaskets, wires and a few other things that are found under the hood of common cars. I would recommend playing this game because it is fun and there is no need to cheat since you can earn money quickly, and grow your business fast, having 3 car slots open keeps you moving right along and a to do list it helpful to keep you wondering where in the car you will be next!

												I have been playing this for a good few days now, and It is a good game to kill bordam but that is it, its missing so many basic things out even a noob like myself knows, and some parts in this game should be mixable as they are in real life, we should also have sinbins for lets say spraying a custoemrs car another colour, more cars for the default game is really needed, sorry but making us by a few cars as DLC's is a rip off, open the game to the moders also you have a hole useless modding option.Custom options like better paint, vinals, inside of the car, better wheels and wheel colours, lights and so on, your mean to be simulating, why havenet any of these cars come in smashed, crash damage is a comman problem and a RSA car wouldn't come with a list of problems you would have to find them and see if the car was safe, in the UK you need a MOT also maybe adding options like this in to the game I am sure the US also has a car safty check it must past per year to drive.Its a OK game but thats all it is, its not really a Simulator as its not really simulating anything, Also stop making ever car have the same frame or engin, work on your moddles ALOT, add more flaver, maybe even add hotrodding and low ridding options to the game to make older recks worth restoring.

												A good relaxing game that can get a bit tiresome and repetitive. This game gets far better once you are able to go to auctions and buy cars to restore and customise. A big recommendation that makes the game better is to go into the game files and rename all the cars to their real life counterparts, it just gives you a better idea of what you are working on. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 without DLC and a 8/10 with DLC just for the extra vehicles as they are a bit more well known such as the Ford Mustang.  "

												I'm not sure why I got this game as I have little knowledge with cars beyond regular maintenace. At first it was a little intimidating working on my first few orders but it starts you off with simple things like replacing Fuel, Air, and Oil filters, and other simple tasks. Then you begin to work with different vehicles and much more complicated issues where you will need to competely break down the powertrain.Of course it's much more simple and MUCH faster than in real life, but it's been a lot of fun so far. Especially with the unlockable upgrades such as unlocking a Paint room, and getting more tools for diagnosising problems, and being able to repair parts efficently without ordering new ones.I'm still pretty new to the game with a few hours of gameplay, but I think it's a lot of fun. The visuals are great, the sounds of a car lift going up and down are great, as well as the music.			"

												Uh... What happened?The game used to be one of my go-tos for a while. It was relaxing, it was simple to learn, and it was free of bugs... Ever since this last update it has become a nightmare. My floor turns black and lags the game when 2 or 3 cars are in the garage, loading customer cars has froze and crashed the game, making me lose considerable progress, orders from the previous job are now showing up in my current customer's car, and my paychecks for fixing people's cars is cut short because of this. I don't know if this is an everyone problem, or if this just happening to me, but it's absolutely gamebreaking. Not to mention, the Mac version has always had poor optimization in the first place, and lags a considerable amount, while my computer can run much more CPU-heavy games quicker. Maps take years to load, and even on the lowest settings the game still runs at about 29-40 FPS jumping up and down at random. Why? I have 8 GB of ram and can handle much more than CMS as a whole, so I don't see why it is hard to run.			"

But on to the game. Its fun, interesting, and overall very educational on cars. I expected much from this game seeing how good the CMS 2014 game. But i was wondering (seeing how some sequals arent good) that this would be a flop. But it turned out great. Graphics are good, FPS is good, and most is good. The only thing i dislike about the game is the camera in inspect mode is a little wonky at times but i get by. Overall i would give this game a 9.5/10.

												Great Learning too. Teaches you how to locate parts, and what order you need to dismantle things to replace a part.I am almost a trained certified mechanic now and plan to open a business soon.10/10 rating. Dont expect it to be a fun game. Boring as heck, but teaches you a lot if you are a beginner.If you know absolutely nothing about cars, youre gonna have a BAD time.			"

												This game is really fun!phone rings, and jobs come in and then you can accept or decline jobs.for example i had a job that needed a new ENGINE BLOCK!i literally striped the engine and some of the suspension to replace it.took me about a good half hour to 45 mins if you take your time not to make any mistakes.game is so detailed and for all of you petrol heads, its a damn blast 1 con --->>> not many cars to start with (its only been released to days prior to this review)			"

												First of all, being a Car DIY person, I do know a fair bit about cars.  It is also the reason why I bought this game in the first place.Car components are held together like puzzles.  Being a car mechanics (in this game), you need to figure out how to take components apart, inspect them and replace if necessary.  At first, it was kind of fun.  Especially it takes away the problems in real world e.g: cables in the way, not enough rooms to work with, bolts rusted up or even strips away.However, after about 20 hours of gameplay, car fixing is so repetitive and the fun kind of disappeared.  In my save, I had 250K cash trying to figure out what to do with it...  Sure you can buy cars from auction, refurbish it, then take it to drag race but that's about it.The other thing I don't like is loading time.  I had this game on SSD (8Gb ram, i5 4570 CPU) but each time I switch from location to location it will take 30 seconds to load.  Its like from Main menu into game 30 seconds (your garage), then from your garage to auction house, another 30 seconds.  I felt like I'm playing this game on CD or something.Game music is kind of cool initially, but after 5 hours or so, you would want to mute in-game music and play your own stuffs.Overall, I do have a bit of fun with this game but game-life is a bit short.  Consider I bought this game while it was on sales (75% off) I think this game is reasonable.  The DLC tries to expand the game-life a bit, but personally, I don't think it succeeded.			"

												Ahh, another year, another CMSI was looking foward for this (CMS 2k15). In all honesty, the game blew me away.Not only modern day shitboxes are on the game, but classic muscle cars are on here, which is right up my alley. They also grew a pair of balls by adding a V8 and making an L4 with and without DOHC (Dual Over-Head Cam). The only, and I mean ONLY bad thing about this game is the XP system. Final gameplay rating, 9/10.I also gave a brief description on realism of the parts on CMS2k14, so might as well make one here amiorite?Anywho, this game blew CMS'14 out of the water. They moved the oil filter to the bottom, which is what I stated. Not only that, but they added more parts to work on, including ABS, even MORE rubber bushings, sterring rack, and much, much more. I'd rate the realism 10/10.Final rating: 9.5/10. I highly suggest getting this for people into cars, or just want to learn some basics, like oil changes, brakes, etc.			"

I love that the Dev's made this version to except new cars in the main game and not be made to play sepret expantion alone... I love that the Dev's are still adding thing to the base game such as the Tablet, new car and music for the radio. They took what they learned from the first game and the feed back from the fans and made a much better game. Rock on Dev's. I backed you in kickstarter and would do so agian with confadents. :)			"

												At first, the game is quite fun and gives you something to do, but later on it's just all exactly the same and gets boring pretty quickly. I do reccomend this game, but only at a sale price of over half off because fixing cars doesn't get different once you get through all the things to fix. Everything to fix just gets recycled with either different cars or different objectives for a car. Also, if there were more stock cars where you don't have to buy as DLC, having more to do than just fix cars, and being able to do more customization would make the game a lot more satisfying.			"

												I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work. If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.			"

												At first, it was hard to figure out the controls and what everything was, but once you know what you're doing, this game is extrememly fun. It's a great game for car enthusiasts and is relaxing to play casually if you just want to take your time repairing and driving. The only bad part is even with the 4 dlc I own, there isn't very much content for replayability or incentive to progress after about 25 hours of playing.			"

												Okay so i have been thinking a long time before i thought about writing this review because i want it to be as truthfull as possible. So i have around 33 hours + on this game as i am writing at the moment and i think that if you are looking for a car game where you want to tune and fix cars, you are kinda on track and off track.Because CMS 15 is about fixing cars, but there is so little tuning options and customising options when it comes down to it. As well, when i started this game i bought because of the restoration part... But i got dissapointed, there is endless of fixing cars on contract before you can even get to an auction, you need way to much xp to unlock everything as well. If i could choose i would have wanted to do it more simple like in real life, that you have to pay and expand you way, and not with xp and pay. And except that there is a lot of cars to choose from which is a big +, but it's kinda all the same, because there is not much diffrent motors or car parts. And it explains itself because it is a Car Mechanic game.So what is the Pros and Cons?Pros--Many diffrent car models-Fantastic looking Grapichs-It is what it is supposed to  be-You have a lot of diffrent things that you can do on a car-A lot of rimsCons-You need some damn good patience-It circulates in the same jobs and same parts all the time with small exeption of diffrent parts to switch out-Have to get Xp to unlock, paintshop, dyno, test areas and auction house, as well to pay money for service areas-To little custom car parts, and diffrent ways to tune.-Having to buy all the content because it is DLC and not just normal contentAnd that was it, this is my opinion the game could be much more but it is what it is			"

												Game really good you can learn a lot...A+ but I think they could have made it even better...I have the feeling that they started selling the game too soon, they could have worked on it a little more. I finished the game in 32 hours...and when I say finished I mean I repaired every car possible and I have lots of money...I love the Idea with the garage, buy cars etc...but come on...the test track is a joke...they could have done something better..having more cars would be great...I got bored repairing the same cars all over again.

												While this game is fun, it gets to repeatitive. Unlocking harder jobs means trudging through many simple ones that seem to become more the same. Plus, unlocking all the equipment you would like to use means leveling up 1000xp for each unlock. I've been a mechanic for 16 years, went to school for it. Yet some objects are out of place or even missing. No battery cables to disconnect, not being able to know the status of a part without taking it to a test track even though many parts CAN be checked on a lift such as ball joints and tie rod ends. The worst part is the fact that this game wouldn't work on my old PC even though it met the requirements. All because it was a Win 7 32-bit PC. Now that Im running win 10 64-bit, I realize the game wasn't worth the $10 I paid.			"

												Another great edition to an already good game especially with the DLC's.The one complaint I have though is I think this game is meant for only high end computers because if you have a slow computer you have to tone down the graphics so much it may remove some enjoyment.If this was a racing game I can understand why they would want such high detail graphics,however considering this is more of a puzzle game it does not make sense.If you have a slow computer CMS2014 may be a better choice.

												I'd recommend buying all of the DLCs just for the fun of this game cause it adds in more variety. However, this game needs: Trading cards, and badges Achievements! More things to do with cars (other than auctioning them, testing, etc) such as derbies, races, shows, and events Have your own name for your garage Change the weathers for more fun experimental simulations during test drives Option to turn off menu animations (mine always lag but the game runs just fine after getting into the actual game itself) Possibly have your own character just to fit in the mechanic side of it (and possible customise the character with car related stuff and more) Possibly have more game modes (such as time challenges, online racing, etc) Maybe have our own office to decorate with car related stuff and earned trophies and more (if racing gets added in) The mechanic doesn't always working in their garages, they work at pitstops and such!That's all this game really needs. Great potential for car lovers! Also, add more modern cars (McLaren, Tesla, etc)Subtitles if possible!			"

												i bought this game to purely learn about the inside of a car and to see how to replace things like a real mechanic,  and guys i will say I'm impressed.   I've worked on real cars before and this replicates it to the bone marrow.  This game has a lot of scenarios so you basicly figure out any type of problem that could happen to your car.  One other thing the creator actually makes you figure out where the wared out parts are.  There is no guide line to tell you where the part is located.  You either will have to undo the car peace by peace to see where the malfunctioned part is or simply look on the internet to see where its located at and then do it in the game and trust me your going to learn a freakin lot on how to do stuff yourself.  For christ sakes if you just want to learn how to do a perfect oil change.  Get this game!			"

												I had no knowledge about car parts or any mechanic stuff, i bought this because simply i love cars. And oh boy i got hooked. And here's why i love this game so much:Story:You're a car mechanic and you fix'em cars.Presentation:This game didn't really go for photorealism despite being a simulator, and some parts look really funky at times, but most of the time it doesn't really matter because this game runs really smooth and you don't need a beast to run this very smoothly so good optimaztion there. And mostly i didn't really cared about funky looking parts because i had so much fun. Oh, i almost forgot to talk about how much detail and effort has put into this game. You will be surpised to see how detailed the car parts are even thorugh they didn't went for the photorealism.Gameplay:Gameplay in this game is so addicting and fun for both car lovers and problem solvers, so in the first few jobs the game tells you what to fix, but 3-4h in the game gives less infomation about the problem and you need to dig(or shall i say, screw) your way into the car to find the problem and replace it with new parts. Also this game really teaches you about car parts and how to remove them and put'em back in. It is a very fun and addicting IF you're a car lover like me or a problem solver, novice mechanic, or people who like puzzle games. Well if you're not one of those people i suggest stay away from this game because it's not for you.Overall:Overall this game is perfect for Car lovers, problem solvers, novice mechanic, and people who like puzzle games. For those people this game gets 9/10 BUY THIS GAME NOW. But if you're not one of those people do not purchase this game. I myself would put a recommended review because this game deserves more positive reviews.			"

												This is a pretty damn fine game: finishing jobs and upgrading stuff around the 'shop is satisfying game, the economy is well- balanced, and the cars look gorgeous. However, I upgraded my OS several months back (to OSX El Capitan 10.11.2- I know, I'm trying to game on a Mac, so shoot me), and the game completely broke. Now, I can't get past the loading screen without the game crashing, with no way to alt- tab out of it or otherwise get out of it- the screen just freezes, with any audio from other programmes still running in the background. I recently picked up CMS 2014 on sale as well, and had the same problems. If this problem gets fixed, so I can actually play the game, I'll definitely try to change my review to focus on the fun aspects of the game, but until then I can't recommend it.			"

												In many ways this is a leaps and bounds improvement over the 2014 version, however one thing I think it's missing is some sort of achievement or goal.  You play, fixing cars, solving problems, even going as far as buying wrecks and restoring them... but by the time I got there, I kinda of wondered what the point was.  At least the previous version started you small and you could upgrade to bigger and better shops as it progressed... this one, you get 1 shop and the cost of upgrading it and XP requirements are almost too easy.  Still, it's inexpensive and a good time sink... but don't be surprised if you reach a point where 'what now?' has you moving on to a different game.			"

I´ve played CMS14 (the Game from last Year) and have to say, compared to the Interace from that the new Interface has some advantages BUT also some Disadvantages.Clearly the New Interface looks more Fancy and more Dynamic then the old one. The old one had always the Feeling of something static is going on with no Dynamic in its moves (f.e when looking closly to a Wheel etc). The new Interface solve this Problem with a lot of good Animations and good Grafics (comapred to CMS14). It also feels a bit smoother in its Animation, which offers a Great feeling when using it.The New Interface is also easier to handel for People who are new to the Car Mechanics Simulator, for Players of the Old one its kind of hard to get used to it, but personally i think thats still an advantage, cause its overall better in the handling.But there are some negative Things i dont want to Skip here: I persoanlly dont like the new Highlighting of Parts at all. Its sometimes very hard to Spot something you have simply not seen, if you want to remove a certain part. Also the Assembeling and Disassembeling is really hard now, cause the Highlighting is pretty poor and bad. Another Thing that is really annoying to me, is the Fact that you cant switch the Conditions View on while working on the Car. That was possible in CMS14 and made it a lot easier to get the Parts selectet you want to select. Now that Function is missing and its quiet Hard sometimes to get the Parts selected or even spot them.But overall its acceptable for Fans in my Opinion, cause it makes the Game only Harder not runins it. Gameplay The Gameplay is much much better then CMS14 for me. The Cars are more Complex, you can Filter the Categorys from the Shop on the Computer, you have different Things to Buy, Customize and so on. And you can Finaly reject Jobs that you dont like, and thats cool.I dont know how many times i had to remove a entire Gearbox from a V6 4x4 in CMS14 and was simply♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of it (cause its very low payout and very hard work), so finally i can skip Orders like that, yea :D.Players who played the old CMS14 will like the new CMS15 very much in my Opinion, cause its solves a lot of Problem CMS14 had Sound This is a very negative Part for me. I´m a huge Fan of Music and Soundtracks and listen to Music like 5 to 6 Hours a Day. The Soundtrack from CMS14 had something for most of the People. Some Rock & Metal for Guys with a ""harder"" Taste, some Techno Music for People who like that or some Dubstep for People who enjoy the Electrical Music as well as some good other Tracks. Sure not all Tracks where for everyone, but you could say that not 1 was really ""Bad"".In CMS15 my Ears are bleeding to be honest, cause this Soundtrack is really awefull. Not only that there are some good Rocky Songs are missing, not the whole Soundtrack is more like a Techno / Dubstep / and things like that Album. F.e there is this Song from a Girl with some Douett Part in it (the only one) and i´ve never heard a Professional Singer in a long time, who misses so much Notes like she did in only 1 Song. And this Pattern of awefull Music is applied to all Tracks in CMS15.If there is CMS16 planned (dont know it atm) please take more Time for the Soundtrack and dont choose this Crap again. Its nice that you want to support ""little"" Musicans (as far as i see they are all not that Popular), but please choose those who have talent :). Conclusion I´ve said a lot of positive Things, a lot of negative things and a bunch of awefully things about CMS15. Now its the final moment: Would i reccomend it or not. I have to say, personally, i would reccomend it for Poeple who played CMS14 and people who like Simulator Games. Its a good, nice puzzle Game which can provide Hours of Fun and you can acutally learn something about Business Management and Cars as well (not much, but at least you now know where your Cars Gearbox is right?).

												I have fallen in love with this game.  Not sure why I enjoy it so much.  I guess between cars, and the disassembly and reassembly and all the other neat things this game provides.  I grabbed it on sale, and I have bought all the DLC to date.  This game is a great game, and a must have for gearheads and those who just like tinkering with the mechanics of putting a car together and taking it apart.			"

												I do like this game, and I am a retired auto repair shop owner.  I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.  You have to have the visual tuning DLC to make the game playable, but they charge seperately for it, so you know what your in for with this game.			"

												I'm on the fence about this one honestly. Got a little time into it and while it's pretty neat, there's not a whole lot they let you do. You basically get two options when you repair the cars, either fasctory parts or performance parts. There, you only get one option each. Campaing is all right, nothing to get excited about. I'd LOVE to see more variety when it comes to the parts you can use and the cars themselves. Perhaps allowing workshop content would greatly contribute to most of my issues, but that's on the dev end. Verdict? Get it on sale, otherwise pass.			"

												Slow, progress is painfully slow, so slow it's like having a dead end boring job in real life, Except you don't get paid, so... total waste of time. The game is fun, initially. It's fun when I fix the first car, it's fun when I fix the first complex part. But, you'll need to fix the same boring simple car, screw and unscrew the same spot thousands of times, BEFORE you can even get to play with the second car.Just speed up the experience and money! or just open up all the cars!Seriously, why?Game developers don't get paid extra for holding gamers playing longer (by wasting time). It's a single player game, and a car mechanic game, there's literally nothing to brag about for spending(wasting) so much time on it.It's the desert bus game with a better interface. Playing it should be considered performance art.			"

												Dull and boring gameplay. You accept repair contracts, get a list of parts to change, and then proceed to do it.The interface is clunky and not intuitive and the graphics are nothing to write home about.Might be a nice way to teach someone the basics about car parts if that is the desired goal, but that's more or less the only reason I could think of to play this game.0/10. would much rather repair real cars.

												Great idea. The trouble is you don't play a good idea. Your clicking parts on and off a car. All the cars use the same set of parts. There are some tuning options but they are very limited. Don't think you can chop and change engines etc. Limited choice on wheels with no real choice on width or diameter. So you click parts on and off  a car. Then you get to set it up on the dyno. This is 3 buttons you fiddle with till the mixture is right. Doesn't say what you are actually doing and its so random you might as well throw a dice. Then theres the drag strip. Throttle is just a button so if you have a car with decent power your either spinning into the wall or short shifting gears so you never get a meaningful time anyway. Like I said a great idea that very soon becomes very boring.			"

												If you're a gearhead, but just don't have the time to work on cars as it is, this game is for you.  Yeah, there's no ""end game"" or ""end goal"" but there are lots of goals along the way: get equipment to diagnose problems easier, get a place to store cars, buy cars and restore them, customize cars, etc.I played the last game, and I'm very surprised at just how much better this game is.  Initially, I was worried this game might go the route of the city building game, where basically you were paying full price for what was a patch.  Not with this series!  I can't explain just how much of a massive improvement this game is over the previous one, and I had a great time with the last game.The engine is very smooth, and they keep tweaking it to make it run better.  Attention to detail is very high, I'm surprised at how nice the shop looks.  It would have been cool if we started out in some ratty shop and eventually paid our way via hard work and business to a cool high-tech shop, but beggars can't be choosers, and I understand that would add extra development time.The game gets very detailed in the repairs, and I'm hoping the next version of this game gets even more detailed.  The fact that you can dissassemble engines all the way down to the crankshaft is impressive.  There are variations to the engines in that you work on 4 cylinder and 8 cylinder layouts as well at 8cyl with DOHC.At first it may feel like you gain experience slowly, but I feel the pacing is pretty much perfect.  I've put in a lot of hours and I'm only about to start bidding on cars and restoring them.  I'm a very casual gamer and feel the pacing fits my schedule perfectly.The devs actually monitor the forum and listen to suggestions.  That's great!This game is very therepeutic for me, it's so relaxing to just sit back and work on a virtual car.  Anyone who has wrenched on a car knows it's not as easy as this game, so it's nice for everything to work out so smoothly.As far as where this series future goes, I'm just hoping it gets more detailed and realistic.  I'm so glad they have a well optimized game engine as it is, as well as their attention to detail.This game is worth far more than $20, and I would have gladly paid $60 for it.The devs have set a HUGE benchmark with this version,  they have their work cut out for them in the sequel!  Great job.			"

												Car came in that had trouble running, found out one problem was an igntion coil, but didn't say what the other one was.Spent about 30 minutes tearing down the engine and rebuilding it, trying to find out what it was.All it needed a new air filter.

It only takes a few repair jobs to quickly become bored with the process.			"

												You basically take apart cars and replace broken parts (which are shown as covered in rust). As you gain experiemce you will unlock ability to repair parts rather than replace them with new ones. Also you gain access to some diagnostic tools which willl tell you what is broken, but you will rarely use them because they'll just color code what you already see as rusty as thus broken. First 10 hours of the game you are likely to have lots of fun, but soon after you will inadvertly realize you have just been taking apart 3 variants of engines and 3 variations of undercarriages stuffed in different chasis all that time. There is little progression to speak of. In fact the only difference awaiting you at the end is option to buy  broken cars and sell them after you have fixed them the same way as completing the repair job. There's no customization, no tuning and virtually no driving cars in this game. If you're looking for that you will be dissapointed. If you're looking for simplistic puzzler to kill 10-15 hours in you will enjoy this title. If you're looking for something akin to classic games like street rod, you will find this title dull and repetitive.			"

												the first one was better. it has way more realistic repair orders and you actually diagnosed cars. this one your car as a problem in the description and when you look at your repair order it just shows a list of parts that you are supposed to replace instead of having to actually look at the car and figure out what is wrong. the learning curve is dumb, the first few jobs are replace timing belts or cradle bushings. im sure eveyone online know exactly how to do that... should start out with lower level jobs like changing a set of brakes or doing an oil change. it would help people that dont know how to work on cars ease their way into this and maybe even learn something. another thing is it should have a budget per car that looses money the longer you take.

												It gets incredibly boring incredibly fast. It's incredibly simplistic, and unless you have a thorough knowledge of how cars work, you'll get lost trying to find which parts you need to swap out. The mechanic of taking off certain parts so you can access others is neat, and it creates a more accurate simulation, but for the game, I feel it makes things way too time-consuming. This game is not worth the money I spent on it, and should really be free.			"

												Can't recommend this1. Too much grind - about 9 hours of hard work until you get your own parking and ability to actually buy own cars.2. Awful loading time - every time scene changes or car loads prepare to wait for about 20 seconds minimum3. FPS - it barely runs at 60 fps on GTX 970, that's on minimum settings with no AA.4. No free camera - camera always rotates around selected part, selecting distant parts can be troublesome.			"

												I understand this is a ""Car Mechanic Simulator"" game, and i don't know nearly anything about cars.Also i like this game sort of but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and if you do want to play it play the Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 Demo its not that much differentOnce i fully pull apart and put new things on everything on 3-4 different cars in this i felt like that was it the only thing more to do is make money and store your own cars in the garage then just have them sit there because there is nothing elsei made a list of the things i dislike they are in no order-the only thing you can really change on a car is its colour, other then that you repair or replace parts exactly the way it is including the wheels/rims-Rims and tyres are one piece (there is a picture with them separate)-Car seems to lack wires?-When bolts come out of some parts theres no holes in the piece it was in-The inside of the boot/trunk has no detail at all-No spare tyre-The shadow under the car while on the lifter makes no sense-No number plates-Cant change interior at all including the seats which also has a picture out of the car-Cant change windscreen wiper blades-Apart from the colour What ever is on the car you cant change you cant- Rust is how bad a part is there is nothing more to that-Some menus feel like there meant to be on a touch screen (the swiping i'm meaning)- No real car brands?On the test track (Considering this is a simulator game the driving isnt the worst)-There is no person in 3rd person view-Cant remember what car it was but it was only one that i know of theres like a jutter when you drive in 3rd person view-The car from the Youngtimer update has no engine when its hood is off, not sure if other cars are the sameFor the people who say loading times when you get a car or go the the test track is 3-5 seconds really that big of a deal..I would of liked to see trucks in this and just have Mechanic Simulator and have dlc for different types of Mechanics, i cant wait for the aeroplane, boats or motobikes Mechanic Simulatorsi do look forward to seeing what else they make as well			"

												Like everyone, I'm impressed with the level of detail of when dismantling the car, but the game itself..boring to anyone except someone who does this for a living.  It is a GAME so it's missing things that make it a true simulator. No angry customers or budget for keeping the place running. Customers coming back to say you didn't put a screw or a bolt back...accidents there in the garage..challenges, maybe you get to go to Nascar and have to SPEED repair cars.  There needs to be a clock period. Where you quote a customer a time to pick up so you have to work a little faster. And for the love of god please allow us to add our own music..itunes play list..something.Hearing the sound of the wratchet (may have spelled that wrong) definitely did take me back to being a little girl in the garage with my Papa but as a hard core simulator fan this falls short.It plays more like a mechanic class than an actual game.  I'll give it a good review just because you did an amazing job on the parts.  But I won't be buying any more of your games ladies and gents. You need to take a look at other simulators and add a LOT MORE to make it a true Sim.			"

												This game has potential, yet it is so very repetitive.  Basicly you level up by repairing broken parts of 3 different varients, and when you level up, you get more stuff to repair broken parts some more. It would be so much better if there was more to do, and more possiblilties were added. Maybe I will come back to this game when that happens.			"

												Game has tons of potential. This update hasn't cut it though. It crashes a ton, and when its not crashing, Im having issues with part outlines being stuck over my cursor even though the part is on the car and im out of that view. It has three times now. Three times I have completely closed everything and reopened it to have this issue. For sure not worth the 19.99 or even the 13.99 I pard with Humble Bundle. I would be ok with spending 4 bucks on it after the fixes are made. Please get on that.			"

												Let me start by saying.... I know nothing about fixing cars !!First the game made it onto my wishlist because it looked different, not my kind of thing given the fact i have zero idea how to do pretty much anything on car short of checking the oil (and believe me i have even messed that up) however, it came onto the store @ 55% discount and i just figured why ever not.After playing just a little bit of the game, i am already hooked on it, and would glady have paid the full price...Please dont let the fact you know nothing of fixing a car put you off this game folks!!It is a very good game, and you should buy it, support its development further, there are things i would love too see added, a few things i would prefer to have a option to disable/enable and so forth. but thus far enjoying it...

												Edit 07-18-2015 Red Dot has introduced  hopefully a fix for the long loading times and added more Garage space.I will be changing my recommendation as soon as they release in game support for MODs,which will increase content and replay value.


YouTube™ Video: Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 Early Access Gameplay July Brake job 

			Views: 32		

			Just a quick brake job so you can see the gameplay.		

 These Devs take this title very seriously and listen very well to the playerbase.But the Devs themselves downvote negative reviews.Suggestions I think will make this title much better.wheel support for driving on the test trackmore cars(solved by MODs)More test tracks. (solved by MoDs)more parts and customization (Solved by MODs)realistic Auction pricesreduce loading times  (fixed, Good Job to the Dev's)I'm still hesitant about the Chip tuning minigame.Positivesthe music is pretty good, I found myself jamming to the take me home song.the U.I. and gameplay is simple and works wellThe price for the DLC was good at $2.99 but once I built the three cars it only added about 15 minutes of gameplay for me, Honestly.(solved by MODs)I have built real cars, it only takes me about five minutes to totally strip and rebuild a car in this title.

												The tutorial is useless. Controls are useless. Gameplay is intuitive enough, though, once you learn to figure things out yourself.  ...if you have that kind of patience.  The main feeling I had during my brief gameplay session was fear of not knowing what I didn't know.Okay, I've accepted a job. Should I walk to the car? Should I move it to a lifter? Okay, I figured that out by myself. Great. Now I've spilled oil everywhere. Didn't realize that I owned an oil drain. Found that later, again not led by the tutorial. Now, am I placing the oil drain correctly? I hope so, because I can't reposition it until my next oil change!			"

												These games are difficult to recommend.  If you know cars well you will be insulted by how much they leave out, and if you don't know cars but want to learn more you'll be grosly misled.   I enjoyed 2014 more than 2015.  Because 2015 didn't fix any of my complaints from the first game, it would be very awkward to recommend it.  However, it is not a bad game.ProsImproved Graphics.More detail on car parts and repairs.You can now buy your cars from auctions.ConsNo campaign mode.Work orders are less creative because there is no campaign.  2014 would tell you ""the car makes clank sounds and accelerates slowly"" and then you had to figure out what was broken.  2015 just gives you large lists of broken parts to fix.  Not nearly as interesting.2014 would also have you plug the code reader into the obd port.  2015 has you use the code reader on the actual parts, very odd.You still don't have to add transmission fluid after putting the transmission back in place.  Same goes for anti-freeze in the radiator.  Its still fairly difficult to line-up the oil-catch under the oil plug.Some of the jobs are still absurd expensive, people spending $15,000 on crappy econoboxes to fix them.  Some of the parts are still crazy priced.The interface and controls are still awkward and counter-intuitive.Some tasks, such as removing the wheels, still take far too long.Ok, so the list of cons is big.  Do I recommend the game?  I would recommend 2014 before this game.  It seems like 2015 didn't solve any of major issues with the series and they took some of the core expierence away by getting rid of campaign mode.    "

Real low money and XP rewards.There is nothing else in the game either, no managment side of your buissiness, why cant we start with a small back alley garage, save up for bigger buissiness etc?When you pick through the game and admit to yourself and be honest, the game has no content and becomes boring and dull where you need so much money and XP just to get a wrench.

The penguin covered in ice-cream phones for a breakdown truck which arrives promptly and the mechanic is not phased to see he’s been called out by a talking penguin and gets to work under the bonnet.After a couple minutes the mechanic closes the hood and looks at the rather stained penguin and says “you look like you have blown a seal” and the penguin say “ah no, its Ice-cream”Now that the ice is broken, lets get down to business.Good concept, spoiled by a constant stream of below average DLCs that add little other than new new car shapes.Like all of these simulators, the business side of the game is pointless and only there to slow your collecting down. Despite 70hours of play, I'd only reccommend this on Sale and to sombody with OCD.More than a year on and the developers promised steam achievements are nowhere to be seen			"

												Very repetitive gameplay with an unpolished feel.  Parts must be ordered individually, the tutorial is garbage.  You basically have to figure things out on your own, I was losing $100 an oil change until I found an oil drain tucked into the corner.  The music could not be more annoying and it cannot be changed.  Adding some small fixes or enhancements here or there would lend to a much better experience in my opinion.			"

You will have to change filters and dissaemble wheels 10 times in a row, thats ♥♥♥♥ing anoying. Gameplay is not great and not worth 20€ in my opinion...			"

												Eh, $19.99 down the drain.  I wish this would have had a free demo as it's definitely an acquired taste in simulation games.  I like the idea of tinkering with cars, but the navigation proved too dificult for me.  I was under the car right clicking, left clicking, but I couldn't quite get how to take stuff off.  Perhaps a better detailed tutorial is in order.2/10 would not buy again			"

												Very much a niche sim that requires you to have a lot of knowledge about the subject matter already. There is no real tutorial, help file or wiki to help you find what parts are to be found where. Combined with the ho-hum camera, this means you'll spend most of your time clicking around the car, hoping to hit the hot spot with the correct name. If you're out of luck, it'll be hidden inside other components. Strangely, finding the right parts to replace seems to be the core game component. The other mechanics are bolting/unbolting said parts and ordering replacements online. Oh, and you get to push the button on the lift.The music is very much an acquired taste, so bring your own MP3s. Grab a Haynes manual and a lot of patience while you're at it.			"

Ill keep updating, maybe the learning curve is a bit steep if you havent played 2014+Nice graphics+Lots of detail on the cars-Music will making you want to die after 10 min-Low interaction-Boring after the first few cars-Very Unrewarding slow game play (Massive EXP requirements low gains)-Poor Tutorial (Explains nothing nor teaches anything)It has potiental but falls short for me.

												Overall, this is quite a nice game. Game progress is actually quite slow, but it gives you time enough to learn the game mechanics (pun intended). Graphics are OK, what do you need? Being a mechanic and disassembling cars is fun and you can learn a lot. However, finding faults and disassembling parts can be quite tedious, because ""inspecting"" the state of parts can be difficult. Sometimes you can just see it by looking at the amount of rust, sometimes a very small and hidden part (like brake pads) is broken, which you cannot see. Some other disappointments are very long loading times, and slow collecting of XP for expanding your garage's functionalities.			"

												i dont usually do reviews, but this one deserves it. to address a few things, to some it will get boring after awhile due to doing the same job alot, but thats what its like to be a mechanic. ive worked on cars alot in my life and this game is basically as real as you can get. do some jobs, get some EXP, go out, buy yourself a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car, fix it up, tune it, costomize it, do some pulls at the drag strip, park it up or sell it. one thing i would love to see added would be to expand your garage space, you only have a center for one car, and two lifts. id like to see added lifts or another bigger garage you could buy. gameplay-10/10 replay-9/10 realisticness-9/10overall-10/10			"

												i would recommend this game but i would not recommend going to the auction area it is a waste of time you will never win the car you want. lets say you have $100,000 the car you want starts at $1,000 you click the raise button and the price goes up next the computer raises the price, you click again, the computer clicks again you go back and forth until you decide you do not want to pay that muck for the car. what is the final price when the car is sold? probably in the area of $10,000 to $15,000. it is pointless to buy a car from the auction area. i would suggest you just take a job of the car you want, fix it the way you want it and put it in your parking area and never complete the job, this is the only way you are going to get the car you want.

It's a great game to unwind to, zone out, and just get lost while listening to music, or hell, even the game's really cool soundtrack.If you're new to cars, or have an intermediate proficiency, then you really will probably learn something from it. A few folks complain about it not being accurate or realistic, and it isn't, but it gives you a very general overview of how cars are put together and how to take them apart. If you're at all a gearhead, or at all enjoy tinkering, puzzle games, or relaxing games, then this is for you.			"

												I like it for what it is.  A simplified instructional simulation on how cars are basically put together.  It's got a bit of a learning curve but once you've done a couple of brake jobs you can knock it out in no time.  You can upscale the learning by then looking at your own car and try and identify the parts.  I drive a 2002 Jeep Wrangler so there actually are similarities.All in all it's fun learning a bit about how to tear cars apart and put them back together without all the chemicals, fumes, rust, dirt, busted knuckles, sweat, and uncomfortable crawling around a car.  Plus it won't let you put it back together wrong and it does guide you through what components you need to to add/remove before the next step of the buildup/breakdown.The car selections I encountered were mostly european looking cars with a few classic muscle type cars.  I presume alot of the content has pantenting and tradmarking so modern cars aren't readily available.  I probably need to check out the mods to find different cars.			"

												I wouldn't call this game ""fun"" per se (though it is) but instead, satisfying. As somebody who doesn't know much about wrenching cars, I've always envied friends of mine who were good at it. I'm not presuming this game has magically made me handy in the garage but I have learned a lot more than I knew before. I've even learned about cursing at a car in which I forgot some critical piece after a long re-assemble. I was interested in the title but didn't really expect much. It's turned out to be one of the most satisfying games I've played in a long time. My compliments to the developers.			"

												I agree with alot of people, that this game is fun, accurate, and enjoyable. But there is some main components missing from the game. Heres a few things I would like to see in the game. 1. One that is simple yet not avaliable, being able to just jump in behind the wheel and start the car to hear it run. 2. And to continue that thought,  what about realistic sounds? You get a repair order, complaining about a knocking sound in engine bay, or you will get a car that won't run. If you were able to turn the key over maybe that will help with the diagnostics of the repair. 3. Like many have stated, no hoses, no electrical work, no fuel/brake lines. You cant take the enegine out with a cherry picker than dismantle it. Being able to do actual body work instead of buying brand new body parts would be fun. 4. Also i see a tire machine in the shop but it has no use. Having the ability to change tires as they commonly go bad would be an awesome little perk. 5. I havent fully upgraded my ""repair %"" but it doesnt seem like theres many parts that are repairable. Not sure if you unlock more parts as you upgrade, if not than you should.			"

												Well this game has gave me a head start on mechanics. The only thing is that it only theaches you what parts are (Their names) And how to take them out of the vehicle. Not only that but there are no fuel lines, radiator pipes, brake lines etc. You don't really know how parts work, but no doubt after this game its easyier to figure that out via google. This game is really awesome! And so I recommend this to anybody that is willing to learn mechanics and needs a head start!			"

												So. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. The year is almost over, and I have a good 100 hours on this game, so it's about time for a review.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's definitely a very good game, it's informative in its own way, educational, and just plain fun, especially when you save up enough money and experience to expand your garage, get the paint shop, get the underground parking, and go to the auction house to buy wrecks you can fix up and sell for a profit.Of course, things are simplified a lot under the hood of each car you get to work on. I'm no mechanic, but I know enough of cars to have done maintenance on my own cars, and I have studied a lot of stuff for stories I write in which a character is an actual mechanic. There is in fact a funny thing about that; the game showed me painfully well how I got most of my knowledge about cars. It started in Dutch, as that is the language set on my laptop, and one of the first customer cars I got in showed a list that said there was a part that needed replacing. And I was all like; what the hell is that? So I saved and quit to menu, set the game language to English, started back up again, looked at the list, and went; Ohhh! Duh, a rubber bushing! Why didn't you just SAY so? I KNOW those! (And I know the name of that part mainly from watching YouTube videos of HotRod Magazine/HotRod Garage, and reading those kind of magazines - in English. For about 70% of the parts, I have NO clue what they are by the Dutch names alone)How simplified is it under the hood? Well, all cars have similar parts, for one. A front suspension has a crossmember, shocks, springs, a swaybar and end links, steering rack with inner and outer tie rods, upper and/or lower control arms, wheel knuckle housing, wheel hub, brake disk, pads, and a brake caliper. All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.The engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!But, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.For the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.There's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.And the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.The same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)Still, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.Do I recommend this game though? Hell yes!			"

												I do like this game however it gets boring fast with nothing to invest money in other then cars you can't drive on a street or a good race track, I think the creators of this game need to look deep into Street Legal Racing Redline this has potencial and street legal racing even know its old was and still is amazing you build your car in the same way with little less detail on running gear parts nothing modders didnt fix... This game suggest simulation and like many others say who are experianced at this in real life half of the problems in reality do not occure in game torque specs on bolts amazing idea there is important things that should be detailed more or less im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause i wana drive what i build also custom motors and more parts. I paid $30 for street legal around 2003 and that game tops this still i expected more this is more or less the same as 2014 version that looks better.. Its been hyped up way more then it should...

												This game is great I find that I enjoy very much repairing these old vehicles. I purchased this game for the business aspects of this game. I would very much enjoy to see the business aspect of this game expanded to include purchasing new shops or even dealerships. Maybe race your vehicle against others in a multi online aspect. So far there is nothing I don't like about this game I would like to see more added to it. I've gotten to the point where I purchased all upgrades and have about 500k in my account. Even after all that I am still playing it. Please give me more to do!Thanks!			"

												There's good and bad, but overall, it's a worthwhile and entertaining game. The bad: Some things I found irritating was the whole ""Repair Bench"" system. For the most part you can repair most parts on it, and depending how  many points you have spent in the skill, you have up to a 90% chance of repairing a part. However there seems to be no rhyme or reason to which parts you can or cannot repair. For example, you can somehow repair brake shoes, but not brake discs. Another problem is with the repairs itself... As mentioned, you have up to a 90% chance of a successful repair if you purchase all the points for the repair bench. That may seem like a lot, however given that it may take up to 5 repairs on say an engine block, you really only have a 5 out of 9 chance of completely repairing it successfully. This means you may repair an expensive item up to 89% or so, but then fail your last roll and completely destroy it. How does that happen in real life? I have an almost brand new engine and somehow I totally ruin it beyond repair? I could understand letting it only repair up to a certain point, but the way the system works, even with full points in repair, you end up ruining more than half the parts you pull on any given repair job. Also... how the hell difficult is it to put an oil pan under the engine to avoid a $100 spill.The good: It's fun... But gets old fast. Not a lot of variety. Most cars are different only on the outside. If you've worked on one, you've worked on them all.			"

												Very fun game. Overall great soundtrack, brake jobs get repetetive, but I felt that some of the things weren't as ""Simulated"" as they are in real life. For example, draining oil does not require you to drop the entire oil pan. You must also not overfill when pouring oil into the engine as featured in the game to let you know ""It's good"", and another example is that with spark plugs, you MUST gage them before you put them inside the engine or bad things happen. They could have gone super deep with what it is to actually be a mechanic but that might have taken away from the game and turned a lot of people off.Final Answer: Fun purchase, will probably max out my lot and play until I finish it all.

												Vastly improved over CMS 2014. Graphics are much nicer and the engines/vehicles look much closer to their real life counterparts, though there are still a few mistakes. Wider variety of vehicles and a larger garage enables multiple jobs simultaenously.The ability to purchase cars at aution and restore them either for profit or your personal collection is very welcome. The only complaints I have about the auction house are that each car gets sent to your parking lot automatically and there is a set number of cars per auction. I do understand that the limited number of cars is more realistic but it is rather bothersome when I am looking for a specific car to work on. The issue with sending cars to the parking lot is understandable and would be more bearable if the loading times were lower.I also really liked the addition of diagnostic tools and a leveling system not based on cash. The only complaint in that department is that the repair skill maxes out at 90%. That is literally my one complaint about the new system. Everything else was a welcome change.The developer also seems to be pushing updates regularly (as of July, 2015) which is much appreciated. Several patches were already released since I purchased this game. More vehicles and tuning parts have also been added as optional DLC.			"

												So. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. The year is almost over, and I have a good 100 hours on this game, so it's about time for a review.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's definitely a very good game, it's informative in its own way, educational, and just plain fun, especially when you save up enough money and experience to expand your garage, get the paint shop, get the underground parking, and go to the auction house to buy wrecks you can fix up and sell for a profit.Of course, things are simplified a lot under the hood of each car you get to work on. I'm no mechanic, but I know enough of cars to have done maintenance on my own cars, and I have studied a lot of stuff for stories I write in which a character is an actual mechanic. There is in fact a funny thing about that; the game showed me painfully well how I got most of my knowledge about cars. It started in Dutch, as that is the language set on my laptop, and one of the first customer cars I got in showed a list that said there was a part that needed replacing. And I was all like; what the hell is that? So I saved and quit to menu, set the game language to English, started back up again, looked at the list, and went; Ohhh! Duh, a rubber bushing! Why didn't you just SAY so? I KNOW those! (And I know the name of that part mainly from watching YouTube videos of HotRod Magazine/HotRod Garage, and reading those kind of magazines - in English. For about 70% of the parts, I have NO clue what they are by the Dutch names alone)How simplified is it under the hood? Well, all cars have similar parts, for one. A front suspension has a crossmember, shocks, springs, a swaybar and end links, steering rack with inner and outer tie rods, upper and/or lower control arms, wheel knuckle housing, wheel hub, brake disk, pads, and a brake caliper. All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.The engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!But, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.For the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.There's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.And the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.The same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)Still, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.Do I recommend this game though? Hell yes!			"

												Heard a funny noise under the hood of my car this morning and opened it up to take a look. Tried to right click to diagnose the problem and realized I only play a mechanic on TV.Played 3 hours the first time I turned it on. Very addicting because every time you finish a job, you end up saying, ""ok just one more."" Then you say, ""But now I only need one or two more for a tool upgrade."" Then you look at the clock and realize you are not actually making money and need to get up for work at your actual job soon.The graphics are great. The learning curve is easy. On top of that I'm learning how cars go together. The upgrades are cool and the facility unlocks are also cool. I love the soundtrack.I got this on sale for like 7 bucks. $20 is worth it for someone who likes cars. I just like management games and I was looking for more management such as have a crew of technicians and what not but this doesn't have that. Not disappointed with what it is though. Good game.			"

												I have to say i like this. I work on cars for a living and although this isn't really close to the actual job, it's fun. In fact i think it's fun for that reason. I've played this a ton and frankly the only cons i can see are that the game needs more models to work on ( there really can't ever be enough ) Maybe a more in depth way to mod cars, a race track or drag strip would be cool, and MOST importantly....this game really really needs the ability to import your own MP3's so that you can listen to whatever you want while you wrench. I cannot overstate this enough. But it is playable and very fun the way it is now, and i am looking forward to seeing where the developers take it in the future.			"

												I've done engine/transmission swaps, factory and forged block and head rebuilds, and I'm currently in the process of attempting to make 800 rwhp on my '94 SC300 with a 2JZGTE VVTi/R154 swap.  Going with a GTX4088R, 2000cc Hi-Z Injector Dynamic injectors, dual 450 Walbro pumps, an OS Giken triple plate clutch with a hydraulic actuator conversion, Hypertune race intake manifold, a supra MK4 4.06 rear end, and many, many other mods.  In summary, I spend hours upon hours on forums reading about high HP builds and basic repair/maintenance on several different forum sites.  Even though my life is spent on cars outside of work, I can't get enough of this game because even with all of that experience, I still learn a thing or two each time that I play it.

												I really enjoyed this title.  It's fun to play and fix or buy cars at auction to rebuild, tune to your tastes, etc., but this is definitely a niche game, and you need to be aware of that coming in.  There's no racing, unless you buy the extra DLC test track.  There's no building and tuning cars to your tastes unless you buy the Visual and Performance DLC.  As long as you know that coming in, you'll be satisfied with your experience, otherwise reconsider as you'll be better served buying a tank of gas for your real car with that 20 bucks. "

												I was dubious about this game. There's a vast amount of Simulator titled games out there and from the title, this doesn't sound like it's one of the more interesting ones. In the end, I think it was a sale that enticed me in and I'm glad I did, there's gameplay to be had here.You don't necessarily get dropped in at the deep end, you start off only being able to access the more simple jobs. I know how a car works and how it's bolted together so unfortunately I can't comment on how easy this is for those totally new to it all. It's reasonably realistic though, so if you're picking it up you're learning something!The initial pace is a little slow and a bit 'grindy' in places. Once you've unlocked everything though there's a few ways you can play it. I've taken to buying cars at auction and completely rebuilding them to see how much profit is available in each model. There's a few other strategies I've not tried yet such as only replacing parts less than 80%.Eventually, you'll realise that all you're doing is giving the mouse some exercise as you're just clicking the same things over and over again. When that happens, you can switch the brain back on and take on a few customer jobs instead, requiring you to investigate things. I'm not sure how much life is left in the game, but I've had over 60 hours in it so far so I've gotten my moneys worth.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator (henceforth CMS) 2015 is a distinct improvement over what was offered with CMS 2014. The fact that you can choose what jobs to accept or decline is very nice, especially as you are starting out and may not know where a particular problem might lie. However, where I think this game really shines is being able to buy a heap for cheap, gut it, repair what parts you are able, replace the rest, and sell it for a tidy profit. You may also elect to keep it for yourself, but there is little to do with it if you do, other than to simply look at it. My recommendation to any new players of the game is to do enough jobs to save up a bit of money, then start buying and fixing up cars from the auction. You can bet that the price of the car is going to double or triple in the auction house, and I would say to save up enough money to possibly double THAT amount before you start fixing things up. Until you really level up your repair skill (something I would definitely focus on fairly early on), you'll probably need to buy parts to replace all of the ones that you fail to repair. All of that aside, here is how I would evaluate the game:The Good:- Fixing up old cars and selling them is fantastic. This is where this game shines, and the enjoyment of this outweighs all of the negative points of this game put together. At the time of this review, I have clocked a little over 30 hours on the game, and I periodically return to it simply to do this. Although a little unrealistic, it's very satisfying to take something that's absolute garbage and get it into like-new condition, and there is a hefty bonus for selling a car that is in 100% condition.- Leveling up your skills as a mechanic is now separate from money, which you will be needing for the purchase of cars when you get tired of doing work orders.- Havng the garage means that you can hang onto a car that you really like, and it can be expanded with plenty of space for you to collect them all.- Fixing parts is free, but it has the possibility of breaking them, as well. This means that many jobs can be done quite cheaply, and this further increases the potential for profit in selling cars.- The game looks very nice and runs smoothly, at least on my computer.- The core gameplay of removing and replacing parts is executed well, and most things are pretty efficient, although it would be nice to have a side-by-side for your inventory and the shop.The Bad:- There is very little to do with cars once they are fixed up, other than sell them or send them to the garage. However, I don't really like driving or racing games, so this has little bearing on my opinion of the game.- Accessibility of parts is kind of an issue. Even if you are doing things in the most efficient way possible, you have to use the lift multiple times to get at every single part. The worst culprit by far is the crankshaft (and, by extension, the engine block). You have to use the lift once to remove the oil pan and the pieces keeping the crankshaft in place, another time to remove the pistons (and any other engine parts required to get at them), and once more to get the crankshaft out. Then, if you need to get at the engine block itself, it's a FOURTH go on the lift to get it out once the crankshaft has been removed. This is all a pretty minor gripe at the end of the day, and it may be fairly realistic, but it's still kind of annoying.- Even with the convenience of the PDA, which makes it so that you can buy parts without having to run back to your desk, the shop menu is separate from your inventory screen. This means that it can be cumbersome to buy a lot of parts to replace those that you have broken when fixing up an old junker.- Collecting oil requires you to be a sniper. Don't bother with it. Just pay the $100 cleanup fee.- Parts that you are repairing break quite often. When fully leveled, you have a 90% chance to repair a part, but you do not FULLY repair it. This means that you roll those dice multiple times per part. They really should've had a decrease in condition by a random amount if that 10% chance comes up, but instead, the thing is totally borked. So if you have a part that is in poor condition so that you need to hit ""repair"" 4 times to get it fully to 100%, then you actually have a chance that is 90%*90%*90%*90%, or about 66% chance of getting it fully repaired and 34% chance of breaking it entirely and paying to replace it. That may not sound bad, but that is what it is like when you're at max level. - DLC. Gross. Well, it's not AWFUL, but here's the thing: the ""Gold"" version of this game only includes some of the DLC. Most of the rest of it adds actual brand name vehicles to the lineup. So, since they have to pay to use those brands, it makes some sense. Even so, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to buy the Gold version and not even get the majority of the DLC.The Ugly:- The game actually looks very nice on the whole, but the textures for new parts sometimes doesn't say ""shiny chrome"" so much as it does ""plastic thing painted to look like shiny chrome.""- Some of the paint colors are pretty awful.... well, just like with real-life cars, truthfully. Many of them are quite nice, but it seems like you're more likely to wind up with something pretty ugly. You can paint them a new color, but you really can't preview a car's color very well in the paint shop without paying to have it painted, which means that tweaking that color can get kinda expensive.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 (CMS 15) is exactly what is sounds like: a car mechanic simulator. The player takes the role of a mechanic in your very own garage. As you build up a good reputation and learn more, you get to work on harder, more complex vehicles. You are given hints early on to help you determine exactly what parts to fix or replace, but soon those nice yellow outlines will disappear, and you're on your own. Cars get nicer, and so do your payouts.Car Mechanic Sim is literally all I hoped it to be. I wanted to learn more about how cars come together, and it did the job perfectly for me. While it's not a 100% accurate simulation, the game does a good job of giving you the gist of certain aspects of how a car works. Before playing CMS15, I wouldn't have known how suspension even works in cars. I really like working on older cars, such as muscle cars and other little classic cars, because of how different they are from modern designs, especially the engines and the suspension setups.ProsGood basic learning toolLots of inexpensive DLCs to expand the gameplay (licensed brands, tuning options)Good array of cars parodied from real-world vehicles.ConsNot a full car simulation! It's a mechanic sim!Gets progressively more difficult (could be interpreted either way really, just putting it in the cons because it has more weight as a con) The gameplay is a bit repetitive after a while. You may like to try the challenge mode to mix things up a bit!Final Thoughts:CMS is a good way to pass time and learn something while doing it!Rating: 9.0/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

Then buy this mechanic simulator!  Sure, there are a few things wrong with this simulator; it's not perfect.  But nothing serious enough that you shouldn't buy it and enjoy it.Caution: You may quit your job, buy a garage, and start repairing vehicles.			"

												Car Mechanic Sim 2015 is the second one of these games I've played and they keep getting better. While the game may not be 100% realistic it's still a lot of fun. It's a good puzzle and really gets you thinking. Game never really gets old because you are always solving different problems and theres always something next and even when there's not you can just start again. Great game, definitly recommend.			"

												Overall I really enjoy this game. I really feel like this is a spiritual successor to a much older game that some car enthusiasts might be familiar with (""Gearhead Garage""). There are a lot of welcome improvements over the 2014 version of the game such as the ability to buy cars from the auction and sell them. The variety of cars is good and I like how there is an actual variety of how you assemble the vehicles. The graphics are pretty nice. Some of the game modes such as the test track and the paint booth seem a little underdeveloped in my opinion (as in the steering is a little difficult and the paint booth is pretty simplistic in terms of color choice.) The DLCs are pretty reasonably priced for the content in them. The only two things that bother me to any extent in the game is that you have to put a LOT of time into the game before you are able to access the auction block. I feel like the real highlight of the game is the ability to buy cars in various condition at the auction and then fix them up to sell them. Along with the auction sequence comes my second issue with the game: you should be able to put the car up for auction as opposed to outright selling it, and the work order screen should have some information on how much of a total monetary and time investment you have in the car.  With those things said, I don't think that they interfere with my enjoyment of the game to the extent that I would quit playing it or that I wouldn't recommend it.I bought the game as a bundle with a lot of its DLC included. I would buy it again. I would recommend it to others that are interested in cars and simulation games.			"

												I agree with alot of people, that this game is fun, accurate, and enjoyable. But there is some main components missing from the game. Heres a few things I would like to see in the game. 1. One that is simple yet not avaliable, being able to just jump in behind the wheel and start the car to hear it run. 2. And to continue that thought,  what about realistic sounds? You get a repair order, complaining about a knocking sound in engine bay, or you will get a car that won't run. If you were able to turn the key over maybe that will help with the diagnostics of the repair. 3. Like many have stated, no hoses, no electrical work, no fuel/brake lines. You cant take the enegine out with a cherry picker than dismantle it. Being able to do actual body work instead of buying brand new body parts would be fun. 4. Also i see a tire machine in the shop but it has no use. Having the ability to change tires as they commonly go bad would be an awesome little perk. 5. I havent fully upgraded my ""repair %"" but it doesnt seem like theres many parts that are repairable. Not sure if you unlock more parts as you upgrade, if not than you should.			"

												i would recommend this game but i would not recommend going to the auction area it is a waste of time you will never win the car you want. lets say you have $100,000 the car you want starts at $1,000 you click the raise button and the price goes up next the computer raises the price, you click again, the computer clicks again you go back and forth until you decide you do not want to pay that muck for the car. what is the final price when the car is sold? probably in the area of $10,000 to $15,000. it is pointless to buy a car from the auction area. i would suggest you just take a job of the car you want, fix it the way you want it and put it in your parking area and never complete the job, this is the only way you are going to get the car you want.

												I wouldn't call this game ""fun"" per se (though it is) but instead, satisfying. As somebody who doesn't know much about wrenching cars, I've always envied friends of mine who were good at it. I'm not presuming this game has magically made me handy in the garage but I have learned a lot more than I knew before. I've even learned about cursing at a car in which I forgot some critical piece after a long re-assemble. I was interested in the title but didn't really expect much. It's turned out to be one of the most satisfying games I've played in a long time. My compliments to the developers.			"

												ANOTHER RELAXING ENTRY IN THE ""<thing> SIMULATOR <year>"" GENREIf you're looking for action, excitement, drama or tension, this probably won't scratch your itch (unless you take a car with horribly worn steering components and brakes onto the test track, maybe).What it will do, is fulfil a 'hobby', and maybe give you a little basic education on automotive repair and maybe even an understanding of how a car is constructed.Make no mistake, this simulator/game will NOT take the place of professional training, but it might help you discover an interest......think of it as being for automotive maintenance what Guitar Hero is for music performance; a fun, little 'introduction to' game.

												Fantastic game.I really enjoyed playing this one, my friend had this on his account and I had a go and ended up playing it for 10 hours over a couple of days and had to purchase it. I like cars irl and know a small ammount about mechanics and the simulator is a great way of learning some of the basic parts of a car and get a rough idea of where everything goes. However, it isn't realistic in that you would be able to take the knowledge to the real thing, although any hobbyist mechanic may find some use for this.Away from the eduactional side of things and on to the gameplay. The game is really fun at first but it does start to grind on whilst you raise your level and gain enough money to hit the auctions. However, once you have done this grind it will be well worth it because the game so much more interesting and fun when you can buy old bangers and suke them up into high powered machines to either race around or sell for a high profit.One of my favorite games.Pro'sReally well designed and easy to learnHelps learning names and places of actual car partsGood end game contentHighly replayableNice graphicsAwesome soundtrackCon'sSome of the DLC seems rather overpriced for what it addsProbably extremely boring if you have no interest in cars or mechanicsI highly recomend this game to anyone with an interest in cars/mechanics but I would say that if you don't have much interest try a demo or something first as my friend who owns this finds it really dull.

												As someone who really works on cars, I'd say this is a failry accurate mechanic sim without the grazed knuckles and frustration of hard to get to bolts.Very similar to games such as Gearhead Garage and Street Legal, this game puts you in charge of your own workshop. You make money fixing customers cars which you can then spend on buying cars at auction. The auction cars always need some work, when the work is complete you can either add the car to your garage, or sell it for a profit.I am restoring a DeLorean in real life so I also grabbed the DeLorean DLC. It's pretty accurate, although some things in the engine bay are in the wrong place and the DeLorean in this game has a power steering pump instead of an A/C unit, but I understand this is probably a limitation of the game engine. It did feel weird taking the mix unit and intake manifold off to inspect the Valley of Death as I have done on my own DeLorean.I've had hours of fun, the only downside to the game is it can get repetitive. quite a lot of the customer jobs are big jobs such as rebuilding the entire front and back suspension system, which is time consuming and monotonous. Having said that, life as a real mechanic would be very similar. There is also not much you can do with your own cars once they have been rebuilt, apart from sit in them or take them around a test track.Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in pulling cars and engines to bits and at the moment this is probably THE best game on the market for anyone wanting a modern Gearhead Garage clone.

												I know how to work on cars and trucks. I was disappointed when I got into the game. There are only 4 engine types, one SUV and 1 truck. It is setup well but the order in which you remove parts is not like the real world. I understand why they made it this way but takes away from the real world aspect. I was hoping to see a different engine setup for each vehicle, was disappointed again. Once you learn how to do one engine they are all pretty much the same. Don't get me wrong for me it is still fun but would be better if there was more difference between the vehicles.Brake jobs - Too easySuspension - Too easyEngine Work - Needs more varietyTransmission - Too easyDrivetrain - Too easyIgnition System - Too easyFuel system - Too easyBody Work - Too easyAll in all i would say it is too easy of a game for someone like me who has experience and a vast knowledge of how vehicles function & are built.Just a word of advice... Do not think you can be a mechanic after playing this game. You will be pleasently disappointed.			"

												A must have for a car nut! I love the game. I have worked on cars before and mostly everything is spot on - especially suspension wise. There are some parts that have either been omitted or overly simplified but - especially engine wise - but it's no big deal. It performs well but has a few weird quirks. I could not get the game to load until a user suggested I force-minimize the game via CTRL+ALT+DEL, then go back in, which oddly enough worked out.PROS:- Fun and educational- Very accurate parts wise- Great visuals- Nice testing tools- Good experience points and unlocks- Nice soundtrack (in my opinion)CONS:- Odd performance quirks at times- Long and frequent loading times- Some overly simplified engine components- Camera fights with you sometimesSUGGESTIONS FOR CMS 2016:- Let's get deeper into engine parts! I realize it might turn away some folks because engines can get very complex. Perhaps a difficulty setting where this is adjustable?- Automatic transmissions. Every car in this game is a manual. Autos would be nice as they would introduce a whole new category of drivetrains.- The aftermarket scene. I realize this is probably a can of worms, but a few performance mods wouldn't hurt. It's not uncommon for people to take their cars to shops and request performance parts. Throw in a dyno too!			"

												I'm a mechanic and I can say this game is pretty good. It's how you fix things in real life but the parts and detail are very well done. If this game had racing and performance parts this would be the next Motor City Online. I would drop more money for that option without a doubt. I am so tired of Need For Speed Racing games. I liked having to know a car and how to make it faster. Great game guys! Keep up the good work!			"

												The first time I played this I burned through almost five hours of doing repairs. After a few days of playing it I'm starting to find it a little routine simply because I've gotten nearly all the experience perks that are available, and there's only 5 or 6 different models of vehicles that I've gotten to work on. The best part of the game is the detective work, it makes the player think of where to look for problems and gives them tools to diagnose them. Early on you may be tempted to just rip apart the whole engine and put it all back in piece by piece (I've done it). That method works, but the game doesn't penalize you for the time it takes. Since the pieces are rudamentary an engine can be broken down to it's components inside of three RL minutes.In the future I hope that the developers incorporate a timer to dole out experience or money based on how quickly you diagnosed and solved a problem. Ultimately I think I'll just get sick of looking at the same 60-70 parts and doing the same repairs over and over and lose interest, which is a shame because with some ingenuity and integration this could be a very long-lived and entertaining sim:Motor bikes, company finances, hiring/firing AI staff to help on other cars, negotiating repair estimates, having something to do with the pile of junk you yank off cars, even a leveling and story mode are all things that could make me play this game a lot more frequently and for a longer time. Don't get me wrong, still very promising and even educational experience.All in all, it's a great sim with a ton of potential and I'm really looking forward to seeing what direction it goes in. Reccomended, but sincerely hoping for more content to keep it interesting.			"

												Vastly improved over CMS 2014. Graphics are much nicer and the engines/vehicles look much closer to their real life counterparts, though there are still a few mistakes. Wider variety of vehicles and a larger garage enables multiple jobs simultaenously.The ability to purchase cars at aution and restore them either for profit or your personal collection is very welcome. The only complaints I have about the auction house are that each car gets sent to your parking lot automatically and there is a set number of cars per auction. I do understand that the limited number of cars is more realistic but it is rather bothersome when I am looking for a specific car to work on. The issue with sending cars to the parking lot is understandable and would be more bearable if the loading times were lower.I also really liked the addition of diagnostic tools and a leveling system not based on cash. The only complaint in that department is that the repair skill maxes out at 90%. That is literally my one complaint about the new system. Everything else was a welcome change.The developer also seems to be pushing updates regularly (as of July, 2015) which is much appreciated. Several patches were already released since I purchased this game. More vehicles and tuning parts have also been added as optional DLC.			"

												I have never worked on a car in my life (although I have fiddled around with bikes often enough), but about 20 minutes into the game, I felt like a real pro. The controls are intuitive and incredibly helpful, and I was so engrossed into the game, I spent about thirty odd minutes just bolting and unbolting things to figure out what went where! Great gem of a game. I feel its a little underappreciated among the popular sim games on Steam, but it definitely deserves to be up there among them.			"

												I love the game but it feels like in the trailer tey showed us something that wasn't in the game yet. When they where showing us the build of the Tempest Magnum (dodge charger) they engine swapt it. I know that it pretty much doesn't matter wich motor you have in the car its gonna perform the same but we have diffrent parts that we cant use right now. Like the V8 4WD gearbox for exampel or front driveaxel A&B that aren't used in any car in the game. This tells us that there is gonna be one of those updates but why haven't we seen it yet? They have given us like 4 new cars now and every one came with new parts that we can't use in any ohter vehicles. We can use diffrent rims, diffrent body panels from the tuner dlc but atleast I want to see the mechanical swap dlc, am I the only one?			"

												There's good and bad, but overall, it's a worthwhile and entertaining game. The bad: Some things I found irritating was the whole ""Repair Bench"" system. For the most part you can repair most parts on it, and depending how  many points you have spent in the skill, you have up to a 90% chance of repairing a part. However there seems to be no rhyme or reason to which parts you can or cannot repair. For example, you can somehow repair brake shoes, but not brake discs. Another problem is with the repairs itself... As mentioned, you have up to a 90% chance of a successful repair if you purchase all the points for the repair bench. That may seem like a lot, however given that it may take up to 5 repairs on say an engine block, you really only have a 5 out of 9 chance of completely repairing it successfully. This means you may repair an expensive item up to 89% or so, but then fail your last roll and completely destroy it. How does that happen in real life? I have an almost brand new engine and somehow I totally ruin it beyond repair? I could understand letting it only repair up to a certain point, but the way the system works, even with full points in repair, you end up ruining more than half the parts you pull on any given repair job. Also... how the hell difficult is it to put an oil pan under the engine to avoid a $100 spill.The good: It's fun... But gets old fast. Not a lot of variety. Most cars are different only on the outside. If you've worked on one, you've worked on them all.			"

												I've always been interested in cars.  I come from a computer background so really autos are just another something to flex my nerd muscle.  In classic sim style, this game takes you through each challenge while at the same time leaving just enough room for diagnostic and troubleshooting on your own.  You don't have to be a mechanic to get into this game but at the same time it helps a little if you know the basic fundementals of auto mechanics.  It's not a racing game, it's a casual tinkering game that really gets you thinking.			"

												 Fist and foremost this game is a fun game and does teach about basic auto mechanics and theory. now that schools do not teach my favorite subject in high school. I recommend this game to up and coming moter heads. That being said I was dissappointed in no real use of tools. I had hoped to open the toolchesy and see all of the automotive tools of the trade. I think the company that made this game could approach snapon tools and be able to have their sponsership and the snapon brand name all over the toolsets and shops. Since this is the future autoshop class for teaching beginning motorheads, imagine have to use the right tools on the right bolts, the cursor turning into the tool, metric and standard sockets, torque wrenches and their settings, bolt tightning order. Since this game is a problem solving game it would be another level of problem solving. right now it is the removal order and assembly order. in the real world is the the right tool for the right job. for instance a disk brake caliper fails with its seals, the brake dissasembly detail is lacking especially in the drum type brakes, keppers, self adjuster, and parking brake arm to say the least is missing. The biggest offence I found in this game was that the piston is removed from the top, there is no unbolting the connecting rod cap from the bottom to remove the piston from the top. I see that with the DLC more detail is being done to the engines, again if the company that made this game would probably be able to get the cad data for all the ford line or cheve line of engines if the advertised those cars in the game. I am a digital artist by trade and have done many different car engines and cars for the major car manufactures. this is my list for 2016 auto machanic.1.Tools used for the various parts, you can start with the basic toolbox and get more snapon tools with experience points. specialty tools for specialty jobs. for body rapair all the different tools for that too.2.Transmission shop, where you can dissasemble and rebuild many different transmission types.3.Engine rebuild shop where you can take the worn out engines and rebore them, or resleeve them, rework the connecting rods, regrind valves, all the things an engine rebuilder does.4.More detailed, brake repair, sterring repair including power steering, rack and pinion, steering box repair.5. The whole nightmare of electrical repair, one of the most elusive repairs to auto machanic.6. Another nightmare of the cars vacume system.All of this to me would make a better simulation experience. To an already fun game to play.I am recommending this game to anybody who has no clue to basic repair theories. This is a great start to learning the ins and outs of how cars work.Buy this game so they will continue to make it better.I look forward to the next release. "

Even the tool controls do not show up so remember what buttons they are. Overall, good game if your into this kinda stuff.			"

												Just started to play the game. First time running the game there was no overlay or text on screen. Restart fixed this. Game seems pretty cool if you have ever taken apart a car before. It IS pretty realistic having to remove certain components before you can get to the part you are trying to fix/replace. The actual bolts do leave alot to be desired though. For instance when taking off a brake caliper there is no slide, boot, need to grease or brush/sand/grind. I realize this may be beyond the scope of the game/sim but the more realistic the better. People could actually learn something! Including me! I am no pro mechanic and im sure there is alot myself and others can learn from it. Overall so far I think its a pretty good start for this type of sim and im sure, in time, it will get even better and more realistic. I will be checking it out more.			"

												Fun game if you have an interest in cars and car mechanics.The game looks and feels great - you never feel like you're battling a crummy UI or awkward camera. Stripping parts is neither fast nor slow - gives the sense that you're tearing a machine down, rather than just automagically removing everything - this is always going to be hard to balance just right but I think the game gets as close as it needs to.The only thing I've found that I wish I could do is make recommendations to the customer. As it is every job has a minimum wear level - so any parts below a certain wear need to be replaced.  A good example of where I'd like this to work differently is if I'm doing a brake job and am replacing 3 brake pads - in reality this would never happen, you'd replace them all, even if the 4th isn't particularly worn.I don't really rate the driving aspects of the game - but it's not why I bought it so I can overlook it, and once you get the test path you don't really need to drive the cars anyway. If you're looking for a game more like Street Legal Racing then you might be dissapointed though.			"

												I'm a mechanic and I can say this game is pretty good. It's how you fix things in real life but the parts and detail are very well done. If this game had racing and performance parts this would be the next Motor City Online. I would drop more money for that option without a doubt. I am so tired of Need For Speed Racing games. I liked having to know a car and how to make it faster. Great game guys! Keep up the good work!			"

												Eh. Tearing down engines and suspensions is kinda interesting the first 7-8 times, but once you've seen all there is to see of those parts, there's not much point to it.  WAY too much mindless grinding to earn XP (like a week of your actual life) before you can move on to other interesting aspects like body work and restoration. These developers need to get over themselves. Cool idea though. 6/10.			"

												I wouldn't call this game ""fun"" per se (though it is) but instead, satisfying. As somebody who doesn't know much about wrenching cars, I've always envied friends of mine who were good at it. I'm not presuming this game has magically made me handy in the garage but I have learned a lot more than I knew before. I've even learned about cursing at a car in which I forgot some critical piece after a long re-assemble. I was interested in the title but didn't really expect much. It's turned out to be one of the most satisfying games I've played in a long time. My compliments to the developers.			"

												I agree with alot of people, that this game is fun, accurate, and enjoyable. But there is some main components missing from the game. Heres a few things I would like to see in the game. 1. One that is simple yet not avaliable, being able to just jump in behind the wheel and start the car to hear it run. 2. And to continue that thought,  what about realistic sounds? You get a repair order, complaining about a knocking sound in engine bay, or you will get a car that won't run. If you were able to turn the key over maybe that will help with the diagnostics of the repair. 3. Like many have stated, no hoses, no electrical work, no fuel/brake lines. You cant take the enegine out with a cherry picker than dismantle it. Being able to do actual body work instead of buying brand new body parts would be fun. 4. Also i see a tire machine in the shop but it has no use. Having the ability to change tires as they commonly go bad would be an awesome little perk. 5. I havent fully upgraded my ""repair %"" but it doesnt seem like theres many parts that are repairable. Not sure if you unlock more parts as you upgrade, if not than you should.			"

												So. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. The year is almost over, and I have a good 100 hours on this game, so it's about time for a review.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's definitely a very good game, it's informative in its own way, educational, and just plain fun, especially when you save up enough money and experience to expand your garage, get the paint shop, get the underground parking, and go to the auction house to buy wrecks you can fix up and sell for a profit.Of course, things are simplified a lot under the hood of each car you get to work on. I'm no mechanic, but I know enough of cars to have done maintenance on my own cars, and I have studied a lot of stuff for stories I write in which a character is an actual mechanic. There is in fact a funny thing about that; the game showed me painfully well how I got most of my knowledge about cars. It started in Dutch, as that is the language set on my laptop, and one of the first customer cars I got in showed a list that said there was a part that needed replacing. And I was all like; what the hell is that? So I saved and quit to menu, set the game language to English, started back up again, looked at the list, and went; Ohhh! Duh, a rubber bushing! Why didn't you just SAY so? I KNOW those! (And I know the name of that part mainly from watching YouTube videos of HotRod Magazine/HotRod Garage, and reading those kind of magazines - in English. For about 70% of the parts, I have NO clue what they are by the Dutch names alone)How simplified is it under the hood? Well, all cars have similar parts, for one. A front suspension has a crossmember, shocks, springs, a swaybar and end links, steering rack with inner and outer tie rods, upper and/or lower control arms, wheel knuckle housing, wheel hub, brake disk, pads, and a brake caliper. All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.The engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!But, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.For the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.There's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.And the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.The same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)Still, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.Do I recommend this game though? Hell yes!			"

												Heard a funny noise under the hood of my car this morning and opened it up to take a look. Tried to right click to diagnose the problem and realized I only play a mechanic on TV.Played 3 hours the first time I turned it on. Very addicting because every time you finish a job, you end up saying, ""ok just one more."" Then you say, ""But now I only need one or two more for a tool upgrade."" Then you look at the clock and realize you are not actually making money and need to get up for work at your actual job soon.The graphics are great. The learning curve is easy. On top of that I'm learning how cars go together. The upgrades are cool and the facility unlocks are also cool. I love the soundtrack.I got this on sale for like 7 bucks. $20 is worth it for someone who likes cars. I just like management games and I was looking for more management such as have a crew of technicians and what not but this doesn't have that. Not disappointed with what it is though. Good game.			"

This game suggest simulation and like many others say who are experianced at this in real life half of the problems in reality do not occure in game torque specs on bolts amazing idea there is important things that should be detailed more or less im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause i wana drive what i build also custom motors and more parts. I paid $30 for street legal around 2003 and that game tops this still i expected more this is more or less the same as 2014 version that looks better.. Its been hyped up way more then it should...

												The game itself is well made (graphically, etc.), but skimping with different motor types and mechanical challenges (only 4 motorypes plus the ""make no money Maluch""). So it becomes repetetive very quickly, even with addons. No more goal to reach. No sense in playing along, while neither XP nore money will give you any additional benefit. You're able to get all XP upgrades pretty early and then... nothing. Never be able to reach 100% though. A showroom for done cars is missing. And ""designing"" the shop means actually just different colors and floors, which is lame. In this state, I would presume the game is an early access. "

												""Just one more car, then I'll sleep.""I was lucky to catch this game during a Steam sale but would have been just as happy to pay full price. Nice graphics, no bugs or glitches that interrupt gameplay and, overall, it can be quite therapeutic (as long as you don't need to replace a crankshaft). Jobs become more difficult as you progress, requiring you to take advantage of upgrades and unlockable extensions for your garage to make life a little easier. Although some car parts can be a little hard to find, you don't need to be a petrol head to enjoy playing. 10/10, would recommend to anyone 16 or above.			"

												I have to say i like this. I work on cars for a living and although this isn't really close to the actual job, it's fun. In fact i think it's fun for that reason. I've played this a ton and frankly the only cons i can see are that the game needs more models to work on ( there really can't ever be enough ) Maybe a more in depth way to mod cars, a race track or drag strip would be cool, and MOST importantly....this game really really needs the ability to import your own MP3's so that you can listen to whatever you want while you wrench. I cannot overstate this enough. But it is playable and very fun the way it is now, and i am looking forward to seeing where the developers take it in the future.			"

All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.The engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!But, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.For the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.There's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.And the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.The same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)Still, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.Do I recommend this game though? Hell yes!			"

												There are only so many ways you change a tire (or what have you)...so extremely repetive.That being said, addictive as heck if you are in to click-and-point stuff and car engineering in general. Fairly steady supply of patches and dlcs so far, so while being the same ""fix broken stuff"" keeps things semi-fresh. Only once you've maxxed out your shop and filled up your garage you really run out of stuff to do (at that point money isn't an issue either).The expert mode is a good addition once you're familiar with the game as it adds an extra layer to the fixes (only gives a generic fault description ie. ""bad brakes"", parts do not light up: you have to know where they are and in which order they come apart, and so on).I would like some more ""realism"" like seized bolts and general mishaps that happen in real life like parts breaking on disassembly, a more advanced part repair system, more fluids, electrical and wireing. Things of that nature.This game sure does teach an appreciation of ""half-a$$ing"" a fix.- Replace brake disc, check- Brake pads are at 51%....replace? Naah, they're just fine.			"

												The game itself is well made (graphically, etc.), but skimping with different motor types and mechanical challenges (only 4 motorypes plus the ""make no money Maluch""). So it becomes repetetive very quickly, even with addons. No more goal to reach. No sense in playing along, while neither XP nore money will give you any additional benefit. You're able to get all XP upgrades pretty early and then... nothing. Never be able to reach 100% though. A showroom for done cars is missing. And ""designing"" the shop means actually just different colors and floors, which is lame. In this state, I would presume the game is an early access. "

												I do like this game however it gets boring fast with nothing to invest money in other then cars you can't drive on a street or a good race track, I think the creators of this game need to look deep into Street Legal Racing Redline this has potencial and street legal racing even know its old was and still is amazing you build your car in the same way with little less detail on running gear parts nothing modders didnt fix... This game suggest simulation and like many others say who are experianced at this in real life half of the problems in reality do not occure in game torque specs on bolts amazing idea there is important things that should be detailed more or less im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause i wana drive what i build also custom motors and more parts. I paid $30 for street legal around 2003 and that game tops this still i expected more this is more or less the same as 2014 version that looks better.. Its been hyped up way more then it should...

												I have all of the DLC's for this game, and I don't regret it, however I do wish the dev's would stop releasing DLC. i've spent more on DLC than the actual game. If you want to have good game play, you're going to have to buy a few of the DLC packs to have access to more cars. I do like having actual branded cars, because they're fun to work on. I have about 26 hours in this game, and every min of those hours, I've been working on cars, it does what the name is. The graphics are great, the game play is great, and over all it's a good game. I get a solid 60 FPS all the time on max out settings with no issue. However there are a few bugs, if you have too many cars in the garages, your game wont load them and you have to make a new game save. If you're looking for a good simulator, this is the way to go. Buy the game and all of the DLC's and you'll have a great time.			"

												A friend said to me, ""hey, try this game, it's fun."" I said, ""It sounds stupid. But I'll try it.""So I bought it. Pro:Get a way better understanding of how a car is put together by taking it apart. It'll even tell you (on easy) if you've missed a part before you send it out.It's actually fun to diagnose and fix the cars.Simple and goal driven. Find the broken part, replace the broken part.Cons:Can't buy more than one part at a time; parts in use usually come in pairs, and many bushings are always needed to be replaced at once usually.Gets kinda samey.Clicking on a drive train to take it off is more effort than it should be.Future:Would love if a multiplayer component was added (coop & vs).Would love if the shop could be expanded and workers could be hired and managed. (Go from tiny one lift garage to mechanic babylon!)Would love to have the option to be ""known"" for things; Sending out bad cars gets a rep for bad work, stellar performance gets more work, and the option for specialized tuning or performance enhancement.Would love to occasionally work on commercial or farm vehicles as a change of pace.It's fun for an hour or so to rip apart someone's car and wonder what kind of driver they are; resist the urge to replace more parts because the parts on the car are at 64% and the minimum to leave is 62%. Do what I did, try the demo.			"

												Yes my review says I DO NOT recommend this game and it is not because it is bad. It is amazing as it really does simulate being a mechanic, its tedious, repetetive and will sometimes get frustrating. Now having said that it is a lot simpler than being an actual mechanic as it does not go into extreme detail. It is a very simplified game, and this brings me to what it really is. A game. This lies somewhere in the middle of being a game and a simulator, its way too repetitive to be any kind of fun as a game but it doesn't quite get to the detail to make it fun as a simulator.So in summary Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives a very good feeling of what it is like to BE a mechanic but is terrible at simulating working on cars. It is a confused game and is not really a simulator. I really did expect more.I am not saying don't buy it, just do a little more research first so you know what your getting into.			"

												I like it for what it is.  A simplified instructional simulation on how cars are basically put together.  It's got a bit of a learning curve but once you've done a couple of brake jobs you can knock it out in no time.  You can upscale the learning by then looking at your own car and try and identify the parts.  I drive a 2002 Jeep Wrangler so there actually are similarities.All in all it's fun learning a bit about how to tear cars apart and put them back together without all the chemicals, fumes, rust, dirt, busted knuckles, sweat, and uncomfortable crawling around a car.  Plus it won't let you put it back together wrong and it does guide you through what components you need to to add/remove before the next step of the buildup/breakdown.The car selections I encountered were mostly european looking cars with a few classic muscle type cars.  I presume alot of the content has pantenting and tradmarking so modern cars aren't readily available.  I probably need to check out the mods to find different cars.			"

												This game is a massive improvement to CMS14 in every meaningful way, and will help to quickly fill in the gaps to your car knowledge. As with any simulator, there is only so far that you can go to make it feel like the real thing, but in terms of interactive, consumer-grade media, this is probably the best thing on the market right now.The game can get a little repetitive at times, but I'm sure being an actual car mechanic gets a little repetetive too, particularly if you were to specialize in a limited field (like Japanese import transmissions, etc.). This game allows you to work on all aspects of a car, and for the most part, you can strip the cars down to the bone. The upgrade system is kind of a grind, but overall the pacing feels right. If you start a traditional game, the vehicles will have lists of the parts that need replacing, which can be highlighted on the car and identified easily. Over time, the lists will start to identify fewer and fewer parts, and force you to have to search for them and inspect manually. The projects themselves also become increasingly complicated. This system feels like it's rewarding your learning, and it's an empowering feeling. In general I detest the business model in games nowadays -- especially from major studios/publishers -- that basically forces you to buy 'modules' in the form of DLC that should have been included at launch by default. This game does that, but doesn't feel like you're being robbed either. You may only be interested in learning the SUV/Truck or an old Mini, so in that sense it works and makes sense here. In this setting. it doesn't subtract from the gameplay or force you to purchase the ending/continuation of the story, so I can't knock it too much.In a relatively limited timeframe, you will probably be able to name every single part on a car, regardless of the engine/vehicle type. If that is your goal, you can't miss this one. Can't wait to see what they do with the next iteration.			"

												I love this game. It's a great game to unwind to, zone out, and just get lost while listening to music, or hell, even the game's really cool soundtrack.If you're new to cars, or have an intermediate proficiency, then you really will probably learn something from it. A few folks complain about it not being accurate or realistic, and it isn't, but it gives you a very general overview of how cars are put together and how to take them apart. If you're at all a gearhead, or at all enjoy tinkering, puzzle games, or relaxing games, then this is for you.			"

												This is a great game and is the only mechanic simulator that has pulled me away from my 1999 GearHead Garage. It is similar in some ways but is very updated in graphics and ingame technology you get to use. The only thing I miss is the Junkyard, being able to buy and sell parts to it. And there is really no tutorial. Pros------Great graphics.Highly Detailed.Good variety of cars and parts.Use of modern technology.Infinite amount of jobs you can do.Cons-----------No junkyard.Needs more indepth tutorial.You will never see your family again.You have not bought it yet.P.s If you are looking for a sign to buy it. This is it.			"

												Let me start off i say no for following reasons, Lack of home work and its obvious lugs are wrong its nut on not lug in, no vacum, obd does not give those results, no a/c or heating system, or one of the most improtant yet most problematic emissions, and the list goes on. they need to get a master mechaic or a couple of them and DO IT RIGHT i have worked in the field for some time now and was thinking of a training simulator for new people.so heres some adivies do not buy it to learn how to fix cars you'll only get in over your head and make a small or large problem even worse. instead buy it to relax or understand some very very basic mechanics.

												This game is great. It reminds me of an old game I used to play called Gearhead Garage. This is kind of a casual game I can sit and play without worrying about whether or not I'm winning.The upgrades system seems a little slow to me, but with some effort you can unlock everything. The upgrade system kind of matches how much money you have along the way anyway so waiting just gets you where you need to be.			"

												I love the game and would highly recommend it however, it could give you more detail about the car parts and the consequences of driving without them and with them damaged. In addition i would like to have help with lining up the oil drain because,i keep getting charged $100 and i don't like. Ultimately, i recommend the game and it is definately worth £14.99			"

												I brought this last year and was how can I say underwhelmed by the game.But this year is a whole new ball game it is enjoyable to play because of the goal of restoring cars and selling them for profit.Personally I wish there was a game just for that, but this is the closest we have at the moment. Whilst you have to grind your way to get to the buy and selling stage (yep its not open from the begining) but you have to grind you way through countless oil changes, gearbox changes, timing belts or running gear to get enough money to open your parking lot and go to the auction for cars.Sure the grind sucks (but which games doesnt have a grind element to it) and they seem to be releasing new cars. A couple of things I would like to see change is moving the oilpan over to the lifts instead of by the waiting area (hate having to drag the thing acroos the garage every time i load the game)But all in all a vast improvement on last year			"

												I think this is a really well put together game and it's actually interesting to play if you're a car person.I like working on my own project car and I learn as I go (IRL) and this certainly has helped me with some language, part names, and some basics of where things are and how they are connect. As far as gameplay goes it flows quite well, and navigating around your vehicle is 95% of the time smooth and easy. It could use some achievements though and other things to work towards while you're trying to get those XP points to unlock stuff - it gets kind of repetitive when you have a large gap of XP before the next thing you can unlock.

												I have kicked out considebilly more hours on this game compered to Car mechanic Simulator 2014.I found this one far more enjoyable where im feeling i was achieving something, like to better my skills better my garage and to buy rusty old knackared cars, Strip them apart repair what i can and put it all back together with 100% confition parts so it was like new.Dont get me wrong there is pleanty of areas for improvements but by far an enjoyable Simulator especially if your into cars and like myself do all my car repair work at home myself.Pros:Nice selection of cars diffrencing from little 4 Cylinder OHV engines to big V8 Quad cam enginesCustomisation of the body i.e. put sportier bumpers on etc and diffrent wheelsAbility to paint and do through checks before putting car on ramp to fixEverything can be dissasembled so all you can be left with is the shell and interiorConsLacking some vital parts of the engine like ECU and sensors i.e. MAF sensor Cam sensor etc would make for more realismAbility to start the engine when rebuilt on the ramp, Nothing better than rebuilding an engine and turning the key to hear it fire for the first timeHave to do correct cam and crank timingRebuild cylinder heads by changing valves and stem seals and springs etcBe able to do engine conversions put a bigger engine in a smaller engined carA rolling road to test the power output of the car see where it is losing power or where your gainingThese are a few of the Pro's and cons i can think of right now i know there is more cons as i know where i would like to see improvement done, My biggest con to this game is Loading times, My PC is not big Spec i run a Core 2 Quad Q6600 with 4GB Ram and a Saphire HD 7970 Titan X 3GB Graphics card and game is installed on a Western Digital Black 1TB hard drive and the loading between road tests and going back to garage can be as ong as over a Minute which is really Frustrating, Maybe a diffrent case in installed on a SSD but very frustrating to have these load Times.All in all i Would Highley recomend this game as i have had Fair few hours of enjoyment from this and will continue to have More			"

												Game is very intuitive and for someone like me who knows very little about car parts it can teach you quite a bit. It also eases you into the game slowly, giving you easy things to do at the start then getting more complicated as you gain experience. Just be careful you use ALL the tools at your disposal, unlike what I did below.Had a job where one of the problems was a lack of power.Used the test track and test path, no luck finding the problem.Took absolutely everything out of the engine bay, couldn't find the problem either.Remembered I had an electronic meter I earned earlier in the game which I could use. The problem was the fuel pump in the fuel tank at the back of the car.Smacked myself in the head, replaced the fuel pump and had to put the whole engine back together.10/10 would do it again.			"

												This game is repetitive and a little mindless. With that said, I am somehow addicted to it. Why? I can't say. I usually ponder this question as I repair cars for cash & XP or restore an old lemon back to showroom condition. It could use a wider selection of cars. There should be a huge range of cars from different eras. Start from the model T Ford leading up to space age concept cars and beyond. Super hero cars, like the Batmobile would be cool. Motorcycles would also be cool.			"

It obviously doesn't substitue for actual mechanical knowledge, but it will help you if you want to do minor mainainance on your vehicle without having to ask where to put the oil in after you drain it for an oil change. It's quite stress relieving, and is very calming for a ""simulator"" game.The only cons I can really think of is the fact that some people might not like the techno/electronic music that plays, but it's easily turned off.

												Other people have said this before but this isn't really a sim. This is more of a puzzle game involving various car and engine parts. The great thing about it is that there are several types of engines to fix, each with there own unique parts. Fixing them is a lot of fun but the thing i like the most about it is buying cars at an auction and completely restore it and then sell it for big profits. It takes a while to get enough experience and buy the upgrades necessary to do so but its a lot of fun. One car consist out of so many parts and it can be a little tricky when you disassemble them and replace all the defective parts. The only downside to this game are the long loading times (considering the game has to load a lot of parts) and even on a PC that exceeds way above the minimum specs may take a several moments. All in all, this doesn't form much of a problem to me. Another thing i don't like is the music in this game. It's all dubstep and its like listening to a 56k modem making musical tones. Luckily, it can be turned off so that you can play your own music.     All in all, its a great game and the DLC adds new features and cars. Currently, there's a Mercedes-Benz DLC that adds the 300 SL Gullwing and the 560 SEC. There are more real life cars to come, now that the developers acquired the license for Maserati. Can't wait!

												So much, yet so little..,First of all, I thoroughly enjoy this game, I really do. I find myself perpetually visiting the site in order to see what new features and DLCs are available to satisfy this newly created obsession of putting wonderful machines together in different ways that I could never hope to afford on a garbage man's salary.When I first purchased Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, it was one of those titles on my wishlist that I'd hoped would finally give me enough of that car-mod junkie fix I was looking for. My feelings might be mixed on that one though. I played a game called Street Legal Racing (Redline) for a while that allowed you to put some cars together, but was extremely limited without the plethora of User Mods available out there (unfortunately, they cause the game to crash as often as -insert expletive here). What it did do right however, was the customizeability, and a nod to the racing genre if you felt like pursuing the in-game ""game"".Ok, let's start with what CMS 2015 is not. It is not a ""Need For Speed"" clone, and that is Ok. As titillating as the prospect of racing a hard worked, hard earned car is around a fictional Nürburgring facsimile with 15 sirens blaring in the background, I am of the mind that even with a AAA budget, you can either do one thing or the other very well but not both. CMS 2015 focuses on the simulatory aspects of building up your virtual baby with a level of detail that pleases and surprises.You start out with a workshop and some car repair jobs to choose from. As you progress, you gain some cash and leveling points that you can spend on equipment and such. Without delving into too many details so as to stay on point, you get to purchase or fix different components ranging from the suspension to the engine and really get into the ""nuts and bolts"" of things. After 20 or so hours and a real sense of accomplishment, I felt myself wishing that I could get even further detail into the parts I was dealing with. I was satisfied with changing things like cylinder heads and screwing on the bolts, but I kind of felt like ""where is the head gasket?"" That pesky thing that once caused me an overdraft and a scolding from my manager for coming in late. Another thing I desperately wanted, was to take Mr. Bean's car and drop some American V8 muscle in it with 21 inch rims and a boeing wing for downforce. Unfortunately and inexplicably, you can't! It seems to me that the foundations of the game are solid enough to support this though and I do really hope to see something like this very soon. In conclusion, the aspects that are included are very well polished. The assortment of cars work as unique puzzles that need specific pieces to fit in the right order and give you a greater appreciation than the sum of their parts. Yet, more detailed problems can be fleshed out to create greater challenges, as well as interesting combinations that could increase the longevity of the game (not to mention better custom modding) by leaps and bounds.Either way, I want more!

												I bought this game as a backer on Kickstarter, and let me tell you money well spent. The first chance I got to play it I was up all night playing this. This is crazy addictive if you are into the mechanics of a car. The auction is probably a favorite for me. Buy the rust bucket, strip it down completely, refurbish or buy new parts, spray it any color you want, test drive it, and just keeps going. You get experience as you are taking each piece off, granted it\'s only 1 XP per part, but you use that experience to gain upgrades to how fast you unbolt/bolt parts together, disassemble, a tablet so you don\'t have to keep running back to the computer, and a few other things. You also use this experience to unlock new areas of the shop. You gain money for completing a job order, use that and the experience to unlock parts of the shop. The money is also good to gain for cars at the auction, when you\'re experienced enough you can get yourself a parking garage to store your cars. The DLC\'s add such a great taste to it for all types of gearheads out there, whether you are into sporty cars or muscles, maybe even trucks. They thought of everyone when making the DLC\'s for this game. Granted there are no name brand vehicles for legal reasons I assume. Still, the cars are nice. I highly recommend this game, it\'s real addicting.			"

												I like it for what it is.  A simplified instructional simulation on how cars are basically put together.  It's got a bit of a learning curve but once you've done a couple of brake jobs you can knock it out in no time.  You can upscale the learning by then looking at your own car and try and identify the parts.  I drive a 2002 Jeep Wrangler so there actually are similarities.All in all it's fun learning a bit about how to tear cars apart and put them back together without all the chemicals, fumes, rust, dirt, busted knuckles, sweat, and uncomfortable crawling around a car.  Plus it won't let you put it back together wrong and it does guide you through what components you need to to add/remove before the next step of the buildup/breakdown.The car selections I encountered were mostly european looking cars with a few classic muscle type cars.  I presume alot of the content has pantenting and tradmarking so modern cars aren't readily available.  I probably need to check out the mods to find different cars.			"

												Yes my review says I DO NOT recommend this game and it is not because it is bad. It is amazing as it really does simulate being a mechanic, its tedious, repetetive and will sometimes get frustrating. Now having said that it is a lot simpler than being an actual mechanic as it does not go into extreme detail. It is a very simplified game, and this brings me to what it really is. A game. This lies somewhere in the middle of being a game and a simulator, its way too repetitive to be any kind of fun as a game but it doesn't quite get to the detail to make it fun as a simulator.So in summary Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives a very good feeling of what it is like to BE a mechanic but is terrible at simulating working on cars. It is a confused game and is not really a simulator. I really did expect more.I am not saying don't buy it, just do a little more research first so you know what your getting into.			"

												I bought this game mostly for educational purposes. It was sometimes a shame to talk to a car mechanic and have no idea what he was talking about. So I wanted to get a bit of basic knoweledge of how is car made and what car mechanic really does. I must admit that this worked quite fine. Now I know where fuel pump is, how is clutch installed and that a good mechanic can literaly tear the engine apart taking out even pistons.Apart from that this game is really fun to play. You can see different concepts between modern cars and oldtimers. To not get you bored you can unlock some more features like possbility to paint cars or buy cars on auctions. Unfortunately even with these features the game quite quickly becomes repetitive.What really the game lacks is the feel of running your own workshop. It seems you do all the stuff buy yourself but there is no real economical model. You have unlimited number of orders, if you buy car parts you get them instantly, there are no factors like time or costs of failrues. You don't compete with other enterpreises, nobody cares if you are good or not.What I would really like to see is a model where dissasembly of a single part takes some time which is limited in a day. This would promote one to look for most obvious solutions rather than dissasemling the whole engine and looking randomly at the parts. I would like to have to wait several days (or weeks) for the parts I order, therefore I would have to run a storage in which I would keep most common parts to have them instantly and a parking with limited space for my orders. Time should be money, so you should be better paid for quicker repairs. I would like to have the possibility to estimate the price of repair to the customer and inform him next day that I was wrong and ask for his decision. I would like to have the possibility to hire other mechanics to do some work I got bored with myself. They game will not punish you for doing stupid things like - when you change the brake pad in one wheel you should change it in the other one even if its fine. Game only checks if a part is above requested realibility threshold and then it's considered correct. When you take of the pistons you would at least need to change the seals but in this game you can just install them back without any other costs. In oder words you are not punished by uneffective work at all.This game has a great potential which unfortunately was overlooked by the developers. They made a good game while they could make a perfect simulation. I still recommend this game if you want to learn some basics about the cars, but keep in mind that apart from dissasembling and assembling there is really no more depth inside and you migh get bored quite quickly.

												This is one of those games I was unsure if I would get into, or if it would just sit unplayed in my list. I can honestly say I'm already addicted to it. It's really relaxing, but also gives you a great sense of achievement. It felt great to get my paint shop up and running, and now I'm chasing the XP and money to get parking so I can get auction buys. I have a keen interest in cars in real life so was wary that this could be a let down, but the opposite is true. I couldn't recommend it more. Well done.

												The game is good for getting familiar with the part names and such.. but it doesnt make you a mechanic, it doesn't specify the parts functions and theres some inaccuracies.. for instance.. the brake have no tubes leading to them which is something that bothered me since i started in cms2014.. Also parts would fall on the floor if u disassembled certain parts.. but they float in this game without a problem.. You actually take apart the spring within the car.. which i would absolutely not recommend doing in real life.. since it will probably damage the hood of your car.. if not your face..Even with all these inaccuracies..

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a huge improvement to the 2014 edition. The game allows for some real hands-on fun, and you'll keep busy with the option of having multiple vehicles in your garage at one time. At the beginning, the game can seem very tideous, with everything being slow moving. But as you get along in the game, things become faster, and simpler. Add in the DLC content for more fun, and you've got a great all-around game to enjoy for hours.On that note, while I highly recommend this game to car sim guys and lovers of the old school Gearhead Garage, this game is not for low-resource computers/laptops. I'm using a Toshiba Satellite laptop, and it can barely handle the game on low settings. If you're running an old PC/laptop, you're going to miss out on this game's potential.			"

												I've only played a couple of hours so far, but I can already tell that this is a superior game. I'm enjoying it.I don't know anything about cars. Car Mechanic Simulator won't make me a mechanic. It doesn't go that deep. But it is teaching me what the various main components of a car look like, where they are, and as a driver, what a symptom would be if such and such a part went bad.The game brings you in slowly, in the beginning showing you a list of what needs to be replaced in any car that comes in and making sure you don't screw anything up. I've had no problem figuring out what is going on. The graphics/sounds are nice and smooth.I can't categorize this... perhaps I could say it's a puzzle game that also teaches you a little bit of real world info. But I can recommend this. Pick it up. No reason to be intimidated. The less you know about cars, the better this game will be for you.			"

Game is missing basic essentials to a vehicle which is a killer for me but alot of the other components are there. For a simulator it is very lack luster. I can see where the game wanted to go presuming others agree with this review, they did as well. It just hasnt happened yet or it wont happen. I will continue to play and wait for updates(DLC as well). This may seem like a negative review, it isnt. Its a fun game worth the money but be ready for some serious repetitiveness after about 10 hours depending on how much an individual plays.			"

Or changing a rear end in a Camaro or Challenger, the blower on a Hellcat, the heater core in a Blazer (look that one up). Nope not here.I just didn't enjoy it.

												Car Mechanic Simulator (henceforth CMS) 2015 is a distinct improvement over what was offered with CMS 2014. The fact that you can choose what jobs to accept or decline is very nice, especially as you are starting out and may not know where a particular problem might lie. However, where I think this game really shines is being able to buy a heap for cheap, gut it, repair what parts you are able, replace the rest, and sell it for a tidy profit. You may also elect to keep it for yourself, but there is little to do with it if you do, other than to simply look at it. My recommendation to any new players of the game is to do enough jobs to save up a bit of money, then start buying and fixing up cars from the auction. You can bet that the price of the car is going to double or triple in the auction house, and I would say to save up enough money to possibly double THAT amount before you start fixing things up. Until you really level up your repair skill (something I would definitely focus on fairly early on), you'll probably need to buy parts to replace all of the ones that you fail to repair. All of that aside, here is how I would evaluate the game:The Good:- Fixing up old cars and selling them is fantastic. This is where this game shines, and the enjoyment of this outweighs all of the negative points of this game put together. At the time of this review, I have clocked a little over 30 hours on the game, and I periodically return to it simply to do this. Although a little unrealistic, it's very satisfying to take something that's absolute garbage and get it into like-new condition, and there is a hefty bonus for selling a car that is in 100% condition.- Leveling up your skills as a mechanic is now separate from money, which you will be needing for the purchase of cars when you get tired of doing work orders.- Havng the garage means that you can hang onto a car that you really like, and it can be expanded with plenty of space for you to collect them all.- Fixing parts is free, but it has the possibility of breaking them, as well. This means that many jobs can be done quite cheaply, and this further increases the potential for profit in selling cars.- The game looks very nice and runs smoothly, at least on my computer.- The core gameplay of removing and replacing parts is executed well, and most things are pretty efficient, although it would be nice to have a side-by-side for your inventory and the shop.The Bad:- There is very little to do with cars once they are fixed up, other than sell them or send them to the garage. However, I don't really like driving or racing games, so this has little bearing on my opinion of the game.- Accessibility of parts is kind of an issue. Even if you are doing things in the most efficient way possible, you have to use the lift multiple times to get at every single part. The worst culprit by far is the crankshaft (and, by extension, the engine block). You have to use the lift once to remove the oil pan and the pieces keeping the crankshaft in place, another time to remove the pistons (and any other engine parts required to get at them), and once more to get the crankshaft out. Then, if you need to get at the engine block itself, it's a FOURTH go on the lift to get it out once the crankshaft has been removed. This is all a pretty minor gripe at the end of the day, and it may be fairly realistic, but it's still kind of annoying.- Even with the convenience of the PDA, which makes it so that you can buy parts without having to run back to your desk, the shop menu is separate from your inventory screen. This means that it can be cumbersome to buy a lot of parts to replace those that you have broken when fixing up an old junker.- Collecting oil requires you to be a sniper. Don't bother with it. Just pay the $100 cleanup fee.- Parts that you are repairing break quite often. When fully leveled, you have a 90% chance to repair a part, but you do not FULLY repair it. This means that you roll those dice multiple times per part. They really should've had a decrease in condition by a random amount if that 10% chance comes up, but instead, the thing is totally borked. So if you have a part that is in poor condition so that you need to hit ""repair"" 4 times to get it fully to 100%, then you actually have a chance that is 90%*90%*90%*90%, or about 66% chance of getting it fully repaired and 34% chance of breaking it entirely and paying to replace it. That may not sound bad, but that is what it is like when you're at max level. - DLC. Gross. Well, it's not AWFUL, but here's the thing: the ""Gold"" version of this game only includes some of the DLC. Most of the rest of it adds actual brand name vehicles to the lineup. So, since they have to pay to use those brands, it makes some sense. Even so, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to buy the Gold version and not even get the majority of the DLC.The Ugly:- The game actually looks very nice on the whole, but the textures for new parts sometimes doesn't say ""shiny chrome"" so much as it does ""plastic thing painted to look like shiny chrome.""- Some of the paint colors are pretty awful.... well, just like with real-life cars, truthfully. Many of them are quite nice, but it seems like you're more likely to wind up with something pretty ugly. You can paint them a new color, but you really can't preview a car's color very well in the paint shop without paying to have it painted, which means that tweaking that color can get kinda expensive.

												Just started to play the game. First time running the game there was no overlay or text on screen. Restart fixed this. Game seems pretty cool if you have ever taken apart a car before. It IS pretty realistic having to remove certain components before you can get to the part you are trying to fix/replace. The actual bolts do leave alot to be desired though. For instance when taking off a brake caliper there is no slide, boot, need to grease or brush/sand/grind. I realize this may be beyond the scope of the game/sim but the more realistic the better. People could actually learn something! Including me! I am no pro mechanic and im sure there is alot myself and others can learn from it. Overall so far I think its a pretty good start for this type of sim and im sure, in time, it will get even better and more realistic. I will be checking it out more.			"

												Pretty fun. Later on, once they stop telling you exactly which parts are bad, it turns into kind of a puzzle game, where you look at the description of the problem and start picking at likely culprits. Overall, super neat, snag it when it's on sale definitely, possibly full price too.			"

												As someone who really works on cars, I'd say this is a failry accurate mechanic sim without the grazed knuckles and frustration of hard to get to bolts.Very similar to games such as Gearhead Garage and Street Legal, this game puts you in charge of your own workshop. You make money fixing customers cars which you can then spend on buying cars at auction. The auction cars always need some work, when the work is complete you can either add the car to your garage, or sell it for a profit.I am restoring a DeLorean in real life so I also grabbed the DeLorean DLC. It's pretty accurate, although some things in the engine bay are in the wrong place and the DeLorean in this game has a power steering pump instead of an A/C unit, but I understand this is probably a limitation of the game engine. It did feel weird taking the mix unit and intake manifold off to inspect the Valley of Death as I have done on my own DeLorean.I've had hours of fun, the only downside to the game is it can get repetitive. quite a lot of the customer jobs are big jobs such as rebuilding the entire front and back suspension system, which is time consuming and monotonous. Having said that, life as a real mechanic would be very similar. There is also not much you can do with your own cars once they have been rebuilt, apart from sit in them or take them around a test track.Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in pulling cars and engines to bits and at the moment this is probably THE best game on the market for anyone wanting a modern Gearhead Garage clone.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 (CMS 15) is exactly what is sounds like: a car mechanic simulator. The player takes the role of a mechanic in your very own garage. As you build up a good reputation and learn more, you get to work on harder, more complex vehicles. You are given hints early on to help you determine exactly what parts to fix or replace, but soon those nice yellow outlines will disappear, and you're on your own. Cars get nicer, and so do your payouts.Car Mechanic Sim is literally all I hoped it to be. I wanted to learn more about how cars come together, and it did the job perfectly for me. While it's not a 100% accurate simulation, the game does a good job of giving you the gist of certain aspects of how a car works. Before playing CMS15, I wouldn't have known how suspension even works in cars. I really like working on older cars, such as muscle cars and other little classic cars, because of how different they are from modern designs, especially the engines and the suspension setups.ProsGood basic learning toolLots of inexpensive DLCs to expand the gameplay (licensed brands, tuning options)Good array of cars parodied from real-world vehicles.ConsNot a full car simulation! It's a mechanic sim!Gets progressively more difficult (could be interpreted either way really, just putting it in the cons because it has more weight as a con) The gameplay is a bit repetitive after a while. You may like to try the challenge mode to mix things up a bit!Final Thoughts:CMS is a good way to pass time and learn something while doing it!Rating: 9.0/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. I'm not really that into cars, but there was something strangely satisfying about figuring out what was wrong with the cars and then fixing them. Then it was fun buying junkers in auctions, stripping them down, and rebuilding them. But it all got a bit repetitive after a while. After I'd torn apart every kind of engine and suspension there wasn't much left new to discover. The game could be a lot deeper if it was harder to get parts for some of the cars. Then rebuilding them would be much more of a challenge. But after a while, money is plentiful and you can basically get any part you want, so there's not much challenge any more. Anyway, I still recommend it and enjoyed my time with the game. I got a good 25 hours out of it before feeling like I had seen everything.			"

												I recommend this game only to people that want to learn about cars and all of the parts. This game should be a prerequisite training for AutoZone staff, or people that want to have a general understanding of what they're talking about around mechanics and other car people. If you already know it all, you probably won't enjoy this game.2015 is MUCH better than the previous 2014 version. A lot of the navigational frustrations and problematic kinks have been worked out, making the disassembly and assembly of the parts a breeze. When you're unable to remove a part due to another part in the way, the game now highlights the obstacle part for you. In this way the game is highly focused on teaching you, rather than challenging you to show off what you already know. If you already know everything about cars, this game will seem very repetitive and dull. The game counters this by changing the types of engines and cars that arrive so that you will familiarize yourself with searching for the same parts in different car-model setups and slowly introducing additional concepts such as compression checks, electrical meters, OBD, etc.But for players that want to learn, it's a perfect example of gaming that can teach you something that you can use in life. We already see other games that do this in teaching instruments: Synthesia teaches piano, Rocksmith teaches guitar, etc. This is another example of gaming with UTILITY!!!The game goes a bit further with integrating real-life scenarios and descriptions of car problems that mechanics may face such as ""my steering is loose,"" ""my brakes are loud,"" and ""there's not much power in the engine."" Is it as close to real-life as possible? Of course not. It's very basic, but not a substitute for hands-on experience. IRL, mechanics will be cursing at the rusted bolt that won't loosen until it slips and they bloody up their knuckles. They'll spend hours trying to figure out an anomoly and burn their elbows on an exhaust manifold and proceed to throw their wrench across the garage and storm off for a smoke break. So you have to give it credit for what it does best - teaches basic car parts and understanding. This is also not a game where you try to rush through to gain XP and money. That will just set you up for getting annoyed that you have to change out yet another stupid brake disk when it's the 5th one you've changed in the past hour. It's designed to teach through repetition, at times.A few of the bad: the camera angles can be a bit tricky to view the parts, but it has been dramatically improved over CM Sim 2014. Some of the tasks can be repetitive as I mentioned earlier. The upgrades and rewards aren't phenomenal. In conclusion, a great game and learning tool. I'd like to see more of these simulators that offer utility, not just entertainment alone. "

												First of all, for me, I love cars, I love working on them, driving them, and maintaining them. I remember when CMS2014 released, and the controls for that game were extremely wonky and awkward to work with, so when I picked up the 2015 edition, I wasn't expecting much. But I'm very happy I was wrong. This game is so much better in many different aspects, while retaining a lot of complexity from the previous game while adding some very nice additions, like being able to buy cars to restore and sell. The upgrade system gets very grindy at first, but after a while, the upgrades help you progress more quickly and help you earn money faster. There are a few things I do hope they add to the game, like actual track testing and additional performance parts, which would make the game even better and more immersive, instead of only having engine parts available. My only other complaint would be the limited variety in vehicles, engines, and engine swap options, because the game starts becoming more motonous once you have a collection of cars.Overall, this game is very immersive and has a very fair learning curve, and even helps people that arent knowledgeable about vehicles learn the basics of automotive repair. If you love cars, this is a must-have.			"

												Lots of fun, with only a couple downsides. I definitely recommend giving it a try, especially if you get some of the DLCs to go with it, and/or get it on sale.The major negative is the loading screens. Holy crap. I'm running an i7 with the game installed on an SSD, and it's still bad. Using the repair bench and working on a car is fine, but anything past that is just awful. The drag strip, test track, auction house, parking lot... all take a ridiculously long time to load. It's enough that I basically never use them anymore (except the auction house, which is a big part of the end game content).The only other real negative worth mentioning is that there is no real satisfying ending. It's just the same gameplay loop over and over- buy car at auction (or accept work order), fix it, finish. With some DLC, you can also do some tuning to the car to get better performance, but this is never requested in a work order. It's a nice addition, but not really tied into the care gameplay in any meaningful way. Other DLC adds performance parts and additional cars... which is cool, but again not really changing the core gameplay. Once you've seen all the car models and done all the upgrades, there's really nothing more to do except ""do it again"". The DLCs really just extend the game out a little further before you hit that. I've got most of the DLCs and 65 hours in the game... and I still enjoy it, but I'm definitely feeling like I've run out of things to do.And finally, there's very little in the way of a 3rd party / modding community. The game apparently doesn't lend itself well to that. It's never going to be anything more than what you get out of the box (plus DLCs).However, the core gameplay is pretty fun. I've never been a mechanic or even worked on cars beyond pretty simple things, but I really enjoyed it. I doubt the accuracy is all that great, but the core concepts line up reasonably well with what I do know, and it's fun to play around. You can even be a ""shady"" mechanic if you want by removing good parts and putting bad ones on in their place (though I found doing so to be too time-consuming, personally).I recommend the Gold or Platinum edition, especially if you can get them on sale.

												The game is good for getting familiar with the part names and such.. but it doesnt make you a mechanic, it doesn't specify the parts functions and theres some inaccuracies.. for instance.. the brake have no tubes leading to them which is something that bothered me since i started in cms2014.. Also parts would fall on the floor if u disassembled certain parts.. but they float in this game without a problem.. You actually take apart the spring within the car.. which i would absolutely not recommend doing in real life.. since it will probably damage the hood of your car.. if not your face..Even with all these inaccuracies.. I still enjoy the game			"

												This is a great game and is the only mechanic simulator that has pulled me away from my 1999 GearHead Garage. It is similar in some ways but is very updated in graphics and ingame technology you get to use. The only thing I miss is the Junkyard, being able to buy and sell parts to it. And there is really no tutorial. Pros------Great graphics.Highly Detailed.Good variety of cars and parts.Use of modern technology.Infinite amount of jobs you can do.Cons-----------No junkyard.Needs more indepth tutorial.You will never see your family again.You have not bought it yet.P.s If you are looking for a sign to buy it. This is it.			"

												A great game to learn a bit about engines. Thats right, a game. Not a simulator. The test drive track is pointless and has little bearing on the condition of the car, let alone the model.After a couple of hours it is just repetetive as the default cars have limited variants in engine and car parts. If you want more variants you have to buy the DLC. Much of the DLC should have been paart of the game by default to give it some depth. Well, any depth really.TLDR, Could have been worth the asking price if DLC was already in base game as the base game lacks depth.And that oil pan...really?			"

												Overall I really enjoy this game. I really feel like this is a spiritual successor to a much older game that some car enthusiasts might be familiar with (""Gearhead Garage""). There are a lot of welcome improvements over the 2014 version of the game such as the ability to buy cars from the auction and sell them. The variety of cars is good and I like how there is an actual variety of how you assemble the vehicles. The graphics are pretty nice. Some of the game modes such as the test track and the paint booth seem a little underdeveloped in my opinion (as in the steering is a little difficult and the paint booth is pretty simplistic in terms of color choice.) The DLCs are pretty reasonably priced for the content in them. The only two things that bother me to any extent in the game is that you have to put a LOT of time into the game before you are able to access the auction block. I feel like the real highlight of the game is the ability to buy cars in various condition at the auction and then fix them up to sell them. Along with the auction sequence comes my second issue with the game: you should be able to put the car up for auction as opposed to outright selling it, and the work order screen should have some information on how much of a total monetary and time investment you have in the car.  With those things said, I don't think that they interfere with my enjoyment of the game to the extent that I would quit playing it or that I wouldn't recommend it.I bought the game as a bundle with a lot of its DLC included. I would buy it again. I would recommend it to others that are interested in cars and simulation games.			"

												Go in knowing it's a business sim/strategy/puzzle game and not a 100% realistic simulation. If you can enjoy those types of mechanics (eh...pun) with a gearhead theme, you will enjoy yourself :D -Start out small and do odd jobs to gain cash and xp.-Upgrade your tools, facilities, and skills. Start making some more cash.-At 9k xp you can start going to auctions and buy cars to upgrade and sell or keep in your collection.-DLC is where it's at. Performance/Visual Tuning pack gives you lots of new options.-Kinda Grindy. You get xp for every part you install or replace or screw you turn.			"

												Definitely an enjoyable game. Feels kind of like a puzzle in the order you have to take apart and put things together. Cars in the game will have different engines, running gear, brakes and other parts. Doing the jobs and getting xp can be repetitive, but once you get your own parking and get to buy auction cars and keep and sell them, gets a lot more fun.My only big con is the music for me, don't care for the techno type beat, but I just mute the ingame music and run my music player and listen to my own music. I find it actually relaxing to play this.			"

Highly recommended for fans of motors, cars, or puzzle games.Yeah. That's what I'd call this at the end of the day--a puzzle game.Generally it goes like this: Someone comes in with a car and tells you what's wrong with it--or rather as much as they can. In the beginning this is usually a description like ""Loud exhaust"" or ""Strange knocking sounds"", and then a full list of parts. You then go buy those parts for the customer, go in, and find and replace them. Eventually however the game stops holding your hand. You're given the description of the problem, and a list of the NUMBER of parts that need replacing, but you're not told which ones they are. You have to go in and manually inspect the engine, or the exhaust, or the transmission, and you have to diagnose those problems yourself. It's challenging, it's fun, and it's all the great parts about working on a car with none of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.It's a really cool game, and the DLC just makes it even cooler, with the addition of aftermarket parts, engine swaps, and new cars to play with. The DLC are VERY appropriately priced as well, each one adding just enough content to justify their price without feeling like a ripoff or a total steal.The only thing I can possibly complain about is the god forsaken soundtrack. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, but there are literally like... 4 or 5 songs that just play over and over--I suppose it's a rather realistic simulation of listening to the radio, but without any ads or DJs. Thankfully though, you can mute that♥♥♥♥♥♥ So when you get tired of the music--and you will--just go put on some hair metal and get back to thrashing.			"

Also I would like to request the option to lift trucks and such and also to be able to turn certain or all cars(whatever suits your fancy) into boneified drag cars, just my opinion but thatd be cool.

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a huge improvement to the 2014 edition. The game allows for some real hands-on fun, and you'll keep busy with the option of having multiple vehicles in your garage at one time. At the beginning, the game can seem very tideous, with everything being slow moving. But as you get along in the game, things become faster, and simpler. Add in the DLC content for more fun, and you've got a great all-around game to enjoy for hours.On that note, while I highly recommend this game to car sim guys and lovers of the old school Gearhead Garage, this game is not for low-resource computers/laptops. I'm using a Toshiba Satellite laptop, and it can barely handle the game on low settings. If you're running an old PC/laptop, you're going to miss out on this game's potential.			"

Not much of a tutorial, and as stated, you really need to know something about cars if you want an easy start of the game. However most gamers will be able to figure most of it out. Biggest strength of the game is it's a great teacher (if you like figureing things out for your self) of basic mechanics, biggest weakness is it's play for the long term, you'll tire of the game quickly if it's not your thing.

												I've started looking at my cars in a whole new light after getting this game. My main challenge now is keeping in mind that I am not actually a real life mechanic, so I shouldn't start buying broken down husks to restore them on my free time.In my eyes, it only has two problems. First, the music does get pretty repetitive after a while; you can fix it by running Spotify or whatever in the background. Second, and more importantly, after a while I started to want even more detailed disassembly. Right now, for instance, engine rooms are almost too tidy; there are no tubes and almost no fluid containers. Why is there no brake fluid to disconnect before removing the calipers? And why are steering knuckles and brake dust shields combined into the same part?On the other hand, I had no idea what any of those things meant before I started playing this game, so yeah.			"

On first startup i have a great graphics card so I put the textures on ultra then giving me a black screen and i now have to put my pc in sleep mode then wake it up to play the game on startup.2. Always remember to save your work because this game still can freeze or give you a black screen so beware as i had just finished completed restoring a ""Delray Custom"" and after painting it the game gave me a black screen so a good hours of work just went to waste.Other than those two negetives its an all out Great game i would totally reccomend it!!

Of course, it is not 100% realistic, if it was that easy in real life it would be amazing, but it is very well made, there are a lot of details and I'm pretty sure if you don't know anything about mechanic you'll learn a thing or two.

Other than that I'm loving this game. Except that it's insanely unrealistic. ""Oh, need to replace a front CV driveshaft? Sure, just take the tire and brakes off, remove this bolt and BAM!""

												Seriously! My Grandma can screw faster than that, and she never misses. So far, I have been enjoying the game. Although it is long and drawn out, and you really don't get to choose what you want to do, the game is very detailed, and I appreciate it for that. No game breakers here, just don't play this if you get bored really easily. Biggest things I hate so far are how long it takes to take apart and replace parts, and how everything is so vague. Example, ""Odd noise from engine bay. (found 6 of 7 items)"" so I take apart the engine for like the 3rd time, ""Hey I wonder if it could be the battery?"" and sure enough, it is the battery. What the hell? noise? whatever. 8/10 would play again			"

												A must have for a car nut! I love the game. I have worked on cars before and mostly everything is spot on - especially suspension wise. There are some parts that have either been omitted or overly simplified but - especially engine wise - but it's no big deal. It performs well but has a few weird quirks. I could not get the game to load until a user suggested I force-minimize the game via CTRL+ALT+DEL, then go back in, which oddly enough worked out.PROS:- Fun and educational- Very accurate parts wise- Great visuals- Nice testing tools- Good experience points and unlocks- Nice soundtrack (in my opinion)CONS:- Odd performance quirks at times- Long and frequent loading times- Some overly simplified engine components- Camera fights with you sometimesSUGGESTIONS FOR CMS 2016:- Let's get deeper into engine parts! I realize it might turn away some folks because engines can get very complex. Perhaps a difficulty setting where this is adjustable?- Automatic transmissions. Every car in this game is a manual. Autos would be nice as they would introduce a whole new category of drivetrains.- The aftermarket scene. I realize this is probably a can of worms, but a few performance mods wouldn't hurt. It's not uncommon for people to take their cars to shops and request performance parts. Throw in a dyno too!			"

												I know how to work on cars and trucks. I was disappointed when I got into the game. There are only 4 engine types, one SUV and 1 truck. It is setup well but the order in which you remove parts is not like the real world. I understand why they made it this way but takes away from the real world aspect. I was hoping to see a different engine setup for each vehicle, was disappointed again. Once you learn how to do one engine they are all pretty much the same. Don't get me wrong for me it is still fun but would be better if there was more difference between the vehicles.Brake jobs - Too easySuspension - Too easyEngine Work - Needs more varietyTransmission - Too easyDrivetrain - Too easyIgnition System - Too easyFuel system - Too easyBody Work - Too easyAll in all i would say it is too easy of a game for someone like me who has experience and a vast knowledge of how vehicles function & are built.Just a word of advice... Do not think you can be a mechanic after playing this game. You will be pleasently disappointed.			"

												Overall I really enjoy this game. I really feel like this is a spiritual successor to a much older game that some car enthusiasts might be familiar with (""Gearhead Garage""). There are a lot of welcome improvements over the 2014 version of the game such as the ability to buy cars from the auction and sell them. The variety of cars is good and I like how there is an actual variety of how you assemble the vehicles. The graphics are pretty nice. Some of the game modes such as the test track and the paint booth seem a little underdeveloped in my opinion (as in the steering is a little difficult and the paint booth is pretty simplistic in terms of color choice.) The DLCs are pretty reasonably priced for the content in them. The only two things that bother me to any extent in the game is that you have to put a LOT of time into the game before you are able to access the auction block. I feel like the real highlight of the game is the ability to buy cars in various condition at the auction and then fix them up to sell them. Along with the auction sequence comes my second issue with the game: you should be able to put the car up for auction as opposed to outright selling it, and the work order screen should have some information on how much of a total monetary and time investment you have in the car.  With those things said, I don't think that they interfere with my enjoyment of the game to the extent that I would quit playing it or that I wouldn't recommend it.I bought the game as a bundle with a lot of its DLC included. I would buy it again. I would recommend it to others that are interested in cars and simulation games.			"

												great game for when you want to do something productive but have very little resources. obviously the inclusion of licensed brands wou ld make this a bit better and more realistic, but they did their best with what they have. the garage being a first person perspective makes things a little bit clunky and awkward (especially with the stairs that are clearly designed for you to go up but don't let you? maybe a future update?) NOT A TIME PASSER you actually need to be committed to the cars you take on in this game, and that can be upwards of an hour or two of hard focus. if you take a break, you WILL lose all your momentum, and it's one of those games that if you leave for any extended period of time you might need to do the tutorial again for certain parts. but that's great training for life, where there are no tutorials and if you're really good you won't need to touch up an engine more than once every few months.8/10graphics are great for such a small game sizei haven't made it to the driving stage yet so i can't comment on thatrealism is ON POINT (sometimes to the point of frustration, but it's the good frustration where any error made you know is your fault, not the game just being absolutely stupid)			"

With a little help from the internet (bc the tutorial is lacking) you'll find a relaxing game with enough reward, in the form of upgrades/unlocks for content and convenience, and solid pacing to keep you playing. The game regularly releases DLC which I recommend to add to the base game. I'm 35+ hours in and intend to continue playing for a while.			"

												Cons: *Not many cars*Most of the songs are what can only be described as ""electronic fart noises that 6 year old kids listen to while they play Minecraft."" A few songs are tolerable, but you'll probably want to play this game on mute to avoid the tasteless music and incessant phone-ringing. *The auction system is a complete joke. If you don't show interest in a car, the AI won't bid on it at all. If you so much as bid on a car once, the AI will spam it with bids until a car with a starting bid of $4,000 has well over $40,000 in bids. All exaggeration aside, the last car I bought  started at around $20,000 and ended at over $60,000. At $500 per bid and a $40,0000 raise, that's 80 bids. 80. ""Come ONNNNNNN, JUST LET ME BUY THE CAR."" is something you'll probably say to yourself a lot. *It's pretty repetitive. Unbolt this part, beat on it with a hammer until it breaks, buy a new one. You'll be running back and forth to your PC a lot, so I suggest that your first upgrade point goes to a tablet. It'll save you a lot of time and frustation.*Did I mention that there aren't many cars? I think there are maybe 10 different ones. I also got the Fiat DLC for free, somehow, but I don't think everyone else will. Still, not nearly enough cars for this price point. The lack of variety really makes it even more repetitive than it already is. *Not much driving going on. After you finish restoring your poorly-modeled, generic-looking knock off of a Peugeot 505, you might want to drive it. Your options are a small skidpad that was ripped off from Beam MG Drive, or the testing area. *Poor car models. Looks more like CMS 2012, but I still can't run it at the highest settings on my PC with 6 GIGs of memory. Medium-high settings at around 30 FPS. *The customer orders are tedius and more or less all the same. ""Loud exhaust, fix all driveline issues, repair all body panels."" Every time. Every single time. It's always the same problems with every car. *You need 9,000 XP and $50,000 to unlock the garage and be able to auction and restore cars, which is probably the only thing in the game worth doing. It took me about 16 hours to get to that point, give or take. So it'll take roughly 16 hours to get to the point in the game where it'll be worth playing, but then you need to do more customer jobs to raise money to buy and repair cars, because buying the parking lot and other parts of the garage will eat up most of your money at the beginning of the game. *Overpriced, along with the DLC. It would be a great game for $10, and $15 including the DLC. *There's not really any simulation going on. Everything is too simplified and easy. Maybe I'm just not in the age group for the target demographic or something. There's a lot more to a car than 50 bolts and some body panels. *So [loading]  many [loading] loading screens. Why. How could this game possibly need this many loading screens? Need to scratch your nose? Loading screen. Go to the auction? 2 loading screens, and then 2 or 3 going back to your garage. And just for the fun of it, a loading screen to launch a loading screen. It's like being on Oprah when she decides that everyone wins a loading screen. ""YOU get a loading screen! YOU get a loading screen! EVERYBODY GETS A LOADING SCREEN!"" Pros:*I guess it's pretty entertaining for a little while. While what little charm it had wore thin a long time ago, I still enjoy it. I honestly don't think my enjoyment of the game makes up for everything else. It's not good, and not bad. It's basically the definition of mediocre. Edit: If you look at it as a car-based puzzle game, you'll be a little better off. As a car mechanic simulator, it's not that good. As a car-based puzzle game, you'll have a hard time finding something better. I don't have much of the DLC, but I'm sure with the cool cars they've added on it'll be even better. Not everyone will like this game, maybe even most people. I still like it. It's relaxing, though a bit tedius sometimes. You don't need to know much about cars at all to play it. Just pay attention to what parts need to be removed in what order and you'll be okay. Would I recommend this game? Probably not. It seems to have a pretty specific audience. That doesn't make it a bad game, but not everyone will find it enjoyable. And I feel like a small Eastern European game company who tries their best to make a good game deserves a good amount of support.Like others said, it seems pretty pointless that you can't customize your cars in the base game. Also, you get the parts from the DLC cars in your parts catalogue for the DLC cars, even if you don't have the DLC.			"

												I bought this game with all the tuner/trader DLCs, This is the most fun I've had since playing street rod on floppy disks, buy cars at the auction and complete their makeover and make a profit, or just repair people's ride to test your basic mechanic knowledge, all in all, it's a very good and immersive game for car lovers.Only negative aspect is that all car names are fake, but you will recognize the models.

												Very good game, teaches you the basics of what parts are where on a car and the idea of how to get to them but my one problem was the dlc, the porfomace is a waste of 5 dollars, unrealistic and boring. you cant add a turbo to a i4, you can only put on a diffrent part (same part just shiner) and the hp numbers are way off. also how does an alternator/water pump/clutch give me more hp? yes for the game but no for the dlc			"

With the 2 lifter bays being kind of redundant seeing as you can only really work on one car at a time, an online aspect to the game would be great. You and a buddy fixing cars side by side would bring a whole new thing to it which would be awesome.Still an amazing game none the less but personally could be sexier with online.			"

												Yes my review says I DO NOT recommend this game and it is not because it is bad. It is amazing as it really does simulate being a mechanic, its tedious, repetetive and will sometimes get frustrating. Now having said that it is a lot simpler than being an actual mechanic as it does not go into extreme detail. It is a very simplified game, and this brings me to what it really is. A game. This lies somewhere in the middle of being a game and a simulator, its way too repetitive to be any kind of fun as a game but it doesn't quite get to the detail to make it fun as a simulator.So in summary Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives a very good feeling of what it is like to BE a mechanic but is terrible at simulating working on cars. It is a confused game and is not really a simulator. I really did expect more.I am not saying don't buy it, just do a little more research first so you know what your getting into.			"

												A great game to learn a bit about engines. Thats right, a game. Not a simulator. The test drive track is pointless and has little bearing on the condition of the car, let alone the model.After a couple of hours it is just repetetive as the default cars have limited variants in engine and car parts. If you want more variants you have to buy the DLC. Much of the DLC should have been paart of the game by default to give it some depth. Well, any depth really.TLDR, Could have been worth the asking price if DLC was already in base game as the base game lacks depth.And that oil pan...really?			"

												This game had me stoked as I'm an actual mechanic.But this game is simply too easy.You use a tool to search the car for faults, and the faulty components glows red.So all you've got to do is disassemble parts in the correct order, to reach the part you want to upgrade/change. Then visa versa once you're done. Voila, you fixed a car. 15 dollar profit.Now do that 40 times and buy upgrades for your garage, making everything easier.			"

												The game lacks content. You can very quickly run out of things to do, goals to strive for. It also lacks achievements, not bothering to even try to add anything there. There is a good, solid base to build on, but the developers appear to have chosen to put out the minimum possible and then add a few DLC. I have put over 40 hours into the game, I own all the DLC and I won't complain about the game or the DLC at all, it's the value I take issue with. The game / DLC is simply overpriced for the amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it. It feels a bit like your typical early access title where you can see a lot of potential but it never gets realized. I assume 2016 will come out soon and be a rinse and repeat of a formula that appears to be working for the developers, at the expense of consumers.			"

You'll take more than 10 hours to start buying something, like a testing area or painting. To buy a garage it'll take more hours. You gotta buy a garage to participate in the audictions.I can't wait for more DLC's for this game.Red Dot Games FTW!!			"

												Lots of fun, with only a couple downsides. I definitely recommend giving it a try, especially if you get some of the DLCs to go with it, and/or get it on sale.The major negative is the loading screens. Holy crap. I'm running an i7 with the game installed on an SSD, and it's still bad. Using the repair bench and working on a car is fine, but anything past that is just awful. The drag strip, test track, auction house, parking lot... all take a ridiculously long time to load. It's enough that I basically never use them anymore (except the auction house, which is a big part of the end game content).The only other real negative worth mentioning is that there is no real satisfying ending. It's just the same gameplay loop over and over- buy car at auction (or accept work order), fix it, finish. With some DLC, you can also do some tuning to the car to get better performance, but this is never requested in a work order. It's a nice addition, but not really tied into the care gameplay in any meaningful way. Other DLC adds performance parts and additional cars... which is cool, but again not really changing the core gameplay. Once you've seen all the car models and done all the upgrades, there's really nothing more to do except ""do it again"". The DLCs really just extend the game out a little further before you hit that. I've got most of the DLCs and 65 hours in the game... and I still enjoy it, but I'm definitely feeling like I've run out of things to do.And finally, there's very little in the way of a 3rd party / modding community. The game apparently doesn't lend itself well to that. It's never going to be anything more than what you get out of the box (plus DLCs).However, the core gameplay is pretty fun. I've never been a mechanic or even worked on cars beyond pretty simple things, but I really enjoyed it. I doubt the accuracy is all that great, but the core concepts line up reasonably well with what I do know, and it's fun to play around. You can even be a ""shady"" mechanic if you want by removing good parts and putting bad ones on in their place (though I found doing so to be too time-consuming, personally).I recommend the Gold or Platinum edition, especially if you can get them on sale.

Like most ""tycoon"" games financialy it can start off slow, but over time can build up rather quick. It does monotonous after a while, but with new cars that come with a relatively inexpensive DLC pack, it can pick up for a while. I would give it an initial 8/10 stars, but after a while the replay value dwindles.			"

												In many ways, this game is the best car mechanic simulator we've ever seen, which earn it a thumbs up.  Some improvements really need to be made and most of all, I'm terribly unimpressed with the new game release for the year rather than properly updating the game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) that we've already paid for - bad form.Positive:- Various systems in the car to work on- Easy to remove/add parts and repair them (once you unlock that option)- Buy used cars through an action and refurbish them- Decent soundtrack- Easy to move around in the shopNegative:- It can be difficult to get to the part you want to change/affect; it's hard to move around on the actual cars once you're trying to affect them- When in the mode to re-add parts, the opaque white overlay is difficult to see at times.- No explanation for some features such as the extra rooms, how to get to auction, old game test track (how would you even know this exists?) - I personally took ""Exit"" for leave the game, not ""Go to other areas""- Various game crashes, mostly involving the Unity engine; telling me to play in Windows 7 mode really isn't an answer.Overall, I love it for being the current best at what it does but at the same time I hate it for what might have been.

												Fantastic game.I really enjoyed playing this one, my friend had this on his account and I had a go and ended up playing it for 10 hours over a couple of days and had to purchase it. I like cars irl and know a small ammount about mechanics and the simulator is a great way of learning some of the basic parts of a car and get a rough idea of where everything goes. However, it isn't realistic in that you would be able to take the knowledge to the real thing, although any hobbyist mechanic may find some use for this.Away from the eduactional side of things and on to the gameplay. The game is really fun at first but it does start to grind on whilst you raise your level and gain enough money to hit the auctions. However, once you have done this grind it will be well worth it because the game so much more interesting and fun when you can buy old bangers and suke them up into high powered machines to either race around or sell for a high profit.One of my favorite games.Pro'sReally well designed and easy to learnHelps learning names and places of actual car partsGood end game contentHighly replayableNice graphicsAwesome soundtrackCon'sSome of the DLC seems rather overpriced for what it addsProbably extremely boring if you have no interest in cars or mechanicsI highly recomend this game to anyone with an interest in cars/mechanics but I would say that if you don't have much interest try a demo or something first as my friend who owns this finds it really dull.

												Great game - One of the best Simulator's i have ever played by far!Thumbs up and i would buy it !Just a sad side it doesn't have any form of multiplayer.also not much to adding extra's like paint job's , they are working on things like turbos etc at the moment along with lights and added extra's. looking good - just wish there was somewhere for us to have fun with them , maybe pinkslip'			"

												Is an ok game, but not very realistic. Need blower mods for the bigger cars and torque specs for all the bolts you have to remove and replace Especially the engine parts. Plus I think the parts should be more vehicle specific. Not generic. Maybe interior work also? Good game for someone to learn the basic workings of a vehicle overall. Graphics and load times need work. Its almost 2016.			"

												Reminds me of Street Legal Racing Redline, without the racing though...Would be a fantastic game if roaming of city streets and/or drag races gets implemented (Where you can bet money/pink slips) (The DLC for the drag strip is literally only a drag strip where you see how fast you can complete it...)Still, I love taking apart and reassembling/restoring cars.

												LOVE THIS GAME!  To be clear I know nothing about cars and you'd think simulating something as mundane as auto mechanics would be boring but I gotta say i'm crazy addicted.  Takes a while to get some levels going as i'm just shy of buying the parking lot so i can buy auction cars (requires 9k experience).  There's a bit of help at first so you get familiar with general locations of where car parts are.  For example i know in most models i have to remove the starter before i can remove the gearbox (which requires lift, starter doesn't).  I had the hardest time finding the spark plugs but then i learned that the stars next to the part description will highlight things in blue.  They could have done with a little more detailed tutorial on that but that's minor.  Great game, highly recommend if you like these simulators such as farming sim and construction sim.			"

												Metacritic gave this game a 68? What did they play, the demo almost 2 years ago? This game is a solid 90+. Reviewers need to take into account which demographic this game is aimed at and that a game that keeps adding patches and content is going to get exponentially better with time. Don't listen to the idiots. If you are a car enthusiast and a bit of a grease monkey, you'll love this game. Believe it or not, you even learn quite a bit of real life mechanic knowhow if you know nothing about nuts and bolts. I was even able to make some basic part replacement on my real car that I would have never attempted before. Great stress reliever and highly recommended.			"

												Pretty good puzzle game. But there is a lot room for improvement though.Interioir cannot be modified at all and the engine bay could have more stuff to fix.Part positioning is also a little off on some vehicles, because some parts can go inside the car chassis. Complete restorations are available but only if you buy the car first, which is a long minus.However the good things do win the... lack of some things, so that's why I recommend this.			"

												I'm no expert when it comes to cars but this game has got my attention, I bought this game not only to have fun but to learn car parts as well. The game is really fun (seriously), especially if you buy the Performance DLC because you can modify your own car even more like swapping engines! Unfortunately there's no tutorial, at least for the control. You won't be guided what to do to fix the car, you'll be given list of parts that needs to be replaced and that's it (I even search Google Image to find the location of the part xD). If you gain enough XP there will be more challenges, like you need to find the broken parts yourself. Soon you'll get tools like OBD Scanner to help you examine broken parts faster and more easily.---------------------------The game's pretty small though, unlike game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 where you can name you company, hire staff, travel between countries. This game only let you work inside a garage alone, so this game can be boring after you play the game for a while. Well you can test cars in a test track, buy your own personal car, and have a drag race but that's basically it. Even so, to purchase your own car, you need to get a parking lot, which require lots of XP to be able to purchase it.---------------------------You should purchase this game if you're interested in cars, because believe me, you'll be fixing cars all day long and if you're not into it you'll ditch the game right away.

It positively portrays slogging by in a mostly thankless service job.  But it is oddly fun.  I don't have a good explanation for it.  8.5 / 10 (It would be 9.5 if you had to negotiate the minefield of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that is working in customer service. Possible DLC?)			"

I would very much enjoy to see the business aspect of this game expanded to include purchasing new shops or even dealerships. Maybe race your vehicle against others in a multi online aspect. So far there is nothing I don't like about this game I would like to see more added to it. I've gotten to the point where I purchased all upgrades and have about 500k in my account. Even after all that I am still playing it. Please give me more to do!Thanks!			"

												""An Investment in Automotive Education"" While this game is not even close to a 100% representation of actual car functions or mechanic duties, I can honestly say that i know so much more about cars than i did before i started playing this. The first large chunk of this game will be occupied by repair jobs, where you will be required to find broken parts in the car and fix them. When enough experience and money is gathered, the real fun begins when you can purchase your own cars, then restore them and either sell them, or keep them for your own personal collection. The DLC for this game is fairly priced, but is not necessary to enjoy the game. Anyone who has an interest in cars, or just wants to learn more about cars should certainly pick up this game. It is fully worth the $19.99 price, but if its on sale, there is hardly an excuse to not give this a try.			"

												I love this game! I find myself always going onto this game expecting to be on for 1 or 2 hours, then i usually actually end up being on it for longer then that. Its helping me learn how to diagnose whats wrong and figure out where faulty parts would be, instead of just pulling things apart hoping to find something which is what i was semi doing at the start of playing this game. Ive also finally learnt that the engine in the Maluch is in the back of the car not the front hahaa  xD  Just sucks that need to buy anything else if want more to do. Dyno would be helpful butnot sure i would wanna pay for it. To those who have it, is it worth the money?Overall this game is really awsome and i recommend it to anyone who loves cars or wants to learn about fixing them.			"

												As someone who really works on cars, I'd say this is a failry accurate mechanic sim without the grazed knuckles and frustration of hard to get to bolts.Very similar to games such as Gearhead Garage and Street Legal, this game puts you in charge of your own workshop. You make money fixing customers cars which you can then spend on buying cars at auction. The auction cars always need some work, when the work is complete you can either add the car to your garage, or sell it for a profit.I am restoring a DeLorean in real life so I also grabbed the DeLorean DLC. It's pretty accurate, although some things in the engine bay are in the wrong place and the DeLorean in this game has a power steering pump instead of an A/C unit, but I understand this is probably a limitation of the game engine. It did feel weird taking the mix unit and intake manifold off to inspect the Valley of Death as I have done on my own DeLorean.I've had hours of fun, the only downside to the game is it can get repetitive. quite a lot of the customer jobs are big jobs such as rebuilding the entire front and back suspension system, which is time consuming and monotonous. Having said that, life as a real mechanic would be very similar. There is also not much you can do with your own cars once they have been rebuilt, apart from sit in them or take them around a test track.Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in pulling cars and engines to bits and at the moment this is probably THE best game on the market for anyone wanting a modern Gearhead Garage clone.

												Other people have said this before but this isn't really a sim. This is more of a puzzle game involving various car and engine parts. The great thing about it is that there are several types of engines to fix, each with there own unique parts. Fixing them is a lot of fun but the thing i like the most about it is buying cars at an auction and completely restore it and then sell it for big profits. It takes a while to get enough experience and buy the upgrades necessary to do so but its a lot of fun. One car consist out of so many parts and it can be a little tricky when you disassemble them and replace all the defective parts. The only downside to this game are the long loading times (considering the game has to load a lot of parts) and even on a PC that exceeds way above the minimum specs may take a several moments. All in all, this doesn't form much of a problem to me. Another thing i don't like is the music in this game. It's all dubstep and its like listening to a 56k modem making musical tones. Luckily, it can be turned off so that you can play your own music.     All in all, its a great game and the DLC adds new features and cars. Currently, there's a Mercedes-Benz DLC that adds the 300 SL Gullwing and the 560 SEC. There are more real life cars to come, now that the developers acquired the license for Maserati. Can't wait!

												It's okay.Gets repetitive very quickly.would be neat if they implemented some kind of online interactions with your builds, shows, dragracing others with your tuned honda civic clone, etc..also more engine swaps. a lot of the cool cars i liked i was only allowed to replace the oem engine with the same one, not many allow you to swap to crazy things.

												Very nice, relaxing game just to mess around for a while, the ammount of things you can do early on is fairly limited though, and it may get a tad repetitive while getting to medium-high xp levels, but once you´re out of that, the ammount of different jobs you can do is fairly big, specialy if you have the dlcs. overall a nice, relaxing game when you dont feel like being on the edge of your seat.

It's a good puzzle and really gets you thinking. Game never really gets old because you are always solving different problems and theres always something next and even when there's not you can just start again. Great game, definitly recommend.			"

												I'm a mechanic and I can say this game is pretty good. It's how you fix things in real life but the parts and detail are very well done. If this game had racing and performance parts this would be the next Motor City Online. I would drop more money for that option without a doubt. I am so tired of Need For Speed Racing games. I liked having to know a car and how to make it faster. Great game guys! Keep up the good work!			"

												I'm no expert when it comes to cars but this game has got my attention, I bought this game not only to have fun but to learn car parts as well. The game is really fun (seriously), especially if you buy the Performance DLC because you can modify your own car even more like swapping engines! Unfortunately there's no tutorial, at least for the control. You won't be guided what to do to fix the car, you'll be given list of parts that needs to be replaced and that's it (I even search Google Image to find the location of the part xD). If you gain enough XP there will be more challenges, like you need to find the broken parts yourself. Soon you'll get tools like OBD Scanner to help you examine broken parts faster and more easily.---------------------------The game's pretty small though, unlike game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 where you can name you company, hire staff, travel between countries. This game only let you work inside a garage alone, so this game can be boring after you play the game for a while. Well you can test cars in a test track, buy your own personal car, and have a drag race but that's basically it. Even so, to purchase your own car, you need to get a parking lot, which require lots of XP to be able to purchase it.---------------------------You should purchase this game if you're interested in cars, because believe me, you'll be fixing cars all day long and if you're not into it you'll ditch the game right away.

The ""race track"" in the performance DLC is just a drag strip, and you can't change how thw wheels look, unless you are into coding. Overall, a good game if you like working on cars.			"

												This game is VERY fun because it allows for some form of education and learning about the cars, but it is also fun because of the money managment that takes place. I will say that the only *bad* -ish part to the game is the lack of purpose behind driving the cars, and also some contracts in the game just straight up tell you what parts need to be replaced, while the other car mechanic sim gave you a customer that gave you ambiguous info as to what was causing the problem and you had to figure out what part was crap and why it was tied to the problem.8/10 its still a game you can sink some hours into and want to come back to once you leave.

First upgrade recommended, the tablet!. All in all it's very much worth the price.			"

												I wouldn't call this game ""fun"" per se (though it is) but instead, satisfying. As somebody who doesn't know much about wrenching cars, I've always envied friends of mine who were good at it. I'm not presuming this game has magically made me handy in the garage but I have learned a lot more than I knew before. I've even learned about cursing at a car in which I forgot some critical piece after a long re-assemble. I was interested in the title but didn't really expect much. It's turned out to be one of the most satisfying games I've played in a long time. My compliments to the developers.			"

												I agree with alot of people, that this game is fun, accurate, and enjoyable. But there is some main components missing from the game. Heres a few things I would like to see in the game. 1. One that is simple yet not avaliable, being able to just jump in behind the wheel and start the car to hear it run. 2. And to continue that thought,  what about realistic sounds? You get a repair order, complaining about a knocking sound in engine bay, or you will get a car that won't run. If you were able to turn the key over maybe that will help with the diagnostics of the repair. 3. Like many have stated, no hoses, no electrical work, no fuel/brake lines. You cant take the enegine out with a cherry picker than dismantle it. Being able to do actual body work instead of buying brand new body parts would be fun. 4. Also i see a tire machine in the shop but it has no use. Having the ability to change tires as they commonly go bad would be an awesome little perk. 5. I havent fully upgraded my ""repair %"" but it doesnt seem like theres many parts that are repairable. Not sure if you unlock more parts as you upgrade, if not than you should.			"

												i would recommend this game but i would not recommend going to the auction area it is a waste of time you will never win the car you want. lets say you have $100,000 the car you want starts at $1,000 you click the raise button and the price goes up next the computer raises the price, you click again, the computer clicks again you go back and forth until you decide you do not want to pay that muck for the car. what is the final price when the car is sold? probably in the area of $10,000 to $15,000. it is pointless to buy a car from the auction area. i would suggest you just take a job of the car you want, fix it the way you want it and put it in your parking area and never complete the job, this is the only way you are going to get the car you want.

												This is a pretty entertaining game, even for a light/heavy line auto technician who does the real life stuff. Its great to pass the time with, learn a little (for the average individual who doesn't do this kind of work), and enjoy a game for those who have the automotive passion. Most average players won't notice the mistakes, but it's understandbly not 100% realistic. A couple examples are: The ""power steering pump"" looks exactly like an A/C compressor on most models. Also, I had no idea a belt driven radiator fan could bolt up to nothing with four bolts in FRONT of the radiator. And lastly, coming from someone who does this kind work in reality......don't spend an hour with frustration on how to drop the fuel tank or try to remove the back seat in a car to change the fuel pump in the top of the tank. You know, the usual, real life step you would have to take. Because none of that works or is apparently needed. You can apparently just remove the fuel pump in the tank that's buried in the car. Makes no sense. Real world thinking screwed me there for a bit.Anyway, game doesn't have any bugs. No glitches or issues with playability.All in all, not too bad of a game. I enjoy it.			"

Reviewers need to take into account which demographic this game is aimed at and that a game that keeps adding patches and content is going to get exponentially better with time. Don't listen to the idiots. If you are a car enthusiast and a bit of a grease monkey, you'll love this game. Believe it or not, you even learn quite a bit of real life mechanic knowhow if you know nothing about nuts and bolts. I was even able to make some basic part replacement on my real car that I would have never attempted before. Great stress reliever and highly recommended.			"

												Absolutely the best game have bought in ages, just want more, more, more.  Start off fixing cars in a garage, and work your way upto car restorer.  Learn tons about cars and kinda get hooked on the whole problem solving bit, and no dirty finger nails. Both self and son play this, and now he's dragging me to vintage car rallies, and telling bemused car restorers about their own cars. Love it, play it.			"

												This is a more in-depth version of CMS 2014. Much more detailed, more cars and more parts then before.But that's not all. This game had recived an epic evolution since 2014:-You can now re-design/customize your garage.-Restore old cars!!-Buy your own cars!-Customize your cars.Playway has gone on the glory path with this game. This game's stock price is really low for what you're getting in my opinion. It is worth it in any day of the week. Super Satisfied - 10/10P.S to Playway, incase you're reading: How about some modern tuners next game?			"

												Pros:+Nice car selection+XP based game play to unlock parts of the shop is a majot plus+With the current platform it is a great base for a lot of things. i.e when exiting the garage the map screen. plenty of room for say addon tracks and things to that nature.+Graphics+/-Depth of engine and car deconstruction+Parking garage is a amazing idea (got about 4 project cars stored in there lol)Cons:-Rusted parts. They are a dead give away. Granted rust does happen, just wish there was a difficulty setting to change this for more experienced players.-/+Depth of deconstruction. It does go into a lot of detail, but I miss things like the hoses from the air box to the intake. Would be nice to see radiator hoses, maybe even brake lines and fuel lines. -Variety. Seems like every car I work on I'm doing the same things to the same engine, chasis, etc, except the body of the car looks different. -Limited customization. I know the dev plans on releasing DLC but I can't wait lol. I would love to buy a beat up car from the auction and a massive tiwn turbo with a racing suspention. Turn around and, for example turn a 30k car into a 100k car.My biggest hope is for user created addons. Its a lot of work for the devs to keep up on the game adding new content all the time. There are people out there that can some pretty spectacular things with modding programs. All in all I love this game and give it a 10/10. I logged about 10 hours on my buddy's game when I went on vacation back home. As soon as I got back and walked into my house the first thing I did was buy this wonderful game.			"

If only it was so easy in the real world with no rusted and broken bolts with no grime and not resorting to just beating old parts off :DOld crappy cars having mpfi is a bit silly, and the option to swap better parts and engines into car bodies would be damn awesome.8.4/10			"

												 Car Mechanic 2015 is a definite improvement from the 2014 version. There is a lot more detail in the work you do to the cars. I find myself not wanting to stop playing. I finish one job and I tell myself this is the last one I'm going to do today, then I start looking at the next job and find myself working on it till I finish. It is very addictive!  If you know nothing about cars, Car Mechanic 2015 will help you understand the basics of what is what on a car an where it can be found!I can't get enough of this game! I have had no issues with the game play at all! If you don't have it yet, get it, you'll love it!  Since I am a trained mechanic myself there are a few things that should be added to the next version, if there is going to be next version, like powers tools! Instead of using the ratchet sounds add in some power tool sound fx! Like the impact wrench and an air wratchet! These would make the game even more enjoyable! Also custom paint jobs woud be really cool as well! Something where you could have a set of custom designs the customer would like to put on their car and paint it in the paint booth! Even metallic colors would look great! Something for the designers to think about! I have a lot of ideas for future Car Mechanic Simulators! This game is well worth the money! Two thumbs up from me! Definitly on the top of my gaming list!			"

												It's a fun game that makes you want to work on cars in real life (if that's something you enjoy doing to begin with). Pretty detailed as to things that need to be removed in order to remove something else such as Spring caps before you can remove the lower strut. I enjoy the game from time to time, but after about 1-2 hours straight, I need to take a break. They're slowly adding new features like being able to add any rim to any vehicle, the tuner ability to change out headlights and tail lights, grills, etc. Would be nice to see a bigger selection on the visual tuning, but what they have is decent for now. They said they'll be adding more and other feature so just waiting around for those options now. Would be nice to add a turbo or supercharger to any vehicle instead of just turbos to the vehicles that are factory turbo. Or the ability to drop a v8 into one of the smaller 4 cylinder cars to make it a sleeper. Maybe it'll come, maybe it wont, but that wont stop me from playing.			"

												There are quite a lot of pros and only a few cons to the game. Mind you, I will be comparing the older version to the newer version.Pros:-It is not very laggy: The biggest issue I had with the older version was that I set my game to the lowest video settings, but I still kept on lagging. This game takes that and throws it in the bin. With the same computer and same specs, the 2015 version was much more smoother than the 2014 version. I had at least 30fps all the way, whereas I would have 15-20fps on the 2014 version. -Interesting Campaign Mode: The one in CMS2014 was very controlled, you were given the same puzzle as everyone else who played the game. This gives you the choice to select the orders you want to take, and that is a game changer. No longer do you HAVE to do an order. You get to pick what you want to do. i.e I don't feel like fixing that guy's brakes, so I'll just select the order with the engine problems instead. This helps to make the game much more smoother and much more playable.-Much fewer glitches: I had a problem with CMS2014, and that was my order #43 glitched and I couldn't finish the order no matter how closely I followed the instructions. Since this is a newer game, we don't have as many glitches anymore. This game is being constantly updated, so it allows for improvement all the time. -Cool DLCs: We have had two DLCs come out by the time I am writing this review, Visual Tuning and Young Timer. Young Timer is free, with the nice little Fiat 500 lookalike. The Visual Tuning DLC does cost some money, however it is much more cheaper compared to the price tags on the other DLCs. Cons:-Time Consuming: Unless you are an absolute car bore who likes fixing the cars in this game like I do, you are not going to have a fun time. This is a simulator of what mechanics do on a daily basis, so ofcourse it is going to be time consuming, what did you expect? -Unlockables: In CMS2014, we had the OBD scanner as a tool since the beginning of the game. Why do we need to work on 10 cars maximum in order to unlock the tool that we had for a long time in the previous game? They could've let some tools remain like they were in the previous game. However, it does add for an interesting aspect to the gameplay, because now you get to work for the things you really want. Although that is interesting to me, it might not be to the other gamers. -Repair Uncertainty: Now again, unless you are a car enthusiast that finds these innovations interesting to the gameplay, you are probably not going to like the fact that there is a chance that the item you repair may not be fixed successfully. Overall, I think they did an excellent job with the new 2015 simulator. The new additional features are absolutely worth every single penny of that price tag. This new game completely demolishes the other older one, and I am not saying this because my CMS2014 Order #43 did not work. I genuinely believe this new game is a huge step forward from the previous one. I can now only imagine how much greater the 2016 version will be, definitely a rival to the upcoming Street Tuning Revolution. I am only joking, that game is a total in depth tuning game and it will take Red Dot Games a little while to catch up to that level, eventhough in my opinion it is very close. Then again, I have not played Street Tuning Evolution yet, so I can't tell the gap there might exist between the two games. CMS2016, that is a game definitely to look forward to.  "

												There are only so many ways you change a tire (or what have you)...so extremely repetive.That being said, addictive as heck if you are in to click-and-point stuff and car engineering in general. Fairly steady supply of patches and dlcs so far, so while being the same ""fix broken stuff"" keeps things semi-fresh. Only once you've maxxed out your shop and filled up your garage you really run out of stuff to do (at that point money isn't an issue either).The expert mode is a good addition once you're familiar with the game as it adds an extra layer to the fixes (only gives a generic fault description ie. ""bad brakes"", parts do not light up: you have to know where they are and in which order they come apart, and so on).I would like some more ""realism"" like seized bolts and general mishaps that happen in real life like parts breaking on disassembly, a more advanced part repair system, more fluids, electrical and wireing. Things of that nature.This game sure does teach an appreciation of ""half-a$$ing"" a fix.- Replace brake disc, check- Brake pads are at 51%....replace? Naah, they're just fine.			"

												Learnt lots of car parts from this game. Needs more real cars tho. More details too like different type of engine oil, brakes etc. I'd totally buy CMS 2016/2017 if they were to add more real legit cars into the game so I could relate. Also, add customer complaints issues and we mechanic have to try to understand and look for the issue. For example customer complains that their car rpm keeps going down and we should try to identify if its a caburator problem etc and we'll have to figure out how to solve it. More irl problems so we could relate and hopefully fix our own cars irl. Also, maybe add in different kinds of tools and screws for us to choose from. Summary:- Add more details- Add more relatable problems- Add more real life cars. example: Lamborghini, BMW, Toyota and so on (i know there might be license issues)			"

Taking stunning pictures of you favourtie gear while listening to music...... It's one of the best csual games out there.

Summary:- Add more details- Add more relatable problems- Add more real life cars. example: Lamborghini, BMW, Toyota and so on (i know there might be license issues)			"

												This game is literally working in a car repair shop withhout oil and mess all over your hands, without missing nuts and bolts and of course, being in the comfort of your home. The game becomes more fun when you can buy your own cars and fix them up, however eventually you would have fixed so many cars, that it would be a bit boring after some time. The dev's have been releasing DLC's frequently though, so that we have more cars to mingle around with. Recently the Mercedes DLC came out, now THAT was a suprise. here are the Pro's and Con's about this game.Pro's-Wide variety of cars-Huge amount of customization for the garages-Bodykits and new rims if you get the DLC-Nice and simple auction system-Upgrades that make it more convenient in-game, for eg. faster un-bolting times, portable tablet for easy purchase of parts etcCon's-Bad inventory organising and sorting-Small and confined area to test your cars-Interior of cars are never damaged, torn or worn-Strange driving physics Overall I feel this is a great game for car enthusiasts and is not over complicated for those who are still extending their knowlage of cars, this game runs very smoothly on my MacBook Air and should do well on a PC running core i5 and has 4GB of ram.

												Game is very intuitive and for someone like me who knows very little about car parts it can teach you quite a bit. It also eases you into the game slowly, giving you easy things to do at the start then getting more complicated as you gain experience. Just be careful you use ALL the tools at your disposal, unlike what I did below.Had a job where one of the problems was a lack of power.Used the test track and test path, no luck finding the problem.Took absolutely everything out of the engine bay, couldn't find the problem either.Remembered I had an electronic meter I earned earlier in the game which I could use. The problem was the fuel pump in the fuel tank at the back of the car.Smacked myself in the head, replaced the fuel pump and had to put the whole engine back together.10/10 would do it again.			"

												It's quite a good time-waster.  :)It won't entirely hold your hand all the time, but it's easy enough to figure it all out with a tiny bit of patience.In fact the things I miss are the really big eff-ups, like lowering the car when something *is* underneath, or the disgruntled customers...these would add a laugh into the game that's missing IMO.And a FOV setting.  God I miss that badly!Edit:After some time I've realised there's one big missing thing here; the challenge. There's none.And so after you've completely re-built a couple of (owned) cars the game has really nothing to offer.  You can make truckloads of money this way.			"

												Car Mechanic 2015 is interesting. I foresee this game striking only certain gamers, but if you question whether you will like this game or not, you should buy it because you're curious. The game itself won't let you down. Graphically the game is top notch compared to CM2014. The intriguing part about the game is about what it offers. The DLC is fun, you can completely tear down a vehicle inside and out, work orders, buy a garage to stow extra vehicles, go to auctions, there's test tracks, a DYNO, and paint vehicles. I'm sure I left out other cool stuff. The best way to play this game is to sit back, put on some music, and work on fixing several different cars.			"

												Around 6 hours into the game I've done about 8 cars.The game tends to hold your hand a lot, and everything is pretty straight forward. So far it has been more of a point and click simulator than a car mechanic simulator but it is still fairly entertaining.Not knowing anything about what goes on under the hood myself, the game has been somewhat educational in showing me where and what parts are that I've only seen on a repair/service bill. I do think with a little more time put into the game I might actually be able to go out to my car and identify them myself.For a simulator title, the game is very simplistic. Taking off parts is as simple as holding down a mouse button, and when you need to unbolt or unscrew something the same applies. When putting something back onto the car, you are provided with silhouettes of missing parts. This makes assembly fairly simple almost to the point of being too easy.Most of the cars have been more of the same, and I can see the game getting very repetitive quickly. The only difference in difficulty boils down to how extensively you will need to strip the car to get to the broken part. This becomes more of a chore than a difficulty factor. Speaking of broken parts, the only indication of this is rust. Parts do not have cracks etc. The only indication of wear on parts is rust. This makes most of the problems you fix linear and adds to repetition.All of this taken into account, you would think I would not recommend the game. However the game is fun in a zen repetition kind of way, and there is some novelty to the learning experience. My first maluch (old) car was more interesting since I had even less of an idea of where everything is, and I even left out some parts when putting the engine back together xDIf this is something that interests you, and the price is right, give it a try. But don't expect too much realism or much of a challenge.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a sharp game as it tears through time as you know it while you play CMS15. But here a few problems that I had in my brief play through. 1.) CMS15 was very hard to run on Ultra Graphics settings and using a GTX1070 graphics card just makes it a head scratcher on the low/laggy FPS. 2.) With the lack of control Scheme changes made available to the player, alongside with the awkwardness of the key placement to perform certain tasks. 3.)Also the game needs a custom mode that allows you to choose and build your ""Dream Car"" and whatnot.

												Short Version: Disassembly and reassembly is great but that is really all there is to it. Other functions are more of an add on with bare minimum to call it a function. Think original SIMS Pets mod.Decent game. Not too much to it but still fun enough that I feel like I got my 20 bucks worth and I did buy some of the DLC packs. Most of it revolves around taking apart cars and reassembly. There is really not much to it. You do not get penalized or rewarded for taking your time with it. You can end the job at any point and still get paid for work you did. Even during a ride, you cannot damage the cars (or dragging). The only thing that is negative is if you don’t put oil collecting thing under the car and get fined 100 bucks for the cleanup. Once you do enough jobs you get the option to buy Junkers and repair them than sell them or drag them. But that pretty much it. You only get one static shop. Jobs will come in no matter what you do. There is no bigger space to move in. There is no managing a garage, hiring other mechanics. No cliental or cliental review to give you more or less work. This is a very simple (detail oriented down to the screws) take a car apart and put it together. "

This sim has made it easy for me to learn how to take an engine apart, & it back togather again. I am learning the names of each part, where it goes, & why its importent. To the creators of this simulation, I thank you very much for teaching me something I've wanted to learn since HS, but thought I could never learn. You took something really complicated to me, & made it simple to learn. Perhaps, next yrs game can teach me about tourqe, & whatnot. Whatyasay? You up to the challenge?			"

												I'd have to say, I wasn't expecting this game to be any good but after playing over 2 hours with the game it's clear to see that this game is pretty interesting and fun!Is it perfect? No. But I will say that for a game that simulates being a mechanic rather than it being another joke game like modern Simulator games have become is breath of fresh air and I have to say that I think I might be putting more time into this game a lot more. I'd love to see this kind of creation in a racing game from these guys in the future because this is just outstanding.8.5/10 - Too Much Oil			"

												This a really cool game, but it's not something for everyone. I'll start out by saying that it's actually pretty fun repairing cars in this game, but if repairing cars is a game concept you dislike or don't think would be fun in any way, maybe this game isn't for you. I'm not a person who likes cars, but the idea seemed intriguing, and sure enough, I really liked the game. Now I'm going to give you some personal likes and dislikes about the game. I can't say it enough that these are my likes and dislikes and they are not factualLikes:- The game generally is quite educational. You generally learn about car parts and maybe what they do.- The game has a good learning curve. It generally doesn't throw a lot of tutorials at you, though I do think that it has one at the start- You can buy different old and broken car at an auction so that you can repair it. You can either choose to keep or sell it. That generally adds something new after you've learned practically everything.Dislikes:*- The games feels quite repetitive after about 30-40 hours or so. - I would have liked there to have been a bigger selection of cars. There's is actually a lot of different cars, but what I mean is that more variety, since a lot of the cars look the same on the inside.*The dislikes mentioned could probably have been solved by me bying the gold edition instead of the regular edition, but I don't have it so screw me right?All in all I would probably give it a 7/10**Do keep in mind, that if this doesn't sound intriguing to you, you definatly shouldn't buy this game. If it does sound intriguing to you, you should probably go for the gold or platinum edition instead, since they give A LOT more content that the regular version** "

												Love this game. Started out doing the most complicated jobs to earn money now i spend all my time flipping cars. The realism isnt the best (i.e. not all engines take 10w30, theres more than one configuration of v8s, tedious things like that), but a great game nonetheless. A few more additions that would be great are diesel cars and trucks, duallies, and being able to customize the interior. Just a few thoughts.			"

												This game is tedious and boring, regardless of what DLCs they add, the fact that you need to perform 9,000 parts replacement in-game before you even have the right to purchase the required parking lot, is enough to put non-serious car fanatics off... 1 part requiring up to 10 actions means you could end up spending a week of meaningless and mindless drudgery doing up to 90,000 meaningless and mindless actions...the fact that the camera view centers on the part being disassembled at a distance which usually leaves *all* the nuts & bolts at the very edge of the screen means this game will lead to a serious case of RSI on the wrist & arms...

												In it you have your own shop. You pick up the phone and accept or not the jobs. Some of them have a list of the parts you have to change, some of them not (which i prefer).Once the car is in your shop, you can visualy inspect parts for condition. After you earn some XP, you can buy skills (equipments) that you make the ""ispection job"" a lot easier. You then disassemble, change parts and assemble the car back together.I must say, not everybody will like its gameplay style, but as an Aircraft Mechanic myself, I feel like this game was made for me.I really hope they will make newer versions (maybe 2017?)P.S.: I really wish we could open the gearboxes though.

												I now have ~13hours of play time, enough for a review I think.Overall: Solid, fun game, but short.I started in normal mode and I was really happy with this game. The setup of the shop, moving cars around. Inspecting, removing, (repairing) and finishing the job is all great fun. After a couple of hours though I feel like parts of the car are missing. The engine and suspension are done pretty well in this game. Other than that I thought few parts of the car are in the game extensively.So I switched to epert mode and this gives a new challenge. Almost all info and hints are gone, which makes it hader and more fun. After a while though you kinda feel like you know all the parts in the game and even in expert mode you dismantle and reassemble the cars with ease. The disciption on expert mode says you need to know where al the screws are, but really if you just ""screw around"" in the general area of the part, that does job too.In conclusion. It's fun to investigate where the bad parts of the car are, repair and put the car back together. Engine and suspension parts are well done in this game (I guess). That is why I recommend this game on sale. After a while (~10-12hours), you know the parts by heart and its old. For his to be really great I'ld like maybe a fusebox or the inner parts of the gearbox or even just windshield wipers and fluid levels. This game is good enough for me, but it could be awesome.			"

												This is an interesting game for those who may have an interest in basic mechanical principals, although not entirely accurate it's enough for younger people or novices to learn basic fault finding (a must for any one who drives). You may not be able to tinker with an ECM or dive head first into a total restoration but for the price what more do you need. I thought it would get boring but after watching a young teenager be entertained all day I am convinced that it does offer value for money .. off you go now!

												Much more fun that you'd initially expect; I thought I'd drop a few minutes in, 4 hours later I'm wondering why the clock says 3am.  Definitely worth it at the $5 Steam sale priceThe game is great for those who don't even know where to find a spark plug or an oil filter, you'll learn a LOT about the anatomy of a car, where to find a lot of parts that you were too embarrassed to ask about before, and you'll have fun doing it!  I never knew what a camshaft was or where you'd find an intake manifold, but after seeing them in-game with the rest of the engine, I finally figured out what they do.  Swar bars? Ignition coils? Crankshafts? Learned that too!Don't expect to become a mechanic from this game - it skips a lot of the little things like bolts (eg - the gear box just comes right off while the engine is sitting in the car, it's not this simple in real life!), but like I said, you WILL learn where a lot of things are, what they're called, and won't look like a complete fool when you pop open a hood on a real car			"

												Overall a good time waster. The car repair aspect of it is fairly accurate if not basic. It feels good to complete a whole car restoration. This isn' the type of game you will spend hundreds of hours playing, but it is something different to play when you get tired of AAA games			"
