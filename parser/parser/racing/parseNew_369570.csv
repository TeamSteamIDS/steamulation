												Spectra is a retro-styled runner game more then it is racer. Avoid the obstacles while cruising down neon highways to the amazing soundtrack by Chipzel. If you don't believe me just take a listen for yourself. http://chipzel.co.uk/album/spectra

Downsides are the inability to use your own music, no visible global leaderboards and sometimes procedural nature of track generation could be a little unfair. Mostly due to the camera being zoomed in quite low and hitting blind hills. Keyboard and gamepad both worked well but no mouse control was supported. 10 levels included with standard and hardcore modes for each. Screen resolution scaled upto 4k+. Decent game in shorter bursts. Cheers folks.			"

												(Note: Steam doesn't allow for a ""neutral"" recommendation, which is what I would score this game. In the end, I chose a thumbs up.)""Spectra held great potential but the end result is too simple for its own good. The gameplay is intriguing but it never evolves and is plagued be repetition as are its visuals. One could make an argument its main draw is in the scoring system and attempting to beat it, but with no online leaderboards this too fails to meet expectations. At least it offers a stunning soundtrack.""Full Review: http://www.tech-gaming.com/spectra-review/ "

												If you are a fan of Chipzel's music buy the album and go buy audiosurf 1 or 2 and play it there you will have a way better time there. This game has the same concept as that racing game in the 200-in-1 game your grandmother buys you when you were 7 except somehow they screw with the controls. They feel extremely sluggish as if the same grandmother who bought you the 200-in-1 game was the driver of the car, most the time im holding the left or right arrow and the car barley turns either direction but gods forbid i let go and the car go right back to its original position faster than light. Now i am a fan of difficult games i played super hexagon, dark souls, demon souls, dank suits 2, all the touhou's and those have a learning curve and the deaths in those games dont feel half as cheap as the one's in this game and most of the time its because grandma wont turn the car fast enough. So there if you find this game's concept enjoyable buy the 200-in-1 version and buy the sound track its a way better use of your money.			"

												Soundtrack is fun to listen to, Visuals are beautiful. I like the concept of it, very simple with great atmosphere. But i wish there were checkpoints. Being at 60-70+ done on the map to only wipe out at the end really kills the vibe. Even if it starts you at half way, It would be so much better than starting all over again. That or i wish the maps were just a bit shorter. Thats all personal preference though. Its a good fun game. 8/10.			"

												Designed around each song, each stage has a unique look and tone to them despite being procedurally generated. There are little touches in each level's design that show that each area is indeed different, despite not appearing so at first. This works in the games favor, because after playing the game for a few minutes and going through each song, the tracks could start to bleed together in a macabre painting of bleeps and bloops if the soundtrack was too uniform the tracks are set up in such a way that it never gets to that point, unless you try the same stage over and over again.The players' struggle for perfection might also be hampered by the sometimes unfair obstacle placement which, while it is avoidable, requires a sort of hair-trigger reaction time that not even the most seasoned Counter Strike players have. It's when your ship is going downward on a track and then in suddenly tilts up, and it's very likely that there will be a block in the way causing you to lose a certain number of points. This can be increasingly frustrating when you've built up a lot of points up until this section and you end up losing them all to a randomly placed block. That's the issue with procedurally generated levels: you're never quite sure on what you'll get and there will be times that it does seem that the game is stacking the deck against you. While it does test your mettle, it can be frustrating and cause quite a few outbursts of profanities.Full Review[www.noobfeed.com] "

 This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of Review over at TechRaptor Summary: It's a reasonable different take on the endless runner genre. The interesting element here is actually the point system: the idea being you collect points and need to run out a timer before collecting the points, but with all the hazards and points around you, that can be more difficult then meets the eye. The game's core gameplay is good: it plays to twitch reactions and gives you room to experiment as you skirt along barriers and the edge for extra points. It's the staying power that lacks: the game has 10 tracks, and while the levels are procedurally generated, that only goes so far as a lack of hazards/traps shows. The game is solid at what it does, but don't expect it to keep your attention for a long period of time.  Gameplay Footage and Video First Impressions:

			This review was done with a key from the developer. Spectra twists the formula a bit on the endless runner genre, but does it do enough for a mobile port? Come find out.		

 Lists: +: Solid gameplay mechanics in particular with the point system and the risk/reward elements that it creates Controls work to the games advantage giving you the level of control you need without it being too forgiving.  Visuals and transition to the PC work reasonably. It's a mobile port, however, it was available on windows phone, so availability was limited.  Also love the gameboy in there even if it doesn't make sense-: Variety over a period of time. Too little tracks and traps to really extend gameplay over the long haul. I'm a chiptune lover, but too many similarities here in my mind with some of the tracks. Sound sliders are not present. "

YouTube™ Video: First Thoughts and Fun - Spectra 

			Views: 32		

			Hello and Welcome to First Thoughts and Fun, the show where I go into a game blind and see if it's able to be instantly interesting or boring by design.		

I would consider Spectra to be a fun, simplistic game with a futuristic aesthetic. During my time with the title, I found the game to be fun and compelling to want to do better but feel the game is not making full use of it's potential by not including a multiplayer component like a versus mode which I feel would work excellently with this title. Overall while I do recommend the title, I do so cautiously due to the lack of diversification in the levels and amount of them (10). However the main attraction in this title is the stellar soundtrack which was upbeat throughout. I will say pick this up but at discounted price as I feel £5.99 is a little steep for the amount of content currently available.			"

												Great soundtrack full of chiptunes, but unfortunately little else about this game is good. This game could and should be so much better but instead it feels like so much wasted potential.The controls are terrible: You'll be sliding dramatically left and right even with the slightest press of the controls, as if the entire game is covered in a thick sheet of ice. In a game where obstacles are often placed in rapid succession, this makes it almost impossible to actually avoid everything. If you're lucky, you'll grind off the side of something and get bonus points. If you're not, you'll bounce off of the very same thing and fly off the track, immediately ending the level.The levels are procedurally generated in such a way that you can get a different track even when playing the same stage at a different time, so while this adds some variety it also makes the game feel even more inconsistent. It feels like the the music should be synced to the gameplay but it never is. This might be in part because the start-of-level animation also starts the music, meaning you can skip up to 15 seconds of the song just by letting that play out.There are plenty of smaller quirks that make the game feel unsatisfying and frustrating. If it detects a controller, you can't interact with the game using keyboard and mouse at all; it will refuse to cooperate. When using keyboard and mouse, you have to use the keyboard in the game but the mouse to navigate everything else: you can't use mouse controls like in Audiosurf and there is no way to quickly replay a level or advance to the next without using the mouse. Smaller issues, such as an in-game timer that always shows 0 tenths of a second, pale in comparison to the greater problems with this title.			"

												I am wondering why this game was even created. Because yes, it indeed promotes chipzel's album... but the album came out two years ago, which in modern music terms is equal to ""ages"". Because yes, it gives a very nice audio-focused racing experience... but AudioSurf did it better, and nothing stops you from importing the album itself to the game. Because yes, it has randomly generated levels... but Soundodger+ did it better and even has a very advanced editor. Because yes, it has high scores and the incentive to boost your own results... but no global leaderboards, which makes it kind of pointles, plus all the levels look exactly the same and it gets really repetitive and boring.If you want my sugestion - drop it and import the album to Soundodger+ or Audiosurf - you will like it a whole lot more.

												Spectra is exactly the game I was expecting, while listening to the eponym album by Chipzel.You ride and it makes you feel badass. The scoring system is interesting since you earn points by doing dangerous actions (like touching the walls), but be careful, if you bump into them, you lose your multiplier (you gain multiplier with boost on the floor) AND the point you accumulated from your chains. At first, you have to take the maximum of Yellow Pixels you can. Don't take everything if you know that you'll lose them.So if you wanna score well, you have to know when you have to take a break, resetting your multiplier to zero but counting the accumulated points to your total points. Those points cannot be lost. Be careful to not fall from the track, because it's game over.Awesome game, and Chipzel is a really big plus. <3			"

												Spectra is a flashy cyber punk score attack game that features simple mechanics, but challenging gameplay.The game's premise is pretty simple. Keep your ship on the track, steer it away from danger, and collect points. Hit an obstacle and you lose your current score chain. The game focuses more on the score attack aspect than actually completing the track, though for obvious reasons, completing a track gives the player more opportunity to build his or her score. There's 10 tracks total, and a hardcore version of them as well, offering the player a decent amount of gameplay.

			Spectra: Quick Look (Score Attack, Racing, Indie game, gameplay, and review) Spectra is advertised as a racing game, but I feel this cyber punk indie game is much closer to a score attack game.		

Visually the game looks great, with a cyberpunk, almost Tron aesthetic. The music and audio are great as well, with fantastic upbeat chiptunes that fit right into the game's atmosphere. Presentation wise, I have no complaints. Though the game is simple, yet challenging, it does suffer a little from monotony. Though each progressing track get harder and harder, it's really more of the same, but with more obstacles, or an extra turn. As far as variety is concerned, the game lacks in the department.Overall, Spectra is a very easy to learn, yet hard to master game. It has a nice polished presentation, and ideal for the who like score attack games, or as a distraction from your more main staple games.Pros:- Polished presentation- accessible - Challenging GameplayCons:- Repetitive			"

												Never been one for racing games, never mind twitch based ones.I actually like it quite a bit. The art style tickles my 90's nostalgia, and music is fantastic. Tracks are quite long, longer than I'm use to, but they feel nice due to how well the music blends with the overall game.The objective is simple, get to the end of the track with the highest points and time possible. You do this by running into little cubes to up your points, and over arrows to build up speed. Be careful though, if you hit any obstacle it massively reduces speed and knocks off points. You can also easily go off the edge, failing you instantly.My main concern is the drift like nature of your vehicle. While it handles well enough, it has a dissatisfying glide/drift to its movement. I would except a twitch based racer to handle a bit tighter. Even so, it doesn't detract much from the game, and you quickly get use to it. After miserably falling of the track and running into things.The game certainly kept me on the edge of my seat at time, especially after hitting triple arrows a few times in a go, and then suddenly seeing a tight maze of blocks to navigate through at high speed while trying to get my cubes for my score; all while desperately trying not to fall off the edge.Is the game perfect? Not at all, I still don't like the glide/drift movement of the vehicle much. Even so it does a great job and I do enjoy it. Especially the music. It's a shame the soundtrack costs so darn much as I really like it and would even just buy it for that alone.PC Gameplay

												I'm recommending it for the music alone, though the game itself could stand to be improved.  For one, there's no volume slider, forcing you to utilize your desktop audio mixer.  Two, the levels have the same color scheme...mixing up the atmosphere from level to level would have made the game seem a bit less repetitive.

												I actually did not know this was a game since I had been listening to the soundtrack for so long. As a game, it's really simple, maybe too simple. You just move left and right and try not to fall off the map, there's no filters or anything, not even an options menu. But I am so in love with the soundtrack, that I can see myself playing this game for quite a while since it gives me something to do while listening to one of the greatest chiptune soundtracks of all time.
