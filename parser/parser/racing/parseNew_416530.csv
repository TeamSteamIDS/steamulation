								It's Crazy Taxi, Rogue Trip, Jet Set Radio, Rocket League and Tony Hawks Pro Skater thrown into a blender. What more could you ask for?!?!			"

												Tacopocalypse is a taco delivery game inspired by games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio. I was lured into playing this by the fancy graphics in the trailer, but you can get the most out of this game by watching the trailer than actually playing it. The art style is fantastic, and the sounds + punk soundtrack really flow well with it.My main disappointment was with the lack of content. There's one mode (two if you count the local multiplayer), with only one objective. Your objective is to deliver tacos (within a time limit), and get style points by doing stunts during the process. With the cash you make from delivering tacos you can buy 2 new cars and customize them but that's about it. You can collect hidden songs along the way which I thought was a nice touch, but there's just not enough incentive to play this. It doesn't help that there's no guidance system to tell you where you need to deliver the tacos, which is odd cuz they do point you in the direction of where you can stock back up on tacos after you've run out.There are 4 levels, which is a small amount but they're big and intricate enough to where you can pull off some neat tricks and grinds while being visually flashy. There aren't enough collectibles or objectives, so this makes them feel a bit too empty. The controls/physics were a little too over the top for my taste, there's too much freedom here with the ability to flip that I end up losing control, but I think this may be personal preference because the game is meant to be over the top and ridiculous. If you can get used them you may have more fun performing sunts than I did. There didn't seem to be much depth to the stunts you can do, you do flips by rotating your car and grind rails but that's all I noticed.There were some minor bugs I encountered with my short time with the game, including getting a black screen on the first level I played after the tutorial, falling through the ground (not a big deal cuz you can reset your vehicle with ease), and music not playing. I don't know the success rate of the dev fixing bugs, but the dev does respond to bug submissions on the forum.In its current state, I can't recommend Tacopocalypse. You might be able to get a few minutes of enjoyment out of it, but there's just not enough to do. This comes off more as a tech demo or art project than a game, which is unfortunate because I would love to see this art style, open world level design, and sound/music implemented into a game with a substantial amount of gameplay. I think it's a really cool concept, but not a good execution.			"

For the sake of brevity..Genre tags: Driving, ArcadeValue Proposition: There isn't a ton of content so the $10 entry fee seems a little high but if you can get it on sale (I purchased it in a bundle) it's pretty fun. Mildly archaic in a nostalgic sort of way. BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Little bit Tony Hawk, little bit Simpsons Road Rage, little bit Crazy Taxi, little bit Pain – That PS3 game where you slingshot a human.Concomitant Exposition and SummationThe world is at an end and the vast populace needs tacos.Tacopocalypse is an arcade-y driving game in which you need to deliver tacos in quick succession. However, in your noble quest to sustain the hunger of many in the dying moments of earth you've had the unfortunate brain malfunction of only bringing three orders with you. And this is the loop.You drive around an open map taking tacos to certain spots. You can boost, you can even double jump. You can also flip the car around in the air for style points. There are not a ton of maps though they are quite varied and rather large. There is some lite customization in the vehicle though money earned from delivering tacos. The OST is also very ”punky” – extremely reminiscent of the Tony Hawk games. THE GISTFun distraction, has a mild ability to scratch  a very specific nostalgic itch. Look for a sale.Follow my curation page for more. "

												A decent arcade racing game, fun and has great music and quite good graphics.I recommend it for everyone who enjoys arcade racing games.Especially if they need to de-stress and get fun.On each map there will be a lot of jumps.Your task is to fly higher, turn around for a while and get paid for it.You can upgreade your car to make it awesome.It's actually the fun single-computer multiplayer racing game I have ever played.

								I have to say this is one of the all time great being overshadowed by Triple AAA dissapointed. This gave me more fun than Tom Clancy the Division and COD BOP 3 combined. The developer influence from Rocket League, Tony Hawk and Jet Star Radio has allowed the game to become a combination of the three and flourish as it own game. So far all review so far have been extremely good and this is no difference. This game is true fun which is all you want from one, you can play with friend, high replayablilty, great soundtrack and more. Nothing to prove. Game of the Year Award. Viva Del Tacopocalyse.			"

												Tacopocalypse:~~~~~~~~~~~~  Are you looking for a job to get you through your University studies? Maybe you are just looking at an additional income to put food on the table for your family. Have you thought of becoming a delivery person for a Mexican fast food business?  Great, we need drivers to deliver huge numbers of tacos . . . Just think Taco, Taco and only Taco! Tacopocalypse is all you need to know!Tacopocalypse is a racing / action game where you have to deliver as many Taco orders as possible within three minutes.As you are a new recruit, it will be a good idea to learn the ropes to become an expert taco delivery person by playing a short an easy-to-follow tutorial. After familiarising yourself with the controls, you will be able to choose to play in one of the four available maps, which are: Golden Bay Burps, Downtown, the Military Airport and the Beachside. You will only be able to carry a maximum of three serves of tacos at any given time. Locate all the taco symbols and make sure you touch them with your state-of-the-art second-hand car to make a delivery. The interesting thing is that some icons will be located on tops of buildings or even in the middle of nowhere. This is where you will need to know how to use ramps as well as your speed booster to be able to reach them. The other interesting point is that your car has a curious suspension system. Yes, your car can jump and even double jump, which can be very helpful at times, especially for avoiding collisions with other vehicles. Each time you successfully deliver an order, you’ll be collecting money which you’ll be able to use to unlock specific upgrades, paints or even for purchasing exciting new delivery cars.  There are other icons to collect, such as tape recorders (which will unlock new songs) and spray paint (which will give you access to additional paint jobs to customize your car). You will definitely run out of stock very quickly (remember, you only carry three meals in your car), so locate the pick-up point to re-stock - you can’t miss it; it’s a big yellow circle with small taco’s flying up towards the sky. As with all good taco delivery person, stunts are in your veins and the bigger they are the better it is to boost your income.I like the car customization; nothing too fancy but when you collect enough money, you can purchase new parts such as spoilers, antennas and others. You can play this game on a local-network too, with three of your friends, which is a lot of fun.The graphics are nice and the soundtrack is very good too. I would definitely recommend playing with your gamepad as I find it easier to control. I do feel that we need more content (additional icons to pick up and maps) in Tacopocalypse.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Nice artwork-	Fun and easy to play-	Good soundtrack-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Definitely need more contentsTacopocalypse is a fun casual racing game.6/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I was not expecting Crazy Taxi meets Tony Hawk's Pro Skater when I started this game but that's exactly what I got: deliver tacos in the apocalypse as a soundtrack of actual punk bands blare and the ollies are leading into the flips.Definitely one of the more creative indie games under the radar on Steam right now and should be checked out by anyone who wants a fun over the top car stunt game.

												This game is really fun for about 4 hours. After that point theres was just not enough content to keep me captivated - I'll come back to this game if they add more levels. I recommend it if you aren't expecting a big game, but a few fun levels, great music and really fun car movement. The controls for the car feel great (simmilar to rocket league) + the levels are good ++ the music is amazing and the leaderboards + collectables is great.  -------- Theres just not much content ~7/10			"

								Tacopocalypse is a mechanical blast from the past featuring tricks and scoring fromTony Hawks, the delivery aspect of Crazy Taxi, and the car mechanics of Rocket League... but let's not forget that incredible soundtrack.Playing this early build hints that this title has SO MUCH potential to be great with the right love. Maybe future releases could feature objectives like the old THPS? Maybe we could see an online mode? I could go on with how giddy this throwback is getting me.			"

												I have had this game since early access and am glad that I got it when I did because I have always really liked the concept of this game. I actually just started it up for a quick look at it and it has improved significantly from when I have last played the game. The momentum and physics have improved greatly. Before it was like the original Super Smash Flash, almost as if you were constantly driving on ice and it was quite impossible to steer although the concept was fantastic to me from the start. The environment is now destructible and seems like it has added lots of fun to the game. I look forward to trying this out and I will give you more of an update later.			"

This game features awesome graphics, fun gameplay, local multiplayer, multiple game modes, fluid controls, and innovative mechanics. I can go on and on!CONS:I want to run people over and throw tacos at their corpses.			"

												So much Dreamcast era nostalgia packed into this lovingly crafted little indie gem.  The developers seem very active, whether on the Steam forums or Kickstarter.  You can run this thing on a potato, I easily ran it maxed out above 1080p and still had a rock solid 60 fps.  First Unreal 4 Engine title that I've been able to do that with, lol.  The celshading is simple, but highly effective.  Love the Jet Set Radio visuals.  The absurdity of a taco truck somersaulting through the air, doing ollies and grinding on rails while the world is engulfed in the fiery blaze of Armageddon . . . . not gonna lie I lost it a few times.My only gripe is how much weight I'm going to gain playing this game.  Everytime I boot it up now I want to take a trip to either Capital Tacos or Tijuana Flats lol!			"

								This game is a blast! Like its been said before, its very much like Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi and maybe a little bit of Rocket League. Its got that Cel shaded look kind of like Jet Set Radio. Its got a killer soundtrack like Crazy Taxi. And its pretty much controls exactly like Rocket League. I played a little on my own and thats fine but its a blast with some friends. Im one of those weird believers in local split screen games and this one has it! Its a fun party game. I very much recommend the game to anyone who is looking for something different with a real arcade feel to it.			"
