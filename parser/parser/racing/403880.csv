												Its a good sim with a difficult learning curve if you care to put in the time.Harder than riding in real life, well I ride but don't race.  Its more of a sim than the game ""ride"" too imo.			"

												I liked the game. If you haven't played motogp for a few years, this one is to get. I don't think I would pay 40 euros for the same engine based game. I would expect AAA optimized graphics, but Compact is really balanced at the price and features. If you like MotoGP, this one is to get.			"

												This is the hardest racing game I've ever played. I'm getting canned on 'Very Easy'... I've turned off most of the help, like the guide line and steering assist, but still...In Forza that wouldn't be a problem. I usually find the guide line distracting. MotoGP 15 is a lot of fun. I appreciate the difficulty, I love motorcycle racing, the graphics are good, and I dont have anything to complain about. Especially at $10. If you want a game that's built around letting you win, skip this one. Otherwise gruel on.			"

												This game has no feeling at all, motogp 08 is still the best and has the best sound aswell. The sound that the bikes have in this game sounds like a early 2000's rallycross game. worthless. cmon milestone, you can do better than this!			"

												To be brutally honest... the MotoGP game series hasnt been the same since Milestone first took over and when they realesed MotoGP 13 I was seriously underwhelmed and quite frankly disappointed at what they had created but Ill give them credit where credit is due, MotoGP 14 was a big improvement and I found myself spending hour after hour doing lap after lap after lap and MotoGP 15 was no different and this compact version is great if you just want a cheap and cheerful bike racing game.  Of course there is the odd bug or two and sure the actual riding mechanics make no sense at all, but hey, thats all part of the fun.			"

												If you're a single player only type of guy/girl, the racing aspect of the game is 10/10. As for the fact I couldn't make an online username/account (due to not being sent the registration email?!) I refunded and have to give it a negative review. What's the point of online scoreboards if you can't access them...?			"

												Beware Newbies.After recently getting into racing games and wanting to try out a bike racing game, I picked up MotoGP 15 Compact after reading a review from another user. I was excited to try the game and was looking forward to riding a motorbike for the first time.That being said, I have to warn you. This game is not for newbies. It is not an entry into racing games by any means. This game's controls are exceptionally difficult and personally I was not willing to put the effort into learning them.The graphics are beautiful, sound is on point and everything is top notch but those controls are extremely unforgiving, even with all the assists turn on. I know some of you may simply think I'm a noob, but that's the whole point. From a newbie's prespective I would definitely recommend avoiding this one as it is clearly catered to people who have experience with racing games.I could barely keep my bike on the road and couldn't get out of last place no matter how hard I tried due to the extremely difficult learning curve. This is not a game for newbies and definitely not for people just starting out with racing games. Unfrortunately I can't really recommend any other alternatives so if you do want to put in the effort to learning the mechanics and controls in this game just understand that it will take a very long time to master.

												Graphics in video misleading. Looks like it runs on a gameboy. Sound hasnt even worked for me so far. Also, where the hell are my kawasakis????!!!!!! Played for one minute, after one minute, the only thing that amused me was popping wheelies and doing endo's. 10/10 would do the wheelies, endos, and crash into players again.10/10 would uninstall again.10/10 would take my money back and return the game.
