												If you check out most of my reviews, they are just under 1000 words long. Usually, I feel the need to write a long review talking about what I feel is important. This is not such a case.In short, it's a lot like Big Rigs, but better.This game is... dreadful, but also kind of fun. The main reason its fun is because of how lighthearted it is, and how colourful everything is, along with the pleasent, if repetitive music.But it's also completely broken is almost every possible way. The environments are glitchy, the car controls kind of crappily, the controls don't really work sometimes, and there isn't really much of a goal except to collect all the stuff in the level and go to the next...It really just that simple. Here's a level, collect the stuff, move on. That's it. No racing. No real need to do stunts at all. It's just... here. Drive around and collect stuff.Just to give an example of how broken this game is, I came across a bug after 4 mintues of playing where, if I jumped, and then held the backwards key (""s"" for me), I instantly started flying up into the air, and as long as I kept the key pressed, I kept going. While this is actually kind of fun, and I would hate to see it removed, it does sort of highlight how broken this game is. Also, every time I died, I couldn't access the first person viewpoint any more. No idea why, it just didn't let me. You can also drive directly up vertical walls, and your car goes faster going backwards than it does forwards. Once again, this is actually kind of awesome, and does have some fun in it, but I doubt they intended it to be like this.It's a lot like Big Rigs in that sense. Terrible glitches, but ones that serve to be entertaining. Without them, the game would ironically be a lot worse I feel.At the same time, despite all of this, the game doesn't really lie about what it offers. You can do stunts, I guess, though there's no reason too. And you drive a small car. It's sort of enjoyable, so what the hey. A thumbs up for now. Maybe I'll change my mind later, but right now, it's 3:20am here in Australia, and I need to get some sleep.			"

												This feels like the alpha version of a game. Within the only 5 minutes of playing the game, I encountered the following:- The game didn't start on the first attempt - after the intro screen the window stayed black. Had to kill the process and restart.- When starting out, there's only one game mode, one car, and one ""track"" available. You have to collect items on some sort of open-world island to unlock even other race modes. The open-world collect-things game mode was not fun to me, but of course that's completely subjective.- The controls are laughably bad. A small change in slope may suddenly jerk the car around. You will do lots of flips and crashes for no reason. It's almost impossible to consistently go where you're aiming.- The physics are hilarious or terrible, depending on your point of view. The car will do multiple flips in one jump all the time for no reason. At one point after my car exploded on impact, I respawned like 100 meters in mid-air. Instead of falling down, I ""fell"" up for probably 200 more meters before falling back down. I was in mid-air for at least 30 seconds total before hitting the ground and exploding again. This happened within the first and only 5 minutes of playing this.- I gave up on the game after about 5 minutes. When quitting, the process crashed, got stuck and I had to kill it again via task manager.I like small casual games, but this one is ridiculously unfinished. Avoid.			"

												Very fun.  To a degree it reminds me of the original Carmageddon games where I would often ignore the race and just explore the levels.  This game has no race and gives you incentives for exploring.  It's a very relaxed and enjoyable kind of game.			"

												this game is quite fun for all ages it's not hard to unlock everything in the game in 2 or 3 hours  I can see myself playing this game for over 200 hours. the things i really like are the fact you can control the car in the air and land anywhere you want by simply using nitro or steering it you can even climb up walls to get to where your going. landing every possible trick is done by learning how to control it in the air and i have almost mastered flight controls. this is one of those sleeper games where nobody pays attention to it but it's going to get super popular in time when friends see friends playing it for 200 hours or more like my friends will see. I recommend this game for everyone because in time i know the few minor bugs will be fixed and it will still be the perfect little game for everyone. Also it's that perfect little game to get all achievements in less than 15 hours. the hardest ones are the 25, 50 & 100x 1440 degree flatspins but they are easy to get with a little grinding.

												First game to make me physically feel ill while playing. No, it's not an ""insane"" stunt game. It's just a poorly designed one. The physics are terrible, the smallest bump in the road will send you flying or 180ing. The controls suck, no matter how you tweak them and doing stunts, what few there are, is ridiculously easy. Now to the physically ill part; I can't really understand why this is literally the ONLY game to do it but I suspect it's because when you control the vehicle in 3rd person it appears the terrain, not the car, shifts. It looks ridiculous and it's a bit messed up. Even if I am the only that perceives the camera as such you're still left with a poorly made game that's too easy, despite itself, and not fun. There was definite potential here but it was wasted.			"

												Picked this up in a bundle alongside a couple of games I actually wanted, and actually this is quite fun. If you ever played Re-Volt and liked finding the stars, this is basically that. Or, the parts of Carmageddon 2 where you were doing missions jumping from roof to roof. It's kind of almost like a car platform game. The controls (I used an Xbox 360 controller, which it does support, though doesn't actually tell you the button mapping or allow you to change it, but the default mapping makes sense to my hands) didn't quite feel right to start off with, but after a few minutes I got the hang of it and was able to control my stunt jumps quite nicely. It feels a little unfinished in places and I kind of wanted more than is available in terms of gameplay, but for a few quid, it's definitely worth it.			"

												The Short Version: 7/10, but keep in mind this is a driving exploration game, not a racing game. You'll be disappointed if you expect Mario Cart. Think Spyro's hub worlds in a car, and graphics like the original Spyro.Long Version: I'm two levels in and I have to say this game is exactly what I wanted. You drive an RC car around a large area collecting hidden things and doing tricks. I have a couple of complaints, however. Doing tricks doesn't seem to do anything but flash some text; It'd be nice if there were more motivation for me to rack up score or soemthing. There doesn't seem to be a functional difference between the cars, and they all cost one coin to unlock (you get a coin by finding three parts in a level.) So after you've found one coin you'll unlock the car you like and after that there's no incentive to unlock more. The graphics are pretty rudimentary, and in places you'll think you're playing a PS1 game. Despite these issues, the game is still fun if you like exploring an area and collecting things in a vehicle. It brings back memories of playing Diddy Kong Racing and San Francisco Rush 2049's stunt mode, and is comparable to the drive-around-collect-stuff mode from Joyride Turbo on Xbox 360. I only wish this game's player investment system had gotten a bit more attention.			"

												When title säys StuntMANIA my first thoughts are remake of good old classic: 4D Sports Driving aka Stunts.Well this game certainly isn't one.I's about open kind of world driving with RC cars. Your goal is to collect coins and other stuff from ""track"" to achieve new cars and tracks - if I figured it out. It could be fun BUT:* The controls aren't rebindable and steering feels very clumsy.* It doesn't work with my driving wheel (and hat HUGE con for driving game).* It might have 360 controller support but not for PS controller, and well controls can't be rebind* It's not pretty and I still have some performance issues. - well my computer isn't top of the notch, but so isn't this game.Few pros:* Open world. You really can't fail while driving. So it could be suitable for kids.* Driving could be fun.* This definitely isn't worst game in world. It actually could be good. - and some might feel like it already.Got it from some bundle. Wouldn't buy it separately. And wouldn't buy bundle because it has this game.			"

												Well what a surprise, this is actually a pretty neat little game. It has native Xbox 360 controller support, although there's nothing in the options or menus telling you what does what... it's not hard to figure out.The controls feel a little touchy at first. Okay, a lot touchy. You have to make corrections quickly and there's not much margin for error, but you're controlling what's basically an R/C car that can take a lot of punishment, so it's okay.The game starts out with nothing but an open world type map with all these powerups and collectibles scattered around everywhere. You have to build coins out of fragments to unlock more maps, vehicles, and game modes, but starting out you have access to 3-4 different vehicles so it's not bad. As you go through the level you also collect upgrades for your current car - things like nitro, super jump, low gravity, extra health, etc. The challenge is to figure out how to jump or climb up to the hard to reach spots to get your goodies. There's no penalty for dying, you just respawn at a random location, sometimes way up in the air.Like other reviewers have mentioned, you have full control over your pitch and roll while in the air, so you're basically like a cat in that way. If you're good at being a cat, you'll always land on your feet... err... tires. If not, if you land on your nose or roof, you'll probably go boom if you're high enough.You can switch camera angles. I found it's easiest to control spin from the bumper cam, but the disadvantage is it's harder to see where the roads, ramps, and hills lead off to. There's no way to adjust where you're looking, it's always straight ahead, except in third person, then the camera faces whatever direction you're going. There's a button to do a full 180 reverse, and another button to do a quick stop. It's not like a handbrake, it's to stop completely. This is useful for planting yourself on hard to reach ledges after you had to take a running jump to get to it. I keep forgetting that's what it's for but there it is.So, this game is cheap, it's goofy, it's fun, and with so many things to unlock and maps to explore, I think it's well worth it for the price. Thumbs up! A solid 7/10 at least. Good fun.			"

												StuntMANIA Reloaded was a game which I had conflicting thoughts on. It's fun and not serious or a pretentious game, and it feels like it was developed with attention and good intentions, however it has a few drawbacks which stopped it being as good as it could have been.+ The design is mostly consistent throughout, nothing feels out of place + Controls mostly work well+ A throwback to games such as Re-volt, and more of a unique game today+ The aesthetics, environment design and the car models are well designed and make the game quite visually appealing and colourful+ The sound design is pretty good and the soundtrack is fun to listen to, nothing special or memorable but it works and it isn't particularly annoying or makes you want to turn the sound off. The engine noises sound like the cars actually have power behind them and each vehicle seems to have different sounds.Negatives- As other reviews stated, it's pretty glitchy. Most of these aren't game-breaking but some of them get pretty annoying, such as respawning in mid air and being thrown around or having small areas of ground which aren't solid.- The car handling seems to be pretty strange, quite slippery until you collect power-ups, it seems to improve a little then but it's still quite odd.- One level glitched and didn't have any sound playing, the sewer level glitched and some areas were without light, making it pitch black and impossible to see where you were.-The collectables don't seem to have any purpose other than the coins, which could have been done better so that you had more of a reason to collect them. - You can't see how many collectables you've picked up until you collect another one, making it difficult to tell later on in the level if you've collected everything.- The game doesn't end when you collect everything so you have to manually end the game which feels strange. There's no indicator of if you've played a level before besides having unlocked it.That said, I bought this in a bundle for cheap and it ended up being one of the better games of the bundle, and it made up for the cost of the bundle by itself.

												This game is fun, I will say. It's very unwinding and a relaxing game involving racing on amazing and awesome jumps and loops and well, stunts. STUNTMANIA Reloaded is a basic free-roaming racer involving several gigantic maps that have all sorts of hidden and secret areas to explore. Each of the ~10 maps feature hundreds of jumps and stunts, complete with large amounts of green, yellow, and red collectables to gather in each level. Also in each stage, there are 3 types of coins that need to be gathered in-order to unlock certain parts of the game. Some coins need to be gathered in 3 pieces, which will be spread around the map. These include the first coin, a ""car coin"", which is used to unlock different cars. Second, a ""level coin"", which is used to unlock different levels. And the only coin that comes in whole, the ""gamemode coin"", which is used to unlock gamemodes. Finally, in each level there will be a set of powerups. These powerups include Super Jump, Nitro, Antigravity, Teleport, and more. These little parts of gameplay make this game a very fun and relaxing racer/explorer, leaving you taking a long breath at the ramps, loops, and obstacles of each map.""Wait, if this is 'very fun', then why did you rate it badly?"" You may be asking.The biggest and most dreaded downfall of all players' experiences is the giant number of glitches and bugs that there are in this game. Let me explain. So, you crash your car into a wall, and you wait around 2 seconds for it to respawn. Around 1/7 of the time your car will respawn being shot up into the air like a cannon and stay airborne for a good 40 seconds, leaving you with nothing to do but wait. Once that car comes crashing down again, unless you've picked up the ""Mega Health"" powerup, there's a 50/50 chance that you won't survive the fall, with the possibility of respawning shot up into the air once more. However, I have come to a slight realization of the glitch and it is if you've crashed with your car's nose tipped mildly upwards, it seems to bring up the glitch. An easy way to stabilize your car is holding down SPACE, but this is still unconfirmed as far as I know. In the game I guarantee that you'll find your car glitching through the map either fully, or just partially, even if you can make it out with a small hop. And, I've also taken note that you can literally drive up a flat wall, whether it be land, or a building, without any powerups or any help or tricks.Now, I will say that this game is relaxing, fun, and enjoyable, but the glitches that this game possesses just seem to ruin the fun for most people. The price just doesn't seem like it's worth it's value if it's possessed by such bugs and broken mechanics, even if it's only $5. However, this game demonstrated to me amazing levels, and breathtaking and cool stunts and jumps and loops; This game is its own rollercoaster. But, even all of this doesn't top for the game's value. The only time I would recommend to buy this game is when it's on sale, or in Humble Bundle or other such sorts.			"

												The options menu is bugged. Once you choose it, you can't change anything and you can't exit the game. My knockoff Xbox One controller didn't work with the game either. The game was fine for the $1 I paid for it but when I want to kick back, relax and play a game in Big Picture mode as I did first with the game, it makes for a frustrating experience. If Steam doesn't start vetting its games better so we can have a full console experience with no fuss and no bugs, the Xbox store will take over. I can bet they'll make sure their games are a less frustrating experience for those wanting a more console-like experience.			"

												StuntMANIA Reloaded is a fun and charming do what you want, car game. Sure it's got some bugs, camera issues, respawning issues, textures not loading, but for $5 it really isn't a bad game. The music for the game is very interesting and is fun to listen to, and the ideas for the levels are really cool (Mini Golf is probably my favorite). There is a nice small selection of cars to choose from and having to collect coins to unlock them, levels, and game modes let's you search every nook and cranny on the map. Some pieces are difficult to find, but it shouldn't take long to get all the coins on every level. Go Crazy is a neat feature, no time pressure or objective really, you can go nuts and drive to your hearts desire, blowing up your car as many times as you want. One thing I really wish that would have been added were nice backdrops. It gets boring looking out into the gray/black outside of the arena, though this is a smaller issue. All in all, this is a good game for $5, even if it was $10. It's not the game of the year, but the developer clearly had a great idea in their head, and did a great job of making a fun game.			"

												Really glitchy but in a good hilarious way like goat simulator with wheels. This game is great fun it a little repetitive. A real blast.  Would be great with a split screen co-op mode.			"

												StuntMANIA Reloaded is a fun and charming do what you want, car game. Sure it's got some bugs, camera issues, respawning issues, textures not loading, but for $5 it really isn't a bad game. The music for the game is very interesting and is fun to listen to, and the ideas for the levels are really cool (Mini Golf is probably my favorite). There is a nice small selection of cars to choose from and having to collect coins to unlock them, levels, and game modes let's you search every nook and cranny on the map. Some pieces are difficult to find, but it shouldn't take long to get all the coins on every level. Go Crazy is a neat feature, no time pressure or objective really, you can go nuts and drive to your hearts desire, blowing up your car as many times as you want. One thing I really wish that would have been added were nice backdrops. It gets boring looking out into the gray/black outside of the arena, though this is a smaller issue. All in all, this is a good game for $5, even if it was $10. It's not the game of the year, but the developer clearly had a great idea in their head, and did a great job of making a fun game.			"

TL;DR: Very bland and boring pseudo open-world stunt-racing game.As much as I like play-testing other devs alpha-versions of their projects, asking people to pay money for it and not even calling the game ""Early Access"" is kind of hypocritical.* Controls are awful. Spins and twist are totally random -- you can be rolling down a perfectly flat hill and all of a sudden start twisting/spinning in the air.* No tutorial, no campaign, no storyline, no progression. Yes, you have cars, tracks and modes to unlock. Which is basically more of the same -- cars have all the same (awful) physics, and tracks aren't unique and seem like reskins. Modes are kinda unique, but boring nevertheless.* Game is riddled with bugs. Dying will usually bug up your sound (engine keeps revving), and respawning will occasionally launch you in the air -- you will be ""falling"" upwards instead of, like, you know, the gravity tells you.* Gameplay isn't obvious, to put it mildly. Pseudo open-world stunts racing game with no scores, no time limit, no opponents, no tutorial. Just roam around, pick some useless boosters (affects nothing), unlock new tracks, repeat the process there.Extremely boring. Avoid.			"

												when you first play it, it might seem a bit weird but the game really grows on you. It's a game that can be enjoyed by both young and old (some people say it's just for kids). there are a lot of different  modes, you have to explore each world, obtain coins, do stunts, use power ups. I throroughly enjoy this game and it keeps me coming back, it's also an ideal game for casual gamers because you can set out to do one or more things every time you play. i wrote this review mostly because the game got a lot of mixed reviews which i think is unfair because it's not a big game studio but they did deliver a really nice game			"

												Physics are terrible and it's just an ""exploration game"". So yeah, I'd say this game doesn't have much to offer.			"

												Good:the game can be fun and the cars have fun but also glitchy physix and works with a 360 controler.Bad:the game is buggy as hell and creates a crash report everytime i close it and not just when it crashs and it does crash pretty often lol.also the cars glitch through the ground at times especialy when hitting ramps, instead of going over them you get stuck in them or they flip you over or blow you up,also respawns sometimes send you tumbling into spacethe game feels early beta at best and defenatly needs work. it be worth a $1 but defenatly not $5 got mine in a bundle so no hurt feelings here:)			"
