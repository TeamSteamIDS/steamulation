												Over priced game made by a company with shady buisness practices. Game used to be $5, but the second people started buying the game they raised the price to $11 and constantly shifted the price around that point; however, whenever there is a sale, they change the release date of the game in order to get it to show up on the front page, which is a very irresponsible way to advertise a 2 year old game. Disgusting. Do not buy this game at full price. If you really want to play it, pirate it, but I wouldn't even bother since there's little to no content and no new updates for over a year.EDIT: Changed the incorrect information brought up by the developers.

												Polarity is a first person logic puzzle game whose concept is vastly inspired by Portal. It has similar mechanics but at the same time it is full of originality. The companion cubes might not be as cute as in Portal, but they’re still present in this game and needed to complete the puzzles. An innovation consists in the ability of the player to switch between two polarities (red – blue) which allows him to run through gates or to jump on platforms, according to the selected polarity.The single player part consists of 14 puzzles that are not too hard to solve, with difficulty increasing  each level though. However, even the most difficult levels can be solved in less than 5 minutes each. The 10 bonus levels are slightly more difficult to figure out, but they add new fun features to the game.The coop mode, on the other hand, is quite challenging. The two players must cooperate to solve the puzzles that are much more complex than in single player mode. The levels are bigger, now consisting in multiple rooms. The path to the exit isn’t usually the same for the two players, but nevertheless, they need to work together to reach it. There are places in which timed jumps are needed while trying to grab certain objects at the same time, and these jumps are not easily performed with a controller as compared to a mouse and keyboard setup. Sadly, the game offers only local coop and not online multiplayer, so make sure to invite a friend that can be persuaded to work on those together with you, without him losing his patience. Or even better, maybe you can convince him/her to do those tricky jumps :)Don’t hesitate to buy it, especially discounted, since it is a very fun game!More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												QUICK NOTE: At the time I'm writing this, the game is on sale at $0.54 (95% off). At that price, I could recommend the game, sure. Unless you absolutely cannot get enough first person puzzle/platforming, I wouldn't get it otherwise, especially not at $10.99.---You play as a hacker that is being paid (presumably) a large amount of money to hack into a level and steal data through some physical manifestation of your target's... network? Mainframe? God knows. The point is you have to go through 12 levels (followed by another 10 bonus levels), collecting 3 Data Fragments per level.The main gimmick of the game is that you can switch your ""Polarity"" at will - between red and blue. While a certain color, you will collide with objects of the opposite color (such as lasers, which will kill you), but pass through objects of the same color. There are also cubes (pretty much tiny Companion Cubes) which behave in a similar fashion. The cubes will power things when plugged into a slot, very similar to how Companion Cubes could hold buttons down to keep platforms suspended, etc. in Portal. Add a couple generic objects, such as launch pads and moving platforms, and you pretty much have the entire game.The game unabashedly takes a lot of inspiration from Portal: levels feel like sterile, self-contained test chambers, the only difference is that everything's dark grey instead of white, and you don't have a charming robot voice monologuing you or telling a story while you progress; the large and open, but still linear level design; and a general futuristic theme (though it's admittedly silly to mash both Portal and Polarity into such a vast genre and expect it to mean anything). You don't need to collect the 3 Data Fragments to technically ""beat"" the level - rather, you can simply progress through the level and find the exit. This is where most of the difficulty comes from. However, Data Fragments are required to unlock the next levels. They are usually poorly hidden, if not put directly in plain sight, and by simply walking around the room you can easily tell how to get to the fragments. The worst the game will do is put them behind a small puzzle, or out of your immediate field of view when you enter a room. To put it into perspective, the only levels I needed to play more than once were the first and second levels, where I missed one fragment each, because it was placed slightly out of sight or in a corner that I had carelessly overlooked.It doesn't feel good to collect data fragments because the level design is not challenging at all. The main ""puzzle"" in each level often requires next to no thinking. I beat all 22 single-player levels in about 50 minutes, and was fairly bored the entire way through. Sadly, this is why I can't say I recommend this title.It's not that the art style is uninspired and simple - that doesn't necessarily make a game bad.It's not that the music, and the general sound design for that matter, has a generic, forgettable 80s futuristic feel, which I'd normally think was quite humorous or charming - lots of devs these days just use stock royalty-free music and nobody seems to mind that too much. At least this has custom music (I think).It's not that it's trying to copy Portal - I don't see a huge amount wrong with following the footsteps of a very successful puzzle game and trying to recreate that formula!It's not even that the first person animations, head bobbing, and movement glitches make it painfully obvious this is a 3D Unity game. Or that my Logitech F310 - a fairly good controller when it comes to compatibility - would only work during the main menu and the two ""cutscenes"" that exist in singleplayer.The problem is the frankly depressing lack of content, and, more importantly, the content that IS there is unchallenging, unengaging, and simply not fun. As a developer, I'd be disappointed if I spent a significant amount of time and effort building a game and only could be bothered to make a few mediocre-at-best levels that don't even show the potential of what few mechanics that DO exist. As a consumer, I'm very confused with how this game has so many positive reviews - must just be me being out of touch with the puzzle game community. Don't expect level design that lives up to Portal, or any other good puzzle game I can think of, really.TL;DR - Game's really dry on content, and what content DID manage to find its way in is insultingly easy and boring. I'd say it's worth neither your time nor your money. Get on a crazy 95% off sale, if at all.			"

Polarity is a fun little puzzle game, whether you are in for some achievement hunting or simply want to face some brain challenges. However, note that this game's stages are nowhere near the level of other puzzles games such as Portal or The Talos Principle. Most of the levels in Polarity won't leave you thinking for more than 2 or 3 minutes, sometimes the solution is painfully obvious, making the completion of this game feel rushed, even though there are 20 levels attached to it.The goal of the game is to reach the end chamber of each level (similar to the Portal series). In doing so, you have to make use of red and blue cubes in order to activate different mechanisms. In addition, you can change your player's ""polarity"" from red to blue and vice-versa. This is mainly useful because some walls only allow you to pass through them if you are in their specific polarity.We are presented with a poor attempt at a story, which will not matter in the slightest throughout the game and only serves as a filler. However, this isn't anything important if you don't care much about a storyline. Polarity is, after all, a puzzle game.The game looks pretty, visuals are nothing too impressive, but they're on point for its genre. Unfortunately, the game seems unpolished. There are glitches, some slightly unfinished areas, while the places which represent abyssal falls are literally... void, leaving the map in a lackluster state.The music is pretty much alright. Fortunately, there's a couple of songs attached to it, so the same tune will not repeat through each level.The store page of the game claims to feature a multiplayer factor. However, this is partly true. You can only play a local co-op campaign with your friend, on the same computer, using either a keyboard and a controller, or two controllers.Summary:Pros: + Fun little game to kill time with and relax;+ Overall a nice simplistic approach to games such as Portal;+ Collectibles and achievements, as well as the co-op campaign, encourage replayability;+ Ambient music that fits the game's setting;Cons: - Some people will find the experience lacking, due to the easy challenges and small amount of gameplay mechanics; in addition, this may lead to a fast completion of the game, maybe too fast for its price;- Unfinished, visually speaking; the pits that serve as obstacles are pitch black, as if parts of the map are just missing;- Even though a multiplayer feature is out of the question, since the player base is pretty much dead, a more advanced co-op feature would be appreciated, letting players play with their friends, each on their own system;- Occasional bugs here and there;Personal rating: 62/100 - Decent			"

But I think that the game isn't finished because at the end of the story's levels, there is a level called ""story 2"" so I hope that there will be new levels... And I also hope that the game will have ONLINE multiplayer cause it's not so simple to play at the same computer...			"

												There’s a sad irony to how Polarity succeeds at being both bloated with ideas and creatively bankrupt.Every few levels it throws out a new mechanic - binary colored platforms, rotating switches, color changing portals, to name a few - but it barely gives time to show how they function before it decides to move onto something new. The constant stream of introductions to tools that are barely utilized keeps Polarity from ever managing to create puzzles that provide any sort of challenge.From the main campaign, to the coop levels, and even the bonus stages (which could have just as well been included with the other levels as they feel identical) every puzzle is agonizingly mundane and basic. Polarity mingles in tutorials from start to finish, as if testing my patience for repeating the same handful of puzzle types for hours on end, chuckling to itself at how cleverly it has hidden its simplicity by placing it within tediously large levels that have a habit of breaking halfway through and forcing you to restart.The cooperative mode itself feels like almost a misnomer, allowing two players to go through levels together but rarely if ever requiring they work together, or even giving both players something to do. Often one of us would simply took over completing a puzzle while the other trailed behind waiting for their turn to help, with a few instances of actual cooperation being the sole highlight of the game.There just doesn’t seem to be any point to Polarity. It exists for the sake of existing but in a post-Portal world and an increasingly crowded genre, it feels trite and uninspired. I could potentially see a lot of things from it being spun out into better games, but it’s hard to imagine that ever happening when what’s already here is so disinterested in moving forward.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

""ONE OF THE MOST FUN PUZZLE/PLATFORMERS SINCE PORTAL""Alright, look at the statement above and then look at the Polarity. You see some confusion and/or incorrect statement right? Well, yes, and that one is coming straight from the guys behind game. What a promo. This has nothing to do with Portal, it ain't have portals and it certainly ain't have guns. Only thing that these two games have in common is first two latters in their name ""PO""Polarity is usual type of indie game - puzzle & platformer. And also Polarity is usual type of game that is hiding behind term ""indie"" Man, that guy who come up with that idea of abusing indie to cover BS, should get medal. For real. Now I'm not saying game is utterly boring, it's fun at the beginning and out of those 3 hours at least 1 will be good. Just after that you get bored.If you want to get everything, game will last you around 3 hours. ""Story"" yes ""story"" itself is under hour, then there is local CO-OP that will add another one. People asked for online CO-OP but I don't really think that would make any big difference. Game have as always trading cards and also 10 easy achievements.Price point is 9,99 which is definitely not price you'd want to get it for. At the time of writing this (10/4/2017) it's in 90% off for 0,99 so this is time to get it. Soundtrack was relatively pretty nice, and it's also in discount for 0,49 so you can get that one also.Now I really have to quit with these bellow or just average ""indie"" games because when I get my hands on some AAA most definitely I'll be dead from ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Bonus Point: Portal thingie was a lie!Rating: 5/10 "

""Blue or red forcefields?""Polarity looks on the first view like a cheap ""Portal"" rip off. But after playing it through it's mostly relaxing puzzle fun. Instead of using portals you carry and throw little cubes to switches. There are also switchable bouncers and moving platforms. But most important are the red and blue energy fields and your color change ability. We know this from ""The Flip"". Well, the puzzles get more complex and challenging on higher stages.For example you must fall through 5 alternating colored laserfields. If you have the wrong color you die. In each level there are 3 hidden data pieces to collect. The Coop levels are no real internet coop (they are just local coop). But with an additional gamepad controller + keyboard they are quite doable on your own. Altogether very joyful.			"

They also said ""The price has never been 16.99"" so when you go to this link that the dev provided, you'll see at one point it was IN FACT 16.99.

												Sometimes, it isn't one big thing, but a lot of little things.  In this case, that lot of little things make me feel like I'm playing a university student's final project for their game design class rather than a Real Game That You Pay Money For And Stuff.Here are some examples, in no particular order: There appear to be at most twelve to fifteen different textures for the entire game.  Many puzzle elements appear to be deliberately constructed to minimize the number and complexity of their textures.  To the game's credit, what textures do exist are visually distinctive, rather than the twenty or thirty variations on ""industrial, brown, and ugly"" you will find in more than a few ""modern"" games. The game's plot appears on a series of simple dialog boxes, and appears to have nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay except insofar as it dictates the names of a few puzzle elements here and there. The game presents dual controller/keyboard+mouse prompts everywhere, except for a few places where it displays controller prompts only.  It does not adjust the prompts based on the input method, nor is it capable of accepting keyboard+mouse input while in controller mode (or vice-versa).  It does (apparently) try to guess the correct input mode, but I only know this because it guessed wrong. The ""data fragments"" you are expected to collect are in many cases simply scattered about the level.  Finding them is an easter-egg hunt, not a puzzle challenge as with (e.g.) the stars in the Talos Principle.  This appears to largely stem from the baffling design choice to provide a fixed three fragments per (short) level rather than making them rare and irregular enough to be interesting. The cubes you can pick up do not respect the inertia of a moving platform.  If you drop them onto a (horizontally) moving platform, the cubes will stay where they are and fall off. The game has somewhat limited animation.  Buttons do not depress when activated.  Objects are destroyed by instantly replacing them with untextured particle effects. The menus are mostly static and not very pretty.  They do not take advantage of the high resolution of my monitor.  This is not to say they are pixelated or otherwise mangled; they just aren't all that pleasant to look at.The smoking gun, of course, is the ""readme"" on the game's main menu, which informs us that the game was made by a small group of people coding it ""in their bedrooms,"" whatever that's supposed to mean.  Ordinarily this would inspire lenience in me, especially since I paid a mere $1.50 for it.  But the note then goes on to exhort the player to purchase the game if they enjoyed it, which suggests to me it was intended for a demo and (accidentally?) included in the final copy.  Combine that with a complete lack of such a warning on the main store page, and I'm just not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here.Nevertheless, it is better than nothing.  Buy it when it's 90% off.			"

												I gotta say that Polarity is a short, but fun experience in my books, but anyway here's the review:So far, Polarity is a really fun, short, but simple game to play. It consists of 37 levels, including co-op levels, which some of them can be challenging, but not to the point of frustration. You can also collect Data Fragments in each level, which are used to unlock more levels and add a little bit more fun to the game. The gameplay is very similar to Portal, but in a different way, and that's what makes this game unique. I find the graphics pretty good and I also love the music in this game! The ambience in the music fits perfectly inside of an obstacle course/ facility setting. This game also includes achievements and trading cards, which is also a plus.In conclusion, Polarity is just a casual and pretty fun game for people to play if they're bored and have nothing to do.Should you buy this game?If you're looking for a fun game to chill with, then Polarity is the game for you.9.5/10			"

												This game has been released several times now. Each time the release happened nothing had changed and the price was increaed. There is a very short campaign with little to no content. I finished the game in 4 hours, and spent the rest of the time trying to get the multiplayer to work. The mechanics aren't good and some feel like they were ripped straight out of portal, a better game that everybody should buy. Some ""puzzles"" feel so agrovating that I nearly cared about this cash grabber. The only reason i got this game was that it costed without sale $5 and with sale 45 cents. The $15 price is outragous and not worth this pitiful atempt at a game. Do not buy if you want a decent game.Edit: HAHAHAHAH. I'm laughing my♥♥♥♥♥of after the devs realised they are reciving a huge amount of flak after raising the price to $15 and decided to not only lower the price to $10 but also put it on sale as they are desprate to not have the new player's thoughts to buy the game ruined. No, I will not be changing my thoughts about this game and think the devs are even more scummy than before.			"

												Considering the size of team that made this, it's pretty good. I enjoyed it, BUT it shouldn't be compared to Portal whatsoever. The ""puzzles"" were far too easy and most of what you had to do was more like a platformer game. You get to the end expecting Story 2 to unlock when you get the last 3 data nodes and it shows the icon, but no more after that. The bonus levels were even easier. I like the concept, but it shouldn't have been released in this state, imho.I got this for free from a contest I participated in, and I see it's for sale for $11. No way I'd ever pay that knowing there's only a little over an hour of play and the coop is freaking split screen. That's ridiculous. I think a reasonable price would be $1.99 tops.I recommend this game based on the concept, but due to it not being finished and the current price point... no.Will change if things are improved.			"

												Don't buy this game.This games feels unfinished an unpolished. It literally feels like I'm playing a university student's project,a demo,a free-to-play Unity game,rather than a fully fledged game.The game has loads of bugs. Clipping out of boundaries is stupidly easy.The art style is cheap and lazy, featuring stupidly bland colors.There is no plot,except for the ""Cutscene"" that explains that you are a hacker,and explains your goals. By the way, The 'Hacker' thing is a lie. You do absolutely nothing that makes you feel like a hacker. It feels like it's just a cheap excuse to explain the bland color of the levels,the uninspiringly empty and minimalistic design,and the plain use of solid colors.Textures are horrible and look pixelated when you look closely at them.Controls aren't bad,except by the fact that the mouse has this weird acceleration that you can't turn off or adjust.Cubes simply disappear and reappear when the 'Reset Cube' button is pressed,with no animation.Moving platforms behave weirdly. They just start and stop moving,again,with no animation, this without mentioning that the physics of cubes also behave in a very erratic way when on top of a moving platform.The UI,once again,features no animation.Entering or exiting a level also doesn't feature animation. You just hop from the level to the menu,from the menu to the level,because the developer did not even have the audacity to implement a simple fade-in and fade-outSound effects are horrible. The sound track isn't bad,though.The ""puzzles""  go from super simple to super confusing,in a matter of minutes of gameplay. Some of them require you to kill yourself in order to progress. Does that look like good level design for you? It sure doesn't look good for me.All in all,don't buy this game.It is not worth it's price,not even on sale. It is a shameless waste of time and potential.If this was a free to play game,or a public alpha,it would be OK,but as a full game,its unacceptable,as it is nothing more than a poorly built 3D game built in Unity,that feels more like a student project,and that being said,there are better student projects out there.

TL;DRDevs have strange practices and their game is buggy as all hellThis game may seem fun, but it's mediocre at bestLet me first give you a warning of the shady marketing/advertising this company practices. This game is around 2 years old, but the release date has changed multiple times. The developers claim this is a steam bug, but it has happened too often for it to not be suspicious and the developers try to dismiss the claim too much without providing any reasonable evidence.If those business practices haven't put you off the game, then maybe the actual game will.First off, I will talk about the general gameplay and what you do in this game. This game is a first person puzzle game. There are 12 regular levels; 10 bonus levels and 15 co-op levels (NOTE: The co-op levels are local co-op and use 1 keyboard and 1 controller, so don't think about playing with friends online). This game has FORCED mouse acceleration. There is no way I, or my other friends who have put more hours into this game than I have, have found a way to turn it off. The developers are also lazy, and do not bother to connect planes of the levels, as seen here[i.imgur.com] in level 9 where the walls and floor are not connected.The aim of the game is to solve puzzles in order to get to the end of the level. Most of this is done through picking up cubes and throwing them in receptors in order to activate certain things. There is also the 'polarity' aspect of this game in which you can change your 'polarity' from blue to red. For example, with blue polarity you can walk on red platforms and safely go through blue lasers. The opposite is true for red polarity. Some puzzles in this game are pretty fun to figure out, but most of them are incredibly easy.Now, the meat of the review: bugs.This game is rife with bugs. To demonstrate most of the found ones, Siglamii and I have created some videos showing them. For some bugs, there is more info in the video description about the bugs:List of bugs in video formReset boostMoving during end screenLeftover developer toolsClipping with developer toolsFrame advance while pausing Buggy cube collision Cube boost Ledge boost Wall boostCube clipping through wallsHigh cube jumpingThere are also strange framerate bugs that exist. On any frame rates other than 60, jumping might not register, and framerate also dictates momentum and jump height to some extent. For example, higher framerates make you jump lower and make your momentum more sensitive. Setting the graphics to simple will limit the framerate to 60; setting the graphics to medium will limit the framerate to 30 (if in windowed mode) and setting the graphics to gorgeous will cap the framerate to your monitors refresh rate. There is no reason for this.I hope reading this review has persuaded you not to support the developers with their questionable practices by purchasing their shambles of a game.Thanks to Buttravage, MHFSilver, Dungeonfire, Avetixz and Siglamii for helping the speedrun community and I find these bugs and thanks to Siglamii for helping me with the review and demonstrating the bugs.

												Very fun game, strongly influenced by both Portal 1 and 2, however manages to also be unique in its gameplay.Pros:+ Graphics (Looks rather nice and runs at constant 60 - probably even on a potato)+ Soundtrack (especially later levels)+ Movement+ Puzzles + Has cardsCons:- Only about 40 minutes long- Co-op is limited to one computer (controller required for co-op) "

												Really good game, i like the grafics (unfortunately sometimes they glitch). The game mechanics are really cool. I wish there would be more difficult levels. I played the game in 90 minutes - only 90 minutes. With this mechanics you can create so more difficult puzzles. I really hope there are more levels coming. Thank you! ;)			"

												Polarity is a first person puzzler which is pretty easy and relaxing.It has taken some things from Portal but it also has alot of original mechanics.The game is kinda lacking story but thats fine.The gameplayIn Polarity you can switch you’re polarity to red or blue so you can pass through walls by being the same color or being the opposite color to walk to paths.You collect green things to unlock other levels.You can pick up cubes and put em in a button of a sort or throw them to it.There are jump pads they can also be on walls, there are also ones which you can turn around.There are polarity changers for cubes which is self-explanatory.And there are laser which kill you or destroy cubes.At last you have room switches which turn around rooms.There are 12 main missions and 12 bonus missions, and there’s coop also.It will probably take you around 2 hours to complete bonus and main missions.The game controls good on keyboard.StoryTheres not much of story youre hacking( aka collecting the green things ), and then at the end he gives you money and then he offers you a better job.AudioThe music is relaxing.Other effects sound like pretty basic sounds.GraphicsThis is a unity game so the setting are just presets and resolutions.The game doesnt look amazing but it does the job theres not really a artstyle.The only resolutions you have are 1280x720 1360x768 1366x768 and 1600x900.Other things there are three graphics presets : simple medium and gorgeous.then you have windowed mode and rebindable keys.Final verdictSimple fun first person puzzler with some elements of Portal and some original stuff,with good controls and mediocre graphics but lacking story of any kind.

												First of all, I would like to thank the staff of eq-games to provide me of this key. I hope that the key wasn't meant for writing a review ASAP since I found the code in my mailbox not that long ago and the mail dated back from may. I think I'd rather won this key in a giveaway of some sort on twitch. In any way I'm not going to let that influence my opinion.Polarity is a first person puzzle game where you are a node inside another persons's network/database/server (it is not clear) and you have to finish the puzzles to collect the data from your victim and to complete the hack. If you are bored with the story itself you can also try out coop mode, which you complete puzzles with two persons even including splitscreen which you can connect controllers so you both can play on the same pc. This sounds like an amazing feature, I enjoyed every splitscreen that you could play and it was an utter shame to remove that on any upcoming game. Also if the main story is finished there are about as many bonus levels to dig into. I did find the concept interesting and they certainly set the bar very high. When I opened the store page this immediately catched my eye: ""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal. Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes.""That is my main problem with the game, not the fact that it is comparing itself to Portal, but the fact that the execution of this concept is very poor. Okay I agree they have a lot of features to make the puzzles good like colored cubes, lasers, gates, jumping pads that you can rotate, bridges which you need to be the other color to be on top of them, and buttons that rotate a part of the room in front of you, gates that change the color of the object you throw in it or yourself (I don't think you could get in one of em so I couldn't test that). Those features literally made me decide to complete the game because they were pretty well done aside from the chance you may get stuck in an object. As a node you can swap in two colors, red and blue which were meant to make the puzzles more challenging but why limit yourself with only two colors? I think it could be more of a thinking game once you get multiple colors. Not to mention how buggy it sometimes is. The control setting is something you have to take a close look at but even then some glitches happen. For example I have set my forward key to E (standard color swap keys are Q and left ctrl) and whenever I wanted to move in the beginning it swapped my color while moving which made it impossible to complete the puzzles. To solve this I set this key different and that seemed to do the trick. The next problem to me is the fact that they did nothing with the story. They start of with a small intro telling you that you are a node hacking a computer. They could do something with that like make the map the inside of the motherboard or maybe give it a wallpaper with black background and green binary or something like that. Talking about the map that wasn't my favourite feature either. The map could, like I said before, be done better not only in idea but I think they are not familiar to corners. Whenever looking at the ground in the direction of a wall you may see an empty line where a corner should be (for ex Level 9) and sometimes there are corners but they are way too big making it harder to jump over them. Or you can see the floor sometimes not fully connected or stuff like that. The map is also a bit too big in some levels where it could be way smaller but every level had the same width and height of the map. The music was very silent but I didn't mind that because I picked my own music from youtube to play in the background. As for the data you have to collect, for most of the time it is not a challenge at all. Most of the time you just walk around the map a bit and find it convienently being behind a pillar or in the corner or so. I wish they did all the data placement like the few that needed a bit of thinking to get to. I was the least satisfied with the ending, even angry, they could've added a boss battle connecting it with the ""story"". For example that you as a node get detected by the computer you are infected and you need to escape the level before they erase you but they did nothing instead.  Actually they require you to collect all the data to unlock the next 'level' which turns out to be a simple text message saying ""We're hiring you as a hacker now because your node succeeded, also you gain a million credits hooray"" This game definitly has a good concept but the poor execution didn't do well in my book. I consider you only pick this up if you want to play a game just for the puzzles and don't mind the rest of the game.			"

												Product was NOT received for Free - but nearly since it was only pennies in a Bundle xDWhy do I like this game - simple - it's challenging and keeps you working, but is still relaxing & isn't crazy difficult.  The Solo campaign went really fast like passing some of the easier levels in 40 seconds.  The Co-op was a different story - definitely required teamwork - & timing your jumps & changing color quickly was more work.  I'm the guy who mutes the music in so many games - guess what - the background music/sound in Polarity was actually good.  I don't really see the Portal comparison that others have mentioned - this game stands just fine on its own.So, once you've been through it all, I guess you could try to beat your times or something - I didn't see much replayability.  On the up side, 100% Achievements should be no problem for you.  Fun & very much worth the Bundle price.  But, if I'd paid the retail $9.99, I'd be hopping mad LOL - Just saying!  The Developer(s) did a great job - Kudos!P.S. My actual play time is around 3-4hours (forgot it was running one night & that ran the time up, in case anybody wondered). Cheers!			"

												Hmm...If this were a concept demo or something, I guess I'd recommend trying it, but as a full game I'm disappointed. If I were more cynical, I would call this a moneymaking scheme, leveraging the Steam Trading Card system to get people to pick it up for 19-25 cents during sales and re-sell the cards for a small profit. However, I don't hold the developers responsible for this and I want to give this an honest review. If I were judging this as a concept demo, or in a game jam, or even on Steam Greenlight, I'd rate it very highly. I'm glad that Steam exists not just for big-budget studios to market games but also as a platform for small indie developers to try out unique concepts and hone their skills. I just feel like this game would work better on something like itch.io or gamejolt, in a pay-what-you-want market. As a finished game, I can't really recommend it.The core mechanic of Polarity - color swapping - isn't really new. Basically, walls/platforms block things the opposite color as them, lasers destroy things the opposite color as them, and boxes/buttons have to match colors to work. You can swap colors, you can change a box's color by sending it through a color-changing field. Oh, and don't touch green lasers. That's it. Not every game needs to be super innovative to be good; puzzle games can take simple/already existing ideas and turn them into good puzzles. The problem is, this game doesn't get that far. There's only a handful of very short levels, and they're all super easy, even the 'bonus levels'. In an hour, I completed 75% of the game (I started skipping to later levels once I started finding them easy). You don't really need to explore, or reason/plan solutions to puzzles, or do anything beyond the basic interactions. I'm not sure if this is because of the level design/lack of levels, or if the concept itself doesn't lend itself to difficult/interesting levels.It's also not polished. Level design is sometimes annoying: lots of wide open rooms without many puzzle elements (and a slow-ish walking speed), and there's really no point to the green lasers apart from making you return to a checkpoint. There's a general awkwardness to the movement (jump boosts and moving platforms are inconsistent, and held boxes get stuck on things really easily). Control setup is weird (it's Unity, so you can remap things, but there's a bunch of controls that aren't used/show up twice). The tutorial is really unnecessary (the game pauses to display button prompts when a simple tooltip saying ""WASD, Spacebar, Q, click, have fun"" would have been more than enough).Polarity doesn't really have much else going for it (I guess controller support and local multiplayer are kind of neat considering the suprising number of big-budget games without these features, but again they're auxiliary to the main experience and they don't really affect my overall review).So ultimately, who would I recommend this to? My friends that already enjoy puzzles would finish it within minutes, and my friends that are new to the genre would probably enjoy something that's more polished/complete. Despite all that, this game does a few interesting things right: Gameplay elements within the levels have a very clear and consistent visual design. There's subtle hints that players might use without noticing (like a white square/black frame that means 'throw a box at this from far away') and platform placement/wall design actually guides players toward the optional objectives. The system of checkpoints is actually really well done (most games like this make you restart levels completely). Despite my earlier complaints, the level design is pretty good overall, and it's clear that effort and time was put into this experience. Sadly, as a finished game I can't recommend it.			"

TL;DRIf it's on sale, pick it up for a quick whirl. Alternatively, if you have a child and Portal is too difficult for him/her (or if he/she has a strong phobia of cake), then consider this game instead. Otherwise, save the money.Another Portal Clone without the HeartFrom a technical standpoint, this game really isn't bad. The levels are actually pretty well designed, especially some of the co-op missions. But if you look past the chocolately outer layer, you'll find that the game lacks the nougaty center that Portal provides. There's no real story, the whole ""hacker"" bit only manisfests itself in the naming of certain things, but has no bearing on the gameplay. And overall, the gameplay is quite lackluster.And honestly, I'd might be okay with having no story if it wasn't for the fact that the game is just sooooo easy. There's no challenge. Once you get the hang of timing polarity switches in mid-air, which any competent gamer will have down by the fifth level, the game doesn't get any more challenging than that. The whole ""data-collection"" bit is also a bit contrived. Originally, they seems like optional collectibles that add some kind of difficulty, until you realize that they're necessary to progress the game.BreakdownPros Not too gimmicky, sticks with core mechanics pretty wellCons Just boring. It's uneventful, there's no story, the gameplay doesn't challenge the user. It's like flavorless pudding, there's nothing wrong with it, but why would I get it when there's all these other better tasing ones around. Had issues a few times where my character would clip out of bounds for no reason. I'd just fall out of the map and fall endlessly down until I restarted the level.Score: 5/10; Not good, not bad, right in the middle			"

												I didn't expect much when I picked that game up.I actually saw this game lying on the Steam Store shelf for a crazy 0,36 euros, so I had to check it out.Imagine Portal without portals and humor.It's the most basic 3D puzzle game you can imagine. It's not as boring as it sounds.It's super-short, for one thing. It's not a game you pick-up and replay over and over again.It's one of those ""I've got nothing to play"" kinda game.Everything seems alright, but after diging in I've found some flaws.Controller support is clunky and it doesn't always work. The menus are glitchy unless you disable the gamepad in the settings. For most people this game would probably bore you to death, but not me.I've sat through this thing and I actually found some impressive puzzles.For a game all about picking up things and throwing them, that's quire an accomplishment.I launched Vs mode just out of morbid curiosity. My brother just died in front of the monitor.It's not a fun multiplayer game to play. The rules are easy and there's no challenge.Combine that with gamepad controls and you've got yourself a nice nightmare session.The best thing about this game is the soundtrack. Spectrosconomy is probably the best track on the whole game. It's in the trailer and it deserves some recognition on SoundCloud.Go look it up and show Ludiotic some love.For the full price, avoid immediately.Wait for a crazy sale to make this game pay-off.It's not a novelty, but I think I could let this game pass.

												how do people dare compare this to portal?This is something that you should be playing for free, it's something that a developer would create to improve or test his skills, not to sell. Am I missing something? I have no idea how people can love it so much when it's literally brainless 'puzzle' solving. If you're gonna get this, then get it when it has a huge discount, like it did during the summer sale (it was 0.19€ I think). The summer sale price should honestly be the base price of the game, like I said it's something that's supposed to be free, not 5€!Anyway.. I'll give the game itself a short review. The game just feels and looks cheap, the interface is cheap, the world is cheap, the physics are cheap, the movement is weird, the camera movement is also weird, there are only a few levels, the concept is OK, the music is OK and overall it's still not something that I would want to pay five euros for, I'm sorry that's just how I see it.

												Polarity is a good puzzler, but don't be confused, it's not Portal. The puzzles were interesting, though I rarely thought it was really difficult in a way that stumped me. The hardest part is finding all the collectable ""data"" in the levels, and I'll admit I had quite a bit of fun looking for and getting to them all. The addition of a multiplayer mode was a HUGE plus, and was frankly a lot more fun than the standard game, in my opinion.The viusuals get the job done, but they aren't anything to write home about. (Also, it didn't natively support my 1440 x 900 resolution, so that was kinda a bummer.)  Also, there are a good number of bugs that still need to be worked out, and frankly rip you out of the experience. holes in the ground that drop you down to infinity and don't respawn you unless you restart the level aren't fun, and I've accidentally fallen down more than one. In summary, I'd say to pick this game up when it's on sale. I wouldn't spend the whole 5 bucks on it, but if it gets around a dollar it's definitely worth your time.  "

												Great game to play in co-op mode if you're a casual gamer. Sure, there is no intriguing story. Sure, some of the puzzles may be a little easy for the hardcore gamers. If you are into the background and story of games or into extremely difficult puzzles, this may not be the game for you.However, if you're planning on relaxing with a friend, jump on co-op campaign and you guys will have a great and laid-back experience. The soundtrack of this game is solid and very relaxing, the puzzles are in my experience very rewarding and the game feels polished.The only negative is that there is no online co-op: only split screen co-op and single player.I do not recommend paying the full €10.99 for this game though, as it often goes on sale for 95% (€0.54) and even 98% (€0.21). You can even make your money back by selling the trading cards! I would recommend everyone to get the game on sale and enjoy a few hours of relaxing gameplay. DO IT!!! JUST DO IT!!!

												I got this because it came bundled in a sale with four other games for $1.50 and I thought I would try it out. This review is assuming you are buying the game at the listed price of $10.99. I have also 100% the game and my time in game is probably about 1 hours of idling so it is a pritty short game. This game clames a lot saying that it is the next portal ext. but it just is not. The main machanic of the game is to change your polarity between red and blue. You use this to pass through and stand on platforms and not get killed by lazers. That is about as indepth as this machanic gets. The other main machanic is using red or blue cubes that you move around that level to activate switchs that move objects in the level. The color of the cube has the same function of the polarity of the player you just cant change it at at anytime. In each level you must also collect 3 data fragments which are not that hidden. Pros:The 2 player part was not that badIf you can get it on sale it is very cheepSome levels were interesting and make the player thinkAmbient musicCons:$10.99 is way to much for a game that is aobut 2 non-interesting hoursThe puzles are not very interesting and get borring after aobut 30 minutesOutdated visualsThe puzles dont build on eachother very wellVery little story that should not even be thereYou can glich through some objects and the void is sometimes visableNot hard to figure out the puzlesLots of sniping cubes across the map and hopping you hit itThis game is not the next portal. It is a 6bear bones puzle game that is not worth the $10.99 price tag. I think a fair price for this game would be about $2.			"

												I would recommend this game on sale or in a bundle. The puzzles are interesting, although fairly easy. I was able to 100% this game in just under 4 hours. The co-op puzzles were way more difficult and fun than the single player levels, and it's possible to play through the co-op levels by yourself with a separate controller.			"

												The game lacks elegance in my opinion.While it is a good effort, it starts you up with controller mode on. Unfortunately, it couldn't use my controller correctly making it unplayable. I managed to switch to keyboard mode, where controls need a little more optimization.The puzzles are nice and the graphics are simple. Music is so so but it does the trick.A good puzzle game, but far from what Portal is as many say.The tutorial is crudely made, giving you the feeling that this is a rushed project.No I don't recommend this one unfortunately, but I actually would on a huge discount.

Posted: January 8
GameplayPolarity is a puzzle platformer that'll take you through 22 levels (12 campaign levels and 10 'bonus levels') + 15 local co-op levels (with a horizontal split screen as seen in one of the screenshots).The goal in each level is to collect 3 items and then find your way to the exit. To reach that goal, you'll need to take blue and red boxes from one point to another. Sometimes you'll need to aim and throw the boxes to their destination. You'll be jumping from platform to platform, sometimes switching your 'polarity' mid-air. Your polarity is a red or blue glow that allows you to pass through force fields of the same colour but prevents you from falling through force fields of the opposite colour. This makes for some interesting mechanics. Unfortunately, it also means that Polarity sometimes becomes a twitchy game when you quickly need to push several buttons  during one long jump or during a series of short consecutive jumps.Graphics, sounds and other issuesThe graphics are very basic. They aren't pixel graphics but nonetheless they look quite pixelated when seen up close. However, they serve their purpose here and the 'laser-look' makes up for a lot. I don't just mean the force fields that are made of lasers, but the platforms have a laser-like edge and the walls and the ceilings have laser-like lights drawn through them, too. This livens up a bit what would otherwise be very bland graphics.The music is subtle. Actually, the music is hardly noticeable. Its volume is too low. You'll need to turn up the volume of your speakers a lot to actually hear it, which makes for tons of fun when another sound pops up, for example a new incoming message, which may startle you and everyone who's in the room with you. There are little options in the game's menu: you can adjust camera sensitivity and switch music and sound effects on or off. When launching the game, you do get the standard Unity pop-up allowing you to change the resolution, select the overall graphics quality and toggle windowed on or off.Controls feel a bit clunky from time to time. I used an Xbox controller because that seemed the logical choice for a platformer, but maybe keyboard and mouse makes for a smoother experience, I don't know. A strange thing happened to me when using the controller: when moving the camera left, it kept turning left even when I didn't touch the controller anymore. I had to tap the camera to the right for it to stop. The same thing did not happen when turning the camera right, and this problem doesn't occur when I'm playing other games, so it's a weird bug in Polarity. When trying to find a solution for this problem, I came across posts from people complaining about much worse involuntary movement of the camera and even of the player's avatar, rendering the game pretty much unplayable. So Polarity is not a fully polished game, it seems, and technical difficulties are not out of the question.A word about Steam's extra featuresPolarity has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.Most of the 10 Steam Achievements are awarded for completing a number of levels successfully. The remaining few achievements are a bit more creative but are easily attained. If you don't have a co-op partner, you can complete the first co-op level by yourself to get that achievement relatively quickly, but you'll be left with two incomplete achievements: one for finishing all 15 co-op levels and one for finishing all the levels of the game, unless you want to take both avatars through each level, one by means of a controller and one by means of the keyboard and mouse. Verdict: it's not as good as PortalA lot of critical reviewers dislike Polarity because it isn't as good as Portal. And they're absolutely right! Moreover, the publisher of Polarity brough the storm of criticism on themselves by mentioning the name Portal in their game's description. Even though they don't compare their game to Portal (on the contrary, they say their game is the best puzzle platformer since Portal, which means they recognize they can't top Portal, but they do claim their game is better than all the puzzle platformer games made after Portal), they should have known just mentioning the name Portal would mean endless comparisons between the two games, a comparison they could never hope to win.But I'd like to judge Polarity on its own merits. In that case, I have to say I enjoyed Polarity considerably more than I found it frustrating, which means a positive verdict in the end. But I do have to stress that Polarity is not worth its full price. I mean, it's the same price tag as Portal, a game of which even the publisher of Polarity admits it is a better puzzle platformer. You should consider giving Polarity a chance only when it's on sale at -75% or better, and lower your expectations accordingly.			"

												Maybe it's worth your money at -90% discount (I got this dirt cheap), but it's barely worth your time. It's a poor-man's Portal. Without story, without any production values, personality, without any cohesive artstyle or ambient music. it's servicable, but it's obviously something that I could find with label ""my first, serious video game"". I congratulate that someone was shipped it, making even a basic game is a pretty hard task, but we are at Steam, There is a strong competition and this game doesn't stand against it's opponents.You are better off replaying Portal again.

The puzzles should be tricky, but there are serious bugs throughout levels which you can take advantage of, so it becomes a fairly easy game. Recommended if you still don't mind.

												This game is nice.I can only speak for myself, but Polarity is satisfying. A good chunk of that is because the puzzles were never frustrating, even though I'm not very good at this genre. Additionally, the music, sounds, and visual ambience were pleasant, possibly on par with a bubblebath. Most importantly, there's neon everywhere!I felt that the story was superfluous, though. I wish more developers didn't feel the need to include one when it's not necessary; a game can exist for the sake of existing.Recommended at -90%, but not at 100%.			"

												- The puzzles are too simple and there are too few of them- Some visuals are rather confusing (e.g. there are blue and red elements that don't have anything to do with your polarity)- Glitchy. Physics have some annoying issues like cubes passing through moving panels- It's easy to mess up and have to restart everything because some cube got stuck on the other end of a level- The premise with ""hacking"" is rather laughableOverall, you'll enjoy it if you like to throw cubes around. Otherwise I don't recommend it.			"

												A nice puzzle game that kind of feels like Portal without portals. There's stuff like launch pads, cubes that activate certain moving objects and open doors, a mechanic that allows you to pass and walk on different types of platforms and a co-op mode. The levels are all very well made and will definitely require some thinking to complete them. Each level has 3 'data fragments' which are optional to collect to unlock certain bonus levels. These fragments are often very easy to obtain, but some of them are very well hidden. One thing that I should mention is that the game is not very big (even together with the bonus levels) and I could not get the co-op missions to work. It's definitely worth the money though, had great fun playing it!			"

												It is indeed simple puzzling game like ""Portal"" and each level can be finished at least 3 mins. (even the bonus level)Your goal is just to get to the exit. Collecting Data is optional.You can change your body colour to Red or Blue but not Green because Green is for data.The most shocking things I found is you're not a human or some experimental object. You're just a block without legs that can jump and sprint. And you also had no hands but you can take and throw blocks. (Trust me! I have tried to see myself in the cooperative mode).Sadly the cooperative mode are only allowed in Split-screen mode.And the saddest part is I have no friends to play the co-op and now I can't get the 100% Achievement :cry:Anyway I have fun playing this game and will definitely recommend it.

												This game won't start from Steam, so I had to gather 5 minutes spamming the Play button to write this.When I launched it from the exe, the game looked promising.The mechanics featured in the tutorial was really novel.And that's where it ends.It's in the name of the game.The game is called Polarity, for crying out loud.You're meant to get around by switching your polarity.Yet, in the first 10 or so levels after the tutorial level (couldn't be bothered to count), I can probably count the number of times the mechanic was used ON ONE HAND.If that isn't enough, the graphics are lacking and the physics are wonky.Level design is wanting too; the first few levels were okay, but after that it becomes less of a mind-stretching puzzle per se (which I assume is the basis for it claiming to be the next Portal) but more of ""do you spot this tiny thing at the edge that you have to press"", which certainly makes the navigation of maps challenging in an annoying way.Also, attempting to fling cubes across the entire map is just plain disgusting, and takes way too much trial and error. I can only imagine that's the reason for the cube reset button. More disturbingly, it's the most efficient way to place cubes on a receptacle. If randomly spamming cubes at different angles and hoping one gets caught by the receptacle is the best way of putting a cube on the receptacle, I don't see why I should invest any more of my time in this game.Certainly wouldn't recommend buying for anything more expensive than the 98% off sale price.(I also wouldn't recommend buying it for the sale price since it's such a terrible game, but you get card drops if you actually manage to start it up.)

												A short, light, relaxing puzzle game that you can finish in one sitting. It's actually refreshing to see a puzzle game that doesn't overdo it -- a lot of them will have 50, 100 levels that ramp up in difficulty and confound you for hours of play time but not give much reward. Polarity doesn't either, but it's just simple enough that it never becomes tedious or repetitive. Sometimes you just want a snack, not an eight-course meal. There's not quite enough here to justify the full price tag, but it's a great sale pickup.			"

												In short, fun little Portal-wannabe game worth 0.19€ bought on sale.That being said, the game has several problems:Bugs - There are quite a few bugs, main issue there is clipping and disappearing cubes through floor or walls when not being careful (had this happening several times in coop). Other annoying bugs include auto dropping cubes when coop partner dies, random rotation of camera when using gamepad (Xbox 360 controller in my case) while pressing nothing and no end game screen for coop campaign  (there is normal ""Next"" button which does nothing so you don't know if it's broken or what's happening)Difficulty - Sadly the difficulty is almost none, all ""puzzles"" are very straight forward requiring almost no thought. I'd definitely wouldn't call it ""demanding all of your wits and reflexes"" as devs do.Coop - It's advertised as multi-player game but it only contains local coop (which wasn't problem for me but it might be for others). Included coop campaign isn't really coop for most of the parts, there are few moments where two players must interact with each other to finish the level but otherwise it's mostly one doing all of the work while the other is waiting for partner to open the road for him (being a burden in short).Length - Both coop and single-player campaign takes only around an hour each.This might sound like very negative review but in fact it really isn't. Thought there are issues with the game, they aren't game-braking. I still enjoyed playing coop with a friend and can only recommend it for this next-to-nothing price. However paying full price would most likely change how I perceived the game.			"

												the programing and graphics are pretty basic. they'd pass for some games, but there are some bugs (in multiplayer i could use the ""drop"" button to make the other player drop their block) and the models were really lazy. the player model is a block with another smaller block on a stick. the menu is worse.but the real problem is the level design. quite frankly, it plays like a free flash game. the puzzles are more just a series of obvious steps, as though your not playing through a level so much as moving through it. some of the later levels are a bit puzzling, but they're still really easy.the hidden secrets are usually pretty easy to find too. most of the time they're just behind a pillar or around a corner and you just need to turn around every so often to make sure you didn't miss it. some of the time they aren't even hidden, they're just sitting in the middle of the pathway you're already walking along.the only real hard challenges are the platforming parts, which are well designed but the controlls aren't always intuitive enough for what you want to do.honestly, if i hadn't gotten it on sale for a dollar, i probably would have gotten a refund after playing it for an hour.

												Single player campaign can be completed in 1.5 hours.  There is no plot at all, nor characters to interact with.

 Not very difficult, but quite relaxing. Buy on a sale!	 More suitable for a younger audience, or simply to relax. The graphics aren't great, but to be honest it didn't take long to get used to. Considering the game has a cyberspace theme, you wouldn't really expect top quality graphics (or at least I wouldn't, anyways...) So they certainly stood out enough to be easy on the eyes for the duration of the gameplay. I haven't tried Multiplayer so I don't actually know what the player model looks like, so in my ignorance i'll assume it has the same minimalistic appeal.The audio for this game, I didn't really notice it. That isn't a bad thing - I knew when something happened, but it was more of a confirmation than actual sfx. It added to the feel of calm under pressure, and aided the relaxing puzzles through what could have been frustrating experiences if it wasn't for one problem......It was too easy. I finished the game (all data fragments) and all the bonus mission in 92 minutes. It was enjoyable, so I would recommend at a low price, but it certainly wasn't something that I had to struggle to understand the solutions. It took a few attempts to actually do some of the solutions, granted. Some of that was because of a slight issue with physics/momentum that I wasn't expecting. If you are on a moving platform, you will continue to move in that direction as you jump off it. This means that instead of jumping towards what you are looking for you have to account for a slight air drift. Which, again, wasn't difficult to understand, just wasn't as expected initially.I don't know if this game was supposed to be for a younger audience, or if I am better at this game than others. Personally I felt like the bonus missions should have been part of the main missions, but if the game was meant to be a little easier I can understand why the difficulty would be at a mismatch in that situation. There were 22 levels (including bonus levels) for Singleplayer mode, and I assume 15 for multiplayer - given there are 3 fragments per level and 45 set to CoOp mode. All the same, I was sort of expecting more challenging puzzles, but I didn't dislike the experience up to the end goal.I doubt this game would get a great deal of re-runs. The base price is not worth the content in my opinion. That being said, I got this game around 90% off (maybe more) and I certainly think this game would be worth it at a discounted value. I have seen this game on sale many, many times. So long as it is half price or better, I would say go for it. As it stands, however, my view is that the game should be around four times longer, with much more challenging rooms in order to justify the retail value asked. Or maybe include a level editor and allow workshop support, but that is likely above the developer's skill level judging by the content provided. Again, not a bad thing, as I in no way disliked the levels that I played, I just don't think that there is  enough  content provided...PS - Technically, you can get this game at such a steep discount that you could sell the trading cards and make money, though if you are into that kind of thing you'd already know that without reading this review.

												Honestly I feel pretty good about this game, however there are a few things I should mention for anyone who is considering purchasing this game.1) The levels are really easy, as you can see, (not sure if I have played more after this) I have played the entire single player campaign in 1 1/2 hours.2) The concept is interesting, but needs a lot more work, more elements in the standard campaign would be nice, instead of relegating everything to the bonus levels.3) Large areas, very little story, no voice work.  This game feels great for what I purchased it at for $0.50.  Now seeing the price at $11, it feels very lack luster.4) Co-op is couch co-op, no online co-op.  Which was confusing when I saw ""multi-player"" which I assumed meant online play, there is none available, so it was really mistagged.5) There are a few levels in which it is required that you die to progress, this came to a shock for me the first time, every time after it became the solution to harder puzzles.Final verdict, if you are purchasing this game while it is on sale below $11, then get it, its a good quick game to try and test your brain on, however if your not, consider waiting.

But you have to find some dumb fragments and uness you find all you have to re-do a bunc of levels you already did and were booring as hell all over again.. and the game doesn't realy let you know you have to pick them up until you pass like a bunc of levels and than expects you will go back and find them in some not original hiding spots like in a corner or under a bridge... Realy unless you are realy chill or high and you dont need nothing more than a empty world od walikng around with no real action... Buy portal1,2 talos principle dont waste your time on this.

As is, it's not worth $20, but it has potential, and hopefully, with future updates, everything can be smoothed out.			"

												And I thought the first Portal game was short...○ While this does have some nice ideas and a few puzzles took me a while to figure out, it's way too short. I 100%ed (all collectibles and achievements) the whole singleplayer part of it in less than an hour and a half.○ It's also pretty buggy, I managed to clip out of the map through a wall once without actively trying to do so.○ The movement feels really tedious - you can get stuck on a 1 inch step and have to jump in order to traverse it. The collision detection of jumping platforms is a pain, too, among other things.○ Then there's the thing with some of the puzzles... You know, in a puzzle game I like the idea to be ""spend some time figuring out what you have to do, then do it"" whereas here it's often ""see what you have to do right away, then spend 5 minutes trying to pull it off with the dodgy physics system and clunky movement"".○ Some gameplay elements don't add anything to the challenge of the puzzle itself, they merely serve as a layer of hogwash that can foil your efforts at any point (I'm mostly talking about the moving lasers).○ A couple times I didn't get any hints on newly introduced mechanics (e.g. rotatable jump pads or cube colour changing portals) so I wondered what the hell I'm supposed to do with a blue cube and red socket.All in all it's not an awful game but if I had paid the full price for it I'd feel robbed. For the current price of 0.21€ though it'd be a shame not to give it a try.			"

												Note: I got this game for free by installing Out There Somewhere, which actually features fun, interesting, and challenging mechanics. Also, I haven't played the co-op stuff yet, but I'm doubtful it's much better than singleplayer.The Good pretty good background music unique core concept (I've only seen color-swap used in 2D) people could make some very interesting user-made levels if user-made levels were a thingThe Bad The learning curve is shallower than a stereotypical blonde. In each main level, the game seems to try to teach you about a gimmick that's specific to the level. One might expect that the level would then have you apply that new knowledge in a more challenging or puzzling room, but... that never happens. The level ends before that.Now, to the game's credit, the bonus rooms are slightly more challenging, although that's like saying getting struck by lightning is slightly less lethal than a guillotine. The game never seems to make up its mind whether it wants to be puzzle-focused or platforming-focused. In some levels, no dexterity at all is required - just figure out when to put which cubes where put the only available cube in the only available switch. In others, however, cubes hardly do anything, and you need to pay more attention to what color you are so you don't fall through the floor. But, it never focuses on developing either, so it's just kind of plain all-around. In some of the levels, it's possible to easily get stuck in a situation that demands you reset the level, losing any progress you might have made, rather than respawning at a checkpoint. Fortunately, the levels can all be beaten in about 2 minutes, so you don't miss out on too much. The physics engine can be pretty weird when dealing with the color cubes, and with moving platforms. Cubes sometimes get stuck in walls, and a few times got stuck in a spawner, only becoming dislodged when I rapidly clicked in its general direction and it popped out of a separate wall entirely. Cubes do not seem to interact with moving platforms. A strange amount of emphasis is placed on throwing accuracy. Polarity compares itself to Portal, which does not have this odd and rather inconsistent mechanic because portal shots travel in straight lines, whereas Polarity's cubes drop off at a rate never quite what you expect. A couple of the gimmicks are never explained. In the level that introduces color-changing fields, nothing draws you to the unassuming small gap that looks a bit like a wall. Additionally, you have no way of knowing other than sheer luck that the launchers affect cubes as well - no previous level required or used that information. In each level, there are 3 green thingies you can collect, for a total of 60 across normal and bonus levels. Of these, two, maybe three require any amount of thought to find them - almost all are either hidden in an unremarkable, useless cove 10 seconds from anything else, or directly in your line of sight. They're not challenges so much as they are errands. GET READY TO HOLD DOWN SHIFT! The player walking speed makes a tortoise look like Speedy Gonzales, and without a toggle, your finger's going to be on that Run button for the entire game. Polarity just feels... unfinished. Like someone had a couple of ideas for a game and accidentally published basic testing levels as the full thing. The story doesn't really have much connection to the gameplay... or relevance to anything at all.TL;DR I sure am glad I got this game for free by playing one that's better in every way, because I wouldn't pay $0.99 for this, let alone ten bucks.

												This is a speed-running, platformer puzzle game.  Each level has some endpoint you must reach by using color-coded switches and platforms.  (The colors are supposed to indicate opposite polarities.)  Each level also has 3 collectibles to find, which are always positioned in some out-of-the-way location to increase your completion time.  Surprisingly, there is no reward nor punishment related to how quickly you finish each level, so there's not really a point to actually try for the speed-running.  The puzzles are okay, but certainly not comparable to Portal as this game's steam page claims.  I found the game moderately enjoyable, but it's very short with less than 1.5 hours playtime (and that includes retrying a most levels for faster times).  The game could certainly use a lot more levels.  In fact, it's perfect for Workshop content, yet there is no level maker.  There are a few bugs with platforms and the small blocks used to activate switches, but nothing game breaking.  I'd like to also play the co-op levels, but the game is sadly local-multiplayer only.Ultimately, I feel like the game failed at nearly everything it set out to do.  You get a handful of mediocre puzzles that you can complete in one sitting, and that's it.  Not a bad game, but not one I'd recommend.			"

I managed to softlock the game (put it in an uncompletable state due to poor game design) three times during the tutorial level, completely by accident, and I couldn't force myself go through the first painful few minutes of gameplay a fourth time. Uninstalled it straight away.IIRC, the mouse and FOV options were awful, too.Only get this game if you want to test out steam's refund feature, otherwise just get portal instead.			"

												Well, the game is fairly interesting. it is a puzzle game inspired by Portal, which is surprisingly fun. The game is relaxing enough so that you can play through it fully in one go, but can become challenging at times [if you try to collect all Data Fragments]. The game isn't lacking in any aspect, but one thing that may be beneficial to the lifespan of the game is Workshop integration, allowing people to make their own levels.Overall, a fun experience for a fair price, with humble developers and major sales.10/10			"

												+The game is very good. I realy having fun myself.-But multiplayer have problems. We can't play with our friends online. The Game need new features.Local co-op isn't enough. With an uptade ONLINE co-op without splitscreen should be added to the game. Servers isn't necessary. Players could open local hosts ( with hamachi and stuff or LAN ). We must be able to play with our friends in our homes. Developers pelase fix this.			"

												It is really good logical game and i really enjoyed playing, but price is really high, cos playtime is not longer than 2h singleplayer. Pros:+ I had lot of fun playing it, you have red and blue color and you can switch between them. For example you are not killed by blue laser while blue is active. Moreover you have boxes, turrets, switches and jump pads, that's little bit like portal.+ Physics is working - Throwing uses ballistic curve, jumping from moving platform will affect your landingCons:- Coop - splitscreen and you need pad + keyboard or pad + pad => i couldnt play it :/- Price - 11E that's really overpriced (i got free coppy, so that didnt bothered me :D)- Short playtime			"

												""Polarity"" is a first-person puzzle platformer that's hugely derivitive of ""Portal,"" except that it's:1)  much cheaper (both in terms of price and production value)2)  much shorter (main ""campaign"" takes about an hour, maybe)3)   much  easier (see #2 above)4)  much not-as-good, frankly.Oh, and there's no jokes...  Or portals, for that matter. There  is  one original gameplay innovation -- you can alternate the ability to walk between red and blue force fields -- but this is so rarely incorporated into the puzzles that it's hardly worth mentioning.""Polarity"" isn't a  bad  game so much as it's just a deeply unsatisfying one. Taken solely on its own terms as a cheap knock-off, it's made with a certain degree of underwhelming competence.  If you're desperately itching to play a first-person puzzle platformer that starts with the letter ""P"", and the phrase ""cheap but competent knock-off"" doesn't scare you away,  and  you've already played through both ""Portal"" games at least twice, then buy ""Polarity"" when it goes on sale for fifty cents (which seems to be every six months or so). Do not under any circumstances pay full price for it.			"

												Since I can't really give a neutral review, let me just set this straight. Generally, Polarity is a fun, quick game that is perfect for anyone looking to kill some time. However, it is literally a poor man's version of the Portal games. For a standard price of $9.99 USD, I would definitely not consider this game for a purchase. Why? For around this price range, I rather buy a full, critically-acclaimed, better version of the game  (*ahem* Portal which also has the same standard price of $9.99 USD)  or even chip in some more to purchase the Portal Bundle or the Portal 2 game standalone. This being said, I only purchased this title because it went on sale, at a measly price of $0.19 USD  (yes, that apparently is possible.) To sum it all up, please don't buy it at its full price of $9.99 USD, it's really not worth it. Go look into Portal if you are readily wanting this sort of puzzle game. However, if you really, really,  REALLY  are dying to have it, I highly advise purchasing it only when it goes on sale. Nonetheless, I respect the effort of the indie developers, and will give this game a recommend.  A For Effort, F For Originality, Bluebutton Games.  "

												Polarity is a nice game with some flaws. It's not great, but it's fun to play.The singleplayer levels are short and pretty easy, but still fun. It takes about 1 and a half hour to finish them all including bonus levels. Keep in mind that I got this game as a gift, and I don't think it deserves this much money. Grab it on a sale and you won't regret it.Pros:-Fun singleplayer levels-Portal references-Nice ideas for puzzle mechanics-Despite the easiness, the levels require thinking-Achievements and trading cards-It makes a nice sound when you sprintCons:-(almost) No story-The physics...-Lazy level design, data fragments were poorly placed and in co-op, you don't need a partner to complete a level. You just need them to get to the next level.-Only local Co-op option-The resolution settings. If you have an old monitor, welcome to the world of black bars.-Too short and no workshop support.Additional notes: I normally would consider the idea of being have to collect data fragments to open new levels bad, but it wasn't worth putting it into cons because it was really easy to collect them. It may seem like I didn't like the game, but I did. Polarity is one of those ""not so great, yet still fun"" games.			"

												Very cheap game but very nice as well. Relaxing puzzle game that requires some good reflexes. It's easy to pick up, learn, and complete even if you're not that into puzzle games. I only wish this supports online multiplayer via Steam but the single-player part pretty much pays for the whole game. Also, there are cards. So you get more bang out of your bu...I mean...cents (when on sale).Prepare your eyes though, the player view bobbing up and down as you walk combined with the bright lights and dark spots may not agree at all with you if your room isn't lit properly and will give you at least a mild headache some minutes in. This may or may not apply to you as I'm only speaking from personal experience.I'd ask for more levels, but that may already be asking for too much.9/10 Great game			"

												Polarity is a very simple and relaxing but still challenging puzzle game that reminds me a lot of Portal, even though there are a lot of differences. The graphics are nice but simple and movement in the game feels good, though some of the physics involved with moving platforms are odd. I had to get used to a moving platform acting like a catapult every time I jumped, but that just made the game that much more unique. I finished all the single player levels in a couple hours and I would really love to see more levels added or a way to make custom levels. Overall it was a great purchase for $0.19 and I've already recommended it to a number of people.			"

												This is basically a platformer game with a few puzzle elements. Polarity mechanics boils down to switching to correct polarity when jumping on colored platforms. Puzzles are trivial and most of the play time comes from traversing unnecessary long distances on foot while constantly holding your ""run"" key. On a few levels it's literally easier to kill yourself (to reset your position) instead of walking back and forth.There is no narration or plot, aesthetically this game is meh, visually it's unpolished even, from time to time you'll see misaligned textures and z-fighting.Speaking of play time, single player campaign (not counting bonus levels) takes around 30 minutes to beat, but then it asks you to replay it and 100% it to unlock a ""Story 02"", which is actually a ""Thanks for playing"" message written on a black screen.I guess I could recommend it if you get it very cheap, but this game also requires you to go through extra hoops to be playable on some configurations. If you're playing on a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor, open your GPU drivers control panel and switch to 60Hz.Apparently if your framrate is too high, game from time to time doens't register jumps and this game has a lot of platforming. You run towards next platform, you press the jump key, hear the jump sound but there is no jump, you just fall off the ledge. This is extremely frustrating. You can't set the refresh rate in game settings. Judging by the forums, someone tried to contact devs about that issue but it's still not fixed. I also hate the mouse acceleration that is there by default but I couldn't find any mouse settings apart from Y invert, which is probably there just for the controller.			"

Also the game would have a much longer longevity if it came with a level editor, but alas, that was not the case or I would have been willing to pay a lot more.			"

												Polarity is no Portal but it's a solid game in its own right. I see that some are complaining about its simplicity and its brevity but honestly, those are some of the qualities I like about Polarity. No puzzle is so challenging that it leaves you scratching your head. Each puzzle can be solved in a span of 1 to 5 minutes. It makes the game more of a relaxing experience, whereas, Portal could be relaxing or it could be hectic.There's little to no story in Polarity but I really enjoyed the TRON-esque asthetic the developers went with. Overall, I found myself enjoying this game and for the price that I paid while it was on sale (I think 99 cents?), I ain't gonna complain about it being short or whatever...If you like puzzle platformers and you see this one on sale, pick it up.8/10			"

Luego de jugarlo, cambié totalmente de idea respecto al juego. Es entretenido, algunos puzzles me costaron un poco entender exactamente que tenía que hacer, pero después de saberlo, es un juego fácil. Entretenido, buen SFX, buenos puzzles, pero algo fácil. Completé los niveles que venían con el juego en una hora y media (90 minutos).8/10			"

Y ese hijo y Spunky Ball (Juego de Android) tuvieron un hijo.Un juego bastante corto, un poco fácil pero igual se disfruta.

												You could consider this a sort of \""value brand\"" Portal, as this costed about 80 cents at the time of purchase. Throughout the game you will complete very intricate obstacles that can be overcome with insane mechanics such as ducking, jumping, and discovering answers to puzzles that progress you through this 80 cent masterpiece. There is also a sort of sidequest esque feel with the optional collectables during the main story progression. In the end you could have just bought a donut with the money, if I could do it all again I would probably buy the donut.Still a solid purchase though. Would recommend.			"

												(4/10)The overall presentation is spartan but not unduly or unpleasantly slow.  The problem that I could not surmount is the controls seem wildly inconsistent.  On dozens of occasions, trivially easy jumps failed to land, the 'jump' sound would play, as the character walked straight off the cliff.  Sometimes even just standing still I could press jump multiple times and only about 2/3 of them would actually register and jump the character.Given the platforming nature of the game in general, having the controls be anything less than 100% accurate/responsive is a deal breaker for me.

												(PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY A REVIEW FOR THE SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN. I'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER IN THE REVIEW)I don't know what I expected for four dollars (though I got it for 19 cents), but apparently this isn't it.GameplayIt felt way too short, but that was probably just because they kept repeating the same puzzles/parkour stunts over and over again, such as when you have to switch polarity in midair to stay on/avoid the platforms/lasers. There were about 5-7 actually unique puzzles.Also, the mechanics weren't being used enough, such as the on/off switch and the rotation buttons. Even the polarity was mostly just used for either the midair-polarity-switch stunt or fields that blocked certain cubes.Plus, the data fragments were placed in awkward positions and it didn't feel like they had anything to do with the puzzle at hand. 3/10EnviromentThere's no real plot aside from being informed that you are hacking into some super important company (although it doesn't look like you're in cyberspace). We are never told what this company is, what they do, or why we need to hack into it.The scenery never changes, either. We aren't showed where we are before we take up the offer, we aren't shown how we get transported into cyberspace, we aren't shown how we get beamed out once we finish the mission, and we aren't shown where we are when we get the massive supply of credits.And it's completely clean with no props or broken walls anywhere, despite the numerous video games that showed us that messier was better. Portal had the famous Rattmann dens, Portal 2 had the facility beat up and destroyed in many of the chambers, Gateways had the laboratories broken into by a messy criminal, etc. And just because it's in cyberspace doesn't mean you can't make some areas briefly be replaced with nonsense code before automatically repairing itslef or have the lights take a while to turn on.Final note: There's just too much black and dark gray on the walls, floors and ceilings, especially in the later levels of the game and the bonus levels. Wouldn't hurt to make it half-light, half-dark like Portal. 2/10Co-opI do not have any friends who are willing to come over to my house just to play Portal 2 minus the portals. Either way, I don't think it would be that much of an improvement. 2/10The store pagedoesn't contain that much content from the real, finished game. As a matter of fact, from the looks of it, the prototype was better than the real thing. It contains some final levels with a better balance of dark and light, and one level that was two from the finished product put together.The description contains numerous flaws. ""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal."" is a little bit too egotistical and not very true. ""Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes."" is hardly true at all. I finished all of the singleplayer levels with all of the fragments in around 114 minutes, and I only stumbled across 2 levels that required reflexes (along with the numerous midair-polarity-switch stunts) and they were pretty easy. ""Full-featured local co-op campaign."" I am not sure about. 2/10OverallThis game is hardly worthy of your money, even if it's only nineteen cents. 2/10			"

But Recently, after becoming bored of other games, I dove into my library and saw this game again.

The way it is engineered is great, the whole ""don't miss a step or you'll ♥♥♥♥ yourself"" aspect.I really enjoyed this game, I just with there was more than two arcs.			"

												Well, we are not supposed to write a long text review for this Indie. So, just consider to grab a piece of gameplay from the most notorious Portal, then merge with some level design of Tron (Disney) and simplify the levels in order to have some funny quick to resolve games. This is Polarity. I appreciated this game, as I've appreciated the previous masterpieces. I want to recommend this game and tell you that it's absolutely playable and short, so if you want some casual gaming with nerd effect this is an option. Of course play Portal 2 and Tron if you like the genre.See ya!Lord Hol Napult's experience: 6,5 / 10			"

												This is a mixed review. Polarity is very similar to Portal series, so if you enjoy Portal 1/2, try Polarity. However, Polarity is inferior in many ways compared to either Portal game, there's no story, no voice acting, not many levels available and the level difficulty is the same throughout the game, and the co-op gameplay is useless if you don't have a pad controller. I gave it a thumb up because I enjoy puzzle games and I did have fun with this, but I wouldn't recommend buying the game at full price.			"

												Interesting little puzzle game, sort of a Portal with aethetics more akin to Tron 2.0. Not too terribly difficult; most levels only took me a few minutes. Good distraction for a couple hours; I picked it up as part of a four-game bundle for about a dollar, so in terms of money-per-unit-entertainment... I'd say it was worth it. (Had I spent its current ""full price"" this review would have a very different tone.)The backstory is that you are, um, hacking some computer system or something? The backstory is completely irrelevant, and can safely be ignored.The game has a bunch of interesting mechanics (a switchable ""polarity"" that lets you pass through walls or lasers; red and blue cubes for activating switches; jump pads of various sorts; etc)-- it's unfortunate that the game is so short, since it seems like there are some missed opportunities there.The ""co-op"" mode is local split-screen only (not online, oddly). I was able to work through it (as one person) with a keyboard and a gamepad; there's little in the co-op campaign that requires active participation by both players simultaneously. That could have used a bit more work.			"

More importantly tho, the puzzles are rock-solid enjoyable and you cannot ask for more than that.It's not Portal but it's not the repetitive grinds which were Magrunner or QUBE either.It even has speedrun potential tho I didn't notice anything like scoreboards for that (you can always challenge yourself tho!!)p.s. the slappy feet noise gets kinda annoying, did the sound guy record himself barefoot in his bathroom or am I playing a fishman and is this more Cthulu? :)			"

												Good GameThis game works similar to Portal. You go through different rooms and try to get out. You also have to collect data fragments to unlock more levels. The game has lots of cool mechanics and each level is unique, if a little easy. There is also a co-op campaign but it's in splitscreen only. Nothing wrong with splitscreen but I would be nice for online multiplayer. The graphics are simplistic and serve there purpose. Overall, if you liked Portal, you're probably gonna like this.			"

												A fun game that doesn't require much brain power. Co-op levels were far more trickier than single-player. Honestly, I wish there was more. But it's worth it for a couple of cents. I enjoyed it.Since co-op is local only, it's possible to beat co-op if you don't have any friends. Plug a console controller into your PC and you're ready to go.			"

												Polarity is a 3-D first person physics puzzle game with the core mechanic of switching ""polarities"" to progress through the level. In each level there are three data pieces located in hidden or hard-to-reach places that you must collect to finish the game. If you were a fan of the box-juggling of Portal, this game has plenty, as most levels requires you to carry, throw, and place boxes on buttons. It's a fun little game whose biggest issue is the little. The game is fairly short, and I was able to beat the ""story mode"" in less than an hour, half of which was going back through the levels to collect all the ""data"" I missed due to tricky placement. New mechanics are barely added in this short amount of time, meaning each level feels roughly the same. The puzzles weren't challenging enough to help the length, and the story mode is barely a story. The game doesn't really use its core mechanic to its full potential, and it really seems like just a box-and-button puzzle game rather than something fresh and new. The aesthetic is nice.If you do get this game, get it during one of its sale periods where it goes down to like 19 cents. I do recommend it because it is a nice puzzle game, but it's not all there.

												My friend and I played the co-op campaign. We managed to bring the cubes through the exit doors on most of the levels we played. You can phase the cubes through the barriers that they aren't supposed to go through. You can clip out of the map. The music is very well made for the most part. You're supposed to be hacking, but for the most part, it feels like a nice peaceful stroll down Cyberspace lane. The ambient noises are very nice as well.You can enjoy a fun, relaxing time, or laugh your head(s) off breaking the game. Don't want to pay 11/12 dollars? That's fine.

												Very good puzzle game. I had a few problems with the platforms flinging me when I jumped but for all I know that could actually be a mechanic of the game. I also hate games that have achievements for playing co op splitscreen but that is just one of my pet peeves. Now, the puzzles aren't super hard and don't require much skill but the graphics are pretty while the actual gameplay is solid and fun. You get to pick up cubes to throw them in what I will call ""trigger boxes"" which gives a portal feel and that's really neat as well. Overall this is worth picking up and definitely worth spending some time on if you even mildly enjoy puzzle games.			"

												Polarity is the poor man's Portal, but perhaps that's being a bit unfair to Polarity; it IS its own game in its own right. It doesn't have an incredibly engaging story to it (in fact, save for a short text introduction at the beginning of the game, there's no story to it at all), but at the same time it doesn't really need one. The objective of each level is to use colored cubes to activate corresponding gates and switches to get to the end-level warp while collecting data fragments.HIGHS: --Gameplay is fun and engaging, albeit a bit bare-bones.             --Bonus levels and Co-op campaign add much needed replay.             --The music (or I should ambience) is soothing without becoming repetitive. Accompanied with the easy-on-the-eyes visuals, the game is actually quite calming (in the good way).LOWS: --The levels aren't incredibly challenging. They're enough to make you think, but none will really stump you or leave you stuck.            --There's a couple important details the game neglects to inform you about. For example, later in the game you'll encounter yellow gates that, turns out, change the color of whatever cube passes through it. An attentive player would be bound to figure this out on their own eventually, but the more casual player may not be so quick to catch on (especially when the FIRST none-red/blue gate you encounter without being informed kills you).            --The game is FAR too short, especially for the asking price of $10.99 (The single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour, even if you're not the greatest at puzzle games). The game could've, and SHOULD've, been much longer; especially with the multitude of potential puzzles the aforemention yellow gates can bring to the table.BUY or BYE: I say buy, especially if you're a big fan of the Portal series or puzzle games in general. Polaris is not worth the default $11. A good default price would be $5 (perhaps $9.99 at the most), but certainly not $11. HOWEVER, it IS a fun puzzle game that should be experienced, and for the current sales price of $0.54, you can't go wrong!			"

												The game Polarity introduces a virtual hacking system where the goal is to collect data fragments and solve puzzles to earn an explicit amount of money from the payer. The game shows promising concepts and awesome game play. The things I thought were different were the lack of story line and the slightly overpriced tag for the game on steam. I feel like it deserves more levels because I strongly enjoyed the fantastic game Polarity. There was a few glitches in the game where the cube (The Red or Blue cube that activates pistons or boosts) could go through walls and or when I picked them up, it would go through its pedestal and in both scenarios become unusable forcing me to restart the game and try again. Other than that I would strongly recommend this game primarily due to the fact that it is so much fun and provides the gamer with a fun filled adventure on what it is like to be a virtual hacker. I look forward to any advances the owners include in the game and I thank them for such an awesome game. Please try this game for yourself, it will be worth it!			"

												I bought this game only because I had 19p in my steam wallet with nothing to use it on. I looked for cheap games and seen this one, dont let the price fool you. This game is worth far more than the small price and will keep you playing for a good while.Graphically the game looks great. I really like the art style in the game and it ran smoothly.I dont know if it was me, but the puzzles were kind of on the easy side with only a couple giving me a challenge, regardless of that, the game is still lots of fun.I have yet to play the coop stages, but I have got a friend to buy it as well, so that will be done soon :)If you like Portal, then you will love this and in many ways I found this better than Portal.Polarity 2????

PresentationPolarity is like a simpler and shorter version of Portal, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game or a relentless copy of the game which obviously inspired it, as there are plenty of concepts and ideas that make this title stand on its own. To begin with, there are no actual portals, as the game relies on its blue-red polarity concept to solve puzzles, allowing you to change your polarity in order to pass obstacles and reach otherwise inaccessible areas. As that alone would become boring, companion cubes show up just at the right time to throw in the extra element that allows certain levels to present you with challenging puzzles, without over-complicating them to the point where you don't know what to do next. Cubes, just as yourself have polarities as well, however their polarity can only change in special areas, forcing you to use what you have at your disposal in order to solve puzzles, and since you can only summon a limited number of cubes, the solution will always pop up once you've exhausted all other options, making puzzles challenging, but not unsolvable. Unlike Portal, Polarity doesn't have a background story, and there is nothing to tie in one level to the next one, making your entire adventure feel without purpose, especially since the single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour.Rating: 6.5GameplayThe gameplay is simplistic and accessible to anyone, as it only requires basic character and camera movements and control buttons for switching polarity and interacting with cubes and other objects, but aside from that logic is the only tool you need in Polarity. Puzzles are challenging, but they never get to the point where they become hard or unsolvable without consulting a guide, mostly because the game will be over before the level design reaches that point. There are a lot of interesting features packed in the final levels, and there was definitely room for a lot more afterwards, but unfortunately none of those features reached their full potential, as the level design remains basic, even when there are more elements involved, as the solution will always be obvious once you take a look around you. The polarity switch is the game's greatest strength as it creates opportunities for clever and unique puzzles, but once again this feature never goes beyond that basic gate, making it feel unused in most cases. There are some interesting puzzles to have fun with, but even so it shouldn't take you longer than four minutes to solve each one, as you will always find the solution to each one once you've failed on your first attempt and realize the answer is the other way around.Rating: 6GraphicsThe game looks okay for what it is, however even with the test chamber look inspired by Portal, there was room for a few details to differentiate one level from another, but in this case all the levels look similar and the only thing to set them apart one from another is the placement of the objects required to solve the puzzle. The visual effects are basic, and once again for what this game is, they do the job, even though in certain areas better effects would've made a difference in the sense of power the game tries to give you by interacting with its objects.Rating: 5.5AudioThere are no voices in here since there is no background story, narration or characters, leaving the entire experience up to the level design and the puzzles, but the lack of such things only makes the game seem shorter than it already is. The sound effects are basic and repetitive, as you will still hear the same interaction sounds over and over again; the soundtrack is limited and even though it is in theme with what the game offers, you will eventually grow tired of hearing that same tune all the time.Rating: 4ExtrasApart from the single player campaign, there is a Co-Op campaign which consists of a collection of levels designed for two players and a Bonus campaign which can be accessed once you've finished the main missions; all that added up and you've still got only 2-3 hours worth of content.Rating: 6.5VerdictPolarity is a fun game to play if you fancy the genre, however don't expect this to have anything else to offer besides its gameplay concepts, and even with that in mind there is not much to play; after all, this is a 5€ title.Rating: 5.7Check out the full review and a lot more about Polarity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=338 "

												The game says it collects coop data, but there are no chickens anywhere and it doesn't look like Farmville at all.What is the CIA trying to pull here?No mouse sensitivity setting. With a gaming mouse, I have to switch dpi whenever switching between 3D and menu. I am beginning to appreciate that my mouse has dedicated buttons for that. Set it to 400 dpi, Windows to 1/11, still too fast.Same with sound volume. Too low, and not adjustable.Autorun would be very helpful, too.Dropped the cube on an arrow plate - couldn't pick it up again. A little bug I guess.One time the cube moved to me in slowmotion when picked up.One time I threw my cube against a wall and it vanished in it. Another little bug. (They're so cute. :3)One level had a fail condition, requiring a restart. Not a big deal. Just seems like unintended design.Rotation arrow buttons are the wrong way. The button showing clockwise rotation turns the whole room counter-clockwise. Bit confusing at first.Progressive complexity, without becoming actually more difficult. A generally easy-difficulty game for those who don't like their head to go up in smoke. Although it's also so non-exciting that it can become difficult to find motivation in the more complex levels.Jumping is nicely controllable, even in mid-air. Since there are jump-timing puzzles, this is very good. A bit bothersome maybe that you get stuck at very low edges and need to jump there, but you can just adjust to that.Menu navigation is a bit tedious with no rollover and no good visual selection indication.Barefoot walking sounds, yet jumps and landings sound like shoes.The 'story' is lackluster even for this game, especially because the 'ending' text abruptly goes out of character. They could just as well not have made a story at all if they don't put any passion into it.A game should be easy or short, but not both. This is  of acceptable length if you play all the content types. But cooperative mode I found bothersome, because player 2 can only be controlled with a game controller, and while I have that (otherwise not playable it seems), controlling your avatar using a game controller is a challenge in itself, especially if you're not used to it.Since I got this with heavy discount - 19 cents, I didn't consider it a bad investment. Especially since a foil card dropped, hah.			"

So, just consider to grab a piece of gameplay from the most notorious Portal, then merge with some level design of Tron (Disney) and simplify the levels in order to have some funny quick to resolve games. This is Polarity. I appreciated this game, as I've appreciated the previous masterpieces. I want to recommend this game and tell you that it's absolutely playable and short, so if you want some casual gaming with nerd effect this is an option.

												Interesting little puzzle game, sort of a Portal with aethetics more akin to Tron 2.0. Not too terribly difficult; most levels only took me a few minutes. Good distraction for a couple hours; I picked it up as part of a four-game bundle for about a dollar, so in terms of money-per-unit-entertainment... I'd say it was worth it. (Had I spent its current ""full price"" this review would have a very different tone.)The backstory is that you are, um, hacking some computer system or something? The backstory is completely irrelevant, and can safely be ignored.The game has a bunch of interesting mechanics (a switchable ""polarity"" that lets you pass through walls or lasers; red and blue cubes for activating switches; jump pads of various sorts; etc)-- it's unfortunate that the game is so short, since it seems like there are some missed opportunities there.The ""co-op"" mode is local split-screen only (not online, oddly). I was able to work through it (as one person) with a keyboard and a gamepad; there's little in the co-op campaign that requires active participation by both players simultaneously. That could have used a bit more work.			"

Good distraction for a couple hours; I picked it up as part of a four-game bundle for about a dollar, so in terms of money-per-unit-entertainment... I'd say it was worth it. (Had I spent its current ""full price"" this review would have a very different tone.)The backstory is that you are, um, hacking some computer system or something? The backstory is completely irrelevant, and can safely be ignored.The game has a bunch of interesting mechanics (a switchable ""polarity"" that lets you pass through walls or lasers; red and blue cubes for activating switches; jump pads of various sorts; etc)-- it's unfortunate that the game is so short, since it seems like there are some missed opportunities there.The ""co-op"" mode is local split-screen only (not online, oddly). I was able to work through it (as one person) with a keyboard and a gamepad; there's little in the co-op campaign that requires active participation by both players simultaneously. That could have used a bit more work.			"

												Polarity looks and feels like a budget Portal.  The textures, lighting, and sound are awful, the puzzles are unbalanced (several don't even use the central conceit of the game and are just box-courier exercises), and the UI is dogshit ugly.  But the single-player is an enjoyable ~hour of dicking around that I couldn't really fault at a sub-$1 price.			"

												It was $0.21 how could it NOT be worth it? know what you are getting though. its probably under an hour to beat and the difficulty is low to medium, especially if you have played other first person puzzle games.it does have a co op set of levels but they are local split screan only. no online. and minimal input is required from the second player. the puzles can be solved by only one player while the other just has to follow along and get to the end of the level.

												It's a really nice game! I've never played games like Polarity before (though some people suggest it's very similar to Portal), and was amazed how easily I got myself immersed into exploring new levels. It's fun and relaxing experience, however very short. The game doesn't cost much, so it's easy choice and you won't regret you spent your money on it. The biggest disappointment for me was the co-op mode, in which two players can either play on two pads or one pad and keyboard, so if you don't own a pad you can't play the co-op. Using the same keyboard by two players should be also allowed (with customizable controls).			"

												I like Polarity, its a simple puzzler and I can honestly say I was surprised by how not terrible it was.  I ended up liking it and playing through it and I have got to say it is super short. I think what we need most would be more levels, or some way to make levels.   In Polarity you play a hacker whose goal is to collect all the data fragments throughout the game. Each level takes place in a type of ""digital vault"" that is supposed to be ""un-hackable"". Its up to you to puzzle your way through the game.   I recommend Polarity to any puzzle game fan.			"

												Would not recommend this to anyone who's looking for challenging puzzles because this game does not have a single one. To solve most puzzles you don't even have to think. The level design is very linear, there aren't really any connections between different parts of the level. A short game that is ridiculously overpriced.			"

Polarity  - A first-person puzzle game in the vein of Portal.****Arbitrary Number Rating****||//////||////||__ 5.5/10 __||\\\\||\\\\\\||The descriptions seem to make Polarity out to be a challenging puzzle game that is made for fans of Portal who want more. Beyond being a first-person puzzle game with discrete puzzle rooms that require you to unlock switches to progress to the next puzzle chamber, the comparison between Portal and Polarity is miles apart. The game isn't exactly challenging and the narrative is pretty bare and forgettable.Although portals are absent, Polarity does introduce some original, although very simple new mechanics to add to the ""drop off box at checkpoint to open door"" puzzle genre, mostly relating to the ""Polarity"" of the player. You switch your polarity between Red and Blue to get through shields and jumping platforms. Also included are co-op and competitive splitscreen modes, but I did not try those out. #Very short and easy, with little replay value. Great for those who are hankering for a small, small dose of Portal-like puzzle gameplay. Pick it up when discounted at 90%, not worth otherwise. "

												Polarity in a sentence: Polarity is a first-person puzzle/platforming game where you, well, solve puzzle and... yeah.That was Polarity in a sentence (And a half, I guess). Now, it's time for the real review.Basic Info:Polarity, greatly inspired by Portal, is a first-person puzzle platformer. You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. Either way, they're the same kind of puzzles.List of Basic Uses:-Cubes: Used to activate switches, platforms, laser walls, etc.-Polarity: You switch your Polarity (Your color, some say) to jump onto colored platforms, or to get through a laser gate without dying.-Gold Lasers, A.K.A. Color Changing Lasers: These are lasers that you can throw cubes into to change their color from either red to blue, or blue to red.-Data: These are collected to unlock more levels throughout the game and eventually unlock the bonus stages. There are three per level.Other Notes:This game is completly Xbox 360 controller compatible without any configuration needed. There is also a split-screen multiplayer that has its own campaign.Story:Honestly, Polarity doesn't really have a story at all. However, you can peice together a basic story from what you're told.You're a hacker trying to break into one of the greatest firewalls in the world, trying to collect data so you get your reward that was promised to you by an unknown person/thing - 10,000,000 Credits.Gameplay:Polarity has you jumping from platform to platform, switching your Polarity (Or, some may call, your color) and carrying and throwing cubes everywhere. What I'm trying to say is that you may have to get through a  red  laser gate, so you have to switch your polarity (Which, by default at the begining of every level, is blue) to, obviously, red. That's different with platforms, however. With platforms, you must switch to the  opposite  color to get across, which leads to switching polarity in mid-air. What I'm trying to say is that your Polarity and ablility to work with cubes is all you need to beat the levels.Polarity has 14 levels in singleplayer that are not too tough at all, but can actually be a bit fustrating for reasons such as ""Crap, put the cube in the wrong spot - Oh, there it goes. Bye cube. Just gotta run back to the other side of the map again to get a new one..."" Most of the levels are short, but every now and then, you'll notice repeating concepts in the levels. For exaple, you may have just completed a level where you had to through cubes into switches and now, you're throwing cubes into color changing lasers and then putting them in switches. May not  sound  similar, but once you play, you'll know what I mean. That, however, is not too much of an issue.Upon getting every Data Crystal in the singleplayer campaign, you unlock the 10 bonus levels. These levels are just  barely  harder then the normal campaign, which is easy once you get the hang of how things work.Difficulty... That's an issue. This game isn't hard by all means. It's just fustrating. Like in my example above, you can easily throw your cube the wrong way or just barely miss the button for it and *POOF*! It's gone. You'll have to go back and get a new one. Anyways, back to difficulty - It's too easy, in my opinion, to be a puzzle game. WAY too easy. The Data Crystals aren't even cleverly hidden at all. You can easily get all of those. You'll also find yourself breezing through this game. For example, if you have even the slightest bit of knowledge as to what you're doing, you can get through levels in 1-2 minutes each. The singleplayer campaign (Bonus levels included) may only take you about an hour and a half. That's how short and quick this game is.Ah, multiplayer... I can't say that I LOVE it, but I like it. You and your buddy are robots (Sound familiar much?) and you must work together to solve puzzles similar to the normal puzzles, except this time, it's even harder. This time I mean it. It's not ""I GIVE UP!"" hard, it's just... Up there, I guess you could say. The Data Crystals can easily be passed without even knowing it, and they're hidden in better spots and actually take you a minute to get them. I would have to say that the multiplayer is better than the singleplayer just because you have a friend with you and you both get to slove the puzzles together.Conclusion:This is a first-person puzzle game that's highly inspired by Portal. Sure, it's not always fair, but it comes through for sure. I would just get this game while it's on sale, as you'll be glad that you didn't waste $5.00 on this. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, it's just I don't see it being worth $5.00. Not everyone looking for a good puzzle game will be satisfied fully, but I still love this game.To conclude this review, I give Polarity a 7/10. It could be better, and it wouldn't be that hard.			"

												It's quite obvious that this physics-based indie platformer takes heavy inspiration from the game portal, but Polarity doesn't have the complexity it's influence does, just lots of switches and platforms and cubes to pick up and toss. Nevertheless, it is a small, modest game, but still a rather pleasing one. The game has decent graphics and smooth gameplay, although the motion blur was a tad disorienting, but that could be disabled. The instructions are simple, and the game is pretty straight forward. Moreover, the puzzles are insanely basic, they are too easy and lack anything remotely complex or challenging to them. The levels feel particularly identical and short. Furthermore, there's no real story, although that being said, a story isn't always necessary. One thing that really ticked me off was that the multiplayer that it supposedly has, is nonexistent, and you must have a controller along with a keyboard in order to play coop. To sum up, the game is very short and lacks many characteristics that make a game good. Considering that the game is actually eleven dollars and not the 20 cents I paid for it, it definetly isn't worth the money. However, I do recognize that polarity has a very small development team and appreciate the game for what it is.			"

												This is a fun game with a cool play style that very much reminds me of the Portal games.  I like the puzzles which are simple but satisfying.I only have one MAJOR complaint with this game: JumpingIDK if this is on purpose but 50% of the time when you press space bar while running you will not jump.  This may be something with key ghosting in the game engine, but it absolutely sucks when you try to jump onto a simple platform and end up just running off.  This may sound like a minor nuisance, but this issue has driven me to quit ENTIRELY due to frusturation.  If this is on purpose to make it harder then its the most BS feature of any game I've EVER played.You may reply with ""You are just bad""  I have literally sat there and spammed the space bar and it will frequently not jump at all.C'mon devs!  Get it together!  I really like this game otherwise :) and I am going to recommend this despite this issue.			"

I think like 3 or 2 is more worth it, considering the game is a Portal copy. It is overall a good game though. : )			"

												even if you missed the deal for this game being 19 f**king cents, it's still worth paying 5 dollars for. While not nearly as shiny as portal 2, it has solid enough mechanics and a very stable game. That being said, since it is a 5 dollar game, some parts of the levels collision detection may be a bit faulty. I can remember one time I threw a cube into a wall and the cube went strait through said wall into oblivion, but again, only happened once. For 19 cents you literaly have no reason to NOT buy this game unless you are flat broke. on the other hand if you miss the deal and you MUST have mainstream quality from both graphics and gameplay, then perhaps you should pass this one up.

												The campaign and the bonus levels were great, the graphics were sub par, the puzzles were well thought out, and overall it's pretty fun. The horrible part is that, although it is advertised as multiplayer and local co-op, it is in fact only local co-op. This means that a part of the game was left untouched which is unsatisfying since I paid to enjoy the full game. A step forward for the developers would be an option for players to create their own levels and play with each other over the internet. Overall, good game but needs some fixing.			"

												Obligatory warning, I really liked this game, but there is way too little content to justify spending 5 bucks on it. Wait till there is a sale and it drops down to 19 cents. I bought this for 12 cents after using the spare change in my steam wallet, and it was totally worth it then. Anyways, lets get started on the pros and cons.Pros:-Graphics look really nice for a game I picked up for 12 cents.-Audio, while repetitive at a few moments during the hour and a half singleplayer campaign, was nice and provided a nice atmosphere for the whole digital hacking heist theme. Not necessarily pro or con:-Many reviews mention Portal as what they were thinking of while they were playing. While it had a unique gameplay idea of polarity switching, it really could've used that mechanic way more than the Portal-esque cube on button style gameplay. Cons:-SO SHORT! Even with the bonus levels, it only took me about an hour and a half, which is why I recommend it only if it's on sale.-Not much of a con, but it was really easy the whole way through. Really could've used a difficulty spike at points.Overall a 8/10 for a game on sale for 20 cents,  "

												A quite interesting first person puzzler slightly reminiscent of games such as Portal and the Talos Principle. Don't buy this game expecting that level of complexity or quality, but anything even slightly like Portal is a good thing, right? Right. One complaint, though: It doesn't use the feature the game is named after - the ability to switch your color to avoid or trigger certain pieces of geometry or lasers - nearly as often as it should. Anyway, you could do much worse for $5 and not a whole lot better for 19 cents, which is what I picked it up for during the Summer Sale.			"

												If your looking for a game to last a long while and give you a lot of gameplay, I would suggest putting this one off. It is a very well made game, considering how it was apparently made my a small group of people, from their bedrooms. (Read the ingame READ ME) and is worth a try in my opinion. Get it while it is on sale, not at full price though, because even though it could help out the small dev team, it really isn't worth full price without something along the lines of a level editor. And if you do decided to get it, full price or not, you would have to agree that a level editor would make it better. Shprt, sweet, simple, great for portal fans. 7.5/10			"

I bought it for 0,19€ on discount...  The only negative thing on this game is the coop. The coop can be played only in splitscreen and if you want play it whit someone you need at least 1 gamepad. I hawe no gamepad so i cant play it :(. The most funny thing is, i got no gamecards for playing this game, i think i was to fast. :DRead more for Slovak and German version. SKPolarity je dobrá logická hra len trochu lahká a krátka. Dohral som to za 1,5 hodiny (singla aj všetky bonus levely). Neodporúčam to kupovať za 4,99€ zas až také dobré to nieje :D Ja som to kúpil za 0,19€ takže treba počkať na zlavu. Jediné čo by som tejto hre ešte vytkol je coop. Coop sa dá hrať iba na jednom monitore v splitscreene a treba mať na to minimálne jeden gamepad. Keďže gamepad nemám a asi ešte dlho mať nebudem tak coop hrať nemôžem :(DEPolarity ist ein gutes logisches Spiel aber ein wenig zu leicht und kurz. Ich habe es in 1,5 Stunden durchgespielt (Einzelspieler und alle Bonus Levels). Kauft es nicht für 4,99€, das Geld ist es nich wert. I habe es für 0,19€ gekauft als es im Rabatt war... Das einzig richtig Negative auf diesem Spiel ist der Coop. Man kann ihm nur im splitscreen spielen und man braucht dazu mindistens einem Gamepad. Ich habe keinem Gamepad also kann ich dem Coop auch nicht speilen :(. Leider....Why in 3 languages? Because i can (and because i have nothing to do right now) :D			"

												This game is actually fantastic. I bought it on sale intending to challenge it's self proclaimed brilliance as ""The best puzzle game since Portal"" After having completed the game I can say that while not as good as any of the Portal games Polarity's clever puzzles and addictive collectables kept my interest. It even has a local co-op mode with more puzzles which were fantastic. The only part of the game where I would say it lacked quality was the story in that it doesn't really exist and when it is there it seems kind of cheesy and out of place. There is also a competitive multiplayer mode that is not worth playing at all, but its inclusion did not hurt the game in my eyes. If you are looking for a brilliantly clever puzzle platformer in the vein of games like portal then look no further. It is absolutely worth the price.			"

												Polarity is a short and at times very easy puzzle game. It is in some ways comparable to portal, but without the portals. The main gameplay, at least, is similar to portal. You use cubes on pressure pads around each puzzle room, in an attempt to reach the exit. There is the added task of collecting data nodes, on the premise that you are a ""hacker"" stealing them from a vault. The story doesn't play too much into this except at the beginning and end of the game.The puzzles themselves are fairly easy. There were a few that I had to think about solving, but most were solvable in less than 2 minutes. For reference: I was even able to complete the co-op levels as a single player, and the entire game to 100% [with all data nodes collected] within ~3 hours.The music doesn't always play in this game, it fades in every now and then with a calming ambient piece. It is very nice, but I don't think there are many tracks that rotate. There isn't any voicing in this game, and beyond text that flashes on screen at the start of the game you are pretty much left to your own devices to figure things out. The graphics in this game are very nice. In some places the shadows look a bit odd, but mostly it looks nice. It has a sort of cell-shaded look, with textures that look fairly minimalistic.To summarise this: Despite peoples insistence to compare this to portal, beyond some similar gameplay mechanics it isn't very similar at all. It isn't overly challenging, but if you want some simple first-person puzzles to wile away an afternoon, this is the game to go for.			"

												While Polarity is not as great as Portal, Yet it's a very great game.The game itself has great graphics and level design, Instead of using the Portal Gun in portal, You use your Polarity... You can hack into Red and Blue beams by using your Polarity. This is quite an impressive feature to a game.The only problem with this game in my opinion is that it is WAY to easy. Remember in Portal when you had to receive a transmission to multiple radios to get an achievement? Well in this game, You collect Data Fragments. They are incredibly easy to find. No challenge whatsoever.If you're up for a challenge, Then this game is not for you. But if you like games with great graphics, fun levels, and easy gameplay, It's for you.My Rating: 7/10 "

There is no online co-op, and (to my knowledge) you cannot use hamachi or other tunneling services.It's an overall good game, but needs a way to use the same keyboard, or something similar. It would be uncomfortable, but for people who don't own a gamepad, possible.			"

A Screenshot of Polarity
By: Hexie Lambent




If those three things were fixed, I could halfheartedly recommend this as a shallow, brainless diversion for about an hour.  I respect it might have been developed on a low budget, as it VERY heavily presents that fact with its... everything, really.  Sound effects, music, menu, level design, gameplay, all rather amateur.I used very rudimentary gaming skills and logic to very quickly clear the main campaign, and the bonus levels did not interest me.  Again, that's fine, but riding on the coattails of Portal WITHOUT EVEN HAVING PORTALS IN YOUR GAME while charging what I believe to be more than double the fair asking price and then being cheeky about ""fooling"" people with screenshots... leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.All things considered, I bought this a while back for 19 cents, thankfully.

												After 100% completing the single-player campaign (including the bonus levels) I do not recommend this game and here's why.-The puzzle designs are lazy and linear. I wouldn't even classify them as puzzles as they don't really get you thinking.-Even though the main mechanic of the game is that you can change your polarity, you suprisngly don't use it that often.  Not as often as you should. It felt like most of the puzzles used the cubes more than the core mechanic, and that got   boring fast.-Cubes. The physics weren't the best and elevators were the worst. Rising platforms (Elevators) would have a circle pad  in the middle to put a cube on to raise the platform. However if you fell off the platform you could not get the cube  off, so you'd have to go back to the beginning and reset the cube back to it's orginal position, and like I said before  since the puzzles revolved around them you would have to do whole entire levels again just because you fell.-At first I thought the data crytals were supposed to be secret, optional objects you would find in levels. But the hiding   places are so stupid. On one level there's a data crytal in a corner not being blocked by anything, just out in the open.  Another level has two of them next to each other. Because of how poorly they are hidden and that the last level requires  you to find all of them, I don't think they are optional.-The story doesn't make sense. You're a hacker hired by a hacking company. What does that have to do with puzzles?  Does the game take place in a computer? It doesn't explain.-At the beginning they explain some of the mechanics but later on whenever they introduce a new object they don't  bother explaining what it does. So good luck trying to find out what to do with a green laser field or a circle ramp.-If you thought Portal 1 was short, wait till you play this. I beat all the levels and got all the data  crystals in less than 2 hours. And it's sad because the game had so much potenial. The graphics were nice and the polarity mechanic was promising.Really, all I have to say about this game is that it is lazy. I give it a 4/10.If you still want to get the game after reading my review, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												Fun Portal-esque game, fresh mechanics, interesting puzzles, but honestly I think it could have done a lot more with the mechanics than it did. Also, I had a frustrating amount of trouble with jumping around when moving platforms were involved--seems like the physics were off, sending me flying unanticipated distances that made several of the levels quite difficult.Being able to throw the little cubes felt like cheating sometimes. Sometimes it was completely necessary for a level, other times it let me skip pieces of a level.For controls, having to hold down shift to run was annoying and got painful after a while. Also, even with the controls options window that pops up when you start the game, I haven't been able to figure out how to set Player2 controls for coop mode.			"

But maybe watching on Youtube, if you're trying to take a nap or something.It's mixed, really.  I'd give it another shot if I could really unbind my move forward key with polarity (E).

												Polarity is a first person logic puzzle game whose concept is vastly inspired by Portal. It has similar mechanics but at the same time it is full of originality. The companion cubes might not be as cute as in Portal, but they’re still present in this game and needed to complete the puzzles. An innovation consists in the ability of the player to switch between two polarities (red – blue) which allows him to run through gates or to jump on platforms, according to the selected polarity.The single player part consists of 14 puzzles that are not too hard to solve, with difficulty increasing each level though. However, even the most difficult levels can be solved in less than 5 minutes each. The 10 bonus levels are slightly more difficult to figure out, but they add new fun features to the game.The coop mode, on the other hand, is quite challenging. The two players must cooperate to solve the puzzles that are much more complex than in single player mode. The levels are bigger, now consisting in multiple rooms. The path to the exit isn’t usually the same for the two players, but nevertheless, they need to work together to reach it. There are places in which timed jumps are needed while trying to grab certain objects at the same time, and these jumps are not easily performed with a controller as compared to a mouse and keyboard setup. Sadly, the game offers only local coop and not online multiplayer, so make sure to invite a friend that can be persuaded to work on those together with you, without him losing his patience. Or even better, maybe you can convince him/her to do those tricky jumps :)Don’t hesitate to buy it, especially discounted, since it is a very fun game!			"

												It's an interesting logic puzzle game, challenging but not that difficult, which makes it relaxing, even though at moments it keeps you thinking how to solve some things. You can play it as a single player or with a friend.			"

												This is a rather interesting puzzle game and a must-have for fans of the genre, where you get hired by a hacking company to solve a bunch of puzzles and infiltrate a system to obtain some pieces of data, needless to say that the story is trivial but that's normally expected from a puzzle game.The puzzles are mildly difficult and only get a bit tricky in Co-op mode.In general, the game's visuals need a bit of polishing alongside some adjustments to the physics involving the player's movement, in addition to that, I had to restart a level from the beginning after dying on the edge of the level because I kept respawning outside of the level.And not forgetting that this game's store page has a Multiplayer tag when it actually only supports Singleplayer and Co-op modes. So, adding a Multiplayer feature would be great instead of just having the tag...But regardless of its flaws and after completing the game, I'd surely recommend it while hoping that the dev/devs will release some updates to both fix the issues mentioned above and to probably add more content to this nice game.

												I completed the single player game (bonus levels included) very quickly, getting all possible single player achievements along the way. Almost the entire time I was wondering when it would get harder. It never did. I never had to think too hard to solve the rooms, or look in obscure corners to get the data fragments. When I finished the game I was left feeling like it had never really gotten started. If you’re after an easy, relaxing puzzler that won’t take all day or require a lot of thought, this is very much for you. I would suggest waiting for it to be on sale (I got it for $0.19, and I can’t express how glad I am I didn’t pay $5 for it).The game itself looks decent enough. There are little issues here and there, like some minor Z-fighting in spots, and in one level there is a doorway you have to jump through because you get stuck on the lip of the floor otherwise. Nothing game breaking though.Unfortunately I don’t have any friends with this game, so I can’t say anything about the co-op side of it. Overall it’s an okay game, it’s just not one I’ll be recommending to people unless they want a really simple and short puzzler.			"

												I hate to be the barren of reviewing games i've played but I was expecting more out of this game. When I first saw this on Greenlight, I thought this could be the perfect alternative towards Portal & QUBE (because they don't work on my current laptop) but then I heard that this game was discounted at 96%! Hearing that must of made the game sound really bad but I ignored it. I read the description of Polarity, claiming that it's the most fun Puzzle game since Portal (I even saw a comment on the greenlight page that the dev(s) don't even know what Portal was). Gameplay was just too simple & it lasted only for an hour on my side, the first time playing Portal brought so much confusion that it was thrilling, this game just wanted me to go to sleep. I also looked around the levels set up & I saw so many flaws that it looked like it was rushed from development just to gain revenue. The worst part about it is that it has no decent story, Portal's story was so fasinating that I want to find out more about its connections with Half-Life 2, Polarity states that your a hacker thats trying to access a virtual vault when these levels don't look anything like a firewall. In conclusion, If you want a better puzzle game at a cheap price, Get something that was made perfectly & looks challenging (even if it has mixed ratings). All that it can be used now is to haul trading cards & allowing a short sleep mode onto yourself.			"

												Minimalistic Portal imitation - this time it's just basic color-swapping puzzles without challenging the player to think that much. On one hand, it's well-presented and kinda-sorta interesting. On the other hand, this has been done better elsewhere. Too short and far too easy to be worth the price tag - only worth it for a buck (cash-money US $$$ for those unfamiliar with the colloquialism) or two at best.			"

												First of all, everytime i sprint and jump it doesen't register half of the time, it does the jumping sound but i don't jump and for a game that relies so much on jumping from platform to platform this is gamebreaking. Maybe i am the only one trying to play this game with red switches and the game can't handle that or something i dunno but it's pretty stupid.I bought this game because i like fps puzzle games and since it has the overall rating of ""very positive"" i just got it because it was in the store for 1,50$. I don't think it deserves that rating and the price is pretty much over the top(it's 10$ now). It should be more like 0.50$ or f2p, there are alot of f2p titles that are doing a much better job then this game.			"

												This looks like a game with potential, but as it stands I found it pretty unplayable. Jumping simply doesn't work 80% of the time (you hear the jump noise but don't move), which is incredibly frustrating given this is a puzzle platformer. Gamepad sensitivity is also insanely high by default (although this can be turned down in the options thankfully - I had to set it to 0.1 to be usable). Gamepad button prompts are just missing entirely from some tutorial popups. The camera clips as you approach walls in co-op. If these bugs were addressed (and none of them seem like challenging issues) it would be a much more polished experience. I'm happy to change my recommendation if they're fixed in a patch.			"

												This game is like a reductive Portal (even their logos are similar, so you can clearly see the inspiration), but also brings something new to the table: you have to switch between the two polarities to be able to pass through gates and jump to platforms, which can require some quick thinking. I enjoyed it, but the co-op can only be played with a controller, so if you don't have one like me (I only have a PS2 one with no adapter), you can't get the last 3 achievements.			"

Portal Except You Pay 99 Cents For It And It's Not Portal And There's No Memes. - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]When you look through the Steam bargain bin, you're most likely to find♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy-paste RPG's, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""My First Platformer"" games from some guy in his garage that thought he'd make it big on Steam with his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wanna-be Super Meat Boy, or just plain actual♥♥♥♥♥♥ Games that were hastily put together for a quick buck that hardly work but still sell because the trading cards.I bought a ton of these games, because I mean why not? During a Steam sale, this♥♥♥♥♥♥is like two cents. Everyone knows how large your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is correlates to how many games you own on Steam. But this one game now, I was pleasantly surprised with.It's Portal. Portality. You know. The meme game. The one with the potato and the cakes and the lemons you squeeze in people's eyes.You might not recognize it, but that's only because this is the Walmart brand. This is Great Value: Puzzle Platformer. It has red and blue squares instead of circles. Also they're not portals. But it's like the same exact thing, honey. It's not Lucky Charms but there's a green man on the box. Eat your cereal.Portality barely manages to get by doing what Portal already did so much better. It has the puzzles in there. And there's different colors. Those do something. There's quite a bit of different elements to interact with, actually. Cubes that activate switches and launch pads and all kinds of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The main function, your ""Polarity"", is purely titular though. You can switch between Red and Blue, and that changes which surfaces you can walk on or pass through. But it's introduced in the first few levels before all-but disappearing until the last few levels, bridged with cube puzzles and♥♥♥♥♥♥While playing through the 20 or so levels that made up the main ""story"", which by the way sucks♥♥♥♥♥ all I could think to myself was ""wow, this game is a cluster♥♥♥♥"". A cluster♥♥♥♥ of puzzles. It's not put together the way Portal was. Portal was genius. Portal was all about portals and how many unique kinds of puzzles could be made with them. Everything always came back to using portals.Portality has all these ideas and it just throws them all at you at once. It's like you got drunk and picked up a chick you thought was way hotter at a club, then you wake up with her serving you breakfast in bed and asking what you want to name the baby before she goes dress shopping for your wedding.The feature that the game is named after gets shoved to the side for generic puzzle platforming that struggles to form a cohesive whole.It's a decent play, and has some good co-op features. It's definitely not a bad game. Off-brand Pringles are still Pringles. As long as they're not BBQ-flavored, they're still edible.It definitely passed the time, and there's a decent amount of content as long as you buy it on a sale when it's like 99% off. The game by itself regular price is 10 whole dollars. And that's clearly got to be some kind of elaborate joke, since I finished the game in a day and it wasn't even that great. It's not like it's particularly impressive graphically either. Generic Tron♥♥♥♥♥ polygonal♥♥♥♥♥piece of♥♥♥♥♥There really is nothing but the gameplay itself to look forward to with this game. The presentation is incredibly basic, all the way down to the ""Conglaturation! You have completed a great game!"" message you get for earning 100% in the main game.There's really no narrative or story to what's going on. You're basically ""an elite hacker"" that has to ""hack things"". And all of the cubes you throw around are apparently inside a computer. And when you beat the game it says ""thank you for hacking everything"". That's it. Whoever wrote the plot to this also wrote Obama's Russian hacker story. There were Russian hackers. And everything is their fault. The end.Portal had some solid lore behind it. This game ain't got♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can't even meme it. There's nothing to meme. There's no decent quotes. And a game without memes is absolutely worthless.Still, considering most of the stuff you find in the Steam dollar bin, it's not too bad. It's definitely functional, it's not 8-bit, and it has something of merit to look forward to, even if it's not exactly done as well as what it's copying.I honestly thought it'd be some cheap♥♥♥♥♥Tetris thing when I started it up the first time. All I saw were squares and thought ""well, this must be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle game"". But it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D puzzle game. That's nice.As far as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ discount games go, this is one of the best ones. They tried a little. It was good. I know most people only use Steam to play CS:GO, but if you ever think to yourself ""hey, I wonder if I can waste a dollar on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle game"", look no further.			"

												Entertaining Portal-like puzzle game, without the humour and story line. Only complaints are that the game is a bit short and that it could be a little bit more difficult. Expect a relaxing playthrough with some headscratching though. I personally finished the single player campain and bonus levels in under 2 hours, all 100%.There is a co-op mode and versus mode too that requires the other player to play with a controller, or you can both play with a controller.  It would be nice to also have the option to play co-op online with random people.It would be amazing if this game had a workshop that allows people to create and publish their own levels.			"

												Short summary of this review: This game tries to be Portal. It isn't Portal. Not by a long-shot.Graphics: Mediocre at best. I'm not a stickler for graphics, but what we have here is a few painfully generic primitives and lighting effects. I wouldn't mind this if the game excelled in some other area, but... well. At any rate, 3/10.Sounds: They don't stand out, but they aren't awful. I somewhat suspect they might be taken from a free sound library somewhere. Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't really wow me. 5/10.Music: It doesn't make my ears bleed. 5/10.Gameplay: Red block goes on red switch. Blue block goes on blue switch. Press Q to change color and pass through certain walls. As I mentioned, this game is trying to be Portal, but the core mechanic is extremely stilted. There's also the data packets which are hidden in each level, which feel like they belong in an entirely different game. About five levels in, I started thinking 'man, how long is this game???' which is never a good sign. 1/10.Story: An excuse plot, so I won't be taking it into account in the final score. N/AOther notes: Supposedly, Polarity is made for 'experienced gamers'. Each level is about three minutes long, and the only real challenge is finding the switch that you have to throw the cube at. Right.Overall score: 3.5/10. Clearly a first attempt at a game by an extremely inexperienced studio. It showed a little promise at first, but doesn't really do anything interesting at any point.			"

												Inspired by Portal with its own unique twists.Polarity is like Portal, but with hidden data around each level for you to find, some simple and others are a lot more tricky. The gameplay has its own unique take on the whole orange portal blue portal. You have red and blue, for negative and positive. You must use them in certain ways to progress maps and not die. Its simple gameplay and can be interesting if your lookin for more casual gameplay. No campaign or story, so if you care about that this game isn't for you.The game has bonus levels for when your done the main stages. They add some more difficulty and more mechanics to deal with. The full game can be completed in around 6 hours, more if your going for the full completion. I personally wouldn't spend 5$ on this game, but if you wait for a sale you can get it for 0.50$. Now thats worth.Personal Rating 2/5			"

												Pros-Fun-Intresting mechanic-Not entierly straightforwardCons-Short-Not the best music-Polarity isn't implemented as much as I think it could have been.-the floors that kill you are sometimes hard to make out from the ones that don't.OverallI would not spend ten dolars on this game. However I caught it at 90% off. If you can get it at a low price, then I highly recomend it. This game was very fun. The learning curve was decent. There were no times when I had absolutly no idea what to do, but there were one or two times when it took me a minute of looking arond to figure out what I had to do. I like how you can get to the end of a level, but realise you have not colected all the data, causing you to have to backtrack. The one complaint I have about this game is that there are not enough levels. If this game were updated to have many more levels, better music, a slightly steeper learning curve, and some voice acting, I would pay ten bucks for it. But for what I got at $.99, I feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												This game was alright in single player. It wasn't anything special, and not challenging at all. I burned through the single player and bonus levels with all of the data shards collected in just over an hour. Then we went through the coop in just over another hour with all of those shards. So 100% in around 3 hours. But my main gripe is that the game seemed to have trouble running smoothly in coop. I experienced frame lag all the time, and levels just stopped functioning. I had to play one of the levels 4 times because a platform wouldn't come down even without the power source. If you can get this game for bundle when it's on sale for under a dollar, get it only for Out There Somewhere. That game is amazing, while this is just filler to go along with it. DO NOT BUY THIS BY ITSELF OR FOR FULL PRICE!!!			"

												This is a decent puzzle game. It brears great similarity to portal. However I've got to say the puzzles arent near as clever and interesting as portal. I averaged about 3.5 minutes per puzzle and finished both the main game and the bonus in under 2 hours. I have not tried the multiplayer components though.I'll say it is pretty fun and somewhat interesting and well worth a few dollars for a short game. This may seem like a disservice to the developer who im sure put an insane amount of time into the game. Clever puzzles are really REALLY hard to make.

Posted: May 13, 2015
												This... this is the perfect type of game for giving an 'eh' or neutral review, but I can't.   It's such a quintessentially human act to try to confine judgments or opinions to pure dichotomies.  Steam.  Anyway!I do think that Polarity - or Portal without Portals, if you like - has a good, if fairly derivative, concept.  Essentially, in lieu of having a portal gun, one can simply change their own polarity, which manifests in either being Red or Blue.  Like colours pass like barriers, and this mechanic (sadly under-used) also applies to the transportable blocks which act as energy keys to platforms, doors and so on.  The player is required to synergise aim, timing and puzzle-solving skills, but the levels never reach that beautiful climax of having length, difficulty and multi-modal challenge in one playable experience.  Things just don't scale up in an intuitive or exciting way; I don't think there are enough mechanics employed  throughout and I don't think the mechanics used have been pushed to their limits.  The relatively short length of the game also contributes to this prosaicness, I think.The total lack of a plot hurts the game.  The data files that players can optionally collect as they journey through the database they're supposedly hacking could have been used to provide background -- why is this data important?  Who is hiring you and why?  Is what you're doing 'right', or does morality even matter in this situation?  Instead, we get a few throwaway lines about earning a bunch of credits and being hired by a company we know absolutely nothing about.   Another perhaps unexpected side-effect of the lack of plot is that, since quite a few levels look similar to each other, they don't really have enough of an identity in their own right.   When the mechanic is used as the Jewel in the Game Crown and it's great, a significant plot isn't necessarily that important... but it wasn't great here and the game really could have used at least more than it had.  The game works.  Movement isn't always smooth, and the camera was somewhat too sensitive in my opinion, but the puzzles all work as intended and they aren't chance-based.  This is good.  The blocks throw fairly well considering there's only one strength setting, although they don't interact at all well with walls and tend to clip poorly.  Having the choice to sprint is appreciated, and the mechanics are intuitive and make sense without needing much explanation -- over-explanation (or the need for it) is a flaw of quite a few modern games.  The graphics and sound are functional but don't excite in their own right.  I'll concede that the relative lack of interesting sound doesn't abjectly cripple the game, and I did enjoy the different coloured hues used in some rooms.  I just got a bit bored of seeing the same tiling in every room and think that even ambient music could have added contouring to the gamescape.  I don't have a gamepad, so I effectively can't comment on the co-op mode.  I wish that the co-op section didn't have achievements, but that's another topic for another day.  In summary, I'd say that it's a good base idea, but it's lacking in finesse, inspiration and length.  When you're selling a game devoid of plot completely on the mechanic and the mechanic hasn't been used to its full potential, it comes off as underwhelming.  It isn't Portal and it didn't grab me, I'm afraid, but it is an acceptable functional, working game.			"

												Basically this game is too short and easy if you are looking for a challenging first person puzzler. There's vibes of Portal and Qube with this red/blue polarity mechanic that can be found in fairly more competent titles like Outland or Ikaruga. Physics can get kinda bugged in places too, primarily cubes that can be moved might fall through moving platforms and get stuck around corners. This game feels more like a proof of concept than a concrete game. 20 very short levels for single player that you can finish in 60 minutes or so. There's some stuff for 2 players too. Its not a terrible game per se, just do not pay the full price for it. I'll give this one a no because it left me craving for so much more.			"

												Polarity is a short puzzle game which, (Like a lot of puzzle games) has you move cubes from point A to point B most of the time, using some kind of game mechanic.Still reading? Okay!In Polarity you are able to.. Switch polarities which is visualized by you changing between Blue and Red.This leads into some pretty straight forward thinking:Red passes through Red.Blue passes through Blue.This is what most of the puzzle will be based around with you using cubes to power things like jump pads or opening doors to progress and gets a bit trickier as you go further into the game.However here is the reason why I'm giving this a negative review:For as fun and interesting this concept is and with the possiblities it has.. The levels in the game itself are rather easy.This could be because I have played many puzzlers before but I think to even people that are new to games this may be pretty straight forward even for them.That is my biggest issue with that game, Not challenging level design.Though there are a couple more things that irk me:    -The visuals are pretty bad for a game released in 2014. (I did not check if this game existed long before the Steam release)    -There is not much music. Only a couple of tracks in the game that change every level but you'll hear the same track multiple times.    -Some things with the physics don't feel smooth or right.All these things can be negated though if this game was more of a proof of concept.Is this worth 10,99€ or your regional equivalant? Nope.. Though may be fun for a little bit. Also has co-op so you can enjoy a small game with a friend. Get it when it's cheap... Really cheap!			"

												This game has potential. It could be made into a great game like Portal and Talos Principle if it had a better story (instead of just about 5 lines of text telling you what the story is) and if it was better technically.It is extremely buggy. You'll fall through walls, you'll have the cube you're carrying fall out of your hands for no reason. I played the coop mode with a friend and what he tells me was ""it feels like a school project"". And he's right, it doesn't feel like a finished product, it feels like some prototype from 2008. There are a lot of strange design choices, from the ugly menus, to some objects behaving really strangely (like the fact that in coop, at the end of every level there are two spots to exit the level, and it won't end the level until the first player is on the left spot and the second player on the right spot, switching spots won't work) (or the fact that you can walk through gun turrets instead of having to dodge their bullets).Still, if you like puzzlers, you could still like it (I liked it, even though I don't feel ok recommanding it since it doesn't feel like a finished product). I don't think it's worth the 10$ they are normally asking, but if you can get it on a sale like I did it could still be worth it, but be ready to have your patience tested, not so much by the puzzles as by the bugs. It took me 3 hours to get through all of it (single, coop, bonus levels), but it could have easily taken me one hour less if I hadn't had to deal with all the bugs and weird design mistakes.			"

												It's actually visible on first sight that this game is from indy developers.Simple graphic, zero difficulty. It's an okay game for recreation, but not for any hardcore gaming or something like that. It tracks the level time, the amount of data collected... But I have no motivation to improve any of these. Frankly put, this game is, at this point, only mediocre. And while it's fairly cheap, it's also fairly overpriced. I can't imagine myself paying more than what I paid for this game (I got it in bundle of the bundles at 93% discount).			"

												I've only logged .2 hours of playing time on the game but in that time, I felt compelled to write a review.  I cannot believe anyone would not recommend this game.First let me thank EQ Games for the free code out of the blue in my mailbox.  I had purchased on sale two others of their games and I guess this was just a thank you for that.  So far this is my favorite of the three so I can thank them enough.This game reminds me of other puzzle games like Portal and The Turing Test.  Both games I enjoyed immensely (well all 3 since there are 2 Portal games) and this is a very enjoyable and relaxing puzzle game that makes me feel smart once I figure out the puzzle.  So far, the puzzles have been easy and I’m hoping they get harder however even if they don’t it’s worth the cost to play.  (Right now, it’s on sale for 90% off) You may want to wait till it’s on sale to pick it up but still worth it at full price.It even has a nice story line to go along with the FPS puzzle solving that is interesting to start off with.  Maybe not as deep as the previous two mentioned games but still enough to make it worthwhile for the play through.  I look forward to playing the game more and if anything changes for me I’ll be sure to update this review.Oh, and I should mention that so far it seems to have full controller support. "

												This puzzle game is very similar to the Portal games, except that in Polarity, you don't have a portal gun, you have the option of changing your ""polarity"" from blue to red, and red to blue. You must use your polarity changing abilities to maneuver abstacles such as lasers, gates, bridges, and more. For example, depending on the color of a laser, you either can get through it, or you cannot. If it were a blue laser, you would have to change your polarity to blue to get through, and if it were red, you would have to change your polarity to red.The story is a bit awkward, considering this game is an intricate puzzle game with blocks and jumping around, being a hacker trying to get data from a computer network is not a very fitting story.Another thing I wanted to mention was that for me, personally, the pricetag of $15 is asking a bit too much, as I would say $10 or less is a more reasonable price, but since I picked this game up during the 2015 Summer Sale, I cannot complain because I paid 19 cents.Overall, this is a great game, with puzzle elements similar to the Portal games, and other unique elements, but the price is asking a bit too much for what it is, and the story does not fit this game very well.I would recommend this game to anyone who wouldn't mind selling two trading cards for this 19 cent game (when it is on sale).

												so polarity is well just another game that tries to be like portal. however it is fun. now it sort of reminds of this stand alone mod for portal 2 in which you had to go trough test chambers without your portal gun. this is what me reminds me of that. still its a very good game i got it for $0,20 cause it was on sale. the original price might be a little to high for now i mean i didnt even play it for 2 hours and i completed the solo and bonus campaign. so a few things that could improve the game would be:Level editors:if players could create there own levels and share them with the community on the Steam Workshop it would improve the games replay value.Online Co-Op:now there is already a Local Co-Op but for alot of people who dont have a controller for their PC this could be well a let down. so something that could make it better is to have Online Co-Op so you dont need to ask a friend to come over to your house just to play this game togetherBigger story:Honestly this game is short its fun but short so ofcourse much more levels would improve this its just not fun now i finished it. so get this game when its on sale like at the moment (May the 4th (be with you)) its 20 cent. because at the moment its not worth 5 dollars/euros its not.Custimozation:so oke you play as a virus or something like that but that doesnt mean you can't have style. if custimozation was added to the game with unlockable and wearable items it would increase the replay value.I do however recommend it but not until a couple of updates past by and improved it theres still a few bugs and glitches that should be fixed. it honestly still lacks alot but it was made by a small team so i kept that in mind.Final Verdict: A Ghost in The Machine 6/10			"

I have not tried the multiplayer, so I don't have anything to say on that area of the game. I'm hoping more levels get added to the game, since I wouldn't mind loading the game back up to try something new. I don't  think it is worth $10 but was a good deal for when the Developer Alliance Bundle was on sale for $1.50. The single player portion of the game goes by way to fast to pay anything more.			"

												This game is a lackluster, it looks appealing on screenshots and promo video, but in reality you get tiny boring and simple levels with an exception of maybe 5-6  out of 37 that prove to be interesting.I've got 100% achievements in less than 3 hours, even did co-op levels solo, what proves there's no need simultaneous interaction between players, only one level required to manipulate both players at once. So if you're looking for coop puzzle, look for it elsewhere. And co-op is not online :)Can only reccomend this only if you want to get your perfect and completitionist score higher, and if you don't to then don't waste your time.			"

												It was a game I got for a dollar, and that's about what it is worth. It's a simple and nice game amde by some guy in the middle of the night. At least that's what I remember the game disclaimer being. It fully said that, and I enjoyed the dev ammiting this was just some side project he made. The thing is some shady stuff happened. I noticed there was an update for it today, so I went to check what it was. There were no new news, so I checked here. And, there's now bundles, which used to be nonexistent. I'm very sad that this stuff has happened. :C Welp, time to see the new ""update""			"

												This game has a cool concept, however the campaign and bonus levels are short and require no brains at all.  Maybe 1 hour max to complete all levels.  Multiplayer doesnt work cause it is local only... on a computer... pfft.  However for 19 cents, you might as well pick it up and get your hours worth.			"

												Wow, this game is bad. In every way. A friend gifted it to me, and after a few levels, I assumed it was some kind of special fundraising game, like a high school kid's senior project that was paying for his cancer treatment or something. Nope. It's an actual attempt at a professional game from a ""professional"" studio. They're trying to charge $15 for it.Have you played Portal? OK, imagine if you removed the clever basic idea, and substituted a much stupider and boring idea instead. (There are two kinds of walls, red and blue, and you can press a button to switch between one color or the other. Don't forget to press that button, or you won't be able to go through the right colored walls!)Now, remove the quality textures and lighting. Make the controls super muddy and unresponsive. Oh, get rid of all that profession voice action. Actually, get rid of all characters entirely. Yeah, just your third-person camera and some blank walls. That's the ticket!OK now hide the mission objectives behind some of those blank walls so that the player can't find them. No, not the red and blue ""polarity"" walls, that would seem like you're trying to design a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥puzzle. Just literally HIDE them where they can't be found unless a player goes searching along every single blank wall in the game in hopes of finding a hidden crevice where you stuck one.Voila! You have designed ""Polarity""!* Do not, under any circumstances, pay money for this game.* Do not buy someone this game as a gift, even if it's on sale for 90% off, as it is at the time of this writing. It is not worth $1.50.* Do thank your friend for the thought if they buy this game for you (it really was a nice idea!). Immediately delete it from your library. They didn't know what they were doing.-----Stage 8 gets a special mention for exceptionally poor level design. My GOD this game is awful.			"

												""Polarity"" is a first-person 3D puzzle platformer that has a few interesting mechanics. However, it suffers from a number of very visible flaws. The graphics are bland and mediocre. The music and sound effects are poor. The level design is generally simple and dull, giving players little motivation to explore the co-op mode or the bonus levels.Despite the description, this game is a far cry from games like Portal. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game even if it comes with some very cheap bundles unless you are looking for cheap sources of Steam Trading Cards.			"

												Polarity is a top down, third person, action, adventure, open world shooter game set in the beautiful country of england. In polarity the main protangonist has to go through endless chucky cheese arcades till he gets to the end of the country. In this game there will be possible gore if turned on in the settings and should be rated M for mature because of the emotional rollercoaster from both the story and art style of the game. The protagonist needs to follow the trails of cheese puff crumbs on the ground to find out who kidnapped his wife and why. The story is full of twist and turns and needs a solid heart yet brave soul to complete those who do not possess these qualitys will not have a fun time playing this game as the the feeling and joy behind the game is hidden in its story which I must say is breath taking. I dont remember a game that has made me feel the same as way as Roblox. What more do you want this game has a very well developed story with a heart breaking ending, graphics that rival next gen titles such as the witcher 3 and is a bang for your buck game.11/10 best game since Backugan Battle BrawlersEdit: Nov 23 2016 - Still best game I have ever played			"

												It’s not ground breaking or anything but just OK.Story:You’re a “hacker” that needs to collect “data fragments” in all the levels. Since when did we let Cave Johnson design security systems? IDK. Basically no story.Gameplay:It’s a puzzle platformer. Think portal except portal and more throwing blocks at switches. The puzzles basically involve launch pads, switches, and platforms. There is one component where you switch between red and blue “state?”. The point of this is that you can pass through walls of your own color but not the opposite. This is well used as it also incorporates floors and platforms meaning you have to really think about your next step. There are 11 levels + 10 bonus (why not just make the bonus part of the normal levels idk) so it’s short but It does have coop.Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game looks simplistic and the performance remains at 60 solid. The music is not bad as it never gets in the way and isn’t noticeably bad.Final Thoughts:Overall, it’s not amazing or groundbreaking but not that bad.			"

												My Rating7/10SingleplayerI enjoyed the full game and I feel like it would be fun to speedrun sometime too. You may need to backtrack sometimes because you need to collect 3 items called Data on every level. Longest time out of all the levels for me to complete was around 5 minutes and an average level took me around 1-2 minutes.Co-opThis game only has local co-op so I played it by myself and the last few levels were a nightmare because I had to use a controller and keyboard + mouse at the same time, still fun, but took me longer due to not having another friend though.Worth Buying?Get this when it is on sale! I got this during the Developer Alliance Bundle was on sale for $1.49 and I felt like it was a good bargain. For the actual price of $9.99, not so much (Perhaps if it were $2.99 or less?).			"

												While this game has a really creative concept, and i got it for sale in a $1.50 bundle, i still feel that 10 dollars is NOT worth the price for this game mainly due to it's length.It's, as the store description says, inspired by portal and it's futuristic FPS setting, where the mechanic consists of ""polarities"" (red and blue) that make you interact with different objects in the level, while finding 3 collectibles per level.The thing that ruins it is, first off, the length. I feel that considering how short this game is (i finished the singleplayer campaign 100% in a bit more than an hour) i feel that 10 dollars is not worth the price at all. I'd say that a price tag around $5 would make it better.Second off is the fact that it doesn't make much use of it's main mechanic.As the name implies, the main mechanic is the previously mentioned polarity. However, the game mainly consists of throwing and moving cubes around, with little to no polarity use, wich is dissapointing (I should also mention that polarity only affects 2 objects, lazers and hard light walls).Overall, i think that with a bit of more working around the main polarity mechanic, and making the levels longer and more complex would make this worth the price, but as it is now i don't reccomend getting this normally (On sale, however, it might be a good way to spend an hour or so)On the plus side, TRADING CARDS!

												Short little game with simple puzzles. Even though the maps are clunky made and cubes sometimes dissapear if you throw them at walls, its designed in a way that you wont get stuck. The ideas like switching colours to go through walls and power up ramps that let you choose which way they face have potential, but they dont get complex at all. It has a co-op mode, but only local. Not bad for a game made between work hours, even though it could benefit from the steam workshop.If you played portal and the like you can spend ~1€ to have 1-1.5 hours of cute puzzling.			"

Polarity is Garbage.I can't emphasize that enough. I played about 2 hours of the game and never made it past the first level. Here's my breakdown of the game:Pros+ Decent graphics+ Excellent time killer (if you have nothing else in your Steam Library that is)+ Cool IdeaCons- Super boring- No Story- No point to this game whatsoever- Controls are clunky at best- Game Levels feel identical- No actual 'Multiplayer' exists (Players must use the same computer to play together)- Everything elseSkip Polarity. You'll be glad you did. There are plenty of better puzzle games on steam, don't give the developer any more money (It'll encourage him to make more garbage like this).My Rating: 2/10 (Not Recommended; Avoid at all costs) "

												Mysteriously got this for free while registering some other game.  I hear this game gets around and with few achievements, I was looking forward to reviewing this particular title.I'm going to start by saying I respect what this developer was trying to accomplish AND that I enjoyed this title.  Polarity is Portal when you want to portal, but don't wanna portal enough to play Portal.  If GLaDOS wasn't your cup of tea, but you enjoyed the gameplay of Portal, then Polarity will continue your experience, only without portals and with a new polarity mechanic.Play as a nameless hacker and reach the end of the stage via color-cube / switch puzzles based on polarity of the cubes and of your own aura.  The story demands that you collect the collectibles in the stage, but you can enjoy the stages while hunting for the items later if you please.  The polarity mechanic is pretty fun and innovative.What's disappointing about this title, however, is that it's pretty short (About Portal's length of 1.5 hours if you're hunting the items).  There's also the aspect of the lack of ONLINE Coop, which some titles on Steam seem to neglect.  It has local coop, but I feel it's more fun to have an online coop thrown in.  Additionally, the cubes you get can fall through floors/walls and get stuck in cubes/walls.  These cubes have also been able to dislodge themselves from your grip as you land on some platforms.   My final complaint is in the ""Lift"" jumps.  Jump off a lift and you go propelling in the direction you're headed (moreso than you'd think, which makes it disorienting).In the end, I'll admit that I had fun.  Do I recommend it?  Of course.   Do I recommend it at full price ($10)?  No.  Wait for a sale, bundle, giveaway, or for it to conveniently find its way to you as it's been known to do.  I hear that it's had 99% off discounts before, so try to nab it at that price.  Otherwise, I'd recommend a price of about $1-2.50.7/10  Innovative and fun, but overpriced and in need of polishing.  Not as polished as Portal, but a nice substitute.			"

It was way to short of a game for 5$ but for 0.19$ not really mad. Not really interested in a replay of it, was fun while it lasted and if it is on sale for 0.19$ i say get it just cus its cheap as hell and it will be a good way to waste an hour if you want to. One last thing the ""co-op"" is not online, it is local and you need some sort of gamepad to play it.			"

												I should have read the comments before the purchase of this game. The comments all look like fake bots just to bring this up in good review. There is a reason this game is 0.19 cents. It's nothing but trash. I was hoping for a Portal alternative and the game would be good if it wasn't for the trashy mechanics in it. Nothing is played smooth, jump is a a joke. I spent more time falling off the edge and getting back up to get where I was at. Eventually I got to a point where I needed to parkour my way to a switch. After the time I spent trying to make 3 jumps, do you honestly think I am going to try 8 jumps? 0.19 cents is a good price to GIFT this game to someone you know as a joke so that they play and rage about the broken game. I rarely leave comments on games I have, lucky for you! >.>			"

The game is super easy, every level takes about 2 minutes to complete. It's basically just Portal with nothing but cube puzzles. It gets very boring very easily. I really don't recommend this game to anyone unless you're buying it for €0.19. If you want to spend a bit of money on a good puzzle game, just buy Portal.			"

												Shoddy Physics makes jumps way more difficult than whats even reasonable. Cubes can be thrown super far, which makes for good puzzles, if you can even FIND the targets. Not that Im complaining that the difficulty is too high, just that it doesnt really have a puzzle element and more of a ""run around like a chicken with its head chopped off"" kind of gameplay. You are lost for the most of the time after the first few levels, and then must deal with the phys engine dragging you away from platforms that you jump to.Considering that it was made by Amateur Developers, It is fairly good quality, but in reality its just difficult for reasons a puzzle game shouldnt be.

And since it was only 19 cents, a friend of mine got it for himself too, cause the store page said it'd have an online multiplayer. Unfortunately, that was very misleading and not true.			"

												For a game that cost me 0,20€ it is ABSOLUTELY perfect.I love the puzzles in the game, the movement isnt that bad, and the maps are actually pretty well designed, even though you can use glitches to just skip parts in levels.The game reminds me alot of portal, but just without the portal gun.Has achievements and stream trading cards, big plus from those.An actually fun cooperative mode that you can play with your friends (xbox 360 controller required) and can make up some pretty damn funny moments, especially if your playing it drunk with your friends like i did :DFun, challenging but not too hard at the sametime.4,5/5			"

My Experience and ReviewSo I picked this game up cheap- $0.19 and I must say, it's very worth the price. I had a lot of fun with this game, actually. This game is just like portal, except the puzzles are harder (imo) and you don't have a gun that shoots portals. This game focuses mostly on cubes and puzzling. There is no antagonist and there is no protagonist, you're just simply hacking into a system of some sort. What I really loved about this game is how original it is. The only real inspiration found here is from Portal and that's about it. The rest of the game is COMPLETELY original. This game takes more of a fast and jumping around approach and forces you to react quickly, otherwise you may have to restart the level. This game has lots of pros, but some cons as well, but it's kind of expected. Overall, I had TONS of fun with this game, but some of the issues the game had were very frusterating and distracting. It made it harder to play and made my playthrough very tough. Pros- Original game- Fast paced, in-your-face gameplay- No distracting elements (except for a bug I'm going to mention)- Thought provoking puzzles- Soothing and calm soundtrack (It really reminded me of Mirror's Edge for it's serene and mellow soundtrack)- Co-Op Campaign- Great visualsCons- Buggy- Experienced frame rate drops for a few seconds (c'mon, this game can be ran on a potato, it shouldn't have FR drops)- Feels like a game that failed Xbox's market- Unsupported resolutions (1440 x 900 and up isn't supported. I should know because that's my native resolution)Overall Rating/Conclusion7/10 - I'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't buggy and supported better resolutions. Since my resolution (1440 x 900) wasn't supported, I was lowered to 1366 x 768 and experienced a problem with the Steam Overlay and FPS meter. If I used my Steam Overlay key (Shift + Tab) and closed it, the overlay would still be remenicent on the black lines where the game isn't shown (on the outskirts of the game) and same goes for the FPS meter and any notification I get (messages, friends coming online, friends going into game, etc). This bug really upped the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥meter"" because it was VERY distracting and annoying. If these bugs and issues are fixed, I'd be GLAD to give it a higher rating because I think it deserves a higher one, it just can't be done unless these bugs are fixed.			"

												Can't make it very far into this game because there are some severe issues with the jump function for me.  Half the time, jumping works as expected.  The other half, the game makes the jump sound, yet I gain zero altitude and procede to run directly into the pit.Between that and a pretty serious crash I've had already, I cannot recommend this game.

												Polarity, a game that is deeply inspired by the Valve TM game Portal, but instead of doing the puzzles, you'll most likely be trying to find the data chunks that unlock levels. This is that kind of game, and the ways you get to some of these are far from me. I have not beat this game, so go and boo on me, but this game has beat me. I can not beat the game due to those damn Data Clusters, wait, sorry, that's from Saints Row 4, data chunks. The game does not want those of us who like gameplay to finish. This game is made for completionist people, who look for the collectibles. This game is not challenging like Portal, it does not have the comedy of Portal, and I know it is an Indie, so voice acting is almost a no, but a game that says it is based on Portal should live up to that, and this game does not. I need to wash my mouth out with a good puzzle platformer to get the taste of this out, so good day to you Sirs and/or Ladies. 3/10         Refunded			"

												Nice puzzle platformer, I guess it can be compared to Portal.It looks and plays fairly well, apart from occasional bugs.Took me 1.5 hours to finish all the single player levels so it's really really short, but if you can pick it up cheap, give it a go.EDIT: Played co-op, the levels are pretty tedious and not really enjoyable. AND it's local split-screen only. Still worth it to pick this up.			"

												this was a really short game but I thought it was entertainingit was entertaining because it had a portal vibe to the game though it had different mechanics. it wasn't a hard game that I can recall but difficult enough that I had to actually think for a little bit to figure out some sections but I never felt stuck at any point I also like the way the game looksI never tried the 2 player			"

												I saw this recommended on reddit gamedeals a while ago.  Since it was also 20 cents, I figured it was a must buy.  People described this as being like Portal.  I couldn't disagree more.  This is a puzzle game that provides no challenge; it is more walking simulator than puzzle game.  Imagine a walking simulator with no story.  It was so easy it was boring.  The mechanics of the game are not interesting.None of the collectables were hard to get, so I skipped some that were a long distance away because gathering that is not interesting, only tedious.  I reached a certain point where you needed X amount of collectables to move onto the next level, so I stopped playing there.			"

												From the description of th game:""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal. Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes.""Uhm... No. Some of the earliest levels of Portal are harder than this whole game. It takes about an hour to finish the single-player campaign. And then, if you have a controller, you may go for local co-op campaign.It's three o'clock in the moring (when I started the game) and I feel sleepy, yet every single level just passes by. You don't have to think much as you come up with solution in the first few seconds while you are running across enormoues empty rooms.You have to collect ""data"" In order to complete levels perfectly. The only tricky part for that is when you do not look behind some corner as these collectibles are scattered somewhat randomly around the course with no further challenge to getting to them.I bought the game during special offer for 0.99 EUR. Not worth it even for that price. Would go for a refund if I bought it for the whole price of 9.99 EUR.			"

												I am enjoying this game. Yes, it may be a Portal spinoff, but it is still fun and some of the levels are quite creative and not repetitive. The puzzles are fairly easy but still enjoyable. I like the music and find this game quite relaxing. I too am having some problems with jumping being unreliable (I have not checked the refresh rate), but to me it adds to the fun. Definitely worth the two dollars I paid. I have not played the coop levels.			"

												Ok, it's not Portal. Nor Portal 2, not that I own either. But its still a great game, that maybe should be bought on sale. The actual gameplay is about changing your polarity to go through barriers, or not fall through platforms. All while doing easy parkour carrying blocks that change parts of the level. Bet you've never heard of anything like that before. It may not be Portal, or worth $10, but it's a good game that doesn't deserve all of the hat it might get.			"

												I played all of the main levels and bonus levels and collected all the data fragments. I did not play the Co-Op campaign.This is a decent first person puzzler - you have a red and blue phases that you can switch between at will, and can pass through or interact with certain items depending on your color.  Move cubes to power devices, change the direction of jumps, and some other environmental interactions.  What's here is pretty good, if a little on the easy side.  But there's only 22 levels, which take 2-3 minutes each to get through.  And the game has very little personality.  Some of the puzzles are pretty creative but a number of the elements don't get utilized enough in the single-player campaign.  And the win screen is pretty minimal.  But all in all, this is a good short first person puzzler.			"

												It is a weird puzzle game, its like an alpha version of portal.. but without portal guns.The step sounds gets a bit annoying after awhile(feet walking sound)There are nice glitches in the game too.It is a short game and you can play this Co-op (which may look even shorter) This is local Co-op.The characters are really weird. Its a cube on a cube. No legs however just hovering.You can move ur head like u are able to do in minecraft( when u are moving ur camera very quickly in every direction)You have to collect data in each level and you need this to unlock more levels.There is no manual or help in the main menu or options. (like if u have forget to jump or sprint then u can search it to know it).You can play this with an xbox controller.You are able to grab ""puzzle cube keys"" through a platform.You should only buy this game if a huge discount or huge discount coupon. Otherwise it is not worth getting it. 3/10			"

												I wanted to recommend it, but I just can't. Polarity is too short. There's only around a dozen levels in the ""story"" mode, 10 bonus levels, and 3 floating green things per level to collect. If you can find someone to join you, there's also some local coop and versus multiplayer but it doesn't last long either.I will give the developer credit, it is a good concept. The way the entire game plays out, it reminds me of Portal in so many ways without feeling like a rip-off. For what it is, the game is decent.

												Everything about this game feels cheap. ugly sounds, the running sound is just segments of white noise and keeps going if you bump into a wall text tutorials explaining the mechanics, interrupting gameplay very buggy physics, cubes pass through things bad lighting in some places ugly menus uninteresting level design, it's immediately clear what you have to do collectibles are not even hidden or challenging to getMost of the time I fell down because platforms go from zero to top speed instantly, and then I had to walk a long way back up. They have a ""read me"" section in the main menu in which they literally apologize for this game. They could make this into a reasonable game if they replaced the physics, sounds, levels, and added an actual story. The idea could work.I paid 19 cents for it, which is about the right price.

												This game is super addicting. I love that each level is a puzzle you need to solve to move on. The controls of the game are fairly simple, which make it interesting and enjoyable to solve each level. The premise is that you are a hacker for hire and with each level cleared you are hacking the system. Will probably marathon this game and then replay to better my level time. I also like the sleek, dark, futuristic graphics of the game. Ran well on ""gorgeous"" mode (on an MSI laptop).			"

												*Good game, only buy if it's on sale.*Don't be fooled by all the thumbs up, as it's a rip off for the full RRP price. Compelted the main campaign in about 0.4hrs. It's not worth £6.99 in my honest opinion. So I'm not going to recommend off the basis of a RRP. If you get it on discount or in a bundle it's worth a play through but nothing to amazing here. As a discliamer I haven't had chance to check out the extra content yet, but to behonset if it's anything like the campaign just more levels I will bore very easily. I will update this review if that changes.			"

												This game is not worth $10. The bundle this game comes with is worth the same or less as the other games in the same bundle ($2). Why? Too short and too easy. I see this game as a missed opportunity or feels unfinished. Any previous criticisms this game got are justified. Luckily, I got this game on sale.Also the developers seem to have no real focus on the game. Local coop? Are you kidding me? On Steam? Should have focused on single player only. Coop would work for a game like the Portal series, not a game like this. Oh yeah, this game shouldn't be compared to the Portal series. DDOS mode is worthless too.Granted, I think this game has some redeeming factors. Rarely do I play a game designed in Unity that plays smooth. The assets must be simple or something. If the developers behind TRI: Of Friendship and Madness used their wall-walking mechanics in Polarity and puzzles were created like Polarity but better, I think we might have something special here. Those games being standalone however, bleh. Pass on both of them.			"

They should have variated the count of data-thingies IMO. It's also anoying that some were just needlesly far away or in places where you just see them when you fail which is hard in this game. But for 19 cents: meh. Kindof a timewaste. There are bugs like mapping bugs with the rotation (You can glitch out the world. The cubes fly through walls. And if the tutorial-screen pops up DON'T PRESS ESC the game totally gitches.) However if this is someones first game, and if he made it alone, then it's kindof a good start, but I don't think this is worth money.			"

												Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever. ((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.))features:Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system. Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters. Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality. Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor. Created mostly by one person. Become friends with all of the bosses! At least 5 dogs. You can date a skeleton. Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...? Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton. I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog. If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.			"

												-Third try reviewing Polarity-Indie, as it´s ment to!No, seriously.They promised this one to be one of the most fun puzzles since Portal. As the lastly mentioned one is one of my favourite games ever, I decided to buy this. (And because it was cheap.) In my eyes, the developers didn´t lie with that.To keep my review as short as possible despite including all information I will make a list for you.Pros:+Fun to play+Actually well made levels+Decent difficulty+New and interesting game mechanic (Polarity)+Achievements that aren´t out of place+Collectable obstacles all over the levels+Suitable sound design+Calm and motivating soundtrack+Full Coop-campaign+Didn´t discover any bugs so far+Takes some time until completation+In sale like every second week +Often available for 90% off or less in a bundleCons:-Absolutely horrible visuals-Graphically bugged surroundings-Missing textures at some parts-Irrelevant story which doesn´t make the game any better-Coop requires friend, be lucky finding someoneOne last thing I have to admit is, that the developers put a ""readme""- file into the options menu saying you ""thanks"" for playing their game. I am not sure about whether I should call this is awkwad or somewhat cute, but I would feel sorry for not telling the developers:""Here you are. A positive review for your game.""And to all others I´d be sorry not to say:""As you can see, I can recommend Polarity. If you are into puzzles you shouldn´t miss this. If you don´t need a game with beautiful graphics and awesome detail but with fun to play instead, here you go. If you have a friend to play the coop-mode with, this might also be worth a try. If you don´t identify with any of those persons then you can still buy this during annother mass discount.""Final score:4/58/1084/100			"

This game have 3 ""Gamemodes"":- Single Player Campaign- Single Player Bonus Levels (After you finish campaign)- Local CO-OP Campaign [this isnt online, is Local, 2 player on the same PC]The achievements are really easy to obtain, you just have to play the game the only 3 achievements that need you to work harder are the ones you need to collect data (""data"" is something you need to get from each map, and all maps have 3 ""data"")(BTW I got this game for only 0,19€ because he got a discount of -96% but after playing it is worth the 4,99€ it costs!)

After 3 minutes of playing into the game, I can feel on how this is based off Portal, but worse. Though I did speak negatively about it, it wasn't honestly that bad. The puzzles are ok and if you're bored and want to spend a few minutes of playing a game, this is worth it ONLY ON SALEdon't know why the devs would think that 11$ for a game that has graphics made on paint would be worth that much. Portal is worth less than this and it's 10000000000000x better. "

												The story and gameplay is lackluster, bringing almost nothing new to the table to keep it fresh. Each level feels similar to the last, and has a hollow sense of accomplishment. It's easy to forget the story even exists by the time you reach the one-note, pointless ending screen. The gameplay itself is god-awful, with incredibly wonky physics that accomplish such things as nearly breaking your screen from a decent fall, or shifting cubes across the stage when it's impossible to do so (rotating a portion of the stage also rotates any cubes that come from it, even if it's not inside said rotated area). The UI is clunky, poorly designed (Can't go to options without quitting everything you're doing), and the game looks ugly overall.The only redeeming factors I could think of would be its short length, which made it semi-bearable to finish, and its low price tag.

												The game obviously is inspired by the Portal series, but without much of a storyline the game gets boring after 30 minutes. You just find yourself doing puzzles without much backstory (you get about 2 sentences worth) or any progressive storyline. (I'm sure it's there, but I didn't bother to finish the game) The puzzles are fun but not enough to hold the game up on its own and I have no drive to finish the game because of this.			"

												""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal""... That is, if you ignore 80% of them. This game is bad, like really bad. The whole description feel way too pretentious, if you didn't noticed.The story is basically a sad attempt to put a goal for the characters. It's almost non-existent, and I pretty much forgot about it right after the third level.Level-design is really bad, bland, and don't expect challenges, unless for like 2-3 levels.Almost no indication on how certain mechanics works, which is a real pain. I spent the whole single player campaign on resetting levels when I couldn't get a cube before learning that you can click on the arrow to make it respawn.The only thing making the game really difficult, it's the number of bugs in it. Also, the physics. Jumping on a moving platform makes you go faster than the platform. Even when you don't want to move. There's a whole level about moving and jumping and a moving platform, and it's easily the worse level of it. Are a little selections of bugs: Getting stuck under platforms, between platforms, no button response, and the worse of it: while playing as Player 1, you can make player 2 drop their cubes with a mouse button. Like.. Why?Those co-op levels are a real pain to play with someone, it's way easier to do it by yourself with a keyboard and mouse + a controller.			"

												Pretty cool and fun puzzle game that reminds me a lot of Portal minus all of the portals.  Nice level design and solid controls.  I picked this game up on sale for 19 cents.  It's worth a buy all day long when on sale, probably only worth the full $4.99 USD price tag if you like this sorta game.Here's a video I made that demonstrates the first two levels and how the game plays:

			I snagged this indie puzzle game which offers Portal like gameplay on Steam in a 96% off sale this week at 19 cents! Is it worth the 19 cents? Well, this video should give you some answers.

												Not exactly your definition of a puzzle game.Me, and a couple of my peers got this game 90% off. I ended up paying something like $.50 for it or whatever, and for that price, it is somewhat worth it. So, what's the game like? Well... simple. Way too simple. The game really just consists of you, the player, running around collecting these ""data fragments"" and getting to the end goal. Maybe you jump up a lift, or activate a switch, but overall the package feels in complete. There are some ""puzzle"" elements in the game though. For one, you have a strange color changing ability (how original). You press a button, and you change from red to blue, or vice versa. Neat ain't it? Well again, this is mostly used to cross walls or bridges, it mostly is half-asses stuff that you're gonna forget. Also there are these colour cubes. Red and blue also, you chuck em across the map and they activate things... how fun and original. So how do you progress? Well as said before you collect these data fragments, which are placed around the map creatively... not really. In the easier levels you can find them right in front of you, and instead of solving puzzles to get to them, it's pretty much a scavenger hunt. Luckily they're almost always poorly hidden and easy to get to. There is a healthy amount of levels but you'll probably get through them in less than 2 hours. Co-op levels are very dumb, as they don't really give you an incentive to actually work together, and also it's local only, so in reality you can just complete everything yourself and just pick up the other controller and finish it. There is also a mode where you literally just chuck cubes in your opponents goal for 30 seconds or so, also local only.How about some positives? Well there is some at least. The game is very easy to run. Your grand-mums computer could probably run it well. The music is quite nice, and that's it. WOW. This game is very mediocre at best and it tries to be portal but it just ends up as some generic indie game that the developers spent 1 day making and tried to make some quick money off it. Don't buy it for $10 or $.50 because it's really just a waste of time. And a even bigger slap in the face is that the fact that they updated it two years after it released, and you expect a huge content update or something and all they do is add a couple of songs. Wow just f*cking great guys.Don't buy this, go buy a CS skin or find something else to waste your money on.			"

												Polarity's claim that it's ""one of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal"" is basically a persuasion to buy the game. It has dull music and graphics, although the concept is ""okay"" it didn't leave me with a jaw-dropping storyline or rather ""fun"" experience. Puzzles got old quick, and the cube glitched a lot and just disappeared when I threw it.And the price, I don't think the game is worth $9.99. Only reason why I bought the game was due to the Summer Sale (at $0.99). It's a pretty short game (good time waster), but I cannot recommend this to anyone who has $10 and looking for a game to buy.			"

												For 0.19 you can't really go wrong since it has cards,. but this is not a good game.Often you'll need to restart the whole level because of a glitch which:- Gets your colored cube stuck in a corner, - Stuck on a moving pad you can no longer reach, - Or on a jumping pad for no obvious reason. - Or even plain out disappear after throwing it, or falling a small distance while looking down.- Alt tab also does not properly re-catch the cursor.It's basically a simplified and unpolished version of portal, without the portals, but with many, many more bugs.Don't pay the full price for this game,.

												Before anything else I would like to state that Polarity is nothing like Portal.  If you want a puzzle-centric game that stands out for the genre similar to Portal then you should check out Mind: Path to Thalamus,  Anti-Chamber, The Witness, or the Talos Principle - all excellent in their own right and infinitely more engaging, stimulating and challenging.  Pros-Smooth gameplay-Graphics are decent and nice to look atCons-Very short (~1-2 hours)-Puzzles don't even feel like puzzles. They're more like common sense obstacle courses that require no thought.-Cubes in the game glitch out and disappear often.-No story whatsoever unless you count two lines of text before and after you finish, literally.I picked this up for like 1$ and it was painfully below average and unoriginal.  I played this simply to kill some time and was on my phone while playing because it didn't require much thinking.  I recommend avoiding it entirely and finding a puzzler that lives up to the genre.

I was asked to throw the cubes around... And my god... There was endless upon endless places they got stuck, and I couldn't find a way to reset them other than restarting the whole map, but I'm already on 6 of 10th puzzle in the map for crying out loud!RestartsAllright, pull your self together, it's a simple throw...I grab the cube and jump once... I see the cube no floating sideways away from me, and I can't reach it anymore...RestartsHmm.. perhaps that was some weird field I wasn't suppose to go near, *goes around* all of a sudden I fall through the floor, no ""death respawn"" or anything.. just falling...0/10 wouldn't touch again, glad I got the bills covered by selling the TG from the game...Remember this is just 1 of many peoples opinions.

Then there is always chloroform. It is less expansive. You can still have an adventure with her, but with none of the charm, personality and humor... This is what Polarity is.

You should buy Portal of you don't have it but if you do and have finished portal several times this is a good relaxing game. Have completed single player and bonus maps. Got all those achievements. Now there is not really a story or intro. And I restarted the level a lot because I did not know that you could click an arrow to get cube back			"

												Better than Portal, imo. I haven't tried the multiplayer or bonus levels yet, but the main game was a lovely experience. Getting to the end of the levels is easy, but collecting all the data can be a bit more challenging. I had some small execution issues of the sort that's to be expected when playing a first-person game with a controller, and I assume there wouldn't be a problem at all with mouse and keyboard.To the devs: Learn to make your platforms connect, and for your ramps to be smoother next time. Through most of the game it's a forgiveable annoyance, but it's very frustrating on the last level. Great game otherwise.			"

PLEASE NOTE BEFORE WE BEGIN!I ONLY suggest you purchase this game if it's on sale for $5.00 or less. While I did enjoy the game, it is by no means worth their $10.00 asking price. I rate the games I play depending on if I feel it was worth what I spent. I got this game for approximately $1.50 and feel it was worth the money. Puzzles!This game isn't a brain teaser. You won't spend hours and hours on difficult puzzles. The game flies by extremely fast because almost all of the puzzles are very straightforward and quick to solve. Which is good and bad, depending on the player. If you're like me, you want to be challenged and feel clever at the end of a puzzle game. You want to feel like you really accomplished something. This game doesn't give you that at all. This is more of a relax and play some easy puzzles with the SO when there's nothing on TV. In being relaxed and straightforward it does a very good job. The gameplay doesn't feel rushed and doesn't require a lot of concentration like Portal does. There are only two or three puzzles that actually require you to move quickly or decisively, the rest of the time you can just mosey your way through. Story!What story? I'm sorry, but that was pretty well pointless. I ended up making up my own story as I went along to make it a bit more interesting than a few lines of text at the beginning and end of the game. The Goal! I also couldn't figure out if the end goal was to finish the puzzle or collect all of the data nodes. It seemed like I could complete the puzzle just fine and then it wasn't until much later that I got a splash telling me I needed to collect X more nodes before I could go to the next level. For me, they were just the nodes on that level, so I'm not sure if it changes depending on how many I have or not. I guess collecting nodes is the end goal since it sounds like I can't progress without enough, but the game itself isn't very clear on that at the start since I finished a puzzle or two accidentally without all the nodes. Gameplay!Let's start at the very beginning. The Tutorial was a little on the light side. I don't know if I missed a bit of it or not, but you can click on the spawning spots for the cubes and it will spit out another one if you accidentally throw your current one out of reach. Like I say, I don't know if I just missed the text or if it wasn't there, but it was a key aspect of the game I missed out on for a good seven or eight levels before I accidentally stumbled across it, restarting the level each time I lost my cube. Besides that I suppose it served it's purpose. Told you how to move, pick up/throw, and the primary objectives. There were no ways to check/change/reset keybindings from inside of the game and NO WAY TO CHANGE THE MOUSE SENSITIVITY! Holy cow it was WAY too high for my taste and I couldn't seem to find a way to turn it down until I went into Razer Synapse and lowered my mouse's sensitivity manually. The keybindings for the controller were extremely awkward as well, and like I said, no way to change them from inside of the game itself. (It doesn't help that I usually don't use a controller.)The sockets where you put the cubes are buggy as all getout. Some of them will snag the cube from half the room away, some will only grab it if you literally hit it directly, and others will grab it and then drop it or pull it toward them and then let it go to fall into the black abyss and make you walk all the way back to the spawn for the cube. They're extremely inconsistent. For instance, on one level, you have to throw the cube across the room and hit a moving socket. I must have wasted a dozen cubes trying to get it. I would get it, and then it would just bounce off of the socket and leave me raging. I managed to hit it directly two times before it finally grabbed it.The way the cubes interact with the jump plates is also buggy. Frequently (35-40% of the time) the cube will literally just plop down on the jump plate and sit there. Then most of the time you aren't even able to get the cube back from the plate, particularly if it's a turnable jump plate, you'll just sit there spam right-clicking trying to pick up your god forsaken cube while the pad does a rendition of Dead or Alive's only good song.*The walls are made of tar. When you strafe into them or walk perpendicular to them when using a controller (Because I guess you're always strafing with a controller?) they will stop/slow you, like getting stuck on fly paper. They do the same thing to the cube, freezing it in place and yanking it out of your hands, frequently over a pit, next to a pit, or in a pit. ♥♥♥♥ing pits This might seem minor, until you find it happening constantly. It does ware on your nerves. I assume this contributes a bit to the lack of physics when it comes to the cube bouncing/rolling. When you throw it against a wall it's as if you threw it full force into a stack of pillows. The cubes also have a tendency to disappear randomly after hitting something hard (usually after falling a long distance.) In the end, to play this, you need to be relaxed. You can't be taking it seriously (as I was at first), because the little bugs will drive you absolutely batshit. Now for the good aspects of the gameplay!Throwing is awesome and it adds a good mechanic to the game, making it less of a Portal clone.  The puzzles were diverse enough to keep me interested. They weren't all carbon copies of the last, and the introduction to new mechanics every couple of levels made for a nice little changeup once in a while (Such as the Crazy Cube Color Changer patent pending or the rotating jump plates.) The variety (Red and Blue) of cubes added a small extra level of complexity, rather than a one cube fits all approach. If the creators were to do any more work, I would love to see green and yellow cubes implemented as well. The Sounds!The footsteps and music are extremely repetative. I muted all sounds after half hour and turned on some Devildriver. If there were more variety in the music and footsteps it wouldn't have bugged me as much. Co-Op!Before I get into the Co-Op. I did the co-op, all of it, by myself. I plugged in a controller and it took me about forty-five minutes. I did it mostly for the challenge and to see if Co-Op were as Co-Op as advertised. To be fair, there are four missions (If I recall correctly) that were genuinely difficult alone and designed to be done with two people playing. Most of the others were pretty well a solo run with a tagalong that would throw a block up to a high place once in a while. None of them really required any interactive coordination between the two players. Really the only time I would have needed someone were the levels where you have to avoid blocks/lasers at the same time. There were no OH MY GOD I'M GOING TO DIE IF YOU DON'T HURRY moments. OVERALL! It's a solid start for something that could be pretty cool if the dev(s) decide(s) to keep going and expand. But like I said at the top, I would only recommend it for five bucks or less, ten is a bit too much for an hour or two of entertainment. It's no portal. But it's better than most early-access ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that's on steam right now.* The song in question "

And if you watch for that to go on sale, you get 4 brilliant little games for $1.49, which is a FANTASTIC deal. Polarity is actually probably the most boring game in the collection.Polarity is a relatively short puzzle game where you move cubes and collect gems and shift polarities and gravity and stuff.

												To be honest, I feel kind of cheated since the trailer you can see in the store page shows some stuff that doesn't seem to be in the game, the game itself is interesting, has a nice gameplay and stands somewhat unique, I wouldn't say is like Portal... at all.I haven't played the co-op levels, but I was able to beat all the single player levels is less than 2 hours, so the game is really short and the full price seems way too much, however, the game goes on sale often, high sale prices as well.There is no story, well, they say you're a hacker and so on (but doing parkour has nothing to do with being a hacker though) and you only get pieces of story at the start and end of the single player stuff, considering this game compared itself with Portal I was expecting some nice story, not another GlaDOS nor anything like that, but at least some story...The gameplay just consists on using cubes to active stuff and progress on the level, the description says ""gameplay found in games like Portal, but is made exclusively for experienced gamers"", yet the difficulty seems way to low, I wouldn't call myself an experienced gamer at all, the game is just way too easy, a couple of trial and error here and there, but it doesn't turn really difficult.""You’ll need clever wits and fast reflexes"" is also a lie, as I said, some things that appear in the trailer do not seem to appear in the game (like the dropping part with the lasers), as I said, the game is really easy.I also found some bugs while playing, pretty much you not being able to step higher and getting stuck in a place, the cubes getting stuck while you ""recall"" them and they can also go through platforms they shouldn't be able to (cubes can no-clip).I'll give the game a thumbs up since it's still interesting and it goes on sale often, but it's way too simple for it's full price.

												Most of the negative reviews suffer from ""I don't like it because it's not Portal"" syndrome. But I think this is a really interesting game. While it does have some similarities to Portal, it is just an indie game and it isn't right to compare the two. I thought that this game was incredibly smart with its level design. Sure, a lot of the levels are not that difficult, but there are a few that really make you scratch your head (especially bonus level 7 and co-op level 9). I bought the game when it was on sale for $0.19, but I would honestly pay the $4.99 for the game.PROS-Co-op campaign has by far the best and trickiest levels; really fun to play with a friend-The regular campaign and bonus levels are fun. Most are easy to finish, but difficult to completely master (get all data pieces)CONS-Some levels are very easy, making the game kind of short-The DDOS Attack Versus mode was not as exciting as I expected-No online multiplayer (co-op or versus)Also just a helpful hint for controller input mapping - ""horizontal controller"" refers to the left analog stick (the one moving your guy) and ""vertical controller"" refers to the right analog stick (the one moving the camera).

												Let me start off by saying if I could give a ""neutral"" recommendation, I would.  Polarity's concept is really cool, if not 100% original, and it handles really well.I understand it's supposed to be in a sort of hacker-esque online setting, but there's a difference between computer-like visuals and ""plain"".  It would have been really nice to see some designs that look like the backs of computer chips.Now, about graphics.  I don't know how, but Polarity makes my Geforce GTX 770 graphics card have a hard time, but it can render Tera: Fate of Arun on max graphics settings for hours on end before it starts to overheat.  Honestly, I would have to applaud the game for that if nothing else.There wasn't a lot to dislike about Polarity, honestly.  The puzzles weren't too simple or too difficult, the controls weren't bad (except on a controller oh god why), and the  difficulty level wasn't stagnant between levels.  But even though there weren't a lot of negatives, there also weren't a lot of positives.  There wasn't a lot of story, there weren't a lot of unique gameplay mechanics (which isn't listed as a negative because it's really hard to do that nowadays), and the...You know what?  I'm tired.

												I got this game for free from a promotion of another game I recently purchased but I agree with some of the other reviews on here - its not worth $10 - my personal opinion is its worth around $5 for two reasons:1) The game is short - I did notice some bonus levels and alternate gampaly modes that could extend gameplay time.2) the graphics & gamplay mechanicss are simple - It almost looks like game made for practice. I noticed no real annoyances while playing and the gameplay was smooth.It is however worth purchasing for when you have an hour or so free and want a game that you can just pickup and play - bonus if it happens to be on special at the time you decide to purchase.For those who are concerned with playing video games with negative content - Violence / Swearing / Nudity for example - you can relax as there is none of that - the story is an excuse to solve puzzles and collect points by pushing the 'use' key on floating green crystal-like objects.

												It's very similair to Portal, in that you have to move objects strategically in order to procceed. It's simplified though, not as much use of physics, and not a lot of different surfaces or area/room types. However, it's cheap, and it's a fun play.			"

												Dont buy this game, its a knock off of portal and although has some new mechnics, they never realy go anywhere accept pressing a button while jumping through platforms. what realy irritates me about this game is that theres not 'reset    cubes' option, which it needs cause you have to restart the hole ♥♥♥♥ing level just cause u through one cube in the wrong place. and that would be fine if this game attually had puzzles that werent grab cube, put cube on block, get cube back, put on different block. it lacks any narritive or charm while you have to play hide and seek with green blobs that are allways just round the first corner you see, or obviously placed high up.

												4/10I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I'm just unable to get past its flaws. It's a fun little puzzle game, with nice level design, but suffers from numerous issues that would lead me to avoid recommending it.First off, this it's a really bad console port. The options are practically useless. I'm unable to change my controls, or adjust the visuals besides monitor resolution. The keyboard/mouse support isn't well implemented either. To make this worse, around one third of the game is the multiplayer campaign, which isn't even playable. The game only supports local split-screen. It has absolutely no network support, not even over LAN. This effectively takes out a massive chunk of the game.To top it all off, the game feels very clunky, and isn't terribly interesting either. You end up spending most of your time playing just trying to move around the stages, as opposed to actually solving the puzzles. This game could've been great, but because of the oversight of the developpers, it really doesn't feel like a complete game.			"

												A fun, quick puzzle game. You can easily beat the single player blind in under 80 minutes. However, the title is a bit misleading. Imagine if Portal was called Speed Gel. It's kind of like that. The whole polarity aspect is kind of a side note. It's barely used in the story mode, and only becomes part of the puzzles in the bonus levels. In story mode, all it's used for is making selectively usable floors and doors. The primary puzzle elements isn't polarity, but more the management of cubes. Swapping, changing, throwing, resetting, and putting them in receptacles that activate things. Sound familiar? Yup, this game is basically Portal without the portals, and gel replaced by a polarity function.Shame there aren't any achievements for bringing a cube to the end with you. You can do that in most levels.Also, bonus points for bonus level 6. Not only can you skip the entire puzzle with a sequence breaking jump; but if you miss that jump, you might fall out of the world by missing the deathzone in the pit.			"

It might look like a portal rip-off but its a good game unlike portal because there are no portals (no hate on the portal series i love the series it self but this game is not a portal rip-off even though it has ""companion cubes"" to help you solve puzzles"". 8/10 - I would play it again if they add harder puzzles for single play.

												I got this for free and I must say I am mildly impressed with what it is - It looks like it has been very much imspired by Tron and the level design with the contrasting neons works really well to make the game look good - I only played a few puzzles but i found them to be very intuitive with simple controls and some novel gameplay elements mixed with the classic platform action. It was nice to play a game where i didnt have to kill anything.Nice ambient soundtrack too. I'll update my review at a later date - but first impressions are if this game is going cheap then buy it - I would probably buy a game like this anyway as long as it wasnt over £1.00			"

 TL;DR It's a pretty solid game with the few exceptions of bugs and painfully simple puzzles The game is pretty much a straight rip of Portal, but still enjoyable at times the game has many ""borrowed"" (Borrowed being the more generous term) mechanics for Portal ie. companion cube-esque puzzles, avoiding laser on a moving platform, etc. However, the game still makes for a fun and light puzzle game to pass an afternoon, but don't expect it to take up too much time. At this point, I have beaten this game (including bonus levels) with just over two hours, and I don't know if I really want to invite some on over to play the co-op missions(no online co-op). The game is sprinkled with a few bugs that were not really unexpected from a small indie dev, but can be annoying none the less (ie. clipping issues with cubes or cubes just straight up disappearing).Overall, if you're looking to  play  a first person puzzle game that comes with some real challenge and story, just pick up the portal bundle. However if you're just looking for a way to throw away a few hours on something sort of challenging and fun, and this game happens to be on sale, why not but I wouldn't recommend paying the full price, I mean I got it for free.

												General Pros:To be fair, it's not a bad game. The gameplay is solid, the physics are mostly solid (excluding bugs), the graphics are a bit lacklustre, but are generally clean and consistent, it has trading cards, it's a good time and the game goes on sale enough to be worth its sale price. I would only buy this game when the sales go for 3$CAD (2.50$USD) or under.General Cons:Why so many negative reviews? Sketchy devs, graphics problems, frame rate issues, general bugs, uninteresting story, very easy, no replay value, general mediocrity and no online co-op. For more information, read some negative reviews.Why the up rating:I actually enjoyed the game for the price I got it at. The single player is generally quite easy, but there was enough challenge to keep me interested for casual play. The co-op is a good time if you have the controllers to do it. It's well designed and harder than the single-player levels. If you're looking for your typical impossible puzzle game that feeds the weak to the gods of ""online guides"" with tons of levels ranking up to an impossible difficulty, go somewhere else. It's a rather short game that's fairly easy to complete. It's too short to get repetitive, but long enough to get engaged in. I personally like this style, but it's not for everyone and thus, I'm recommending it, but not for everyone :D "

												With a puzzle structure similar to that of the ""Portal"" nature, it is easy to see this game as a rip off. Although, it is very much it's own game. having being built by a very small team as a hobby, it is obvious that this is not going to be a AAA title. But it's not neccissarily bad. A few object placement errors here and there, and fairly basic gameplay does not make a bad game. Also, both of these can be fixed with a bit of time and an update.The first half hour playing this game, the only frustration I had was a small one at that; The constant tutorial popups. They just got slightly annoying, but tollerable. Other than that, I found the game to be playable and enjoyable. Like I mentioned, the game has a portal-like puzzle structure with similar mechanics, but they are not completely the same. Overall, considering the small dev team and the time put into the game, I would say the game is really not bad. It's a fun, entertaining little something to do that passes time, which, for a small indie puzzle game, is all I expect it to be and do.I have recieved this game for free as a gift from te developers and I am appreciative of the free game. Thanks guys!			"

												To be honest, this game is pretty good, I enjoyed playing this game. The graphics are nice, nice sountrack and good physics, even though there are some bugs and glitches. The puzzles however are really simple and the storyline is really short, I managed to complete the storyline in just 1 hour. I think this game is not worth buying at a price tag of $9.99, I bought the game for around $0.50 in a TF2 trading website. I think the game should be improved by adding a lot more levels and fixing the bugs.I would also recommend this game only if summer sale is happening where the game is only 20 cents or something.

This makes some levels a bit frustrating.-EXTREMELY easy game - even the most ""challenging"" levels only take a couple minutes to finish. Several of the data (the things you collect each level) are in plain sight or hidden in painfully obvious hiding places. There is little to no challange in the puzzles. Overall, I thought the game was enjoyable but definately not worth $11. I did not play the coop or vs modes, so perhaps these modes give some extra worth. I bought it on sale so it was dirt cheap. TL;DRBUY IT IF IT IS ON SALE, DON'T BUY IT IF IT IS NOT ON SALE			"

												This is an interesting title and will pose some difficulty to complete. It has an aura of Portal series about it although using much simpler graphic engine and story line. Still I have to give credit where its due and would be interested to see Polarity 2, using a more modern graphic engine behind the game and a more complex story line. - Recommended for all			"

If it is on sale, definitely pick it up!  One note however : If you have a monitor that supports >60 hz, you will need to set it down to 60 or else your jumping turns into a game of chance :)			"

												To be honest, I feel kind of cheated since the trailer you can see in the store page shows some stuff that doesn't seem to be in the game, the game itself is interesting, has a nice gameplay and stands somewhat unique, I wouldn't say is like Portal... at all.I haven't played the co-op levels, but I was able to beat all the single player levels is less than 2 hours, so the game is really short and the full price seems way too much, however, the game goes on sale often, high sale prices as well.There is no story, well, they say you're a hacker and so on (but doing parkour has nothing to do with being a hacker though) and you only get pieces of story at the start and end of the single player stuff, considering this game compared itself with Portal I was expecting some nice story, not another GlaDOS nor anything like that, but at least some story...The gameplay just consists on using cubes to active stuff and progress on the level, the description says ""gameplay found in games like Portal, but is made exclusively for experienced gamers"", yet the difficulty seems way to low, I wouldn't call myself an experienced gamer at all, the game is just way too easy, a couple of trial and error here and there, but it doesn't turn really difficult.""You’ll need clever wits and fast reflexes"" is also a lie, as I said, some things that appear in the trailer do not seem to appear in the game (like the dropping part with the lasers), as I said, the game is really easy.I also found some bugs while playing, pretty much you not being able to step higher and getting stuck in a place, the cubes getting stuck while you ""recall"" them and they can also go through platforms they shouldn't be able to (cubes can no-clip).I'll give the game a thumbs up since it's still interesting and it goes on sale often, but it's way too simple for it's full price.

												I liked solving each puzzle in each map, each level was different from the others which gave it that challenge. The levels last a couple of minutes at first but do get harder as you progress to end up taking around 10 minutes or more. The levels concist of using these blocks that could be called energy orbs to function platforms and make things work/move to get around the map. You need to collect these data objects which each level has 3 inside them, each data object is either hidden or there is a puzzle challenge to get to them such as changing the colour of a enery source because a slot is a different colour needed to make an lift function which can take you to that data object. When you've collected the data objects then you can make your way to the end of the level ready for the next one. I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles as they weren't too hard. I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This game, although it may be a cheap alternative to the Portal franchise, does not live up to my expectations. It has potential and some great ideas, but the game creators do not utilize these ideas to their fullest. The game introduces a new mechanic, and then when that mechanic is used to perform a basic task, onto the next mechanic we move. The whole game feels like a tutorial because only one level (one of the bonus levels) required the slightest bit of strategic thinking. If more levels were added that utilized more than one mechanic per level and had the mechanic in a more complex situation, this game would become much better			"

												Polarity is a First-Person, Indie, Local Co-Op, Puzzle, Action Startegy game that is similar to the Portal franchise, so you already know that this game is going to be good.Polarity is a game where you need to get to the end of the level. But, you need to collect all three of the data, which are hidden through out each level. Like the Portal franchise, you need to think about the level, and try a few different ways of tackling the level. There is also a local Co-Op. Yes, I said local. But, the Co-Op, like in Portal 2, works well. And, it's a great edition to the game.Overall, this is a pretty good game. I would recommend the Portal franchise over this, but, this is a good game, and i still recommend it to anyone who wants it,			"

												This game isn't great.But it's not terrible, either.It sits quite firmly in the 'good' category.I had fun playing it, but it's fairly short, and not all that difficult. Still, the platforming is solid, the controls are fine, and the puzzles are challenging enough that you need to pay attention to the game, but not so much so that you really have to work yourself to solve them.It's a good relaxation game; good for taking your mind off stuff that's troubling you, without adding any stress on top of what you've got.There were a couple minor bugs, but nothing major. The collisions just went a bit wonky in a couple places.There isn't enough here for me to recommend it at full price, but if you can pick it up on sale (I got it for 21 cents), then definitely grab it.Unless you hate puzzle platformers, in which case you probably won't like this game.Because it's a puzzle platformer.

												Disclaimer: My first 'proper' review of a game.TL;DR:  Concept and potential is there, execution is lacking. Overpriced. Not actually a puzzle game.Pros:ConceptGame MechanicsSprinting (Timesaver!)VisualsCons:PriceBad execution.'Puzzle' game.Buggy. (Clip through platforms, cubes getting stuck, cubes randomly resetting.)After completing the singleplayer with all collectibles, and as much as I would love to recommend this game, I just can't. Don't get me wrong, the concept for this game is amazing and the potential is there if they want to expand on it.PriceIt's just that for €11 you aren't getting what you paid for. The length of the game, even when getting all collectibles and completing all the bonus levels (apart from co-op) is just over an hour. I would definitely recommend this if you could get it for <€3, but any more is just not worth the €/hour value.ConceptNow for the concept, the idea and potential in the game mechanics is great, but the execution is lacking. Quite a lot.The game reminded me a lot of Q.U.B.E. mixed with Portal. The visuals are kinda similar to these two games, and the game mechanics for the 'puzzles' have some similarities to these two games. But they just fall short in the puzzle department. 'Puzzle' tagAfter playing through the game it's more like a platformer/cubethrow than a real puzzle game. The only real puzzle element in this was finding the place to place/throw cubes at. After you found those it was all just platforming to the end of the level and onto the next one. Occasionally you would miss a collectible that you'd have to look for, but most of those you would come across regularly, or find when you would miss a jump. There wasn't a single moment in the game where I had to think about what to do in the level beforehand, it was all just look for the cube and the platform to put it on to advance.VerdictMy final verdict for this game would be a 4/10. I encountered too many random bugs for it to score any higher, from me clipping through platforms to my cube just randomly resetting when I was trying to use the launch pads.			"

You have to give some of the puzzles a little bit of thought, but its not overly complicated.I experienced a few FPS drops, but it was never too bad, and never lasted for very long.Do not expect portal 2 quality. I'd say this game is about a third of the awesomeness that portal 2 is.The game is also pretty short, which is quite sad, as I enjoyed it alot and wished it would continue for a while longer.It's not really  worth the full price in my opinion. So if you want this game, try to get it on a sale :) "

I couldn't play Co-Op yet, but I don't expect it to be radically different from singleplayer - for better or worse.The game does lack a little polish. Some elements are not explained, controls feel a little odd, etc.All in all it's a great indie puzzle game			"

												Polarity took my favorite mechanical portions of the Portal series and made an entire 38-level experience. I loved this game, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I went into it kinda guilty since it was only 0.21CAD today, but holy crap I got more fun out of those cents than I've had in quite a while. At 5 bucks for the original price, this game is definitely worth it.Just finished 100%ing and perfecting Polarity alone, despite all those coop levels. The coop levels get so difficult later on, even playing with 2 players. Local coop only, btw.Polarity is definitely a great speed game. There's a lot of speed tech I discovered in this session. I can't wait to take them to the test and speedrun it.So, yeah, 10/10 "

												This game reminds me of portal in a way without the robot insults ;) It has decent graphics especially for its price, and it features a local co-op mode. A suggestion I would make is that the developers add a multi-player over lan/internet option to play with friends but its up to them. Also adding more resolutions would be nice. :) There were a couple of bugs such as falling through the floor on a few co-op levels and cubes appearing in the wrong places but even with the small bugs it is still well worth its full price. Get it while you can as it is 96% off and worth every cent :)			"

You can't really compare that to a full fledged game, if you approach it like doing some Sudoku or crossword you will get quite some fun out of it: Think a little bit, Stay a little bit engaged, Kill time...Disclaimer: I paid 19 cents for the game and that made it immense value for me - I would go for it in a bundle or <2 bucks... Otherwise I think you can get more entertainment out of your money over here!			"

												Polarity is a frequent target of outlandishly-good Steam sales. In theory, it goes for five dollars - already a low-risk investment - but in practice, you can generally pay more for a stale gumball than a copy of Polarity. I thought about typing this entire review without one reference to Portal, but the comparison is unavoidable. As a first-person puzzle-platformer that achieves diversity in level design without throwing too many game mechanics into the mix, Polarity succeeds in many of the same ways that Portal did, albeit on a much smaller scope. But to consider Polarity a decent poor-man's Portal is to do it a disservice. By utilizing a mechanic that is less visually jarring, Polarity makes similar gameplay more accessible for casual gamers, and while it is an easy play-through for most gamers, it provides solid and balanced entertainment throughout.I don't think the premise can be laid out any more clearly than in the first sentence of the game: ""You are a hacker."" Lucky you. Supposedly, you travel a mainframe seeking out protected data for the agency that hired you, but a more-salient way to look at the objective is ""Pick up the green glowy things and get to the end of the level."" Each level has three bits of data, and while you can move on without collecting all three, the game does acknowledge 100% completion. Generally speaking, the data aren't too hidden, but it is worth it to explore the big, open rooms that comprise most of the game world to see what you can find.In Portal, you used the titular portals to play with basic physics to complete levels. In Polarity, the concept is much simpler: you switch yourself between two color ""poles,"" red and blue. The levels contain structures made of red and blue light. When your polarity matches, you phase right through the object; when your polarity does not match, it is as solid to you as the room itself. Alternatively, if the object is a laser and your polarity does not match, you die. Challenges sometimes require changing polarities while in motion, and even while in free-fall, so that you pass through one object but not another.The levels also include red and blue Not-Companion Cubes. (I am a masterful and original comedian. Nobody has ever made that observation before.) These cubes are subject to the same rules of polarity that you are, and they can also power platforms and other machines when placed in circles with outlines of matching color. You are not able to directly change the polarity of a given cube, but there are green windows through which you can launch the cubes to change them. Occasionally, you will come to obstacles which you can pass through, but which your cube cannot.The gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the sense of size and scope is nice. For levels that are largely wide-open rooms without too many moving bits, I was worried that after a time they would feel bland and empty, but instead I often had a sense of awe, looking to platforms three stories up that I knew I could find a way to. I did, however, want more from the cubes. In most cases, the cube was simply a proxy for a button or switch, and I felt like more could have been done with switching the polarity of individual cubes, or getting a single cube to help you in multiple ways.Ultimately, the game is a success, providing a short journey through a world that needs little explanation, gives adequate time to learn the mechanics, and increases the challenge as you go. By the end, it is perhaps a bit too short and a bit too easy, but even if you breeze through all of its main and bonus levels, it provides entertainment along the way. Well worth the five-dollar price point - and if you find it at a discount, do not hesitate.			"

												I only paid US$0.20, and for that I was entertained. The graphics are simplistic, there's only one in-game music track, but it's a fun short game nonetheless. The levels were a little too simple, with obvious solutions -- and I ended up completing the game by accident.Near the end of ""chaper 1"" I was told I needed to complete the last level to unlock ""chaper 2"", except there *is* no chapter 2. Finishing the levels in chaper 1 gives you a text-only cutscene before dumping you unceremoniously back at the main menu. Apparently this is by design, although I'm not sure if that means more levels will come later or if what you see really is all you're supposed to get.Overall recommended, but only on heavy discount.

The base 'storyline' puzzles were quite simple however the bonus puzzles are where the challenge shines. The bonus levels really bring out the unique mechanics and gameplay that gives this game it's positive reputation.Overall this game is one of the rare games that's worth it's full price. It's slow to start but has enough conent and end-game challenges to make it a worth while purchase.			"

												According to the level select I've collected half the data points (half way through the campaign) at 0.9 hrs.  This is not a hard, or indeed, long game. especially if you have spent any time with Portal.  Still, it has been a fun romp.  It's definately been worth the heavily discounted price I paid, perhaps even the full $5, especially if I can find someone to play co-op with.The only complaint I have is that you can ""lose"" cubes by throwing them onto ledges where you can't retrieve them.  Then the only solution is to restart the level.  Other then that (and the general short/easy nature of the game) it's a pretty fun experience.			"

Worth every penny (I mean that 0.54 euro in sale).Polarity is something like Portal, but in my opinion it is much much easier.If you want try something logical, but not something too much hard. Try Polarity.I am forever alone. I done COOP levels alone, just because I wanted achievements :'( "

												The physics are horrible, your character falls way to fast, and objects almost don't at all when thrown. And it has the physics effect where when you jump off of a moving object, you keep moving with it, which is a problem when you're trying to jump onto thin floating pathways. The game is very short, and the puzzles can hardly be called puzzles. The hardest thing about the puzzles is finding all of the cubes to continue, and then I get to the end of what the call the single player campaign and tell me I need to find 11 more Fragments to continue. I didn't realize I needed fragments for anything but the trophies, so it's trying to get me to play through the entire campaign again to collect all of the fragments (which aren't challenging to get) to continue through the campaign it says I beat? There is also no voice acting, so there is no reason to want to keep going. If you want a fun puzzle game with better graphics, better physics, and is cheaper, go for the old Portal flash game. Its more rewarding, difficult and polished.Polarity is like if Portal didn't have portals or good physics. Just cubes.I want to give it a bad rating, but its much better than what squeezes out of Greenlight now, so I'll give it a 4.5/10.			"

												I lost interest in under an hour. The puzzles are far too easy, and the difficuly curve is stagnant if it even exists. I may come back and beat it,  and I'm still glad I bought it, but If i had paid the full $10.99 for this I would be extremely dissapointed. I would recommend buying this game if it were under $2, and if you prefer relaxed puzzle games.Why is there a run button? I feel like no one wants to walk, but it was just added because a lot of games have one. The areas that make you run/jump and change colors require 4 key presses, shift being the most awkward, as though I'm playing twister with my hand. just make the player always run. Sometimes I'll throw a box at the wall to grab a data fragments, and the box goes through the wall. Two things here: data should be collected on contact, secondly, fix the wall glitch.I'm not a fan of the use and design of the UI. The tutorial buttons pause the game, almost always when I was in mid jump, for the first message, I had just happened to be clicking right as it popped up, and accidentally closed it after it showed for a 10th of a second. I never got a chance to read it. they should really just stay up, without pausing the game, and dissapear after a few seconds. lastly, I don't like that a ""next level"" button appears at the end, would be nicer if it just went to the next level.The game has a confusing optional yet kinda required data collection, side thing. I say take that out entirely, and force the player to do every puzzle. This would remove the need for back-tracking, level selection, and all of those things that break the immersion of the game. Most of the data finding added nothing to the game, other than make me bored whilst checking nooks and crannies. Only a few data hiding spot added some fun, and you might as well just work those into the mandatory path of the level.Story was non-existent, normally I don't care, but, it's just another example of how the game aimed low in all areas except... technical implementation: the game is almost bug free; It handles pretty well. The only bug I saw was mentioned earlier, Nothing else really annoyed me, outside of the game's design.Keep at it, and try to take more risks. It's a neat concept that can lead to a really great game, but it just needs better level design			"

												I'm recommending it on sale. It's a good game, like a Portal spinoff, but the controls are a little clunky. More reminiscent of QUBE than Portal, really. The running and swapping colors is very fluid, but the sections with the slow moving platforms had me rocketing to my death like I'd jumped off a speeding car. Other than that, nice and relaxing puzzles.			"

												One of the most fun puzzle games I've played. Gameplay wise, it's more fun than Portal. It has a lot of bugs and a few of the mechanics aren't fully explained (like being able to respawn cubes!) and sometimes stuff breaks and you have to restart the level, but even taking that all into consideration it's well worth playing.Ignore the time played, the steam overlay seems to crash after a few minutes while in-game.

												For me Polarity felt rather mediocre. The main innovation, the polarity of things and your character is a nice idea, which in my opinion could've been taken much further though. The game also feels rather unpolished at some edges. And the entire game with all achievements can be finished in 4 hours, which feels rather anticlimactic. In the end I think the game is okay but you might even want to wait for a sale on this one, considering there are other games which give you a lot more for the same price.			"

												I stopped after my first play session since it was way to easy to get stuck. It got annoying having to redo levels over an over. If you have to trow one of the cubes and it doesn't land exactly where it  has too, you have to restart. If you jump before bringing something you need later there is no path back all you can do is restart the level, and even though at least to begin with the levels were short, it got repetitive and boring having to redo levels very fast since the story wasn't interesting/not there much.If you want a Puzzle game of this type buy Portal and Portal 2, they got a long story and you can't get stuck.

The game is very good for Youtubers because it is easy to commentate as you can't be interrupted by narrarators. At the same time this can be a bad thing as it is not a story depth game. Another thing I don't enjoy about it for a puzzle game is that to unlock levels you must get hidden currency not just solve the puzzle. This game is a 7/10 I think.			"

Only a few data hiding spot added some fun, and you might as well just work those into the mandatory path of the level.Story was non-existent, normally I don't care, but, it's just another example of how the game aimed low in all areas except... technical implementation: the game is almost bug free; It handles pretty well. The only bug I saw was mentioned earlier, Nothing else really annoyed me, outside of the game's design.Keep at it, and try to take more risks. It's a neat concept that can lead to a really great game, but it just needs better level design			"

												I'm recommending it on sale. It's a good game, like a Portal spinoff, but the controls are a little clunky. More reminiscent of QUBE than Portal, really. The running and swapping colors is very fluid, but the sections with the slow moving platforms had me rocketing to my death like I'd jumped off a speeding car. Other than that, nice and relaxing puzzles.			"

												Decentish puzzles at times, but the data fragments feel more like a scavenger hunt slapped on top of the puzzling.I see no reason to have a sprint button, when you are pretty much always going to sprint anyway (give my shift key some rest man)The puzzles so far as I've seen them are rather obvious (unsure of later levels, but the difficulty did increase a tad), and will often involve dexterity/aiming challenges. It is also possible to get yourself stuck in some of the levels.Good enough game for its pricepoint, but don't expect wonders of puzzle design.			"

												It's a pretty short game (finished the main story and first three bonus levels in a little over three hours), but it's a lot of fun.  The graphics are easy on the eyes, simple, clean, and aesthetically appealing.  It's not a difficult game, which I found refreshing after stuggling through the last painful level of A Story About My Uncle.   Each level is short, takes about ten minutes or under for each one, which is nice if you're not looking for a super lengthy gaming session.  The only complaints I have are that turning around seems to take forever (you just pan and pan and pan), and sometimes the physics for the blocks are a little weird.  I had a block get stuck in the floor more than once, but the recall block function makes up for this shortcoming.All in all, a quick, enjoyable game.  Made me happy.			"

												Fantastic little puzzler. Nothing too taxing on the brain, but attempting to find all of the data packs (there are three of them hidden in each level) can be a real challenge and the idea of polarity-switching is used to good effect. The similarities to Portal are well-known at this point; you find yourself in a sleek, enclosed environment and use your wits (and cubes) to reach the exit. If you enjoyed Portal, you'll enjoy this, but it would be doing the game a disservice to call it a Portal clone; it has its own ideas and systems that are well thought-out and smoothly executed throughout. The game is void of any real plot or humour, but those things aren't needed here. It's a simple little game and quite a relaxing way to flex your puzzling muscles for an hour or two, without any extra baggage forcefully added on. I've not been able to enjoy the co-op campaign just yet, but if the singleplayer is anything to go by then it must be a lot of fun. There's certainly potential for a sequel here and I hope to see more from this developer in the future.			"

												Pretty unpolished game. Texture errors/level layout bugs resulting in  needing to jump over inch high bumps in the ground that honestly should have been caught if the creators played through their game once. Some mechanics of the game don't work particularly well. For example, the boost mechanic doesn't have great programing resulting in not hitting a boost or hitting it and going too far. Also short, I collected all the data in under 2 hours, which isn't even necessary for solving all the puzzles. I'm glad I got it on sale because I don't think 2 hours of game play with no replay value is worth $5			"

Polarity which i bought here on steam for 19 cents on discount is really a cool game. I enjoy playing it and it made me want to check out the portal franchise for the first time. The downside of it all is that the game makes me feel sick after playing for a while but the graphics are clean and runs really well even on my intel hd 3000 mobile. I recommend you give this game a try.			"

												This game could be great, but instead it's mediocre at best. The titular gimmick (being able to switch between ""Red Polarity"" and ""Blue Polarity"") is very rarely used for anything besides bypassing certain gates, the game is very boring since you don't have very many characters to talk to you throughout the game, you don't have much of a goal, and jumping is a crapshoot if you're playing on a computer. I bought the game when it was on sale for $0.10, and I can certainly say that I got my money's worth back, and I feel bad for anyone who paid the full $11. Maybe if this game was $1, or even $5, it would be worth it, but there are so many problems all I can say about this game is that it's so bland it's mediocre, and if you want to spend $11 of your money you should spend it on the original Portal, if you want a game like it, or if you're looking for new Indie games to play I'd recommend buying Q.U.B.E.: Director's Cut or the Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth.

												This game is pretty fun and clever, but from its description, it is talking like a finished game, but it does not feel like one. Some things are glitchy and awkward, it needs polishing, and it is really short. If this is a finished product, then it's decent, but not ""The best puzzle/platformer since Portal"" as it describes itself. However, if this is still a WIP, and the developer is working on adding more content and polishing things, then it definitely has the potential to reach that description.I like to see wireless co-op, more levels, and some smoothing over of the game.

												Polarity is an overall very nice, Portal-like experience.PROS:- The puzzles are relatively simple, but engaging.- The gameplay is good and makes you want to keep progressing through the levels.- The minimalistic style is pleasant to look at.- The music is very relaxing and a joy to listen to.CONS:- I found the sound effects to be so annoying that after the first level, I went into the options to see if I can lower their volume - for some reason you can only turn them on and off, and I was forced to do the latter. The game doesn't really lose much if you do, and you are able to fully immerse yourself in the music that way.- Some of the level design choices aren't particularly fortunate, like how you can't always be sure where the platform you're standing on ends, or how deadly pits and normal ground are so hard to tell apart. Also, the chambers tend to be too dark and big sometimes.- 2 or 3 levels require quickly changing the polarity mid-jump, which is a pain to accomplish sometimes.- The singleplayer campaign is pretty short, and together with the bonus levels, it can be completed in about 3 hours. (I didn't try the coop one yet, so there's that...)- The ending could offer something more satisfying than just a few lines of text...CONCLUSION:Definitely get it if it's on sale. Especially the one that lowers its price to laughable 20 cents.			"

												Calling Polarity ""The best puzzle/platformer since Portal"" is a bit of a stretch, but nonetheless, it is a decent game. It suffers from lack of polish in a few areas, and has somewhat glitchy physics at times, but for the price it's a fun little puzzle game. I came into it expecting the puzzles to get more difficult as the game went on, and to some extent they did, but each level still only takes around 2-3 minutes at most. Overall, a decent time killer if you need to waste an hour (or more if you have a co-op buddy). Good if you're looking for a laid-back puzzler, especially good for the sale price.  4/5.			"

												How do I review this game?I could complain about the various non game-breaking glitches. But it was only $0.19I could complain about the unimaginative plain level design with repeating textures like an early 90s shooter. But it was only $0.19I could could complain about the various texture glitches and mismatched geometry causing strange unnatural ridges for you to get stuck on and glitches to appear. But it was only $0.19I could complain about beating the main game levels in only a few minutes with little effort. But it was only $0.19I could complain about the cubes disappearing randomly, getting stuck on objects, or even getting stuck in the platform it spawns on. But it was only $0.19I could complain about some of the puzzle parts being non intuitive and requires a bit of guessing to figure out what they do. But it was only $0.19But seriously.. It's only $0.19For $0.19 you can't really complain.Actually, even for a $1 it's pretty decent.Probably not for $5. I think this is game would do well at $1The base game is rather simple but enjoyable, I think younger children may enjoy the puzzles if they can get over some of the visuals or lack thereof.The game features full controller support. However I played with a keyboard and mouse.The bonus levels are a bit more difficult and will take a bit more than a couple glances to figure out.I sadly did not have a person available at the time to play the second player for the co-op mode.The CO-OP is split screen! Would be great to play with a friend and a couple controllers.I was able to find all the data points without too much difficulty, I felt I spent just the right amount of time looking for them.The music is a bit retro 80's sci fi electronic soothing keyboard type style which fits well.Movement feels pretty good. Physics are great. I think the programmers even did a bit of nudging at points to get you to land where you need to be without frustration.You can tell a big studio did not make this game, but I still enjoyed solving the puzzles.If you have an afternoon to kill and like puzzle games, I would definitely pick this up.

												Disclaimer: My first 'proper' review of a game.TL;DR:  Concept and potential is there, execution is lacking. Overpriced. Not actually a puzzle game.Pros:ConceptGame MechanicsSprinting (Timesaver!)VisualsCons:PriceBad execution.'Puzzle' game.Buggy. (Clip through platforms, cubes getting stuck, cubes randomly resetting.)After completing the singleplayer with all collectibles, and as much as I would love to recommend this game, I just can't. Don't get me wrong, the concept for this game is amazing and the potential is there if they want to expand on it.PriceIt's just that for €11 you aren't getting what you paid for. The length of the game, even when getting all collectibles and completing all the bonus levels (apart from co-op) is just over an hour. I would definitely recommend this if you could get it for <€3, but any more is just not worth the €/hour value.ConceptNow for the concept, the idea and potential in the game mechanics is great, but the execution is lacking. Quite a lot.The game reminded me a lot of Q.U.B.E. mixed with Portal. The visuals are kinda similar to these two games, and the game mechanics for the 'puzzles' have some similarities to these two games. But they just fall short in the puzzle department. 'Puzzle' tagAfter playing through the game it's more like a platformer/cubethrow than a real puzzle game. The only real puzzle element in this was finding the place to place/throw cubes at. After you found those it was all just platforming to the end of the level and onto the next one. Occasionally you would miss a collectible that you'd have to look for, but most of those you would come across regularly, or find when you would miss a jump. There wasn't a single moment in the game where I had to think about what to do in the level beforehand, it was all just look for the cube and the platform to put it on to advance.VerdictMy final verdict for this game would be a 4/10. I encountered too many random bugs for it to score any higher, from me clipping through platforms to my cube just randomly resetting when I was trying to use the launch pads.			"

												It's okay. It is a liar. It's not even multiplayer even though it says it is. It's only co-op and no kid has friends go to their house because all of them are online. Plus do you even expect your friend to bring wired controller? I think not.Boogies			"

												Polarity is a First-Person, Indie, Local Co-Op, Puzzle, Action Startegy game that is similar to the Portal franchise, so you already know that this game is going to be good.Polarity is a game where you need to get to the end of the level. But, you need to collect all three of the data, which are hidden through out each level. Like the Portal franchise, you need to think about the level, and try a few different ways of tackling the level. There is also a local Co-Op. Yes, I said local. But, the Co-Op, like in Portal 2, works well. And, it's a great edition to the game.Overall, this is a pretty good game. I would recommend the Portal franchise over this, but, this is a good game, and i still recommend it to anyone who wants it,			"

												General Pros:To be fair, it's not a bad game. The gameplay is solid, the physics are mostly solid (excluding bugs), the graphics are a bit lacklustre, but are generally clean and consistent, it has trading cards, it's a good time and the game goes on sale enough to be worth its sale price. I would only buy this game when the sales go for 3$CAD (2.50$USD) or under.General Cons:Why so many negative reviews? Sketchy devs, graphics problems, frame rate issues, general bugs, uninteresting story, very easy, no replay value, general mediocrity and no online co-op. For more information, read some negative reviews.Why the up rating:I actually enjoyed the game for the price I got it at. The single player is generally quite easy, but there was enough challenge to keep me interested for casual play. The co-op is a good time if you have the controllers to do it. It's well designed and harder than the single-player levels. If you're looking for your typical impossible puzzle game that feeds the weak to the gods of ""online guides"" with tons of levels ranking up to an impossible difficulty, go somewhere else. It's a rather short game that's fairly easy to complete. It's too short to get repetitive, but long enough to get engaged in. I personally like this style, but it's not for everyone and thus, I'm recommending it, but not for everyone :D "

												A fun and relatively novel puzzle game. While the puzzles border on trivial in places the game make use of some interesting game play elements. I really like the idea of the switching polarity and I think there is a lot of potential to expand upon the mechanic. The level design is simple but appealing and the soundtrack has a nice ambient, soothing quality that I think really suits the gameplay.The only real complaints I have are the polish, difficulty, and length of the game.During gameplay, there wer scattered instances of getting caught on small edges and sequences of accelerators. I don't think it detracts from gameplay too much but with the timing component it seems like this has potential to frustrate speed runners.The difficulty is obviously subjective and I understand that it can be difficult to strike a balance here. I think the game would benefit from the addition of more challenging puzzles, either by developer addition, or support for community creation.The campaign and bonus levels felt a bit short overall. Obviously there could be replay value for people wanting to improve time overal but without a leaderboard for friends this might be rather niche.Overall, I like the game and recommend it for people who like relaxing puzzle games.

I simply enjoyed everything about the game. The maps were just difficult enough to achieve it, and hard enough make you struggle and think. I also like the graphics. It's cartoony and yet very beautiful.

												Polarity is a fun puzzle game, wher you do indeed have to think and plan ahead. Jumping and mid-air color switching provides a little bit of action to keep you going as well. The graphics aren't high-end, but they're pleasant nonetheless. However. the ""data"" idea is kind of silly. In addition to completing the level, you have to hunt for ""data"" hidden in random places around the map. It's annoying, and kind of takes away from the game. But overall, I think its a good game.

												Polarity is an overall very nice, Portal-like experience.PROS:- The puzzles are relatively simple, but engaging.- The gameplay is good and makes you want to keep progressing through the levels.- The minimalistic style is pleasant to look at.- The music is very relaxing and a joy to listen to.CONS:- I found the sound effects to be so annoying that after the first level, I went into the options to see if I can lower their volume - for some reason you can only turn them on and off, and I was forced to do the latter. The game doesn't really lose much if you do, and you are able to fully immerse yourself in the music that way.- Some of the level design choices aren't particularly fortunate, like how you can't always be sure where the platform you're standing on ends, or how deadly pits and normal ground are so hard to tell apart. Also, the chambers tend to be too dark and big sometimes.- 2 or 3 levels require quickly changing the polarity mid-jump, which is a pain to accomplish sometimes.- The singleplayer campaign is pretty short, and together with the bonus levels, it can be completed in about 3 hours. (I didn't try the coop one yet, so there's that...)- The ending could offer something more satisfying than just a few lines of text...CONCLUSION:Definitely get it if it's on sale. Especially the one that lowers its price to laughable 20 cents.			"

												Calling Polarity ""The best puzzle/platformer since Portal"" is a bit of a stretch, but nonetheless, it is a decent game. It suffers from lack of polish in a few areas, and has somewhat glitchy physics at times, but for the price it's a fun little puzzle game. I came into it expecting the puzzles to get more difficult as the game went on, and to some extent they did, but each level still only takes around 2-3 minutes at most. Overall, a decent time killer if you need to waste an hour (or more if you have a co-op buddy). Good if you're looking for a laid-back puzzler, especially good for the sale price.  4/5.			"

												How do I review this game?I could complain about the various non game-breaking glitches. But it was only $0.19I could complain about the unimaginative plain level design with repeating textures like an early 90s shooter. But it was only $0.19I could could complain about the various texture glitches and mismatched geometry causing strange unnatural ridges for you to get stuck on and glitches to appear. But it was only $0.19I could complain about beating the main game levels in only a few minutes with little effort. But it was only $0.19I could complain about the cubes disappearing randomly, getting stuck on objects, or even getting stuck in the platform it spawns on. But it was only $0.19I could complain about some of the puzzle parts being non intuitive and requires a bit of guessing to figure out what they do. But it was only $0.19But seriously.. It's only $0.19For $0.19 you can't really complain.Actually, even for a $1 it's pretty decent.Probably not for $5. I think this is game would do well at $1The base game is rather simple but enjoyable, I think younger children may enjoy the puzzles if they can get over some of the visuals or lack thereof.The game features full controller support. However I played with a keyboard and mouse.The bonus levels are a bit more difficult and will take a bit more than a couple glances to figure out.I sadly did not have a person available at the time to play the second player for the co-op mode.The CO-OP is split screen! Would be great to play with a friend and a couple controllers.I was able to find all the data points without too much difficulty, I felt I spent just the right amount of time looking for them.The music is a bit retro 80's sci fi electronic soothing keyboard type style which fits well.Movement feels pretty good. Physics are great. I think the programmers even did a bit of nudging at points to get you to land where you need to be without frustration.You can tell a big studio did not make this game, but I still enjoyed solving the puzzles.If you have an afternoon to kill and like puzzle games, I would definitely pick this up.

												I got this game on sale for dirt cheap and it's pretty addicting. It has a portal vibe to it, without feeling like a copy. The Polarity changing mechanic is cool, but could be used a lot more with the puzzles. My main complain is that the game is pretty short. I beat all of the single player 100% in less than 2 hours.

												wow. just wow. When i bought this new game for $4.99, I doubted that this game would be good. It looked like a cool concept. looked like Portal. But wow. Just wow. This game is as good as Portal 2 if not better. It is like Portal 2 with sprinting + finding special items in each level without Portal guns. I would say it is slightly easier than Portal 2. Rather than following a storyline, this game follows levels that increase with difficulty. This game is entirely worth it. It is so fun to switch things on/off, walk through coloured gates and sprint around in an attempt to solve the puzzle.10/10 THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!			"

Pros: Interesting puzzlesAppealing visualsShould run on almost any PCOccasionally clever level designNew mechanics are introduced organically, so it is very easy to learn how they work by just experimentingCons:While visuals are pleasant, they are very rudimentary and this could detract from some people's experienceAlmost no plot at allCo-op is split-screen onlyVery short playthroughI found it too easy to blow through each level, and most data nodes (3 collectables in each level) aren't really hidden at allThe cons I have listed, while obviously negative points, don't really detract from my overall opinion of the game. I enjoyed it, and considering the cost of the game I felt like the investment was worth it. With so many games pushing 80+ hours to complete these days, it was refreshing to spend a buck for a few hours of entertainment.			"

												Polarity is a very fun game, don't get me wrong. However it has a glaring flaw that the rest of these reviews (as far as I've seen) haven't really addressed. That flaw is the game-breakingly bad jumping. I have played the game for .7 hours as of writing this review, and I can garauntee that at least 30 minutes of that have been dedicated to trying to jump. It only works every ~1/4 time you hit space, which makes parkour very difficult to do. Another (much more minor) grievance is the shadow quality of the game, as they are aliased to hell and back.The game itself is very fun, however. It reminds the player of portal, while still having its own uniqueness that keeps the player going. The polarity switch is a neat little feature, while not very practical in the actual game. (That is, it is necessary, but it does not contribute to any of the puzzles.) If the issue with jumping was to be fixed, I would recommend this game.			"

												A very fun but short Portal-inspired game. It has 21 levels on singleplayer and 15 multiplayer levels. The main downside of this game is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is not online and you must have a controller in order to play them. If you're going for an easy 100% game, this game is for you, provided you have a controller. Without it, there are three unobtainable achievements.Polarity only has about 1-2 hours of gameplay, so I would recommend waiting until a sale to get it. $11 USD is overpriced for such a short game.Recommended for beginners to the First Person Puzzle genre.7/10 - Missing two player keyboard support and short.

												UPDATE: It's come to my attention that the developers have been re-releasing Polarity with no updates, with the only change being an increase to the price each time. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practice and I do not support it.For the sake of objectivity, I'll leave my original (positive) review below. Just take it with a pinch of salt:I was pleasantly surpirsed by Polarity. I picked it up in the Developer Alliance Bundle for barely more than a pound, and therefore didn't expect much for it. However, the gameplay left me coming back for more, though sadly there's only around two hours of content, not counting the co-operative gameplay which I've not done yet.The one thing I'd criticise about the game is that it feels a bit stuck-together at times, with a main menu that leaves a lot to be desired alongside some minor physics bugs. This does not affect gameplay, however.If you like portal style games, you'll like this. Had me hooked more than QUBE.			"

												I received this game for free when I bought a game I don't remember. I had fun playing it but the room that rotates really gave me a head ache out of nowhere.. I really don't recommend buying this game on its full price, its too short and can be finished in 2-3hrs. It has an achievement of playing with someone but can only be accomplished through local co-op using a game controller. Probably buy it when it is on 90% sale if you want to play just to pass time.Over all had fun and why not it's free.. so 7/10 "

												Polarity is first person puzzle game which takes place in a cyberspace full of dark neon colours. This and the quiet,ambient soundtrack really creates a satisfying atmosphere which really sets a good mood to solving the puzzles. The puzzles themselves are well  designed, and strike a good balance between deducing/problem solving and timing and acting.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good first person experience, and especially those who are fans of puzzles games like portal or the talos principle.

												Polarity is a fairly simple 3D first-person puzzle platformer.  It's rather short; I beat the single player game in one sitting in an afternoon.  The game also contains a split-screen co-op mode and a set of bonus levels.It lacks a lot of polish that makes similar puzzle games great: the menus are rather old looking, although the level select in the background is nice; there are a few clipping errors here and there, but nothing overt; the textures are a little flat, but there are is a nice shadow effect around the edges of things that make everything look a little bit nicer.The single player puzzles are rather easy, and the co-op puzzles seem to be a bit harder.  However, it seems that the co-op mode has even less polish than the main game, with the cube spawn sites not even having the fancy model that the single player campaign uses.I'd rate this game as a fairly good entry into the genre for someone who hasn't played much.  But for anyone looking for a well polished game or much of a challenge, it's best to look elsewhere.			"

												I bought this game because I expected something similar to Portal, but I am utterly disappointed. I am no genius, but puzzles are so simple that I feel insulted. In place of decent puzzle solving you have a lot of jumping and running. I am not one of those kids who were born with console controller in their hands, I just want some nerdy fun and stretching my brain a bit, not improve my mouse/keyboard operation skills. On top of that, I see quite a few bugs in the least expected places, like level selection. Graphics are very crude and there is something about them that makes me feel dizzy if I play for any longer than half an hour.Waste of money and time.			"

												The game is pretty good. Fun, challenging, and it has a really nice atmosphere. But please don't compare it to Portal 2. Yes, it is very similar to it, but it is very different in a lot of aspects and mechanics. The things that I honestly liked the most are the atmosphere and the gameplay. The only bad thing is that it only supports 1280x720 (and given that I play on a 4:3 screen that really sucks). Performance is great too, solid 60FPS all the time on a pretty old PC. Definitely recommended for everyone who likes puzzle-type games and/or who has played Portal. Oh, also, it's NOWHERE NEAR worth the $10. I got it for $0.72 with 4 other games so it was an amazing deal.			"

												This game was enjoyable but could've been amazing. The puzzle dynamics, the gameplay, all of it was pretty great. It just... came up short. Not enough content, not enough puzzles, not enough use of the interesting dynamics they put into this game. I don't mind skimping on the story for a truly interesting puzzle game but I blasted through this in a single hour and just felt let down.I wanted more and I was just sitting here like ""but... it's over already?"" I haven't done the bonus levels yet but it's not much more in the way of content.That being said, it was good enough for me to want more, to actually feel put out with how short it was. None of the puzzles were frustrating and the methods you used for them were challenging and unique, it was just a lot of fun. Really short fun. 30 seconds of fun. :(I think that if you're going to buy it, you should buy it on sale and you'll likely enjoy it. But probably not for 11 dollars, there's just so little to it for that price. (I got it from a friend so like lol)So one of those recommended but not at full price thumbs up situations.			"

												Bought this for 19 cents and it wasn't bad, but 11 DOLLARS? Holy cow, NO! Don't give it a second thought, wait for another 19 cent sale and even then you may not want to waste your 19 cents. If you want a great game like this for a dollar less, play Portal.Phew.			"

												Painfully mediocre. The main mechanic isn't particularly original and isn't used creatively. The game's length is short, even with bonus levels and a co-op campaign. Half the co-op puzzles don't required any player interaction at all and the entire thing can fairly easily be played through... if you have a controller. If you don't, TOUGH LUCK, you need at least one because there's only local co-op and no two player configuration for keyboard only. I mean, it's not an awful game, the physics are kinda wonky at times and the challenge level is low, but it's not very good. Not worth the $5 but I won't complain for the 19 cents I picked it up for.			"

												Polarity is a simple puzzle game with a design like Portal.Single Player 8/10     - Relaxed feel but still challenging at points.Co-op 5/10    - The co-op has the same feel as single player, but since there is only local co-op, it is not as usable.Graphics  7/10    - The graphics aren't fantastic but they're made to be simple.Difficulty  6/10    - It wasn't too difficult, but some of the puzzles had me confused for a couple minutes.Overall  6.5/10    - It was an entertaining game but not much replay-ability.Worth it?For $5, only if you like puzzle games.For anything less than $5, everyone should get it.

												oh my god amazing i got this game in a bundle that only costs 74 cents so i kinda cheated to get this game, im just gonna say that. OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS AMAZING. i passed by this game on the store becasue in the description it compared it to portal and i was like OH NO PORTAL IS MY BABY but like i said i got it in a bundle so i had no choice so i was like meh it installed first yolo... do people still say that? whatever, and it is challenging, its satisfying to finish puzzles, but its pretty short i beat it in like 2 hours (including bonus levels) but i can see how slower people would have a hard time beating it.P.S. it has a co-op and a vs mode so buy yourself some friends and play it.  8/10 (cod player voice) ehhhh no violence mehhhh			"

												Good concept. Decent puzzle design most of the time, but lots of occasions where it felt like the level designer ran out of ideas in the middle before they came up with enough puzzles to hide the goal points (like that one level where the third goal point was *in the room with the level exit*. Really?) Occasionally felt more like hide and seek than full on puzzling. Doing more clever things with the Polarity Switch mechanic would be good since it is the game's namesake. Lots of graphical mistakes - Getting your texture edges lined up with your geometry has been level design 101 stuff since the DOOM .wad days, gang. The game is low budget and it looks it.  Still, it kept my attention for the hour or so it took to play through to the end. 99 cents might be a good price point for this - I feel like I got my 19 cents worth out of it.			"

												Anyone who says this game is anything like Portal or Portal 2 has never even once seen any other first-person puzzle game in their entire life. This game has some very minor similarities but in no way feels anything like portal. Now that that is out of the way we can talk about this game. Polarity is reasonably fun to play, you will constantly think you need the cubes and end up with one or two at the elevator and then later you will find out you're trying too hard on something that's easy if you bring another cube. Is this game worth 5 euros? No. It's too simple and short for that. But if it's on sale and you like first person puzzles you can grab this game and kill a couple of hours with this simple game. It's not very challenging but not too easy, and it has data fragments in some sneaky places for completionists out there. Graphics are okay, they're very simple which makes the game easy to read. Those who have played anti-chamber are sure to be able to solve anything in this game. All and all it's nothing too hard, nor too easy. Anyone who has played a couple of first person puzzlers will be able to solve this game, and for 0,19 euros it's worth for killing a couple of hours.			"

												Polarity is a below-average Portal knock-off that is childishly easy, but only made difficult in that you can’t fully remap your keyboard and mouse.Its unique premise is that you have red and blue “polarities”, with each color reflecting the other. How this works in the game is that if you have a blue laser fence up, you have to change to the blue polarity to get past. Alternately, if the floor is blue, change to red polarity so that you can walk on it. The only real challenges are when you have to flip back-and-forth between them quickly, such as when you’re jumping on alternating colors.The whole thing looks and feels like a college project with dreadfully simple layout, mismatched layers that caused me to continually “trip” every time I walked over a line, and simple challenges. The game features jumps but because they’re not flush with the wall, I kept getting stuck on those too.Definitely not worth $5, and really not worth the 90% discount that I got it at. You’d do better with just about any other title.			"

												If you have played other puzzle games, portal, for example, and you still feel like you have yet to find a true challenge, then this game is certainly not for you. It doesn't rely on clever thinking and deep thought processes to entice the player through each level, it relies simply on... general difficulty? What I mean by this is you will never truly find a puzzle that will stump you, that will have you sitting at your computer for 30 minutes, pacing back and forth between point a and point b, just trying to come up with a sollution. Instead, the biggest problems you'll have are gonna be simply from the wonky movement controls and the game plain and flat out hiding the objectives from you.			"

												I will say this game gave me a slight Portal-ish vibe, and the puzzles were realtively enjoyable. AND I don't mind co-op taking place on my actual computer, and not on LAN. But the fact of the matter is, I beat the game (and got all of the main data fragments) in 100 minutes. Yes, there are co-op and bonus missions, but 100 minutes is it? I'm glad I only paid $.30 for this game, otherwise I'd feel ripped off.			"

												I stopped after my first play session since it was way to easy to get stuck. It got annoying having to redo levels over an over. If you have to trow one of the cubes and it doesn't land exactly where it  has too, you have to restart. If you jump before bringing something you need later there is no path back all you can do is restart the level, and even though at least to begin with the levels were short, it got repetitive and boring having to redo levels very fast since the story wasn't interesting/not there much.If you want a Puzzle game of this type buy Portal and Portal 2, they got a long story and you can't get stuck.

												The game is pretty good. Fun, challenging, and it has a really nice atmosphere. But please don't compare it to Portal 2. Yes, it is very similar to it, but it is very different in a lot of aspects and mechanics. The things that I honestly liked the most are the atmosphere and the gameplay. The only bad thing is that it only supports 1280x720 (and given that I play on a 4:3 screen that really sucks). Performance is great too, solid 60FPS all the time on a pretty old PC. Definitely recommended for everyone who likes puzzle-type games and/or who has played Portal. Oh, also, it's NOWHERE NEAR worth the $10. I got it for $0.72 with 4 other games so it was an amazing deal.			"

												A fairly short game, with a bare-bones story and general lack of polish. The puzzles are no challenge, I felt like the main theme of the game, polarity, was barely explored.Halfway through the single player, you're forced to replay the levels to collect all of the ""data"" you might have missed, which aren't hard to find honestly. Now you might be in the mindset to hunt the data down in the bonus levels you just gained access to, except they're all directly in your path from now on!I constantly had to jump over toe high ridges to get on ramps and such. The cubes you have to carry around kept getting snagged out of my grasp, sometimes forcing me to redo multiple steps to get it back.Overall it passed as nothing more than a time waster.			"

												1 Line review: It's like Portal, but without Portals. Also, it's very short. 5/10Full Review:There isn't much to talk about this. The story is almost non-existent and is just a bunch (~20 + 10 extras) of really short levels (5min max if you want to get everything in each level). I'd say that the concept is kinda cool: instead of Portals, you have you manipulate your own ""polarity"", between red or blue if you don't want to die from lasers of that color, if you want to be above platforms of those colors and even transport cubes of those colors without desintegrating them.As a puzzle game, I didn't find it hard, only slightly on very specific segments that you have to get some items to unlock the ending. It should be more as an introdutory puzzle game to kids ages 8 and lower rather than to teens and adults used to more complex games like The Talos Principle and PQ (the psp exclusive). If you fall on the latter category, this game should be just one or two hours long.On the other hand, this game often comes *really* cheap, like dirt cheap (some 50 cents... no pun intended), so the price/game hours ratio isn't that bad. The experience itself is bug-free and the visual is simple and a little retro, so it's nice to relax if you want something for that. Visuals are quite simple as well, but don't strain the eyes.Overall, it is a fair game... I mean, fairly standard. Short, cheap, soothing, but nothing more. Well, it has multiplayer, but it's not that entertaining as other puzzle multiplayer games. So, just don't expect much.			"

												This being my first review, this is a small videogame developed by a very small team in their bedroom. Although it is only 40-60 minutes long (not including Co-op missions), I found the music quite relaxing and the puzzles not too hard but just right enough to where I won't get angry after spending a half hour on one room trying to figure out how to do it and then eventually breaking down and looking for the solution online. Sadly, with the game being short, I highly reccommend not buying it at its full price, you will not get your moneys worth time wise. If you find this on sale (which I did at 95% off), you wont be disappointed with yourself if you put aside an hour or so to play through it. This game is not for the hardcore people that have no-lifed portal 2 workshop maps non-stop for 72 hours, this is for the more casual puzzle players.			"

And I must say, I was really disappointed.Explaining why: the levels are pretty straightforward, since there isn't two or more ways to beat the maps, there is only the solution way. Also, in my opinion there is something really wrong whenever you spend more time moving your character through the huge maps, instead spending time trying to solve the puzzle itself and that bothered me a lot.That is my honest opinion, but feel free to disagree.

												UPDATE: It's come to my attention that the developers have been re-releasing Polarity with no updates, with the only change being an increase to the price each time. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practice and I do not support it.For the sake of objectivity, I'll leave my original (positive) review below. Just take it with a pinch of salt:I was pleasantly surpirsed by Polarity. I picked it up in the Developer Alliance Bundle for barely more than a pound, and therefore didn't expect much for it. However, the gameplay left me coming back for more, though sadly there's only around two hours of content, not counting the co-operative gameplay which I've not done yet.The one thing I'd criticise about the game is that it feels a bit stuck-together at times, with a main menu that leaves a lot to be desired alongside some minor physics bugs. This does not affect gameplay, however.If you like portal style games, you'll like this. Had me hooked more than QUBE.			"

												Do you like simple puzzles? If you do you'll probably enjoy playing Polarity. On the other hand, if you prefer more complex puzzles, or don't like puzzles much at all, you might not. Polarity is a first person puzzle game similar to Portal (the objective is to exit the room by activating switches and the like), with the main difference being in the titular mechanic. Basically, some objects interact with other objects depending on their polarity. For example, red cubes will only activate red switches. You can also change your polarity at will for various effects. This mechanic is used in some way in every puzzle. The puzzles themselves have data (the game's collectibles) hidden throughout, and the main challenge comes from collecting all of the data. Data will also unlock new puzzles on the level select, as well as bonus puzzles (Note: data is not required to play most levels, but you will only be able to select most levels after meeting a data quota. For example, if you play through a level without meeting its data quota, you will be able  to proceed to the next level if you don't return to the menu; but if you do, you will only be able to select levels with completed quotas to begin from.).If I had to complain about one thing it would be that the game is pretty short. There are only about 20 single player levels. To be fair, the game does have a coop mode as well as a player vs player mode, but both of these are only local, and require a pad and a pal to play. As such, I've yet to try either (I'll place and edit here if I do). The game also doesn't have any story or characters to speak of; and while the graphics and sound work well enough, they don't really add that much to the game.But in the end it all comes down to one question. Do you like puzzles?			"

												A very fun but short Portal-inspired game. It has 21 levels on singleplayer and 15 multiplayer levels. The main downside of this game is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is not online and you must have a controller in order to play them. If you're going for an easy 100% game, this game is for you, provided you have a controller. Without it, there are three unobtainable achievements.Polarity only has about 1-2 hours of gameplay, so I would recommend waiting until a sale to get it. $11 USD is overpriced for such a short game.Recommended for beginners to the First Person Puzzle genre.7/10 - Missing two player keyboard support and short.

												I liked solving each puzzle in each map, each level was different from the others which gave it that challenge. The levels last a couple of minutes at first but do get harder as you progress to end up taking around 10 minutes or more. The levels concist of using these blocks that could be called energy orbs to function platforms and make things work/move to get around the map. You need to collect these data objects which each level has 3 inside them, each data object is either hidden or there is a puzzle challenge to get to them such as changing the colour of a enery source because a slot is a different colour needed to make an lift function which can take you to that data object. When you've collected the data objects then you can make your way to the end of the level ready for the next one. I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles as they weren't too hard. I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

Not adjusted for multiplayer. That definitely was worth a buy. For 10,99 though? I am sorry, but that's too much. I can't recommend this in good conscience with a price tag like that.

												I only paid US$0.20, and for that I was entertained. The graphics are simplistic, there's only one in-game music track, but it's a fun short game nonetheless. The levels were a little too simple, with obvious solutions -- and I ended up completing the game by accident.Near the end of ""chaper 1"" I was told I needed to complete the last level to unlock ""chaper 2"", except there *is* no chapter 2. Finishing the levels in chaper 1 gives you a text-only cutscene before dumping you unceremoniously back at the main menu. Apparently this is by design, although I'm not sure if that means more levels will come later or if what you see really is all you're supposed to get.Overall recommended, but only on heavy discount.

												This game is SHORT, but it's a lot of fun. It's in the vein of Portal but without anything but the mere hint of a story. You are a ""hacker"" who, instead of using computers at all, uses colored light and switches to achieve your aims, collecting ""data fragments"" that are just collectibles scattered throughout the level. This thin excuse for a story aside, it's got good mechanics. You can reverse your polarity to either red or blue to pass through lasers and forcefields, or have your polarity opposite so you can walk across light bridges. There are a lot of putting-cubes-on-switches and jumping through forcefields while changing your polarity midair, and it gets pretty easy near the end once you've gotten the hang of it. It feels like I just finished the tutorial level and am waiting for the bigger levels.8/10 overall, mostly for game length. You should definitely buy this, but don't pay more than $5 or you'll feel ripped off.			"

												I picked this up with 3 other games for $1.49 total, not knowing what to expect (despite having positive reviews) I was pleasantly surprised with all the games but especially with Polarity. In polarity you find yourself switching polarity to get through/over red and blue ""gates"" and throwing/dropping red and blue cubes to power up devices in order to get to the end of the level while also searching for Data Fragments to unlock bonus levels.Polarity is a simple, well-executed concept that makes the player feel good when they solve each puzzle. The game is casual friendly with it's level checkpoints, no real way to die and no enemies (at least in the levels I've played).The game could be better with a level editor, steam workshop and leaderboards to encourage players to replay levels, the cubes also sometimes don't do what you want while you are carrying them by seeming to bug out on rare occasions.I highly recommend this for fans of puzzle games and even the casual gamer looking for a new challenge but still want a relaxing game.

Some things are glitchy and awkward, it needs polishing, and it is really short. If this is a finished product, then it's decent, but not ""The best puzzle/platformer since Portal"" as it describes itself. However, if this is still a WIP, and the developer is working on adding more content and polishing things, then it definitely has the potential to reach that description.I like to see wireless co-op, more levels, and some smoothing over of the game.

												Fantastic little puzzler. Nothing too taxing on the brain, but attempting to find all of the data packs (there are three of them hidden in each level) can be a real challenge and the idea of polarity-switching is used to good effect. The similarities to Portal are well-known at this point; you find yourself in a sleek, enclosed environment and use your wits (and cubes) to reach the exit. If you enjoyed Portal, you'll enjoy this, but it would be doing the game a disservice to call it a Portal clone; it has its own ideas and systems that are well thought-out and smoothly executed throughout. The game is void of any real plot or humour, but those things aren't needed here. It's a simple little game and quite a relaxing way to flex your puzzling muscles for an hour or two, without any extra baggage forcefully added on. I've not been able to enjoy the co-op campaign just yet, but if the singleplayer is anything to go by then it must be a lot of fun. There's certainly potential for a sequel here and I hope to see more from this developer in the future.			"

												This game is short. Not being unfair to it but I've finished the main campaign and half the extra levels in an hour. For the 15P it cost me I'm not going to complain though. It feels like its a precursor to something bigger the teams hopefully working on. There's certainly the basics of a truly playable game but unfortunately this falls short of something to write home about.Only drama I had with it bugs wise were occasional invisible walls that my character managed to find. Normally at the top of ramps. Didn't effect too much though.It's not graphically complicated nor are the puzzles but it killed some time and I'm not ashamed to have it on my library list. *cough* Hydrophobia *cough*I'd like to see more complex puzzles and even some different Physics. It's set in a cyber world so the devs could really go to town as Physics doesn't necessarily have to apply.I will point out that I didn't touch the co-op so can't really say anything for that.			"

												Polarity at first glance looks very much like Portal but is as different from portal as it is similar. In Polarity you are a hacker and the ""tests"" - as they are called in Portal - are parts of a code that you must crack. Therefore, instead of being an actual person, you are a digital representation of the hacker which is very Tron-like. The levels themselves are very Tron-like in comparison to Portal; the levels have many glowing elements incorporated into them. Its a fun game and if you liked Portal you will like Polarity as well!			"

												The physics are horrible, your character falls way to fast, and objects almost don't at all when thrown. And it has the physics effect where when you jump off of a moving object, you keep moving with it, which is a problem when you're trying to jump onto thin floating pathways. The game is very short, and the puzzles can hardly be called puzzles. The hardest thing about the puzzles is finding all of the cubes to continue, and then I get to the end of what the call the single player campaign and tell me I need to find 11 more Fragments to continue. I didn't realize I needed fragments for anything but the trophies, so it's trying to get me to play through the entire campaign again to collect all of the fragments (which aren't challenging to get) to continue through the campaign it says I beat? There is also no voice acting, so there is no reason to want to keep going. If you want a fun puzzle game with better graphics, better physics, and is cheaper, go for the old Portal flash game. Its more rewarding, difficult and polished.Polarity is like if Portal didn't have portals or good physics. Just cubes.I want to give it a bad rating, but its much better than what squeezes out of Greenlight now, so I'll give it a 4.5/10.			"

Worth every penny (I mean that 0.54 euro in sale).Polarity is something like Portal, but in my opinion it is much much easier.If you want try something logical, but not something too much hard. Try Polarity.I am forever alone. I done COOP levels alone, just because I wanted achievements :'( "

												Polarity is a quirky little first person puzzle game in a similar vein to portal. Although slightly limitied by its limited length and lack of online co-op (currently only local), this game still somehow provided me with 4ish hours of enjoyment even for an extremely low sale price (~15p). This game is also a really effective achievement hoarder with really not particularly difficult to accomplish achievements providing for a simple 100% completion as well as reasonably rare trading cards which most likely equate in value to more than you'll end up paying for the game.

Easy and short but definitively goodYes, it is not that challenging, it seems a lot like a cheap Portal knockoff without any real story and definitively not worth 10,99€.I got the game for a few cents when it was on sale (it seems it’s on sale rather often) and had a lot of fun playing it.The local coop is interesting too, although I wish it could be played online as well.All in all it’s a fun little game you should get when it’s on sale and even if you don’t like it, you can always just idle the trading cards.

												This game is about 1-2 hours long, with a split-screen co-op mode if you're into that. The puzzles are fun and challenging (for the most part). After playing the first few levels you'll begin to notice that the levels become lower quality/less finished as the developers got lazy, which is excusable for indie developers and not game breaking, (the bonus missions are certainly a drop in quality over the main levels). I don't reccomend buying this game for it's price when it's not on sale. I bought it for I think, somewhere around 20p on a sale (~$0.30)tl;dr short puzzle game, levels are ok but drop in quality throughout - don't buy for above a couple dollars.			"

												First let's go over the good stuff. The puzzle mechanics are kinda interesting and will, at times, make quick use of them. The controls are as smooth as you expect from a recent game.Now for what I didn't like. The biggest problem is that all of the puzzles revolve around finding ""data."" To complete a level and progess to the next one, three orbs of data need to be found. The problem with this is that the difficulty of all of the puzzles come from finding the orbs on the board. They are almost never hard to get to, just hard to find. This would be okay if the developers realized this and made each level interesting. Turn each board into a unique easter egg hunt that reveals something about the story. Show something about my mysterious empoyer. Leave notes on the wall next to an orb that shows what each piece of data is. Have comments of code that reveals something about the owner. Make each nook and cranny rewarding to explore, even if it doesn't have an orb. As is, however, each level is like an easter egg hunt where all the eggs are hidden in 4 acre egg carton: everything looks the same until you stumble upon the green orb.For a game that is ""demanding all of your wits and reflexes,"" this game is surprisingly easy and short. As mentioned earlier, almost all of the difficulty comes from finding all of the orbs. It's reminiscent of Knuckles' levels in Sonic Adventure, which we all know as everyone's favorite part of everyone's favorite game. What makes matters worse is that sometimes it is brutally apparent that the developers placed the orbs as an after thought just to squeeze three into each level. Each puzzle takes less than 5 minutes to complete, except one that I spent several extra minutes exploring the level looking for the last orb. Turns out it was in the exit room. Why even bother?Minor gripes: some small steps can't be walked over, they need to be jumped. At times the physics is unpredictable. For example, a cube won't move with a moving platform when placed on it. Also, the throwing mechanic sometimes makes it feel like I accidentally skipped part of a puzzle (might just be me, though). Less than one hour of main story, maybe another with extras, and maybe another with co-op.I like what they tried to do and the mechanics are cool, but the environment is unrewarding.TL;DR: The game controls well and has a neat idea. The execution is sub par, unchallenging, and short. Not worth $10. If you catch it on super sale (whatever 1-2 hours is worth to you), go ahead and try it.			"

												I got this game for 9 cent or something like that. At the time I wrote this review I played 101 minutes in just singleplayer. That means I bought 11,2 minutes of fun/cent. Not adjusted for multiplayer. That definitely was worth a buy. For 10,99 though? I am sorry, but that's too much. I can't recommend this in good conscience with a price tag like that. A 2 year old game that is this short and easy should not be that expensive. "

												After selling a handfull of cards I got the game for just 20 cents. I've only played the single player mode, so all this is based only on that mode (no idea what co-op is like). The game takes a few things from Portal and Antichamber as well. The game mechanics, the launh pads, the blocks and the way blocks activate platforms is well known from Portal while the graphical style, the very simplistic, bold style with a thick black outline around certain objects looks pretty similar to Antichamber at times. I found the puzzles to be pretty easy to complete. Near the end the puzzles actually became more challenging, but yeah, that was at the end. Definitely not on the same difficulty level as Portal's chambers in my opinion. Having said that if you find Portal too challenging then this game might just be for you. Bare in mind though that you're going to want to play this for the puzzles and not for the story as there isn't much to it. Also if you're thinking about buying Portal but you're uncertain as to whether or not you'll like that kind of game then you may want to get this first given that it's quite similar in terms of gameplay and (at the moment) dirt cheap. Summary: For 20 cents the game is more than worth it. It's not that difficult in my opinion and could definitely use some more levels and perhaps a bit less headbobbing, but still well worth it.			"

												Solid core mechanic that is built off of over the course of the game. Levels take on average 3 minutes to complete and there aren't that many of them so it goes fast.Rather than using the same mechanic in harder and harder puzzles new mechanics are introduced. The introductions for these new mechanics are well done but they're never combined in a confusing way. I never once had to stop playing and think about what I had to do next. Solutions could typically be found by running in, looking around, and saying ""oh"" at which point it became a matter of execution. Or ""how can I beat this in a way that was unintended?"" depends on your mindset really.Game is fairly sparse visually and there are some physics bugs but nothing that takes away from the core puzzle mechanics. For the sale price this really is quite a good fps puzzle game.			"

												I lost interest in under an hour. The puzzles are far too easy, and the difficuly curve is stagnant if it even exists. I may come back and beat it,  and I'm still glad I bought it, but If i had paid the full $10.99 for this I would be extremely dissapointed. I would recommend buying this game if it were under $2, and if you prefer relaxed puzzle games.Why is there a run button? I feel like no one wants to walk, but it was just added because a lot of games have one. The areas that make you run/jump and change colors require 4 key presses, shift being the most awkward, as though I'm playing twister with my hand. just make the player always run. Sometimes I'll throw a box at the wall to grab a data fragments, and the box goes through the wall. Two things here: data should be collected on contact, secondly, fix the wall glitch.I'm not a fan of the use and design of the UI. The tutorial buttons pause the game, almost always when I was in mid jump, for the first message, I had just happened to be clicking right as it popped up, and accidentally closed it after it showed for a 10th of a second. I never got a chance to read it. they should really just stay up, without pausing the game, and dissapear after a few seconds. lastly, I don't like that a ""next level"" button appears at the end, would be nicer if it just went to the next level.The game has a confusing optional yet kinda required data collection, side thing. I say take that out entirely, and force the player to do every puzzle. This would remove the need for back-tracking, level selection, and all of those things that break the immersion of the game. Most of the data finding added nothing to the game, other than make me bored whilst checking nooks and crannies. Only a few data hiding spot added some fun, and you might as well just work those into the mandatory path of the level.Story was non-existent, normally I don't care, but, it's just another example of how the game aimed low in all areas except... technical implementation: the game is almost bug free; It handles pretty well. The only bug I saw was mentioned earlier, Nothing else really annoyed me, outside of the game's design.Keep at it, and try to take more risks. It's a neat concept that can lead to a really great game, but it just needs better level design			"

Also, keep in mind this game is LOCAL coop only, not online coop as many ended up believing.Pros: entertainment:price ratio is healthy when on sale.Cons: Extremely short, not very challenging.I personally would recommend Out There Somewhere or BEEP instead of this, if you have to choose between one of the games this dev has made, but for the most part, it's pretty solid.

												The description tries to lure you in by mentioning Portal, but don't be fooled.  It's a puzzle platformer with a tech theme (though something tells me it's just an excuse to be minimalist in their design - the story consists of a few lines of dialogue slapped on the beginning and end of the game), and you place boxes on pads to advance.  The similarities end there.The puzzles mostly consist of finding where to place a block to activate a bridge or jump pad.  Once you look around and locate it, it's usually just a matter or pointing and clicking to throw.  It will go in a perfectly straight line as far as it needs to and when it gets there it will be sucked in by the switch.  Not a puzzle, just basic observation skills. Some of the pads require you to bounce it off a wall, and those have very clearly marked targets.  Just ""throw here to advance.""  The other aspect of the game is toggling between red and blue, which changes which bridges you can use and which you'll fall through.  At the beginning these are pretty easy except that the default keybindings aren't great (and only remappable before launching the game) and coordinating it is rough.  I'm willing to accept that this is a deficiency on my part, and the controls may be more intuitive with a controller. Near the end, this aspect was getting challenging enough to be worthwhile on its own, but just as it got interesting, game over.On one level, I spent 15 minutes trying to solve what appeared to be an interesting puzzle just to find that the solution was just to push a big button.  I beat it 100% (excluding co-op) in 2 hours, and it was mildly entertaining.  But I also got it on sale for 50 cents.  It's definitely not worth $10.99.			"

												Polarity is a fairly simple 3D first-person puzzle platformer.  It's rather short; I beat the single player game in one sitting in an afternoon.  The game also contains a split-screen co-op mode and a set of bonus levels.It lacks a lot of polish that makes similar puzzle games great: the menus are rather old looking, although the level select in the background is nice; there are a few clipping errors here and there, but nothing overt; the textures are a little flat, but there are is a nice shadow effect around the edges of things that make everything look a little bit nicer.The single player puzzles are rather easy, and the co-op puzzles seem to be a bit harder.  However, it seems that the co-op mode has even less polish than the main game, with the cube spawn sites not even having the fancy model that the single player campaign uses.I'd rate this game as a fairly good entry into the genre for someone who hasn't played much.  But for anyone looking for a well polished game or much of a challenge, it's best to look elsewhere.			"

												General Pros:To be fair, it's not a bad game. The gameplay is solid, the physics are mostly solid (excluding bugs), the graphics are a bit lacklustre, but are generally clean and consistent, it has trading cards, it's a good time and the game goes on sale enough to be worth its sale price. I would only buy this game when the sales go for 3$CAD (2.50$USD) or under.General Cons:Why so many negative reviews? Sketchy devs, graphics problems, frame rate issues, general bugs, uninteresting story, very easy, no replay value, general mediocrity and no online co-op. For more information, read some negative reviews.Why the up rating:I actually enjoyed the game for the price I got it at. The single player is generally quite easy, but there was enough challenge to keep me interested for casual play. The co-op is a good time if you have the controllers to do it. It's well designed and harder than the single-player levels. If you're looking for your typical impossible puzzle game that feeds the weak to the gods of ""online guides"" with tons of levels ranking up to an impossible difficulty, go somewhere else. It's a rather short game that's fairly easy to complete. It's too short to get repetitive, but long enough to get engaged in. I personally like this style, but it's not for everyone and thus, I'm recommending it, but not for everyone :D "

												With a puzzle structure similar to that of the ""Portal"" nature, it is easy to see this game as a rip off. Although, it is very much it's own game. having being built by a very small team as a hobby, it is obvious that this is not going to be a AAA title. But it's not neccissarily bad. A few object placement errors here and there, and fairly basic gameplay does not make a bad game. Also, both of these can be fixed with a bit of time and an update.The first half hour playing this game, the only frustration I had was a small one at that; The constant tutorial popups. They just got slightly annoying, but tollerable. Other than that, I found the game to be playable and enjoyable. Like I mentioned, the game has a portal-like puzzle structure with similar mechanics, but they are not completely the same. Overall, considering the small dev team and the time put into the game, I would say the game is really not bad. It's a fun, entertaining little something to do that passes time, which, for a small indie puzzle game, is all I expect it to be and do.I have recieved this game for free as a gift from te developers and I am appreciative of the free game. Thanks guys!			"

 TL;DR It's a pretty solid game with the few exceptions of bugs and painfully simple puzzles The game is pretty much a straight rip of Portal, but still enjoyable at times the game has many ""borrowed"" (Borrowed being the more generous term) mechanics for Portal ie. companion cube-esque puzzles, avoiding laser on a moving platform, etc. However, the game still makes for a fun and light puzzle game to pass an afternoon, but don't expect it to take up too much time. At this point, I have beaten this game (including bonus levels) with just over two hours, and I don't know if I really want to invite some on over to play the co-op missions(no online co-op). The game is sprinkled with a few bugs that were not really unexpected from a small indie dev, but can be annoying none the less (ie. clipping issues with cubes or cubes just straight up disappearing).Overall, if you're looking to  play  a first person puzzle game that comes with some real challenge and story, just pick up the portal bundle. However if you're just looking for a way to throw away a few hours on something sort of challenging and fun, and this game happens to be on sale, why not but I wouldn't recommend paying the full price, I mean I got it for free.

												To be honest, this game is pretty good, I enjoyed playing this game. The graphics are nice, nice sountrack and good physics, even though there are some bugs and glitches. The puzzles however are really simple and the storyline is really short, I managed to complete the storyline in just 1 hour. I think this game is not worth buying at a price tag of $9.99, I bought the game for around $0.50 in a TF2 trading website. I think the game should be improved by adding a lot more levels and fixing the bugs.I would also recommend this game only if summer sale is happening where the game is only 20 cents or something.

												If you have played Portal, you've played it already. It's a short game where you solve puzzle chamber with cubes, except you don't have the portal gun instead you have polarity which basically mean you need to jump-switch polarity to stand on surfaces, which gets kind of repetative. I found several glitches, such as my cubes falling through walls and player falling through holes in the map, though nothing majorly game breaking that made you unable to finish the map. Only a few of the collectibles weren't in obvious locations, and I doubt many PC players will be able to play the co-op, which means you can only ever get 80% of the achievements.			"

												Polarity has a nice idea, but that's all. To me it felt like there was a big lack of ambition to make something good. It feels pretty halfhearted. The puzzles are pretty simple, data fragments are mostly on the way. Single player + Bonus levels with all fragments took me about one and a half hour to play through, although much time is just spend with running around in those huge rooms. And I have no idea, why they are this big. The ""music"" is just some ambient tootling, the SFX boring (why are there footsteps when move a hovering robot?). The level-design wants to be Tron-like, but is just sterile and boring. Having in mind that this game costs more than Portal, which has way better graphics and atmosphere, a nice story and challenging puzzles I wouldn't know, why to recommend this game. Maybe, if you get it for less than 1€. Maybe.			"

												After reading so many good reviews, I decided to buy this game on sale. And I must say, I was really disappointed.Explaining why: the levels are pretty straightforward, since there isn't two or more ways to beat the maps, there is only the solution way. Also, in my opinion there is something really wrong whenever you spend more time moving your character through the huge maps, instead spending time trying to solve the puzzle itself and that bothered me a lot.That is my honest opinion, but feel free to disagree.

												So, i personally like puzzle games and i played the entire single player and the local multiplayer campaign (solo).The first impression was not so bad (it has a bit portal feeling), so i kept playing this game waiting for the game to become a bit challenging. Unfortunately this never happened. This game is way to easy and the path is allways obvious.Also you can play the multiplayer easily alone (just by switching controllers), there are no elements of tight timings where you actually need another player.

												Fantastic little puzzler. Nothing too taxing on the brain, but attempting to find all of the data packs (there are three of them hidden in each level) can be a real challenge and the idea of polarity-switching is used to good effect. The similarities to Portal are well-known at this point; you find yourself in a sleek, enclosed environment and use your wits (and cubes) to reach the exit. If you enjoyed Portal, you'll enjoy this, but it would be doing the game a disservice to call it a Portal clone; it has its own ideas and systems that are well thought-out and smoothly executed throughout. The game is void of any real plot or humour, but those things aren't needed here. It's a simple little game and quite a relaxing way to flex your puzzling muscles for an hour or two, without any extra baggage forcefully added on. I've not been able to enjoy the co-op campaign just yet, but if the singleplayer is anything to go by then it must be a lot of fun. There's certainly potential for a sequel here and I hope to see more from this developer in the future.			"

												I was having a reasonable amount of fun until I got to level five, which, unless I'm completely mistaken about the puzzle's solution, involves jumping from a moving platform to a stationary platform, perpendicularly to the motion of the former. We've all done this in hundreds of games before without a problem, but this game doesn't seem to understand the concept of inertia. Assuming I'm jumping forward at the same speed the platform is moving, the combined momentum should result in a vector 45 degrees between either axis of motion. Instead, the instant I jump the platform's momentum seems to double, sending me shooting out, impossibly, ahead of the moving platform. In what $%&#ing physics does this make any sense? Has no one else had this problem? Is it foreshadowing later puzzles in which this bizarre characteristic of moving platforms is part of the solution? I'm too frustrated to stick around and find out. Luckily I only paid 19 cents for the game. That said, it might have been worth the asking price of $4.99 if this physics glitch didn't render it unplayable. Glad everyone else seems to enjoy it, though.			"

												This game has a very simple purpose: to be a puzzle game from a small time developer working on their own. Does it work? To a point, maybe. It does have some things that challenge you to think for a minute, but there's nothing really challenging about the puzzles themselves. The only challenge is that sometimes your character won't move in the right way, and that's something out of our control. Does it satisfy my puzzle addiction in the way Portal did? Not a chance. This is way more obvious than Portal. This is more of a skill game than a puzzle game.			"

												Don't let the bad reviews stop you from getting this game.Did I buy it? Yes. Was it worth it? Definitely.While this game was short and quite clearly a Portal-style remake, Polarity is a fun 3D Platform game. The goal is to get to the end of each stage while collecting data fragments along the way (there are 3 for each stage). Using only your intelligence and a few colored cubes placed in specific locations on the map, you run and jump through 11 stages in story, 10 stages of bonus levels and some stages in Co-op (I admit, though, I never tried Co-op). While simplistic, the challenge of collecting the data chips makes it a little more exciting. It's a nice, simple, short game, that is still worth playing.The only con I would have to say is the ending.. It left me wanting more. A lot more. As for the soundtrack? I actually liked it. It was catchy. tl;dr short, fun 3D platform game that can be a little challenging, but wish it was longer. The music is now permanently engraved into my brain.8.5/10			"

												On the whole, a very nice game. The puzzles have some interesting twists and the asthetic is nice.There does seem to be a little lack of polish. The textures dont always lign up correctly and there are 2 level 10's in coop and no 11, most annoyingly is the where floors that should be flat have a slight lip on  that can allow the character to get stuck on what appears to be nothing.It should be noted that walking is far too slow, at least for me. This means I have to hold run all the time... if there was always run or if run was a toggle, the problem would be aliviated.Noe that coop is split screen, considering the only gaming friends I have play over the net, a network coop would mean I sont have to play both players, which is cumbersom.As far as coop goes, there is not much integration between the two players. For the most part, you complete your half of the level and the other player either completes theirs, or just just go to the finish.All in all, a fun game and worth playing, just a little short with a few issues.

												This is quite a fun game actually, even though it's completely overpriced and short and it has a brief if not non existant storyline and its also a complete rip-off of portals cube system (even though it's slightly different). I got a free key from the developers so I didnt actually buy it but I would for $5 USD. Its got promise but it's in the state of a greenlight/early access game. The game description says ""Uncover the mystery"", well to be brief this game is anything but mysterious. SO GO AHEAD WASTE YOUR MONEY. But like I said before its still very fun and I loved playing it, I just think it could use many more levels than it has at the moment and a better story line but until then the price should be dropped significantly.

												This is actually pretty decent puzzle/platformer. Only one level gave me an issue and that was a game mechanic that hadn't been told to me but a few seconds of a youtube video cleared that up. There are videos on youtube showing off the levels. Over all this is a pretty decent game. Wished it was online coop so I could do those levels.			"

												Gives a portal vibe but far less creative or polished. Though the largest annoyance to me is that the purpose of the levels isn't the puzzle itself, it's making you scrounge the corners of the level for the three collectibles. It really puts a drag on the already boring experience. Good thing I didn't pay for it.			"

												It's very simple, and so far I've spent zero time scratching my head thinking about what I need to do next. Instead, the ""puzzles"" are quite straightforward and obvious, and this is more of a basic platforming game than anything else.The phase switching mechanic doesn't add a whole lot of challenge or depth. Just make sure you're red when you walk onto the blue path and you're good to go. Once I had to switch phases mid-jump to pass through a laser beam, and that's about as complicated as it gets.I'm glad I got this game when it was on sale, because I'd be very upset to have payed full price for what I got. If you don't have it already, use that money to buy Portal instead. If you've played Portal before, this game offers nothing new for you.			"

												This game is only good if you want to waste an hour or two. Longer than that may result in extreme boredem from this game. I've completed it and done all the extra bonus stages. However, it only took me 2 hours to complete. Each ""Puzzle"" is pretty much copy and pasted from the previous puzzle. Not to mention the 30 seconds it took for me to figure out what to do. ""Demanding all your wits and reflexes"" is a gross over statement of this entire game. It has somewhat of a ""story"" but it isn't even remotely coherent.  DO NOT buy this game at full price. €15 for a game that give you 2 hours of gameplay is NOT WORTH IT.  I bought this game fairly cheap (99c I believe) and all of a sudden the price is €15. It's simply outragous. Save your money and don't get riped off.			"

												My recomendation comes with a caveat: buy it on sale. It doesn't have to be as low a sale price as the one I bought it for ($0.54), but $11 is too much for this game.That said, This is a decent puzzler even if it is rather on the short side. It more closely resembles Q.U.B.E. than Portal, but I suppose everyone is going to go for the best know comparison rather than the most similar.One nitpick, in case the developer reads this: the sliver of story somewhat explains the asthetic, but not the level design or the puzzle mechanic.  It doesn't really add anything and the game might actually have been better off without those little bits of text.Edit: I just discovered that the UI doesn't properly handle old aspect ratio (4:3) monitors. This is fairly minor, since the game engine handles them fine and there is very little actually cut off by this, but it is kind of odd.			"

												For just .54 cents this game is a steal!  Fun, first person puzzle game.  Reverse your polarity to go thru like-colored force fields.  Collect data, collect colored cubes to activate doors, ramps, etc.  So far, this game is fun, the puzzles are not too difficult yet, but I can see that they are getting progressively harder.   It reminds me of Anti-Chamber, yet does not appear as difficult to achieve.  It is a great casual game, when the high-end games are stressing you out. :)   Get it while it's on sale!			"

The running and swapping colors is very fluid, but the sections with the slow moving platforms had me rocketing to my death like I'd jumped off a speeding car.

												This game is SHORT, but it's a lot of fun. It's in the vein of Portal but without anything but the mere hint of a story. You are a ""hacker"" who, instead of using computers at all, uses colored light and switches to achieve your aims, collecting ""data fragments"" that are just collectibles scattered throughout the level. This thin excuse for a story aside, it's got good mechanics. You can reverse your polarity to either red or blue to pass through lasers and forcefields, or have your polarity opposite so you can walk across light bridges. There are a lot of putting-cubes-on-switches and jumping through forcefields while changing your polarity midair, and it gets pretty easy near the end once you've gotten the hang of it. It feels like I just finished the tutorial level and am waiting for the bigger levels.8/10 overall, mostly for game length. You should definitely buy this, but don't pay more than $5 or you'll feel ripped off.			"

												I will say that this game is fairly easy and there isn't much to it, but that doesn't make it bad. Sure, it's short, it isn't nearly as challenging as an other puzzle game I've played (Portal, The Talos Priciple, Portal 2, etc.), and it likes to stutter from time to time, but it is only $0.54....oh wait...that's the price at 95% off >,> And if you are wondering, it IS possible to play most of the co-op levels by yourself, I am working on the rest of them when I find the time, for those of you without any friends....that play this game of course...because I have friends....they...just don't play this game.But like I said before, it isn't a bad game, but it really isn't worth the $20.00 it would cost you if it wasn't on sale.I'd rate it higher if the price was either lower than twenty dollars or if it had more content, but for now, I'd give it a 4/10.

												I lost interest in under an hour. The puzzles are far too easy, and the difficuly curve is stagnant if it even exists. I may come back and beat it,  and I'm still glad I bought it, but If i had paid the full $10.99 for this I would be extremely dissapointed. I would recommend buying this game if it were under $2, and if you prefer relaxed puzzle games.Why is there a run button? I feel like no one wants to walk, but it was just added because a lot of games have one. The areas that make you run/jump and change colors require 4 key presses, shift being the most awkward, as though I'm playing twister with my hand. just make the player always run. Sometimes I'll throw a box at the wall to grab a data fragments, and the box goes through the wall. Two things here: data should be collected on contact, secondly, fix the wall glitch.I'm not a fan of the use and design of the UI. The tutorial buttons pause the game, almost always when I was in mid jump, for the first message, I had just happened to be clicking right as it popped up, and accidentally closed it after it showed for a 10th of a second. I never got a chance to read it. they should really just stay up, without pausing the game, and dissapear after a few seconds. lastly, I don't like that a ""next level"" button appears at the end, would be nicer if it just went to the next level.The game has a confusing optional yet kinda required data collection, side thing. I say take that out entirely, and force the player to do every puzzle. This would remove the need for back-tracking, level selection, and all of those things that break the immersion of the game. Most of the data finding added nothing to the game, other than make me bored whilst checking nooks and crannies. Only a few data hiding spot added some fun, and you might as well just work those into the mandatory path of the level.Story was non-existent, normally I don't care, but, it's just another example of how the game aimed low in all areas except... technical implementation: the game is almost bug free; It handles pretty well. The only bug I saw was mentioned earlier, Nothing else really annoyed me, outside of the game's design.Keep at it, and try to take more risks. It's a neat concept that can lead to a really great game, but it just needs better level design			"

												TL;DR: I recommend this game, but not at this price.To get it out of the way: There have been some accusations of shady behavior. First: the release date of the game changed several times, putting it back on the new releases list. The dev claims this was due to a bug, many claim it was done intentionally to get the new releases publicity. I follow the axiom of ""never ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence"" and so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.The other thing is that the price of this game has changed several times. This is fully within a game dev's rights, and the dev's claim that when the price has changed it has stayed that way for a decent length of time rather than quick changes to game the sales seems to hold (mostly) true. You can see the sale data at http://steamsales.rhekua.com/search.php?term=Polarity the July 15, 2016 spike is the only part that does seem a little shady. At the end of the day, the pricing data is available, and as a consumer you should be doing your research about purchases rather than getting sucked in by sale percentages.So the game itself. Worth $10? no, sorry. Thing is, the game has gone on sale many times, for as low as 19 cents. Wait until it's less than a dollar, or part of a cheap bundle to pick it up. Alternatively, you can get this game for actually free if you have ""Out There Somewhere"", another game by the same dev, and give them your email in the launcher.The game itself is pretty solid FOR DIRT CHEAP. It's not a great game by any means. It's pretty short. At no point in the main or bonus stages (didn't play the co-op) did I ever feel like a puzzle was challenging. The game introduces a lot of mechanics that could have been explored in more depth with much more complicated puzzles, but just weren't, such as the rotatable launchers that you almost never have to rotate. The game also has its fair share of bugs, for instance I was able to clip cubes through floors a few times, I managed to bypass an entire puzzle just by jumping to the exit, and I also managed to get in a configuration that soft locked a level, forcing me to restart from the beginning.Other than that, I did enjoy my short time with the game. The puzzles generally took a little bit of tinkering with to get all the data, even though they're completely straightforward. I originally started this as a positive review, but I realized that the only way I could recommend the game was with the thought ""what can you expect for less than a dollar?"" But it isn't less than a dollar, it's currently 10, and as a 10 dollar game it's garbage.			"

Avoid this game espically for the $10 price.  The COOP is even worse than the gameplay.   (also, if you want it, i got it for free by buying out there somewhere. May or may not still work)			"

												Game blurb: ""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal. Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes. Full-featured local co-op campaign.""Know how sometimes you wish you could rate a game ~ for meh?Because its NOT very much fun, it does NOT take it to 'the next level' and it demanded NONE of my wits and reflexes. Polarity is to Portal as Monopoly Junior is to MonopolyIn saying that, I bought it for US$0.16, sold 3 cards worth US$0.06 each so have made a profit of US$0.02. Also, after I finished the game (main and  I let my 5 year old play it and she promptly passed the first half of the stages before getting stuck - so she will enjoy it at least.So considering it did keep me and my daughter entertained for a little bit and made profit I have to recommend this game.TL;DR Portal for ages 5-15, for anyone else it could turn a profit if you get it on sale.

[Campaign + Bonus Levels, no Co-op = 1 hr 8 min]Otherwise, it's pretty fun.Picked it up for $0.19 so it was definitely worth it.It also has trading cards.Only pick it up on sale, and I do recommend it.

												I payed next to nothing for this, and wasn't expecting much. But it's actually a totally solid first person 'test chamber' puzzler.  Only took a couple of hours to go through (cause I didn't have anyone to play the co-op levels with) but it was totally enjoyable the whole time.  The levels weren't too easy, but weren't hard enough that I got stuck for more than a couple of minutes. Overall it was just a very well paced, stripped down puzzler.  Certainly worth a shot, and criminal if goes unnoticed.			"

												A fun and relatively novel puzzle game. While the puzzles border on trivial in places the game make use of some interesting game play elements. I really like the idea of the switching polarity and I think there is a lot of potential to expand upon the mechanic. The level design is simple but appealing and the soundtrack has a nice ambient, soothing quality that I think really suits the gameplay.The only real complaints I have are the polish, difficulty, and length of the game.During gameplay, there wer scattered instances of getting caught on small edges and sequences of accelerators. I don't think it detracts from gameplay too much but with the timing component it seems like this has potential to frustrate speed runners.The difficulty is obviously subjective and I understand that it can be difficult to strike a balance here. I think the game would benefit from the addition of more challenging puzzles, either by developer addition, or support for community creation.The campaign and bonus levels felt a bit short overall. Obviously there could be replay value for people wanting to improve time overal but without a leaderboard for friends this might be rather niche.Overall, I like the game and recommend it for people who like relaxing puzzle games.

												Don't let the bad reviews stop you from getting this game.Did I buy it? Yes. Was it worth it? Definitely.While this game was short and quite clearly a Portal-style remake, Polarity is a fun 3D Platform game. The goal is to get to the end of each stage while collecting data fragments along the way (there are 3 for each stage). Using only your intelligence and a few colored cubes placed in specific locations on the map, you run and jump through 11 stages in story, 10 stages of bonus levels and some stages in Co-op (I admit, though, I never tried Co-op). While simplistic, the challenge of collecting the data chips makes it a little more exciting. It's a nice, simple, short game, that is still worth playing.The only con I would have to say is the ending.. It left me wanting more. A lot more. As for the soundtrack? I actually liked it. It was catchy. tl;dr short, fun 3D platform game that can be a little challenging, but wish it was longer. The music is now permanently engraved into my brain.8.5/10			"

I really don't recommend buying this game on its full price, its too short and can be finished in 2-3hrs. It has an achievement of playing with someone but can only be accomplished through local co-op using a game controller. Probably buy it when it is on 90% sale if you want to play just to pass time.Over all had fun and why not it's free.. so 7/10 "

												Polarity is first person puzzle game which takes place in a cyberspace full of dark neon colours. This and the quiet,ambient soundtrack really creates a satisfying atmosphere which really sets a good mood to solving the puzzles. The puzzles themselves are well  designed, and strike a good balance between deducing/problem solving and timing and acting.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good first person experience, and especially those who are fans of puzzles games like portal or the talos principle.

												This is yet another FPS puzzler inspired by portal, this one takes additional inspiration from the polarity mechanisms of games like ikaruga and outland. Unfortunately, I can only recommend this to people who loved both portal outland AND ikaruga, and even then this should be bought on sale. This is because this game is very unpolished, movement seems weird and laggy, the story feels very cheaply made and with no voice acting, and worst of all: The physics is terrible with cubes easily glitching through walls and stuff. There are just so many better FPS puzzler games out there these days that there is no purpose in giving this a chance. The dev probably realizes this as well which explains why I was able to buy this on a huge 95% sale.this picture pretty much sums up why you should not buy this game:

Buy when its on sale (I got it for $0.19)With that being said, the gameplay does remind of portal for a few aspects.  The main concept of the game is switching between the 2 ""Polarities (Red and blue) to pass through certain walls and stand on certain platforms.  This aspect doesnt really come in as much as it probably should though.  For certain levels, its not necessary at all.  Still, if its on sale for under $1, I would certainly recommend it. "

												The Good-Enjoyable portal clone-Gameplay is quite fun-Music is solid-Relatively unique visual style (reminds me of Tron)-Teaches the player controlls without holding their hand in learning gameplay mechanicsThe Meh Stuff-Sounds were hit and miss - example: jump sounds were bad and off time with visuals fairly often but sounds for the cube and polarity shift were good-Gameplay elements were unique but there are only a few to learnThe Bad-EXTREMELY short game - I finished the single player and bonus missions in one sitting; less than an hour and a half total-The jump mechanics do not function very well, especially when trying to make multiple jumps in a row. This makes some levels a bit frustrating.-EXTREMELY easy game - even the most ""challenging"" levels only take a couple minutes to finish. Several of the data (the things you collect each level) are in plain sight or hidden in painfully obvious hiding places. There is little to no challange in the puzzles. Overall, I thought the game was enjoyable but definately not worth $11. I did not play the coop or vs modes, so perhaps these modes give some extra worth. I bought it on sale so it was dirt cheap.

But I got to mention. I would have given this category a pass, because I paid only 0.17€, but seeing it up for sale for 10.99€ is just ridiculous.N/A:~Multiplayer~Story~Vehicles/Mounts "

												I dont mind the bad graphics it feels a bit like playing some retro game which is nice from time to time, but:- The ""Story"" is very short. There are a few bonus levels but they arent much either.- Every level is pretty easy and everything is obvious.- Overall it feels unfinished. There are too many map errors. Holes where you fall out of the map, gliching textures, walls that are just placed completly wrong where textures dont align and there are holes where you can look out of the map.- Not much variation. Every level just feels pretty much the same because they are easy and there arent many elemnts in the game.- Rotating rooms are a nice touch but can bug the game pretty bad. (disappearing cubes that cant be reset, glitching through other rooms, accidentally falling out of the map and glitching the cubes into/through the glass.Fazit (tl;dr):It's the beginning of a nice idea but thats about it. It's not worth the full price, maybe get it when its on sale for ~1€, but otherwise go play something else.			"

												Very short game. Finished both the ""story"" and the bonus levels in less than 2 hours. There are a few more co-op levels, but those require either two ""pads"" (gamepad?) or a keyboard and gamepad.Overall the levels are on the simple side. Some of the bonus levels are broken (in the sense that you can skip half the puzzle). The player model gets stuck on ledges, and cubes will not follow the player physics very well, causing it to move sluggish, or to fall right through a moving platform. The mouse sensitivity is set very high by default (360 turns with less than a cm mouse movement), but can be turned down from the main menu.Overall I think there are better puzzle games for this price.

												The game is quite good. Nothing amazing compared to Portal or even last year's The Turing Test, but still fun while it lasted. The Puzzles are fairly easy and there aren't too many of them (22, not counting the dedicated co-op levels that I haven't tried yet), so definitely bear in mind that playtime is limited to a bit less than two hours for singleplayer. That is, if you have played Portal-esque games before.In a lot of negative reviews you can read that the game feels unfinished. While it is true that the graphics look kinda ugly for a 2014 release, I personally didn't expect much more with this being an Ouya-port. On the other hand, gameplay-wise I don't really see where the complaints are coming from. I never found myself in a deadlock due to bad level design (not that I looked for one, but yeah) and it never felt like I would be fighting with the controls or anything. Throwing boxes around often takes a bit of trial and error, but it didn't reach the point of me getting frustrated or anything.The Levels, again, are fairly easy, but they do have a nice progression to them with the bonus levels, unlocking after the main campaign, being the most interesting ones.Story-wise, it's pretty forgettable. Something about hacking a secure computer system and extracting sensitive data, but it could really be anyting as it never comes into play in the levels themselves.I guess I would be more harsh to the game if I had paid full price, but for the current asking price of 99 cents, I got what I was looking for.

												The game has potential but there are some large problems: 1. It is not particularly well optomized, for a small game with small arenas I had significant stuttering in later levels. I have had less in some levels of the 2013 Tomb Raider.2. The game is not very polished, a bit the opposite. Numerous obvious graphical issues, clipping, and inability to scale very small steps due to bounceback became major annoyances as the game wore on.3. The levels were easy. Really easy. None took more than 10 mins to complete, and all were quite simple. The only difficult ones were harder due to lack of understanding more than actual gameplay challenge.4. The main issue however is the price to gameplay ratio. In less than an hour and a half (87 minutes in fact) I completed the entire story and every bonus level, collecting 100% of their data. The only part I did not do was the multiplayer since it is local only and only playable with 1 or more controllers. I was able to complete the first multiplayer level solo in less than 5 mins, but both players must reach the end to win. I recieved the game for free due to my purchase of another game (Particle Mace), and got 1.5 hours of mild enjoyment. For the full price, 11 dollars, this is absolutely ridiculous. Paying 11 dollars for an hour and a half of gameplay is about as good a deal as purchasing The Order: 1886.Edit: I tried local multiplayer with a steam controller and keyboard, the controller character's movements were delayed by like 20 seconds, absolutely unplayable.

												Portal for people with bad computers (I mean for those who want to play Portal 2), no portal mechanics but everything else seems to be the same gameplay, would recommend it if it wasn't at this price, I'd pay 2usd or less for this game, since there's nothing original about it, okay there's SOME mechanics that this game has and Portal doesn't, and viceversa, but it's not enough. Besides not being original, it's not that fun anyway, also too short. The plot is a joke ""you are a hacker, win the game and I give you money"" ""you won the game, have the money, and we will hire you to do more of the same"", there's no plot at all in the game besides intro and when you beat the last level, which is literally just the text I said but without being simplified. There's a lot of obvious to find bugs and levels that were designed in a rush and are flawed af. Examples: You can force a red cube through a blue laser wall by pushing yourself against it, which is pretty gamebreaking, I wasn't even sure if it was a bug or not at start, how could they let such a bug in the game. If you stand in a part of a level where you can spin the walls with a button, and do it, you will get stuck in the wall while it spins, and when it stops spinning you go flying upwards (and stop being stuck)I admit I didn't try coop yet but I don't think the experience will be any different.TL;DR Go buy Portal instead			"

												Inspired from Portal and themed by computer science-like style. The game has nice graphics, it has  good controls and has NOTE! ..some good puzzles.. the game is very short but offers other gamemodes like multiplayer. If you like Portal, you might like this one as well. I was expexting more from a 7 euro game. Then again if you like these kind of games, I would suggest to try it :)			"

												The game has potential but there are some large problems: 1. It is not particularly well optomized, for a small game with small arenas I had significant stuttering in later levels. I have had less in some levels of the 2013 Tomb Raider.2. The game is not very polished, a bit the opposite. Numerous obvious graphical issues, clipping, and inability to scale very small steps due to bounceback became major annoyances as the game wore on.3. The levels were easy. Really easy. None took more than 10 mins to complete, and all were quite simple. The only difficult ones were harder due to lack of understanding more than actual gameplay challenge.4. The main issue however is the price to gameplay ratio. In less than an hour and a half (87 minutes in fact) I completed the entire story and every bonus level, collecting 100% of their data. The only part I did not do was the multiplayer since it is local only and only playable with 1 or more controllers. I was able to complete the first multiplayer level solo in less than 5 mins, but both players must reach the end to win. I recieved the game for free due to my purchase of another game (Particle Mace), and got 1.5 hours of mild enjoyment. For the full price, 11 dollars, this is absolutely ridiculous. Paying 11 dollars for an hour and a half of gameplay is about as good a deal as purchasing The Order: 1886.Edit: I tried local multiplayer with a steam controller and keyboard, the controller character's movements were delayed by like 20 seconds, absolutely unplayable.

												A simple puzzle game.Let me say this up front, I was very close to hating this game, and giving it a negative review. Then I realized the cubes can be respawned back at their original places.Once I knew that, and had no reason to restart at every little miss throw of the cube, the game went on without a hitch.Polarity is one of those games that you can't really find anything wrong with. It's indie so you can't blame it for small unpolished things, like say getting caught on stairs so you have to jump. However, even with nothing wrong, that doesn't mean that it has enough things right to be perfect.Still a good game though.			"

												There is a read me option on the main menu that explains this game was made by a small team working part time, which makes me sympathetic. I know now why the game isn't very good. I do not know how they think it is worth $10 dollars.Pros:The graphics will not offend you.Cons:This game has a story if you believe reading the menu at a Mexican restaraunt is equivalent to watching a tella novela.I was constantly getting stuck on slight inclines on the floor. Where it happened most? The tunnels leading to and from every level.Blocks can disappear behind walls or flat out disappear for seemingly no reason. You also stop holding the block if you are holding it close to the wall, for some reason.Platforming sections feel like you are being punished for no reason, with instant death pits in the middle of the room when you could have just made more floor and jump distances that flip a coin as to whether or not you actually stick to the very edge of the platform you are expected to jump on to.Some gameplay features are never explained. If you had to search how to even begin Level 10, you know what I am talking about.Overall:You shouldn't expect anything great. The biggest puzzle of this game is figuring out why the floors and walls of this place are screwing with you. Play this only if you have just played Portal for the millionth time and still want to solve puzzles, but are worried because you now hear Glados talking everywhere you go. And even then, you should only buy it on sale or as a part of a bundle, like I did.			"

												I would only recommend this game if it is on sale for a few dollars. It was fun, but I was able to beat the single player, including bonus levels, in about two hours. Puzzles aren't as difficult as other games and the ""story"" isn't really a story. I got the game on sale and it was an entertaining two hours. Can't comment on the multiplayer. There is a bug with higher refresh rate monitors; I had to turn my refresh rate down to 60 Hz because I couldn't jump whenever I wanted to jump. It was hit or miss at 144 Hz and dropping the refresh rate took care of the issue completely.			"

												I bought the game for 0,19€. I completed 100% of achievements in 3h 50mins (needed to start over after re-format). I completed the ""co-op"" campaing 95% alone, playing with 2 controllers. Only one of the puzzles required timing so I had my girlfriend play that one through with me. I would not recommend this game because the puzzles were not challenging at all. You don't get the same kind of excitement that you get from ""the game"" this game tries to cash in on. The ""data"" that you collect is usually hidden in a place that isn't required to access to complete the puzzle, I found this to be stupid, made me replay few maps. The graphics are alright, little bit monotone though. Most of the maps are ""too big"" so you spend large amount of time just running around, not ""completing a puzzle"".			"

												this game is not so hard in the beginning but after like 8 levels is getting harder i think i'ts a realy good game pretty simple but still pretty hard. i think you sould giv it a try and if you don't like it you can just refund it. (if you wanna refund you just press help in the top left corner of the screen and then you wil se polarity and then you just press it and it asks if you want to refund). But my opinion is that this game is very fun it is even funnier in co op. :DPS: Games are fun :D			"
