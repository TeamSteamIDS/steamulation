												How is this not on early access?For an early access game, it shows promise.  But EVERYTHING needs work.  You can technically climb some rocks, but don't bother if you want to actually play a good 4x4'ing game.  Play it if you like to laugh at a broken game.  It's UI is really holding the game back.  There is no indication of what gear you are in *at all* and that's so crucial in a game like this.  I found out you can hover the controls thing and it shows you if you are in 4x4 or 2x4 mode but he didn't even put the current gear in that popup.  He needs to make a proper UI.The engine repair thing looks decent in the screenshots but in reality when you ""check the water"" all it does is zoom the camera into the bottle and it gives you like +2% repair for that part.  Not only is it a waste of time and a joke to look at, but you are forced to do it over and over.Sometimes you crash into an invisible wall and you die instantly.Level 3 is so confusing.  At the start, there is no clear indication of what to do.  If you crawl over this mountain, the starting gates are there.  But it doesn't really tell you how to get to each next gate.  I guess after some practice you could figure out the order, but there isn't any real payoff in this game.  The whole thing is basically a waste of time.  It would be more enjoyable if the game was $1, not $7-8.  The controller support is terrible, virtually unusable.  I upgraded my tires to the large ones and then upgraded my suspension and it reduced the tires back to the tiny ones.  I ended up breaking the game at the end with -1% health and it was not possible to repair even with doing the full service nor could i continue playing.  The whole thing is an absolute broken mess.  But as I say, for a buck it would be fun.  A better name for this game would have been ""Wonky Rock Crawler.""Read this reviews' comments for more thoughts and replies from the developer.

			It's definitely a rock climbing game. Come for the suspension upgrades, stay for the paper people.

												Here is my ""First Play on Launch Day!"" Video Review:

			Is this new 4x4 rock crawling driving game worth your money? Find out my opinion of this new indie game right here! Wanna buy Ultimate Rock Crawler?		

My initial instincts looking at this game were right on.  And I should have listened, however I wanted to review it anyhow, and had just enough credit for purchasing it on my account.  And now, well... I will get about my 100th practice run ar refunding a game on Steam.. YAY!  :-PBugs galore, everything from god awful camera controls and angels, your truck glitching through rocks and terrain, to scoring that makes absolutely no sense.  The controls are also a mess, while using WASD makes sense, pretty much every other key doesn't and you cannot map the controls to your own liking either.  While you can upgrade your vehicle with money earned by scoring points while driving to the finish line, that also is buggy and a a slow, tedius process.  It's likely that you'll never want to play enough to actually buy many upgrades anyhow because after spending five to ten minutes in agony trying to work your rig between checkpoints, you'll likely be ready to uninstall and request a refund ASAP!The editor you ask?  Half the time when you try to test it by placing your car, the game locks up (for me anyhow), and the editor is a clunky, unresponsive, slow, and unfriendly mess.  It's even more frustrating then playing the levels that come with the game, so no thanks, UGH.No, just no.  It scored a 20% in my video review and there's no excuse for this being listed as a final release and not in early access so that at least we could maybe give the developer half of an excuse for a product this bad.

												Camera Glitches, Upgrades delete after buying new ones. The steering needs improvment. The user inferface needs an upgrade. This game is almost unplayable.			"

												This game had so much potential, unfortunately it was spoilt by very glitchy graphics where rocks would vanish as you were driving over them, only to reappear as your about to go over a steep edge, added to this, certain upgrades disappear when you add new ones, for example, returning your vehicle to standard small tires once you add higher suspension. Also the hint system to show you which direction the next checkpoint is, is also very flawed. Very disappointed in this game, save your money.			"
