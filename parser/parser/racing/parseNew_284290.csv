												This game is a scam, IMHO. Edit 2015/11/20 : well moreso a scam when it would barely run on my old computer (Radeon HD 7970 -- still a very very powerful card) but on my entirely new computer, a year later, the game runs better.  Still not much more than 30 fps, and on a Radeon R9 290 it can run Witcher 3 at a higher framerate.  Either way, original review below:I saw the screenshots, figured it looked amusing, so I figured I might as well try it out.  I saw salinger06 had left a positive review, seemed like a relatively safe guess that it would be a good game.  Before even playing the game, I noticed that salinger06 had no other games on their account, so it was likely that the developers had set up a fake account to leave a review.  Who signs up to steam to buy just THIS game?  I noticed that user only has 1 friend, Avreus Culter.  I look at his account, and it's full of these ""simulator"" games from PlayWay, I find that suspicious since they have generally recieved horrible reviews.  Now today, Avreus has left a positive review on this game as well!  Hmm!  I click on his review, and there is one comment from seph.au stating ""Yet another dev or family of dev self review. "" Furthering my suspicion.Now, that aside, maybe the game is indeed fun, so just now I go and try it out.  My system specs:  AMD Phenom II quad core processor, Radeon 7970, 8GB DDR3.  I can play any game on the highest options, I usually hold back on antialiasing (I don't go above 4x on the latest games) but generally any game I can max it out and play it smooth as silk.  I boot up the game, max settings.  It loads and is extremely slow, like 5 frames per second.  I remember seeing people complain about ""Mining Simulator"" being rediculously poorly written and causing people to run it on lowest settings, so that's what I did, get out of the game and try everything on medium.  Same exact performance.  Hmm.  Okay, just for fun, I tried every option on the LOWEST settings...  It was marginally better, maybe 10 FPS, still completely unplayable.  But just to see what the game was like, I tried to struggle through a race.  The game engine is really bad.  There was little to no effort put into this game.  How a person could log more than an hour into it boggles my mind.  I wouldn't wish this game upon my worst enemies and I think the entire PlayWay catalog should be removed from Steam and those customers refunded if they wish.  This is a scam.Edit: Apparently someone has said that this game will run on nVidia GeForce graphics cards.  So if you have a Radeon, don't even consider it, if that's the case.  I literally can't play the game to log more time to give it an honest chance.			"

												Definitely not great. Really feels like they took Farming Simulator 2014 and just dropped a few barrels in a map editor to make this. Completely a bare minimum release, with carried over terrible physics from FS 2014 and no cool extras. No multiplayer?Pick up Farm Sim 2012 instead?2 out of 5.

												Farm Machines Championship 2014 puts you behind the wheel of a tractor for forty dull events. It varies in nuances of relaxing country races, to mundane and tedious beat the clock lawn mowing challenges. I will admit that the premise alone of driving a tractor through these events could be interesting, just as much as it can be comedic gold and this game strays to the latter far too often.There's a thin like between relaxing and boring and there are plenty of times where the game feels like its more chore than fun.The only game mode is a tournament, where you participate in forty events. Here you will enter into events for a fee and make money for placing bronze, silver or gold. With the money you can purchase new tractors and upgrade your own. You can also change the paint job to coincide with sponsors. Some sponsors will pay your entry fee and I wish the game went further for this, such as sponsors demanding no less than bronze and if you fail them three times, you've lost the sponsor.The tractor skins are perhaps the most creative part of the game. Skins like a police officer, a rhino, a dragon and a hot rod. It all shows that someone put time and thought into the design, but little else  into the overall game. There are a lot of ideas, but they're all so shallow. For a game title Farm Machines Championship, I expected to drive a wider variety of farm machines than just tractors. There's no shame in calling this Farm Tractor Championships, unless the Farm Machines Championship is a real organization.Earning a medal in each event will unlock the next. You can even replay previous events, but once was enough for me. The grass mowing is easy enough and quick enough when you go fifty to sixty miles per hour, but its just the variations of grass mowing. You have field clearing, then bailing lines of hay with a round bailer and even tilling the ground. There is an event for following a combine to catch the wheat in your trailer. Its all the same and there's no competition other than the clock. Its the same patterns, even if you're doing different tasks.As for the racing, its a high point in a low game. you drive from point A to point B next to fields and rivers, through a small town eager to watch you. It is relaxing yes to just drive down country roads with spectators watching from beyond barricades while mellow country guitars play. The graphics are serviceable, even if the textures are low quality, the game still looks fair and I'm saying that as a good thing. Object pop in is forgivable, because the game's world feels different and unique to create a soothing vibe even if you're in the heat of competition.Truth be told, there is no competition. You have no rivals, most events are you on your own, although the races have other rivals, but one engine upgrade and you'll leave them in the dust. For a championship this is hardly difficult on normal. If you veer too far away from the path, you'll respawn back on the path. Its also odd having a mini map that marks the track blue rather than white. There are bodies of water.Other events include a slalom that has you weaving between barrels and posts, but in reality I took out more than I went between. There's a hay race, but I'm not sure if its to collect the most hay or make it to the finish line first. Your rival competitors seem to only go forward. No one is smart enough to push backward.I understand having different events, because this is the Olympics of tractors, but please make them optional. I would say make a campaign for those events, but the tedium would wear thin and no one would play them other than to punish themselves. You could do them for achievements, which there are, but there are no Steam achievements and for some people, that's why they play. There should also be a free play or quick event option that lets you setup your own event.The game plays very casually. There are no gears or a clutch you'll need to work, just simple throttling forward and backward. Truth be told it is a better way to play that's easier, but in a game that's about driving tractors, manual would be appreciated.For a tractor, these vehicles feel light and agile rather than feeling like I can crush anything if I lose control. I suppose a tractor with a wagon going fifty mph is still going fifty mph.There are additional controls for lowering a plow, mower or straw catcher. Its also odd that several events with the mower or straw sweeper let you raise or lower the deck. There's no punishment for having the deck down, so why give the ability to raise it? Perhaps it slows you down and I just never noticed?One thing to note is that the game has 360 controller support, for driving and that's about it. The pause and camera are bound to keys and the mouse. At least there are full camera controls for your mouse, but having them for the controller would be nice too. Another sin of game development is when you're in the menus with a controller, the analog stick takes control of a very slow cursor.But you're reading this to hear about the errors. There's nothing awful here. Sure the right side of your wagon is always a different shade than the other wagon and sometimes its a different color. Object pop in always happens so far away that its never an issue. We've discussed the controller issues. It seems like my wagon can bring a powerful tractor to a halt. Sometimes tractors will bump into the air, but never to a point of comedy. Zooming in on the wheels reveals that the tractors are hovering. The load screens are also notably long.While I never expect much going into a budget game focused on tractor racing, i can say it did get me dreaming of what could have been and that became the disappointment.For all the bad, Perhaps next year it will be deeper.

												Gameplay is slow, controls are clunky, progression is hamfisted, and the presentation is barebones. Certainly not worth $10, maybe worth $1 just for the tractor sized cowboy hat.Want to watch some gameplay? Check out my Bundle Buys video on the title!

												I like to claim to be a fan of more 'casual' racing experiences, such as GRID, Flatout and maybe Gran Turismo, so I decided to pick this game up in a bundle for 79p, thinking that it can't be TOO bad.Oh boy, how wrong was I?First of all, when plugging my USB Gamepad in and launching with it enabled, my cursor kept going to the right in-game, which is where I found out that the mouse can be controlled with the analog stick, and for whatever reason it seemed very buggy. There were also numerious spelling errors, which I can forgive since it is not an English developer.Despite all that, I started a career and entered my first race, and, simply put, I was not expecting the level of sheer incompetence in the driving. On my game controller, the left analog stick controlled throttle, brake AND steering, which was odd, so I chose to use a keyboard.My rig can run GTAV at 1080p 60fps, and it was struggling with this game, which was alarming as it looked like a game from 2006. The game controlled HORRIBLY, and the AI seems to be arguably braindead. There was a point where a rival mounted my trailer somehow, with the lackluster physics engine enabling it to. There are no engine noises, instead the pure lack of anything is filled with a really bad 'country' soundtrack, which I had definitely heard somewhere before.A game shouldn't be tedious to play, but halfway through the first race I just wanted it to stop, and that's not what you want from a game in the slightest. The most entertainment this game provided me was uninstalling it.1/10 - Don't buy it.			"

												Is this game good? No. It is an unpolished, horriffic looking, physics? wtf is that?, peice of Jim Sterling bait.    Did I have enough fun/laughs out of the measly price (74p on date of purchase)? Yes absolutely.Look, if you enjoy playing poorly made games for a few hours to give yourself/stream/YouTube/friends a laugh you should pick it up.If, however, you are looking for a game using a simulator engine (I use the term loosely) that turns things on its head, mixes up your preconceptions and knocks it out fo the park, look somewhere else.Oh also there are Shark Tractors...

												All those talk about less than 20 fps are outright lies. Here's proof:

			Farm Machines Championship 2014 2016 07 25 22 20 13 411		

I dunno what they get off by propogating such vicious lies. My potato laptop specs are:i7-2630QM 8Gb DDR3 1333 MHzIntel HD3000 / AMD HD 6770m with 1GB DDR5This was recorded at 720p and also running at 720p. The lowest resolution this game supports is 800x600, 720p is 2 steps higher. Only shadows is on, all other settings are at lowest level. I get about 23-25 fps and this is 'coz the recorder is running, if not i could get about 35 fps or more. This is just a preliminary review, more details will be posted after i've done some actual playtime.Update 2016-07-26 0235It could be described as casual racing game as it's not regular high speed races. They are farm tractors! how fast do people expect these things to go? There are some elements of authentic details in the truck models so it's not entirely casual or cartoony. Of course it's not high profile mega races sponsored by big coporations for other big coporations. The setting is based on small time farmers whose need for speed culminate in occasional racing events for the small communities. That's my take on it and i think it's a fair assessment. So if anybody come into this game expecting flashy high speed races, i can only smh.It takes place in rural locations unspoilt by high density industrial zones or busy city centres; old rustic retro kind of feel to it which i think is charming.GraphicsFrame rate is passable; not as optimized as say, Codemasters' GRID or DIRT of F1 series but it's still enjoyable as the tractors are slow moving so 30 fps should be adequate. Incidentally i got more than 30 fps at some moments but that is only possible when the recorder isn't running 'coz the first race was recorded at 720p. On my potato chips, that's pretty demanding conditions already. Maybe i can get above 30 fps with the recorder running at 800x600.The game has plenty of options to tweak graphic details but that is only available in the launcher. However no AA nor filtering nor V-Sync options in either launcher or in-game, those have to be set in the driver app. Neither can you opt for Full-Screen or Windowed mode, it defaults to FS. On my 22"" monitor, wide range of resolutions are supported from 800x600 - 1920x1080.In short graphic quality is beautiful so i dun understand what's the dissatisfaction with that. Only thing as mentioned before is that the optimization isn't top notch so either sacrifice some graphic quality or you need a very beefy rig. Since this title is not AAA league and you can sometimes get it at really low price in a bundle, i dun see why people would complain about being ripped-off. I mean c'mon are you really that cheap? People would pay similar price and be happy with 2D pixelated throwback to the 80s and sidescrolling platformer games i really fail to understand why all the hate towards this game. Give me a 3D game anytime over 2D; it takes much more effort to model real-life object in 3D than fictitious caricatures in 2D. So i have but respect for the developers. If you criticize a game so much and couldn't even produce something better yourself, maybe you should tone down your vitriol. Sorry for my rant in review space. Seems like being hateful is the cool thing these days.Ok so maybe this game is not suitable for young ones with twitchy fingers who expects adrenaline rush. It's relaxing for me and i think it's a good change of pace and setting. That said, i've only begun playing this game so maybe i would find some nasty bugs waiting to eat my savegame or crash my desktop but until then i'd say it's still a good buy if you can get it cheap.Here is the first race. See for yourselves and form your own opinions. Do not be easily swayed or stay away from potentially enjoyable games by negative reviews with no substance.

												What the ♥♥♥♥ did you just ♥♥♥♥ing say about me, you little ♥♥♥♥♥. I’ll have you know my name is John, and I woke up this morning 5:30 sharp to the smell of wet ♥♥♥♥♥. I was getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from two ♥♥♥♥♥es ♥♥♥♥♥♥was SO Cash), one was trying to fit my humongous 3 pound balls in her mouth while the other was choking halfway on my 18 and 3\8 inch♥♥♥♥♥♥ She started to squirt hard, she was convulsing and having 6 ♥♥♥♥♥♥s at the same time. I gave it to them and they were on the floor squirting like mother♥♥♥♥ing fountains. Must have come about a quart of sperm and compressed air. Imagine your best ♥♥♥♥♥♥, then multiply it by 35. I had to go to base camp so I front-flipped from my 14th floor barracks into my valet parked 2012 Ferrari (I got connexions). Pushed my♥♥♥♥♥♥to about 4 hundo (mph, mind you) and I was at base camp in no time. When I entered, I became a top sniper and was granted access to the entire arsenal of the USMC. I learned how to kill someone in over 700 different ways and was assigned to be the leader of a squad that will kill 300 terrorists using gorilla warfare tactics. Also did 6000 push-ups, 8000 sit-ups and bench-pressed 30 plates in 16 minutes. After basic training, I met a network of secret spies who will help me trace your IP address, while eating gold plated sushi and 15,000 $ champagne. My unit got the rest of the day off and I became captain of our base’s football team and starter of the basketball team. I got straight A’s on the military entrance exams and received more awards. Meanwhile, you were jacking off to pictures on Facebook and naked drawn Japanese people. Went back in the Lambo to my barracks and now I am getting ready to go to sleep. I am going to graduate at the top of my class in the Navy Seals tomorrow and I want to look pretty much perfect for it. Don’t be a stranger and remember, I did more in one day than you will your entire life.And that's the summary of this game.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. A variety of missions, medals system and upgradeable machines meant that each level was a challenge. The downside is the difficulty of some missions where seconds decide which medal will be awarded. Next minus is no multiplayer option. Its rly big thing.			"

												I like that game, and recomend it specially for the youngest ones, but the olders can find here some challenges.Hard dificulty is demanding some tactics too win and  we need to polishing our machines to chave changes with oponents.In my humble opinions game performance is really good. All achievments unlock, all misions on Gold. :) Whose the best in the Village? :D			"

												the game is really bad, it has the slowest races, if you fall behind, you literally wont catch up, you can sit there and full throttle it thoughout most of it, a lot of it is wonky as hell. I suggest looking into other farm games if that's what you're looking for.. a fun farming game.			"

												Bad in every way.  Bad graphics, Bad physics, Bad gameplay, and really terrible music.  I got this because I thought it would be funny to mess about with tractors and do dumb races but the events are so tedious there's no fun to be had at all.  There's not even the fun of ramming into opponents are the physics are so bad you just tip of or get wedged and there is no opponent AI, they just move on rails.  Got it for about 70p and it was still a waste of money.			"

												Not one Review? Aw... This program is your typical modern racing game - yes... its got 3D, nice menus, you can trick your ride, and win races and other timed events.... the big difference... you are going about 15 mph - and yes, you can roll your opponent over and keep going ....at 15 mph! lol - its like racing meets chess and then you have to mow the grass too?I say, if you're in a mellow mood, and grass sounds good to you.... try this game - I found it amusing - I didn't expect much but I found it fun - not just cause 2 fun, or a train sim or other high speed racing games - but - its cute fun and you migth be able to get them girlfriends/boyfriends...perhaps computer game challenged people to finally play something they have a chance of winning that each round doesn't end in 10 seconds if they make a mistake! Go for it - but do keep eye out - I think you might be able to get this in a bundle - I| think I did. hmm - I fergets  :D			"
