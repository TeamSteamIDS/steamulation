												I really like this game. graphics are good gameplay is great. It reminds me of Re-Volt. Though there are not really that much cars and tracks, and after 2,5 hours of gameplay I've almost finished the career mode. Also, the AI is really easy to beat, so i expect to get the most fun out of online multiplayerThe problem with the game is the price. Although I do not regret buying it, a lot of people might not buy it and online players will be scarce.If the devs make it possible to play online against console players, I expect there to be much more players.So, please devs, make cross-platform possible!

												If you have ever played a game like sonic all-stars, Mario kart, f1 all-stars, rc revenge pro, diddy kong racing, crash racing series, modnation racers or little big planet kart you would love this game. I have played all of these titles and adored them, same story with table top racing. The game has superb graphics and quick loading times between races, and runs smooth as silk on my three-year-old slow laptop. While reviewing this game a new update came out so I asked Playrise Digital on their website question form the new features and the team responded hours later. There are 6 championships or 'Cups' to complete and several special races which may require certain wheel types  and cars to participate. The vehicles are divided into three tiers/categories; Amateur (Cult Classics), Pro (Street Racers), Expert (Super Cars) which have four different vehicles to choose from in each category. From the base game there is five different style of race tracks (tables) but four variations of the course. Each car can be upgraded in top speed, acceleration, handling, armour as well as choose from four styles of paint and seven different styles of wheels. Each wheel is unique and gives a different attribute to the car; Standard, Drift (For Drifting), Bling (For Bonus Coins/Money), Sheild (Force field around the car), Centurion (Spike Wheels), Boing (Allow your car to jump/bounce and reach coins on some tables) and Peace Bomb (Disarm weapons). One thing to note is when you buy the wheels which are fairly expensive, you can use them on everyone car without having to rebuy. Opponents do not have weapons wheels until the Expert difficulty cups however, opponents may have weapon wheels in special events.There are seven different types of events; elimination (last car standing), time trial (quickest time over a set amount of laps), hot lap (quickest lap), Combat race (Race with power ups), pure race (Race without power ups), drift (race with drift wheels for drifting) and pursuit (catch up to a slower car and tag). In combat race there are several power ups; Acid, Rocket, Tracking Rocket, electric pulse, boost, bomb and ice beam, which once you pick up two power ups you get a special upgraded power up upon reaching Pro difficulty. The cars in the game generally handle with ease, however the cult classics are a challenge to turn. The opponents are extremely easy to beat in the first two difficulties but the game gets more challenging later in the game, especially the pursuits. The game also has online only multiplayer which I find impossible to find a server in Australia, the game allows the creation of one though. While typing this line I found one server and played, there was a slight jagged feel when controlling my car although this may be an internet issue for the other player. However, at this current update there is no local co-op multiplayer aka split-screen, which is a real disappointment. If you decide to purchase the 'Supercharger' DLC you get three additional championships one each vehicle tier, four additional cars, one extra track 'Can Ya Dig It?' and 16 extra special events. Included is a great drift car which will be useful if you struggle with the drift events like myself. Please do note if you want to play with some people online you need this dlc. The game features upbeat, electronic dance music which adds a nice feel to the game with a nice variety of 17 tracks by WES SMITH which you can listen to on soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/itswessmithyo . Conclusion:Table Top Racing: World Tour World Tour by Playrise Digital is a great indie title to play with friends or alone with a nice selection of vehicles, customizations and maps. The game does lack variety of tables, however I do not mind this as the game is highly addictive, and will provide at least 10 hours of fun. It is now your turn to decide whether a $20 USD price tag is a good price for the game.*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			"

												Okay, first of all, i have to mention that my 1st impression from this game was that this game, tries its best to be the Revolt - why not that game was(still is) 10/10 toy cars racing idol, so let's see if they made it or not:+Visuals - contains high-quality graphics, backgrounds, cars, tracks - everything is good.+OST - rare example when the game has modern music mixes and all of them are good, you are not getting bored listening to them they are well made. Big plus.+ Time consuming - a lot of races in the story mode + a lot of special challenge missions + multiplayer, I wasted like 7 hours to complete 1st 3 campaigns.+- 1st *problem* I faced playing this game - the difficulty is just low - story mode is very easy to complete, every single competition was completed within 1 to 5 minutes at best with 3 stars - so this is good for casual gaming, and not so good for those who loves a challenge. -Only 5 maps for a ton of races, you know after like 10-20 races you understand that your a are rolling over the same places over and over again :| DLC contains 1 more map well then-Not so many cars - you have 4 cars for each class 3*4 - 12 in total, and most likely if you will play as I do - you'll just pick the best car in its class - so you will most likely use only 3 because you have to pay coins for unlocks and upgrades. DLC contains 4 more cars with another car class.-Weird collision physics - When you collide with cars and obstacles, your car acts very weirdly :|-The last problem for me - call it personal - this game is about toy cars racing normal world BUT it does not feel like you are driving a toy car. It's more of a driving REAL car in the world where everything suddenly became enormous big. Maybe its engine sounds, maybe its turning feedback I cant say for sure, but this feeling still exists.Short conclusion - as a racing game this game is nice for casual gaming, not a big challenge, also kind of fun to derp with your friends, can't say there is much of content but they are making DLCs with cars and tracks so I think after some time this game will become big enough to become something like Revolt.

												This game is not worth the $20 price tag. It is a $10 or less game.It is a solid table top non serious acarde racer, but just not that fun or challenging. In under three hours I am almost half way through the game.The maps are not even very imaginative. There is no real feel to the different driving serfaces or maps.The game modes are pretty much all the same or things we have seen in every other game like this before. I have seen this table top theme done so much better over the years. This one is just pretty but without substance even for a game that is arcade style it lacks being fun.OH And Release day paid for DLC needs to be banned.This is getting to be the norm for many companys and in this case they have removed access to several car's in game to charge players who have already purchased the game if they want to access the full game.EDIT: I have just received a message in the comments section of my review. I will not post it in the review so all can see clearly. Playrise does seem to be demanding my review be removed does it not?PlayriseDigital  [developer] 50 minutes ago  You're not even talking about the PC game - this review needs to be removed. The bundle here is like $16.99 and £14.74.AndPlayriseDigital  [developer] Just now  DeleteYou haven't read the post abuot why Day One DLC and why the Supercharger Bundle was created to effective make the DLC very close to free. Its not a marketing tactic, it was structured like this so we can add more content and to it later and as an indie dev with limited resources, we couldn't re-write and re-bundle for PC in the time frame we had. Your assessment of our launch strategy is wrong and so I thought I'd flag this review as it is assumptive and misinformed.			"

												Table Top Racing: World Tour (TTR from now on) is a racing game that takes place on…..well, what do you think? Tables of course! The BreakdownKart racers have been around for eons, but what about…..car racers? Y’know, kart racers with real-looking cars? I suppose that’s what I’d describe TTR as. It feels like a kart racer yet the vehicles have the appearance of realistic cars, vans, or trucks. Normally I’d talk about gameplay first, but hey, why not graphics this time? Let’s switch things up! So, the game has a sort of realistic look to it, like I mentioned earlier. The tracks all consist of a table (or what generally looks like somewhere in a house) with various household objects (food, bottles, etc.) spread around the track/table. As you drive your little cars around you can then knock a lot of the stuff on the track over, which is pretty fun. The cars themselves are just a mix of realistic-looking race cars and knockoffs of cars from pop culture (the Breaking Bad RV, a “fauxrari”, etc.). Everything in the game looks pretty crisp and polished overall, so graphically I definitely have no complaints. Now onto the gameplay. Here’s where things are both good and bad. See, the game basically consists of you driving your little car around a track over and over until you win. That’s….basically it, however there’s a small variety of modes to mix things up. From the main menu there’s “Championships”, “Special Events”, and “Multiplayer”. Championships is the meat of the game, and it’ll last you about 5-8 hours or so depending on how skilled you are at racing games. Within Championships you’ll find 6 different cups with a variety of events to choose from. These events are one of a few different game modes (Combat races where you can use powerups, pure/no weapons races, a “pursuit” mode, elimination, time trials, drifting, and a “get x lap time” mode), which helps to keep the gameplay from getting too stale. On top of that, there’s collectable coins scattered around each track in some interesting hidden locations so even if you’re terrible at the game it incentivizes you to collect them and use the money they give you to upgrade your car (or buy a new one) and get better.The Special Events mode is basically a variety of events, like in Championships mode, yet there’s some very minor twists. It’s just extra content I suppose. I never got to try out the multiplayer unfortunately (no one was playing online), so I can’t comment on that mode.Generally I enjoyed my time with TTR, but what did I dislike? Well, to start, the tracks. There’s…..5 of them. That’s slightly remedied by the slight variation given to them during certain events (I believe the game refers to each track’s variations as “track A”, “track B”, etc.), but after playing what is basically the same track over and over it gets a bit old. I’d have really liked to have seen more tracks, not just the same 5 ones over and over with tiny changes here and there.Secondly, the game’s handling feels weird, at least to me. Maybe this is just a personal thing but it felt like on every turn my car would either hit a wall (at least initially) or just barely make the turn, while the AI seemed to make turns at full speed just fine. Now granted, with handling upgrades on the best cars in the game it’s not too bad, but when I had first started playing it was definitely frustrating watching myself hit walls on almost every turn. I think the speed of the cars is pretty fitting but their handling could definitely use some work, Beyond that, there’s not a whole lot to talk about with TTR. It’s fun I suppose, and pretty well-made overall. Err…...oh wait, that’s right - the music. It’s uh…..well, I think some people will enjoy it. Personally I thought it was mostly generic hip hop/electronic/dance stuff, so sometimes I just felt like muting the game and turning on my own music while I raced. However, I feel as if it’s not terrible, but simply “tolerable”, if that makes any sense. Also there’s a song that says “be drunk” repeatedly. I….I don’t even know.ProsFun, energetic kart racer gameplay across dozens of fairly varied events - racing little toy cars on tabletops is quite exciting and silly compared to real racesDecent vehicle customization is included (wheels, car types, stats, and paint jobs can all be changed)The graphics are fairly good overall - no complaints thereThe music is fairly fitting - it’s upbeat and energetic but also a bit laid backThere’s Steam achievements, cloud support for saves, and controller supportConsThere’s only 5 tracks (even if the game advertises 20 - there’s 4 slight variations to each of the 5 base tracks), so more would definitely be betterCar handling feels bizarre - AI cars turn fine, but for some reason (especially with early cars or ones that aren’t upgraded) you can only take turns super wide by default, which causes a lot of wall crashes to happenSome people may not like the music (personally I didn’t care much for it)Table Top Racing is a pretty solid fast-paced racing game with powerups. There’s a lot to like here, from the lovely visuals to the decent amount of variety in both customization options and game modes. Despite my problems with it, primarily the small number of tracks and some weird  turning problems (which are fixed with vehicle upgrades), I honestly really enjoyed playing this game. Bravo, developers - you’ve made a pretty great little racer! Final Verdict: 8/10 "

												It looks like fun, but it isnt. If you think it has the micro machines vibe, it doesnt (aside from the creativity with the tracks and obstacles) The tracks and cars all look great, but theres little variation in handling between models and there are just too few tracks. The AI is far too easy, with no option to raise or lower difficulty to your liking. (28/10/2016 update: The dev commented on this to say the AI has been improved to provide more challenge. I'm not reinstalling just to test this, but I imagine this would help with making the game more fun. The other points in the review still stand) There are lots of shortcuts you can trigger by firing missiles at them, except they often dont trigger despite hitting them directly. Some of these aren't actually quicker routes but have a special collectible that gives you money, amounts too small to bother collecting and risking losing the lead.The weapons are boring, standard missiles or bombs which either go infront or behind you (you cant chose which way to fire them). I do like the freeze one, opponents can slide off the track if you time it well. The music is annoying, and with maybe 10 or so tracks you will hear it a lot. Half the tracks are just remixes of other tracks from the game.Graphically the game is fine, has options to turn effects on or off, change resolution and windowed or fullscreen modes. I ran it on normal at a constant 60fps using vsyncMultiplayer was almost empty when i played the other night, 2 lobbies, one of which i couldnt join because it was dlc only. I didnt have any trouble wth the races online, but once it finished the host quit and theer werent any others to join.Buy it on sale, £2.74 on humble store right now, I'd say its worth that.			"

												Table Top Racing: World Tour is a mini car racing/combat racing game. This review is coming from someone who is not a fan of the racing genre and I tend to avoid racing games. This game however is an exception to that as it is extremely fun and very entertaining. It’ll remind you of Mario Kart, F1 race stars, those old Hotwheels games etc. The game is very polished and I was surprised how good the production quality is for an Indie game. Graphics:The graphics are very good, you can change settings to low, medium, high and ultra, depending on your system specs you can adjust accordingly. As it’s a table top racing game, the maps are filled with all sorts of stuff such as huge pool balls, spray cans even sushi plates and such, the cars are those cute small cars with huge wheels and they look adorable. Sound:The game features upbeat, fast paced, techno-ish soundtracks which are very suitable for racing games as it’ll keep you pumped up. There’s plenty of tracks so you won’t get tired of listening to the same tracks over and over again. Gameplay:The gameplay consists of, well, world tours of racing. You have 3 categories of races, there’s the “Amateur” level which will have the cult classic cars such as the Volkswagen beetle lookalike, Ford Mustang, Mini Cooper etc. There’s even a camper van called “Braking bad” which I thought was a hilarious reference to, you know, Breaking bad. Then there’s the “Pro” level which has street racer cars such as Nissan 350z, Skyline even a Range Rover type of car etc. The last but not the least is the “Expert” level which has super cars like Ferrari or “Fauxrari”, McLaren or “McHandful” as the game tells it. All the cars’ names will be different than their original counter-part I guess due to licenses and other such legal matters.The cars’ physics and feel is very arcade-y as it should be for a table top racing game. The cars handle fine and have plenty of upgrades/paintjobs/bling-bling rims etc. There’s quite a few customizable items to unlock. The cars also have special wheels/rims which affect your car e.g. there’s the Spartan blade rims which will damage the other racers’ cars when brushing against them. Every time you win or lose a race you will get coins and the 3-star system which will give you stars depending on how well you did on that race/event. You can use these coins to buy new cars or upgrade your already bought cars. One car in all 3 levels are unlocked for you from the start, rest you will have to buy with coins. There’s a lot of stuff which can be bought with coins, paintjobs, wheels, performance upgrades etc.You have a bunch of different types of racing modes available such as racing with power pickups, time trials and best lap time modes. The maps are small enough and most events have short races which are usually 1-2 minutes long with 3-5 laps. There’s plenty of themes like of the maps like a workshop theme which will have all those car parts lying around, sports theme such as pool stuff, kitchen theme with vegetables, sushi etc.You can also get power-ups in races such as speed boost (sort of like nitro), rocket, bombs etc. The usual type of power ups available in any combat racing game. The AI is pretty good and will try to screw you over every chance it gets. There are 3 types of racing levels, or leagues. Each has 3 tournaments which you can beat and get the trophies. The multiplayer mode is pretty dead, as of writing this review I could not find anyone playing online but then again it’s morning where I am right now so I guess people will be on at night time (as is usual for me with multiplayer games). You can also play with friends so if your friends have the game you can have plenty of fun with this game with friends. A short best lap mode race video can be found below:

												Table Top Racing: World Tour presents players with more than just its unsafe fight fuelled races, as it components a wealth of different events. Among the highlights are interests, where you ought to exhaustingly seek after down a much faster vehicle and a short time later mallet into the back of it. There's also transfer races, where the deplorable racer got in last place is constrained to go home toward the end of each lap. These race sorts may not be anything we haven't played through some time as of late, but instead in any case they make for different rapid and fun redirections. These race sorts are part into two essential classes; titles and unprecedented events. Titles fundamentally make up the beguilement's calling mode and are done up with a fabulous prix style rivalry where you'll fight for your spot on the stage. Extraordinary events differentiate as they are standalone challenges where you are depended with using a particular vehicle as a piece of demand to share. The titles particularly race to exhaust themselves as small is hurled in on the way to mix up the experience. A strong part of the things that you'll uncover over the track are disappointingly dull. In spite of the way that they disregard to have a ton of an impact on races, this is in all probability by diagram given the reasonably short length of the tracks: anything too much effective would overpower. In actuality, the stop column is truly satisfying to use, as you're prepared to change your foes into a square of ice and look as they slide over the table top. Regardless, other than that, even typical speed underpins don't feel like a beneficial get, as they're simply prepared to give your scaled down scale evaluated motor with a slight mixture of speed. Apparently the preoccupation is splendid and component, and its five essential set pieces are expertly composed with their own particular exceptional obstacles for you to move around. Evidently the rise of the five is an eighties stirred lair, which is improved with vinyl records, squares of Lego, and dusty old trading cards. While these set pieces feel stimulated and have their own specific identity, they quickly feel depleted as they are too vivaciously relied on. In the midst of the later periods of the calling for instance, these tracks are exorbitantly reused with simply slight assortments to build the inconvenience. In the wake of tearing your way through events you'll be repaid with a whole of coins that is dependant on your finishing position. Your merited cash can then be given on new automobiles and upgrades in the parking space. Part into three levels, each available auto is impeccably arranged and they keep running from Breaking Bad persuaded RV's to souped-up diversions cars. The essential issue is that once these redesigns are executed, races get the chance to be extremely basic, as limiting racers fight to equal your actually pimped out ride. The nonattendance of neighborhood multiplayer is a dreary overhaul that assembling to play with colleagues is everything aside from a diminishing memory. This is bewildering as relative titles, for instance, Mario Kart and Micro Machines are as often as possible recollected on tenderly due to their thought of disengaged forceful modes. There is the decision to play online with up to eight players, yet matches are much of the time quickly soured, as players will stop mid-delight in view of their disappointments. The Supercharger DLC Pack concurred with the dispatch of the principal redirection and joins the development of new cars, maps and titles. While the new parts do overhaul the general experience of the beguilement, there is no making tracks in an opposite direction from the slant that they should have been consolidated it from the onset and that it was simply partitioned off to monetise the redirection encourage while it's free for such an expansive number of through PS Plus. We wouldn't see any issues with paying for it under these particular conditions, however having this as paid substance when the beguilement dispatches on PC and Xbox One (and when it's a standard release on PS4) wouldn't feel right. The new title events in like manner feel truly pointless, essentially mirroring every opposition you would have played so far and incorporating alongside no in the strategy for assortment. Table Top Racing: World Tour looked set to take after the well known path designed by its exceptionally standard versatile predecessor, yet rather it fails to make the stage in light of different in the motor issues. The nonattendance of neighborhood multiplayer, some stifled pick-ups, and the foreordained number of settings are just few of the blemishes that keep this fight racer from remaining mindful of the resistance. It's adrenaline-fuelled gameplay may feel empowering the underlying few times around the track, yet tragically it's temporary as a result of a nonattendance of assortment in the midst of the races.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												I thought of this as BLUR on a small scale.""Mario Kart"" or ""F1 Race Stars"" might come to mind but are quickly forgotten. And tracks that look as good as ""The Mean Greens"" rat maps.  These maps are the main reason I bought this game.The gameplay turned out to be GOOD.  Every car feels different.  For as tiny as they are, they can feel like they have a good amount of weight to them.  There's something visceral about it.You would look and think it's EASY (against bots yeah), but once the server fills up, the chaos begins.You will grind just to get enough money to buy a supercar and upgrade it.  (the Supercharger pack is recommended.  Get it for free right now)These toy replica cars look very much like the real ones.Cars like ""Huuligun"" looking like the Hoon KenBlock Mustang or the RV camper ""Braking's Bad"" with bullet holes in the door.Racing through a restaurant with big pieces of sushi flying is the best part.  Just huge objects laying all over the road. I'm addicted.One thing I dislike online are hosts that just use Supercars over and over (the fastest class).  Slower cars are fun too!  When I host, I like to change car class and tires for everyone.  (Switch it up!)The music was surprisingly good too.  (I heard a song that sounded like Streets of Rage 2)  The bass is shaking the house.  I didn't know who WesSmith was, but now I do.Overall the game is really well made and complete.  No lag in multiplayer either.I'll be looking forward to more content and DLC, which I'm sure they have in mind...?NEED MORE PEOPLE!  If you're even slightly interested, get it.  For the price, you shouldn't be disappointed.If not, then it's those moments you wish a game was Cross-platform.4,837 MB			"

												Table Top Racing is a very aptly named game, because you race around on various sorts of tabletop surfaces. I'm not sure about the World Tour part, though I did see an American Flag in one level and a Union Jack in another, which I guess are flags corresponding to different parts of the world. Four out of five words is pretty good for a title.Now I couldn't really make my mind up on whether I liked this game or not. I spent an extra five or so hours more than I feel this game deserved trying to decide. The graphics seem to lend to an illusion of this game being much better than it really is, at least for me as someone who enjoys racing games quite a bit. The flaws to the game and total lack of documentation on certain game features lend to my depreciating opinion on the game.I know a lot of people will compare this to similar games on Steam like Toybox Turbos or Super Toy Cars and I'd definitely put this on a similar quality level. The graphics are much better but the gameplay lets it down a fair bit.The handling model is incredibly simple and doesn't interact at all with the physics. If your car is acting under physics, whether you hit an object, got rammed or just landed after a jump, you have no control over your car until that stops. You have very mild 'air control' which is the same level of control you have while on the ground. This means the most powerful weapon in the game is ramming someone from the inside on a corner and makes the handling feel very inconsistent. Not to mention, the physics system itself isn't perfect by any means after landing from certain jumps or even little bumps in the track I've had my car rocket in total random directions. The very simple handling model and poor physics implementation means the meat of the game, the actual driving, is very hit and miss. I could forgive it if the game didn't force jumps on every track but every long race I was just constantly in fear of the next jump destroying my chances of coming 1st.The AI doesn't offer much challenge either, none of them take any shortcuts, they all follow one racing line and drive at set speeds and only ever fire their weapons at you. This means the best events become the Time Trials, Hot Laps and Drift Events since all of the Combat Race style Events are braindead easy provided the physics don't screw you over.This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing either, but there's no Single Race mode, you can't pick any of the tracks you've raced on, pick a mode and some settings and have some fun. You have to race on their preset events, whether they're in the Championships or Special Events. There might be a track you really want to drift on with your favorite car, but unfortunately you're not able to.They're working on local multi-player, so perhaps this could come in a future update, but as of writing this review, this feature's not in the game.There's also a lot of undocumented features. Lots of weapons in the game counter a weapon and are countered by another. Like bombs attracting Heatseeking Missiles or the Electricity blowing up the Bombs. Some of the pink glowing things on the side of the track are Shortcuts which can be opened by hitting them with a Level 2 powerup, the things that aren't shortcuts usually toss some debris on the track. There's a boost start you can use at the start of the race somehow which was recently added in an update. There's also a lot of little things on the tracks you wouldn't be able to find out without making a serious effort to. Like the orange GO! Sushi signs on the Sushi shop track actually being little doors you can drive through. Or the Circular Saw on the Workbench track actually hiding a shortcut you can take. I understand some of these things are meant to be 'secrets' but if you have some shortcuts highlighted and others not it doesn't really make sense. It's just confusingly inconsistent for no real reason. The level 2 weapons are also locked at the beginning of the game for some reason so you don't even really know they exist, which means things like shortcuts are unavailable to you as well.Now the Drift Mode for the game, even though I've been decidedly negative about it this whole review, I found to be quite enjoyable. The DLC also adds an AE86 that's 'Legendary' for drifting, so I spent a good amount of time sliding around in the few available drift events I could use that car in. I'd personally say it's the best part of the game even if it's limited. There's also another great undocumented 'feature' in that a lower handling rating makes a car drift better. Especially useful on cars with lower drift ratings and high handling ratings like the Supercars.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game just because I hate the way the physics are handled. For a casual racing game player, once you start racing on the more difficult tracks I could see the difficulty spiking way up, especially with all the hidden things that aren't really common sense. For someone more experienced, the game won't challenge anything except your patience with the poor physics. A little more effort and it could have been a brilliant game.			"

												A brilliant and fun racing game, easily comparable to micromachines with a bit of penny racers thrown in. Lots of game modes and tracks to choose from and the multiplayer is really fun too. Art style is really nice and the cars look and sound great, fair amount of cars to choose from and different weapons. Well worth the purchase!Just to add more info, There's 3 types of cars to choose from, classics, street racers and supercars, each has 3 trophys to win using each of the 3 types of cars. Each type has 4 cars to pick from, so 12 cars in total. (Unless you buy the DLC then there's 4 more) Each car handles differently and has stats to upgrade, speed, acceleration handling and armour so the more races you win the more money you get and the better you can build your car. Each car can be equiped with 7 types of wheel and there are 4 different paint jobs for each car. There are 126 challenges in the game with 3 stars to get in each (gold silver bronze) for a total of 378 stars. Game types inclide Combat where you have weapons to blow up other cars, elimination where a car gets eliminated each lap, pursuit where you start 1 lap behind another car and have to catch up to it, drift where you drift, hot lap which is 3 lap time trials and fastest lap game types. There are 5 different enviroments to choose from and 4 different tracks in each enviroment. Online is upto 8 players and you can customise if you want power ups on and off etc.I think it's worth the money and really fun, the small details make this game. The art style is really nice and on the best settings it runs 144fps so the frame rate isn't capped.			"

												+ It's a powered-up kart racing game+ Nice graphics+ Easy, casual gameplay-It's not much of a powered-up kart racing game-Not a lot of content (tracks and modes left lacking)-Lack of population in multiplayer The game is alright, but wait for a better sale price; or continue to wait for a better table top racing game to come along. The actual race courses are small and not very interesting besides the ""table top"" gimmick. That's some novelty at first, but not a lot of fun is had with it. The driving lacked a lot of feel and excitement a racing game usually has, and the tracks are very flat except for an occasional jump, incline or decline. Sure, it's racing on a table top, but I really think the racing and track design could be done better. Maybe those are reasons why table top racing games tend to disappoint. I think some day someone will finally get it right, but this game still isn't it.I got the game with the first DLC only to end up feeling like the game did not create enough interest to keep me coming back.The multiplayer lobby here is a good place to watch tumbleweeds from.Some people like the ""breakbeat"" dance soundtrack. I found a couple of tracks alright, while others I really did not like and had to turn the music off.

												A fun kart racer that loses some points in the finer details.  Positives are the driving physics are well done, the style is superb, the music is great (reminds me of the Dub Pistols which is nice) and there's no shortage to do, and it keeps things fresh with diffrent modes.  Negitives are some things aren't clear (Why would I bother with buying armor), you kinda need the drift tires if you actually want to slide, which is exaggerated by the fact handbrakes are missing, and while the wheel options are a nice nod, they're mostly tolken outside of Drifts, Bling, and Bounce (Which you'll never use in an actual race.  You'll only use it to go back and pick up the coin collectables),Overall it's a solid experience that's lacking in some finishing touches (But seriously who forgot to put in a handbrake?)			"

												Table Top Racing: World Tour is a fun, arcade style, racing game.The game itself is simple, win races. You have different game modes so you have some variety. But here comes the downside of this game, it gets boring. Yes you have multiplayer and different cars and different upgrades but the idea is the same, every time, every race. Does that mean this game is bad? No, definitely not. This game is doing what it is supposed to do. It is not a game for the hardcore racing fan, but a Mario Kart like casual game. Pro's- Fun and easy- Good looking graphics- Does what it is supposed to doCon's- Controls may feel stiff- May get boring quick- €20,- is too much in my opinionConclusion:This game is fun to play, but the pricetag is a little to high for what it has to offer. I can definitely recommend this game, but get it when it is on sale.			"

												Just thought I'd throw some positivity this way. The game is probably the most fun racer I've played in years. It's not ""hardcore"" and it's not a destruction derby, it's just downright fun. It's basically a cross between Micro Machines and Mario Kart.			"

												This is one of those I LOVE THIS GAME but I wouldn't reccomend it reviews.Here's why:1. Almost no one is ever online, which sucks, because when there was, there was a lot of customization you could have in every game. EX. Set track, Set cars (or only one kind of car), set all or select rims (like drift rims, bouncy rims) and my personal favorite NO UPGRADE option, because you know, you can upgrade your cars or have them race like 50CC in mario kart. But overall, having no one online to ENJOY these features takes a major draw out of the game for me.2. Following number one, the tracks are well done, music is kind of....well decent(?). But the problem is that I can only enjoy the same variety of tracks so many times because of the gameplay mechanics. 3. Following number three, Gameplay mechanics are really simple, which in most cases are great! But it feels really lackluster here, it just feels almost....uncomplete. SO IN SHORT STORY MODE:No one is  playing online, it has great variety in ways to play the game but lacks overall gameplay mechanics to keep it interesting in single player mode, the music is somewhat of a turn off and the tracks get redundant. THERE""S JUST SO MUCH TO BE WANTED. Give me a car shunting system instead of just simply ramming the car and falling off with them and I would think the game is great for the whole ""TABLETOP"" experience.....Oh man....that wasn't really short story was it....?

Table Top Racing blurs the line between the Arcade Racing and Kart Racing genres, by adding the ability to shoot projectiles and collect power ups to the demolition derby feel of the more realistic cars of Nascar. They end up with a racing game that feels like a Matchbox car derby, very nostalgic, with super fantasy table top track setups ranging from a sushi diner counter, to an eighties memorabilia lined attic shelf, to the floor of a garage. I received a copy free for review purposes, but that in no way influenced the fact that I love this game! I grabbed the DLC myself. ∙،°. ˘Ô≈ôﺣ » » » The Cars: These vehicles handle superbly. I prefer to use my Steam Controller, but the controls are simple enough to work with any device. The wide variety of vehicle models includes standard super cars, hippy campers, and pickup trucks. If you’ve played the Disney Infinity 1.0 Cars Playset, you’ve seen how the fantasy addition of not-so-standard race cars can amp up the laughs, adding a much needed jolt to the fun factor in derby type racing. But, these cars each have their own set of strengths and weaknesses added to the cosmetic beauty of the car to create an addictive collectors  aspect to the game much like that of collecting Matchbox cars for children. Personally, I can’t wait to earn the Fauxrari. But, the availability of other upgrades may forestall that acquisition. The Upgrades:  Comical sounding names for tires like: bling, boing, and shield let you know right up front what these tires can do for your ride. The boing tires are one of the more expensive to earn with the in-game currency, but give you the ability to alter typical game physics in a more satisfying way, and allow you to reach more hidden coins and shortcuts. The Bling tires, aside from the ascetic benefit, cause you to earn more money from races, though they don’t really help you win. There are quite a few tire options. Adding more would definitely be better, of course.  But, there are also cool paint jobs you can earn, and of course the leveling up of abilities, like acceleration, max speed, and handling. The TracksThe race tracks are atypically short for most of the kart racers I’m familiar with, more in line with standard stadium race tracks length-wise. There is no stadium feel here, however. It feels like being a kid lying on the floor of a garage, racing your Matchbox cars between old car parts and cans of transmission fluid. Or, like racing your hot wheels around the diner counter past the napkin dispenser. So, there is quite a bit of nostalgic pleasure derived from the game no matter who you are. But, the myriad of objects to drift into, collide with, and knock off the track, along with the ability to careen over the edge of the table adds the pleasure of riding the bumper cars.  Multiplayer: If you enjoy the thrill of mastering all the championship trophies, and exploring the special events, then you will simply love the gameplay of multiplayer, which is where the real meat & potatoes of the game is found. You could spend many hours in single-player racing against the AI, but eventually you will want more than the scaling of typical AI races. Multiplayer becomes more of a competition, and a friendship forming opportunity. Though there is no co-op yet, MP certainly lends itself to teaming up against your opponents. The game could certainly benefit from that option. Pros:*Excellent, beautiful graphics!*Supercharged Cars –fantastic rides!* Challenging tracks and championship options* The Weapon-Wheels are a great addition to the genre/ Spike wheels! Need I say more?*PVP MP combat racing with up to 8 players *NO glitching, bugs, or loading errors of any kind Cons:*Scaling – I’m not too big of a fan of this common race strat, as it seems more like an exploit (I’d rather be lapped a few times when I really suck- more realism)*No co-op team racing *More is better… more content would be great My overall verdict is a 10 out of 10 for this incredibly fun arcade racer. If you love it as much as I do, you’ll definitely want to grab the DLC, for the… well you know… more of everything I mentioned, since more is better. And, the game & dlc are both well worth the pricing. Currently the game is being bundled with the DLC on pc so you basically get the DLC free.  I highly recommend these supercharged racers for everyone, and their brother!			"

												If you're looking for a Micro Machines V4 -esque kind of game then this is a great title to play. The reason I say V4 is because the 3D aspect is very similar to V4 and not like any of the other Micro Machines games leading up to that point.I love the open environments and the enclosed spaces at the same time. I love the fact you can upgrade your car from the start and still have money left over, that is if you choose the basic starter car kit. One thing I will say that I don't like is that sometimes the controls can be a bit stiff and at others times it makes you as clumsy and wobbly as a car on ice. In order for me to really enjoy the controls I will have to learn to get the right balance. Whilst playing this for the first time I slipped into a lot of hazards and lost vital rewards due to the controls. I wouldn't say that the controls are bad but when you take Micro Machines V4 the controls were solid. At least more solid than this game, in my opinion, but I digress.Anyway I think that if you can work with the controls then I reckon you'll have a blast. I mean I don't want to make the controls the reason you don't pick up this game. I can look past that, but it was just an experience I noticed when I played for the first time.Anyhow I suggest you give it a go. The tracks are nice and light as well as realistic and the gameplay is intriguing, desptie the fact it's similar to Micro Machines V4.All in all, a great game! Worth the pickup!			"

												Great fun. Feels like a new MicroMachines from the Amiga era! This is the best of the tiny car arcade racers i've played in a long time. Controls are very responsive (Using XBone controller). All the cars feel like they handle differently, so there's a good reason to change cars for different events. Things on the track have a good physics quality to them, so you can use them to your advantage in some stages.Hopefully multiplayer gets a bit more active as more people get this game.All we need now is a new track.. in a bathtub .. with a big rubber ducky to avoid, and everythings great!Honestly surprised how much i've enjoyed the game so far, I can see me dipping in and out of this game for a long time to come. Would be nice if the camera angle was remembered between races, or as a settings option.Leaderboards maybe? So I can see how bad I am? :)Well done to the developers, hopefully this game gets the kudos it deserves \o/			"

												Good game to quickly pass time. Definitely worth GOOD:- quick progress - cheap- fun- not very demanding (both in hardware and skill)- simpleBAD:- no multiplayer servers (you can host but no one will join and you can't join anyone coz no one is hosting)- NPCs will sometimes have autistic episodes and will ruin your race (rare)- not very customizable- no steam trading cards CONCLUSIONThis is not a serious game, it's a simple game you play when you don't have much time or when you don't wanna stress yourself by focusing in a serious game. You can play just 10-30 minutes and it's fine.It's a shame it doesn't have trading cards, but you can get it for a few bucks or less on 3rd party marketplaces ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)			"

+ Visually, everything looks fantastic, great lighting, shadows, and detail on the cars+ The tracks are very creative placed on tables in a bunch of different locations filled with a ton of different objects and food. My favorite was a sushi conveyer belt in an asian restaurant, which has a ton of detail and interesting things to look at both on the track and in the background.+ Gameplay is a load of fun, and the controls are fantastic (I used a controller)+ A variety of power up / weapons to use to slow down your competition+ Earning coins to buy cars, upgrades, tires, and new skins feels very rewarding+ Great soundtrack+ Race against friends online- Not a whole lot of tracks...I think there is only 5 themed locations and a variety of alterations to those tracks which gets fairly reptitive after a good 2hours or so of racing.- There are ""hidden coins"" that you can find on tracks to earn bonus cash, however these coins are typically in obscure places that tend to cause you to lose a lot of time in the race. Many are also unobtainable until you get bounce-wheels which are very expensive end-game wheels...- The tracks are incredibly short with each lap being around 20seconds, with few (if any) shortcuts or alternate paths to take.[Side Note: I gave this game to my friend to try on PS4 on these were his thoughts: ""It's fun but I wish there were more cars, and the maps are super small but they are cute. No lag at all and it feels like it's running at like 60fps and no screen tearing and super fast loading times probably because the maps are so small""]			"

												You cannot have this much fun in messy places with toy cars as an adult in real life. This reminds me of the childhood I wish I had. The attention to detail is great which makes it even funnier to drive these little things. I normaly disable game music. I was not fast enough and a song started. 2 songs went by before I noticed again that I hadnt turned the game music off. Some people might want to get this just for the music. I have not heard all of it. What I have heard sounds good. I recommend the game to everyone who made a track out of anything around and drove a little car on it at least once. There are enough cars (I do not have the DLC) and upgrades for those cars to keep me entertained for a while. I've only fully upgraded the bug at the time of this.

												It's pretty, but it just lacks any ""feel"".  Not a particularly great kart racer.  I felt immediately like I'd played it before with a different skin on it.  Now, a game like Re-Volt which is 15 years old now, does everything that's going on here and doesn't feel generic about it.  There's still hope for this thing to turn itself around, it just needs to find a way to distinguish itself and spice things up a bit.			"

												Basically a modern Micro Machines, what's not to like?Nicely and what can only be described as 'charmingly' detailed little tracks and just generally rather good visuals for what it is, tight handling cars, well some of 'em anyway, there's a surprisingly distict feel to a lot of the cars and some are definitely more suited to drifting than others.More charm is thrown in with the references to real cars and their descriptions and liveries, it was clearly made by people who like car culture or at least know people that do.   :)The game modes and power ups are a pretty standard, run of the mill sort of affair, nothing to complain about but nothing to get excited over either.A.I is plenty competent as is the multiplayer which if you can manage to get the full 8 people is incredibly tense as these kart racer type games always are as you can go from first to last in no time and vice-versa.Oh and punctuating the whole experience is a funky and very catchy soundtrack.

Given it's price and other similar games available on steam, this is definitely my favourite one that I've played and is great value for money, particularly when it's on sale! You can't go wrong spending $5 on this game.The game has had some issues surrounding controller support in the past (seems to be working fine by most accounts now) but it's best to check the forums to see if your controller is supported before purchasing. If in doubt, the devs have posted workaround instructions on the forums so you shouldn't encounter any problems. "

												This arcade racing game is really fun, mainly thanks to the awesome driving feedback the cars give you. Graphics are above expectations for an indie like this, and cars in particular have really cool models. The game lacks few more tracks, but it's far from being repetitive if you consider the variety of game modes and that races always last 3 or 4 minutes. Many complain about the music, but i find it nice indeed, even if it won't be remembered for ages. The only real downside is that no one knows this game so the multilayer is almost desert, which is a big downside since playing online is where you have the most fun, especially if you don't have friends, just like me			"

												Great Game For Younger Gamers*A lot of my reviews are written for parent with younger gamers (4-7 years) and this is one of them*This is basically your run-of-the-mill ""kart racer"". And that's pretty much why I bought it. My kids are at that age where they like video games but the only ones they can play with any skill are games with simple controls like racers. So I picked this one up on a recent sale and it seems like it's a lot of fun. It's not a very complex racer, utilizing only a few buttons on a standard Xbox 360 controller, which is a plus for younger children. Most of the cars seem to handle the same and while this may turn off mature race fans I doubt most kids and more casual racers  will mind. One thing that stood out to me right away was that the pysics are a little wierd; instead of feeling like your car is moving the game feels like the car is stationary and everything else (background/track, other cars) is moving around it. Anyone who's ever played an old SNES ""Mode 7"" game like F-Zero will know what I mean. But this isn't a bad thing, it's just something that takes a second or two to get used to. The cars are all pretty cool looking but have limited visual customizations which is sort of a minus for younger players who love to change their cars looks. One nice thing is that most of the cars can be fully upgraded with limited amounts of effort which will give younger gamers a real sense of accomplishment.As far as everything else like graphics and music/sound goes it's servicable; nothing special but nothing deal breaking either. All in all If you can get this at the $10 range (I paid about $7 for the game and the DLC) and you have younger race fans this is one of the better Kart Racers out there and I reccomend it.			"

The generic electronic soundtrack was hit or miss; a “Skip Song” button or a list of toggles would have been welcome, though most will want to listen to their own music. The effects and engine sounds are surprisingly well done for an indie team. Most of the cars seem to have unique engine profiles (the exotic cars being particularly satisfying), and the collisions are a mix of the light plastic clacking of a toy car, and a variety of materials (porcelain, tin, thick metal, wood) matching the objects littered around the course. There's very little in terms of ground/tire materials or environmental reverberation. The engine sounds are great, but I've had prefered them at about twice the volume and abrasiveness.ConclusionA simple little game with a charming aesthetic (mainly for gearheads who appreciate the heavily inspired car designs and recognize the iconic skins) and matching sound effects, but unfortunately also features some odd choices that leave a bit to be desired. It boils down to the lack of a custom/free-play mode, raw speed (and thus challenge) in all but the late-game vehicles, and polish concerning some of the map physics and UI. Fixing these problems should be feasible, I just hope the upcoming DLC comes along side and not in favor of refinement of the base game.			"

												After playing for a few hours I find game is very fun. It has a very nostalgic feel for me and lots of references from The Fast and The Furious, to a toy replica of the Hoonicorn. The controls are very simple and easy to use and as you progress further into the game it gets more challenging as you would want from any game. It reminds me of Roadtrip: The Arcade Edition aka Gadget Racers. Although, getting the DLC makes the game a bit easier because the cars come pre unlocked and are fairly high tier for their class. I feel it has a lot more potential, but it's still a very enjoyable game with hours of gameplay up it's sleeve.			"

IntroductionTable Top Racing: World Tour is a mini-car/kart racing game in a similar vein to Mario Kart, that is to say where you have a small sized vehicle collecting power-ups to use against your enemies as you race around the small track. The visuals are great, but in my opinion, the sound track leaves a lot to be desired.Gameplay ImpressionsIn Table Top Racing: World Tour you find yourself driving miniaturized versions of what could very well be real world cars. These mini-vehicles fit right in with the littered table top racing theme. Much of the debris lying around the track can be knocked out of the way. The racers can strike them as they drive around the course at the cost of only a minor loss of momentum. While there are really not that many varieties of tracks available, there are plenty of different race types to make up for it. Sometimes a lack of variety can be a bad thing. It could get boring with the same old, same old, but when it comes to racing games, knowing the track is the best way to give yourself an edge. Having fewer tracks to memorize allows you to spend less time crashing during unexpected sharp turns and more time winning races.The game is divided into different cups, two cups per tier, and three tiers total. As you progress through the cups, more race modes will become available. I won’t go into an exhaustive list of every race type, but I will name a few of the more interesting ones. Battle Cars is the default mode. In it, it plays like Mario Kart. You race around the track trying to come in first place while using weapon pickups to slow down your opponents. Your enemies can also use those weapons, so you will have to be ever vigilant to maintain or improve your position in the race. There is also a more vanilla race mode that is just purely about racing skill rather than using cheap tricks to give yourself an edge. Drift mode is a fun mode; in it you try to slide around corners as fast as you can without hitting the walls, maintaining the drift until just before you lose control you straighten out and drive sensibly again. In Drift, you are not against other opponents; you simply are trying to beat one of the top three track scores in order to earn your bronze, silver or gold stars for the mission. There are the time trials which are similar, race against the clock to score the best lap record or best course completion time. There is also a cat and mouse style mode. You are the cat so to speak, and your goal is to catch up to the much faster mouse and pounce on it, or in car speak, ram into it. You do this through clever and creative means such as using your boost at opportune times and taking short cuts. At the end of each cup is a multi-race event that requires you to do well in each of the races in order to move on to the next cup. There are other modes and multiplayer, but you get the idea, there is plenty to do.Each tier of racing comes with four car options. When you first start the game you can only afford to buy one of the first two available for the tier. Once you earn more by participating in races, you can either opt to buy a different car or upgrade the one you have. Each car will have different balances between their speed, acceleration, handling and armor. You will want to figure out which stats are more important to you when purchasing the car. Just because that one car has more slots for speed, it might not accelerate all that well so you might not actually get up to full speed all that often. The customizations don’t end here though. The wheels on the cars can be customized as well. The wheel customizations have a variety of effects and unlike the other car tuning upgrades, you unlock them once and you can use them on all cars you own. For example, you can equip wheels that cause you to earn more money from using weapons on enemies. You can also use wheels that give you a shield against some weapons, or even turn your wheels into weapons. There are others, but basically this adds a whole extra layer of strategy and fun to the game. Lastly you can paint your vehicles. I don’t believe painting them really has any kind of effect other than a cosmetic one. Odds are you better off sticking with stock until you have bought everything else you need. Visually, as mentioned, this game looks great. It isn’t cartoony like Mario Kart, it actually looks somewhat realistic. The mini-cars really suit the “you are racing on the top of a table” style of the game. The random household objects and foods lying around as you drive through the various environments enhance the table top feeling even more. Overall, the visuals are very well done for the game. There were not even any graphical glitches that occurred for me, not even minor ones. The sound on the other hand, that is something to talk about. The sound effects are your standard racing ones. Nothing really stands out there, but you don’t exactly want random nonsense sounds when racing around, you want to hear those standard sounds. The sound effects therefore are perfectly fine. The sound track on the other hand… well I read in other reviews people really like the sound track for this game. That’s great; I can see people liking it, but it was far from my style of music. Not wanting to be harsh, I would still have to say, the sound track is the kind of music that I typically wouldn’t actually class as music. It’s pretty much all remixed breakbeat (a kind of a funk/hip hop/electro/dubstep/techno blend). It’s the kind of music typically played at raves and other parties that I try to avoid being invited to. I tried my best to endure it and actually caught myself almost sort of liking one of the music tracks, but I realized that was just the Cognitive Dissonance kicking in. Luckily, you can turn off the music without losing the sound effects and play your own music if you are so inclined. Overall, this is an excellent power-up racing game with tons of customization options and plenty of race varieties. The only real detractor is that I dislike its soundtrack immensely. Some reviews agree with me, others say it gets you into the racing spirit and mood. So hit up your favourite music streaming site, look up remixed Breakbeat and give it a listen. If your ears are not bleeding too heavily after that, go out and purchase this game!Pros:Great visuals, using a more realistic setting with mini-cars was a better design choice than attempting to pull of the cartoony visuals of Mario Kart or Sonic All-Stars RacingPlenty of customization optionsMultiple race event types per cup help prevent the game from getting repetitiveHidden coins make even losing a race fun. Rather than “rage quitting” when you are in last place, take the time to explore the track for all the hidden coins. The extra money will help you upgrade or replace your carControls are fluid and responsiveCons:Sound Track “music” that is less enjoyable than listening to nails on a chalkboard that is backed by bagpipes and cats in heat. Not many varieties for tracks, the same tracks get recycled over and over again with some obstacles moved around or replaced "

												Personally i find this game boring as f*ck its ok for 30 mins or so but after that i get just soooo bored of it though maybe just because ive started to grow tired of gaming so not gonna say its a bad game because its not i guess when i was younger I'd probably enjoyed it more. So sure i rec. the game but for old people like me thats been round the block in the gaming industry you can find more entertainment else where for a racing game. More appealing to kids and teens maybe some early 20s. But just not complex enough for my taste spend money on cars to upgrade some speed accel handling change tires and preset paint schemes no depth to customization just simple arcade racing with car combatish racing. Been here done that in the 90s nothing new to really point out. Like I'm playing some same old game from 20 years ago with a different name.			"

												Fun quirky little game, with a bit more emphasis on 'little'.Content-wise, it's relatively sparse. There's little to no background story for each car and track. I wish the devs expanded this a bit further each track and rival that bit more special. A few extra lines of text helps a long way.There's not that many track variety, and what track it has is dynamically limited to simple doodad physics. I was hoping for course-changing events (think Split/Second's PowerPlay) with animations that would incite shock and awe. Sure, it has doodads everywhere on the track affected by physics, but it just doesn't have that much of an awe factor, just cuteness. Oh, and more secret areas in tracks please, like RC Racer from the Playstation.Finally, there's the racing element. I know it's suppose to be an arcade racing game, but personally I think this level of arcadeness can be dull really quickly. I wish that there's more gamified/cartoonified elements of real-world racing in the game here. Some examples I could think of are:- quick tire wear (loss of grip after 5 or so laps, maybe have a 20-lap endurance race?)- quick fuel consumption (in the same line of thought with tire-wear, varies with each car)- component damage (too much crashing into others, damage to overall performance)- track rules (not sure how this can be implemented, but a quirky full-course yellow and a stop-n-go penalty would be amusing)- pit stops (complements the tire wear and fuel consumption)Mind you, I'm mostly a sim racer when it comes to a car race. I'm not asking for this game to be a sim, I just wish that it has some elements of a sim, but make those elements exagerrated and quirky, especially when you consider the vibe that this gme is giving out.There's a sale as of this review, so... eh, I'm enjoying it.Forgot to mention: music selection is dope. Needs moar.More stuff I forgot to mention: the aesthetics, I like it, a lot. Think of Road Trip Adventures from PS1. The cute, chibified cars are back and they're so adorable! Also, I like the resolution choices and how it still remains full-screen. What I'm getting here is that low-end PCs (like laptops) can play this game at reasonable frame-rates.			"

The game runs good and it is fun overall however i feel the gameplay is to similar all the time. After 10 races i was kind of done with it.

												I'm really enjoying this title- it's not innovative, it's not technical, it's not the flavor-of-the-month...it's fun.Sure, other games are similar, but I would say this is worth the money. Others would disagree, but if I get an hour of enjoyment out of every dollar spent- i consider that a valid purchase.I did have trouble setting up a joypad with the game, my solution was a PS3 controller and 3rd party software.All in all, a solid, fun, smooth-running summer racer- just the thing for taking a break from hardcore mode.

												My god.. this is beautiful!I'm a diehard Re-Volt fan  - probably spent a good 1000 hours playing it through the years and still play it every now and then. And well, this is the best spiritual successor I've ever seen.First, the technical part: graphics are amazing, sounds are great and soundtrack is unbelievable good.The gameplay itself is great. The tracks design looks more inspired in Micro-Machines than Re-Volt, but the race action is absolutely Re-Volt-like. Frantic battles, tracks obstacles, jumps, pits, and, of course, power ups! While most of power-ups are already staples from the genre (and some related genres, like Mario Kart), they managed to introduce a innovative weapon design with Frostbite Weapon.Another great innovation is the wheels choice: basically a extra power-up for your own car.I could find only two minor downsides: the cars feels too heavy - meaning impact from other cars or weapons won't send it flying away.. I personally think it would fit the arcade-like style of the RC-race/battle genre. The other downside is the length of the tracks: although I get the design idea of TableTop racing (as opposed to whole museums and supermarket in Re-Volt), the tracks are way too short.However, as stated, they're very minor downsides which doesn't hinder the fun at all. Table Top Racing is an amazing game, I had a blast playing single AND multiplayer (lets hope people keep playing it!) and finally, after 17 years, someone managed to develop a game to live up to Re-Volt standard.

												EDIT:  My xbox one controller using the wireless adapter now works.  Here is what I did.  With my controller on and using the wireless adapter (I'm using Win7), In the start menu I typed ""USB game"" and selected ""Set up USB game controllers"" when the option appeared which brings up the ""Game Controllers"" window. I selected ""Controller (Xbox One for Windows)"". Clicking on the Properties button I tested to check that all the buttons and axes were working and just exited out not making any changes at all.I doubted anything would change, but I started the game again and now everything seems to be working fine.Original post:If you have a wireless xbox one controller, don't bother buying this.  It will let me move the selector up and down in the game menus, but it is impossible to move the selector to the right.  And you can't over ride it using keyboard input, as the controller is constantly forcing the selector to the left.  And this is all after they “patched” the game to fix controller input issues….  For me, it is unplayable.  Also, it's fantastic of them to release DLC for a game that they haven't fixed for so many people.			"

												Really, REALLY fun little racing game. I will say that it seems to be a multiplayer focused game and the singleplayer aspects of it are fairly easy and not very expansive. It's still great fun, though. I haven't done any multiplayer yet and I'm enjoying it just fine, making money to buy and try new cars and upgrades.""Fully tune-able"" is stretching it a bit, though. You can generically increase your car's top speed, handling, acceleration and armor, and you can buy a few sets of tires that have various (but mostly minor) effects, also paint that's purely cosmetic but that's the extent of ""fully tune-able"". You can't upgrade engine, exhaust or suspension parts which, to me, is what ""fully tune-able"" means.$20 well spent, in my opinion, and if you buy it buy the bundle. The DLC that would otherwise costs $6 only costs one penny in the bundle and it is worth having.			"

												I got interested in a game the very moment i saw it has become available on Steam.I visited the site - it was beautifully presented and advertised; and the more details i saw the more i wanted the game:graphics - ok.  But the car models, their names, their looks bring me lots of fun: each and every single one is thoughtfully build, to the smallest detail - there feels a big story behind each of small toy car you are driving: there are lots of love devoted to design of a game.sounds - there's an official soundtrack that automatically mean music has been worked on professionally and given proper attention to.controls - i play on pc and on pc only, so i need just a couple of keyboard buttons and they work ok, i cannot complain about; but still the gameplay is the most great thing - long time ago when i played re-volt i was amazed by the racing game this much: the game feels extremely easy at first, but the more you play it gets harder, it has lots of different races with different tasks, different number of competitors, that are really competing with you: game's ai works just fine for me -it neither too difficult nor too easy, just interesting to play and play again.finally i bought the game couple of days after its release, just couldn't stand the temptation.

Finally!!The only problem with the game, it uses Unity Engine in borderless mode and there are framepacing  issues and some stuttering here and there. You can mitigate a bit using ""-window-mode exclusive -force-d3d9"" in steam for game launch parameters and using a 60 fps limit in nvidia inspector game profile or RTSS.			"

												**I have a ridiculous amount of time into the PS4 version and the PC version is waiting to be played.**If you were a fan of games like RC Pro Am and Micro Machines, you\'ll enjoy TTR. It\'s the spiritual successor to those types of games. Add in a few more foes, a few more weapon items and you have TTR. With multiple modes across a variety of tracks, you\'ll have a variety of different ways to play.The visuals are nice and bright and the comically squished cars are excellent, easily recognizable comic versions of the real things. Oversized wheels and a collection of various paint jobs add spice.Depending on your PC, the game can obviously look and run better than the PS4 version. Looks great on mine so far.If you\'re a fan of cars and a fan of fast, fun, easy to pick up and play games, give TTR a try.			"

												Great Little Racing Game!I first picked this up on PS Plus for free last month and when I seen it released on Steam I just had to have it.  It plays like a toon arcade racer should be fast paced with power ups like you see in most kart racers. There are a handful of cars with unlocks for each.  It would be nice to be able to customize the cars more, however what they have is nice.   The game starts out very easy but dont let that settle in cause the races get wayyyyyy harder!  Below are my thoughts!Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Multiplayer 1/10 Cause noone is buying the game to race with. (Come on make this happen)Value 7/10____________Overall JUST BUY THE DANG GAME 7/10!!!!This is racing game you can pick up and play for 10 minutes at a time or hours and have a blast.			"

YouTube™ Video: Tabletop Racing: World Tour -- Quick Overview 

			Views: 172		

			Make sure you HIT that LIKE button if you enjoyed, it would be real cool of you! Music and Sound effects provided by epidemic sound thanks to our Maker Studios Partnership.		

This game is  alright  by every sense of the word. Table Top Racing: World Tour is...well...a racing game. The biggest appeal they push is small cars on table surfaces like work desks at an auto-shop or a sushi bar. The lack of content and overall non-uniqueness bring this games quality down, begging for a price change. I will reccomend it however with the case of waiting for a sale. Now let's get started!!!!For starters, let's get that TL;DR out of the way!+Good Graphics+Pick-Up and Tire powerups+Several Game Modes+Online Multiplayer+Tracks don't look alike+For me, Good performance+Ugrade Vehicles with in game money you win-Unlike Sonic, Mario, Flatout, Gas Guzzlers there is no named racers. So making a rivalry [like I hated Jason from Flatout] or making your own makeshift narrative doesn't happen. This also brings no character to the competition-Only 3 classes of cars with 4 in each.-Only 2 cups in each class-Each gamemode feels old...like classic is good of course but, there is no new feel to it. Rather just go play another racer that has done it better or made it feel new with some extra mechanic.-Powerups are your typical powerups...ice blast, shockwave, rocket, homing rocket, all generic powerups.-Can not shoot some powerups behind or foward [so if the rocket shoots foward, you cant shoot back]-Day 1 DLC [this doesn't bother me....but it bothers most]So 7 pros and 7 cons....my feelings for this game are very mixed at the moment. Stick around for the full review!!! I am going to put a tad bit more time into it just to make sure my claims are valid, do a video and I will come back later to write out the long winded review. See ya soon!-Update-Okay so to give you a bit of an overview of the content I haven't yet brought up:There is a championship mode, special events mode, multiplayer. There is no quick race or custom race in singleplayer.There is a few secrets such as short cuts and coins...but not many.There is only two track hazards: falling off the table top and objects like dice, cups, spray paint cans you know...it depends on the setting. I like this, but they don't really have much of an effect. I've slammed into many of them, they just go flying and I keep truckin'There isn't much in the way of dynamic gameplay. No random track events, no dangerous tracks, nothing like that. Powerups This is my biggest beaf with this game. The power ups are not satisfying at all. Take mario, sonic or gas guzzlers extreme. When you shoot someone with a power up, you see them explode or go ape crap. But here, a rocket hits a car..little bit of black smoke...then nothing. The electric shock, acid, mines all of that look so weak in nature.The recovery time is also atrocious. You recover so quickly that the power up attacks affect maybe .5 seconds of progression. The power ups I remember are as follows, keep in mind I don't know the official names:Homing RocketRocketFreeze shot [you shoot someone and they turn into an ice cube]acid trailelectric shockboostminesand there is one more I can't remember.

												Disclaimer: I received a product key for this game, but I've got no affiliation with the dev!Loved it. I only played the championship stuff and have yet to try out the multiplayer with other gamers, but even going off of the solo content alone I really enjoyed myself.-First of all, the environments are semi destructive (physical objects can be knocked around) and you can use this to work out shortcuts for yourself. These interactions stop the game from being linear and boring - cutting up the map gives a sense of achievement.-The game looks really nice, what you see is what you get from the trailer so nothing more needs to be said there.-There are weapons, weapons are fun.-Finally, it's affordable! (when compared to other games in this genre)I uploaded my experience on my gaming channel if you want to see visuals:

												This game is not terrible but is absolutely boring. If you are looking for a fast paced arcade racing game (sonic all stars? modnation racers?) this is not the one. If you are looking for a fun and sweet game like micro machines, this is also not it. What is this? A slow and monotone racing game with weapons. The tracks are all the same. You get 4 different sceneries, each scenery (Environment) has one track with 4 different versions (slight differences between all the tracks). There is no sense of speed and you will repeat every track over and over again in every championship, with cars that will go slightly faster (there are 3 classes of cars).I was not expecting much but the game managed to be even below my expectations. Buy this either very very cheap, or just get another game if you never played the REAL arcade racing games with weapons. I can't recommend it.			"

												Can you remember the RC Revolt games? If so, then copy and paste a glowing review for that game here. Better than Micro Machines, if for no ther reason than the cars. TTR:WT has better cars. They're awesome, but I worry that there aren't enough 'vanilla' cars, and any extra are going to be paid DLC. I'm not against paid DLC at all, as long as the base game has enough to start with. Please release some free cars to make the base game more attractive to customers, who will then buy more out of choice, and not feel forced in to it. Game runs really well, looks great, and even the sound is pretty good too. The cars are really cool, and the handling is good. The level design is a lot like Micro Machines. The game's title should tell you that, but I do think more scenarios are needed. In short, the base game is a little light on cars and scenarios, but it's cheap enough, and plays really well. Worth a buy.			"

												Update Sept 26, 2016: 4 whole months and they still haven't fixed the broken 'controller support'. I no longer have confidence in these people.

												I enjoyed the game, but to a certain point...This is not your typical racing simulator, of course, but the game offers a lot of options to make you experience different scenarios that no other racing game does, like trying different cars with different characteristics, upgrading those characteristics, customize with a lot of striking features, experience different arcade options, etc... Driving feels alright, but do not expect to much if you want to drift, you certainly can, but I feel it very sluggish.The game is certainly fun at the beginning, but it becomes EXTREMELY repetitive and exhausting (if you are trying to achieve 3 stars on each level). There are really only 3 game modes: Tournaments, Special Events (which is more of the same), and Multiplayer (Which I have not tried). You are not getting a game with content to enjoy, you are getting a game meant to be played with constant grinding.There are some DLC that you can buy, but the experience won't really change. It also depends on how much you pay for this game, because I would only get it for less than 5$			"
