												Developer is using his superpowers to delete comments on GL page and bans for no reason from discussion when he gets approached by revoking all current keys for the game which was sold and bought legally.Also the game itself, urrrgh.. Don't even...Claiming that the keys were beta/hacked whatever like he said in Discussions before he deleted everything in hope that Valve won't see it.Reading the EULA:""If you have purchased a single copy from MANIC MIND GAME LAB http://www.manicmindgamelab.com/ or Dennis de Magalhaes Ferreira or an authorized distributor, reseller or any retail channel, you may return it unused, within thirty (30) days after purchase, for a refund of your payment less any incidental charges. ""This means indeed he did distribute the keys and SOLD them, not advertised as beta as were the reason for the revokes.So after alot of talking and probably this review scared the dev abit made him send me a key, my 4 other friends didn't have any though.I've also been asked to remove this review and still getting asked to upvote his current projects.I was kind to put it to friends only for awhile but I thought the story should be shared.

												This game is definitely NOT for everybody.I'm sure there are people around there who are going to like it, but I'll take a wild guess here and say they're going to be the minority.What's good about this game: the title. It's a very straight forward title, it gives you a good idea of what to expect. Can't say the same about the description though - it is a little biased.Now, I can't say much about the graphics: they're exactly as depicted in the pictures. Sound? The exact one you can hear in the video, over and over. Configs? There's none. Difficulty? Well, it shouldn't be difficult - but is, probably due to the clunky controls and physics. It might be a little frustrating too, as you die and go back to the beginning of the level.But unfortunately the dev cannot take criticism, to say the least. I was unfriended for being honest and not agreeing in making a false positive review. That behavior made me realize even more the importance of being honest.I wish him well. Hope it helps.			"

												I was gonna write a review yesterday when I bought this, but the game gave me a migraine so I just went to bed. Sure, it was funny for like 10 seconds, but the novelty quickly wore off. Plus the controls are @$$, it runs like ♥♥♥♥ (it's not b'cuz of my computer, I'll guarentee you), and it's very ugly (understatement). I don't feel good bashing on small devs who put out little projects like this but really?!On another note, I like how the license agreement tells me I can't install this on more than one computer... like I wasn't planning on it.Other than that, don't buy this unless you're a masochist and want a headache and/or aneurysm followed up with a seizure.

												It's like one of those side-view vehicle/physics games that are popular on mobile, except it's bad. Terrible. The physics are bouncy and unpredictable, there are no checkpoints as far as I can tell, and I've seen better psychedelics in the Winamp 1 visualizer from 1997. Digital clutter.			"

												Probably one of the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. I highly do not recommend buying this game.The title speaks for it all. LSD-Driver. It looks like you're doing drugs and it hurts my eyes. The GUI is also ♥♥♥♥ing horrible and blurry. This game isn't even worth 79 cents. It should be free tbh.			"

												Just abysmal. - Starts in something ridiculous like 1024x768 Fullscreen, can't change it- Has no options menu anywhere I could see except toggle Background on/off- Absolutely horrendous visuals and ""physics""- Runs like a one-legged cat trying to bury a turd on a frozen lake- Costs more than $0.00- Makes small children cry*+ Super trippy backgrounds for #420n0scop3BL4Z31T doodz to pimp dat swag profile or something+ Super trippy backgrounds can be obtained via the marketplace without having to buy the game*Will test at next family gathering			"

												So I bought this game to start of my web series ""99 Cent Gaming"" to find the best and worst of the dollar and under games...and what a first episode!So LSDriver is a game that takes inspiration from Trials and Happy Wheels and wears it on its sleeves. While many may find that the price point justifies what the game lacks, I feel that if they added a checkpoint system into it LSDriver would go from passable to a pretty decent time waster for your dollar.I may have to revisit this if that gets added, but in the mean time the cheap deaths just causes me to not want to touch it any further.

												LSDriver is the epic tale of one Rabbit and his journey to reclaim the holy land. In this anime dating sim you meet a unique and unforgetable cast with stunning CGIs and a deeper plot of love, betrayal and vengence. Combining this with RPG elements that put The Witcher and Fallout to shame buckle in for the ride of the century, in this masterpiece of a game which breaks the barriers of convention and of the metaphysical plain itself. I myslef was left literally shaking for a solid lifetime after playing this and now am a Furry with sexual fantasies about being dominated by a motorbike.			"

												This game is a pretty good attempt at a side-scrolling stunter. The controls are a bit oversensitive and the bike has to rely too much on boosting to get up hills and things (the tires need more grip!) but the gameplay is solid and fairly challenging. I have to note that the game seemingly has no function to change resolution which can make it display improperly occasionally, and there is no support for triple-screen, though such a feature is very welcome in these types of games. There is no function to change controls either. I highly encourage the developer to add these features to their next title.At its very core it may be a poor mimic of some mobile games, but this one doesn't pester you with ads or keep features behind a paywall. Having to put up with the seizure-inducing visuals, Voodoo-era graphics, and crazy ""music"" is part of the challenge, and one should not write this game off simply because it offends your senses. These individually terrible elements come together to make a rather skillful game, and one can be proud for merely having finished a single stage.In short, this is a top tier kusoge that you should play at least once in your life. Is it art? Perhaps. It is definitely the kind of game a sensationalist reporter would blame for the collapse of society, and for that reason I must recommend it.			"

												LSDriver is a barely functional mess.It's going for a sort of Trials/Happy Wheels vibe, but completely misses what made those games playable, and instead focuses on bare-bones gameplay and awful visuals that give you a headache upsettingly quickly. Avoid at all costs!
