												Great stuff. Gravitation back in business.Review writing with an element of nostalgia, so bear that in mind.I played the original Gravitation on the Net Yaroze demo disc way back, and a couple of us played the dog fighting mode a lot. The simplicity of the design made it easy to get into, but tricky to master.So when I heard a reworked version was available on Steam and Mobile, I thought I'd give it a go for Â£7; expecting to only play it for a little while I've been going back to it quite a lot, and certainly will continue to do so. The main draw for me is probably the leaderboard set up, more on that below.There are two main single player modes:Mission:Needing to clear the screen of enemy ships and delivering crates to set areas. It's a tricky mode so even though there are only 18 missions here, it takes multiple attempts to master them.Race:This is the main draw for me, there are 27 maps which have numbered gates to race through. The addition of a global leaderboard makes this mode more interesting as you can keep going on a map until you're moving up the leaderboard. Another interesting feature is that all replays for top times can be watched for any of the top times. Really handy to get pointers on how to improve your own times.Then there's up to 4 player local co-op,. which I'm yet to try, but will give it a Steam Link bash soon to update the review.The only slight issues I've had with the game so far are:- That it doesn't tend to recognise my main controller as 'player 1', even though it is the first linked in my OS settings. Although not too much of a hassle as unpluggging the second controller sorts it.- There are very occassional frame drops, (on my PC at least), which can make the race mode difficult if they hit you at a bad time.+ I did have one more negative point above about controller support, but there has since been patched in support for this. Thanks very much!Great game, definitely deserves more of a following than it has... Perhaps a victim of not being seen much on release due to the amount of FPS asset flip dross that gets released on Steam these days.			"

												Not a bad game overall, minor complaint is not being able to change key bindings. Great game for easy Steam Achievements .			"

												Ugly graphics which I can live with. But for two players an xbox controller is required! Unreal!			"
