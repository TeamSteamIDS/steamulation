												Chris Sawyer, sole developer of RollerCoaster Tycoon, once said that ""many game designs suffer from having too many people working on them, losing their individual character and becoming games that look and play like so many others."" Dust: An Elysian Tail's animator-turned-developer, Dean Dodrill, programmed, animated for, planned out, and otherwise developed this game on entirely his own effort, save for a few sound people and a smattering of voice actors. He has nothing to offer you but his blood, toil, tears and sweat; times when he would have to cram ten months' work into three, times when his Christian beliefs were put to the ultimate test, even times when by some sheer luck or divine intervention, the solution to an impossible problem of development would come to him in a dream. And when the fruit of his labour came to see the light of day, it became a perfect example of the kind of game Chris Sawyer was talking about. A game that one man was sure he wanted to create, with his will, intention and vision left unspoiled in the final product by the opinions of the many others who would be working on it otherwise; a work of art with his personal signature left in every facet of it.Dust: An Elysian Tail captures the aesthetic of an animated movie almost perfectly, with just a few mature touches to keep its older audiences interested. Its characters, plot and background lore may not be the most complex, Shakespearian thing you've ever encountered, but if anything, they will charm you. In fact, I would compare the story more so to an ancient myth or tale of legend. Despite its animations only being about 12-24 FPS, which is pretty standard for animated works, it runs at a smooth, 60 FPS, and is uber-responsive to controls as well, so that it still plays fluidly with controller or keyboard. Especially considering the majestic hand-painted backgrounds and stages, as well as even the slightest shader effects, like light refracting around icicles, and bloom/lens flare effects that make their presence known, but don't overstay their welcome, I would call this, to my knowledge, the best-looking 2D game we've seen yet.Though the aesthetic of the game may grow to be your neo-childhood, the gameplay mechanics are fuelled on pure testosterone. Being the closest thing that I know of to a fantasy-action-exploitation-film-turned-beat-'em-up-Metroidvania, it carries an emphasis on stylish swordplay, massive combos, and looking like a total bad♥♥♥♥♥in the heat of battle, as well as some RPG-like mechanics, like stat levelling and equippable items, that you'll pay more attention to in the quieter moments, to add some complexity and sense of progress. In fact, you may find yourself caught up in an inner struggle over whether to raise the difficulty to add more challenge, or keep it the same to retain the feeling of being all-powerful. As is standard with Metroidvania-type games, there are hidden areas that can be accessed as you gain new skills, and great attention was put into making these areas still enjoyable to look for, and not just like a long, tacked-on extra journey.As was mentioned before, the plot isn't exactly the most complex thing out there. In a game like this, it actually works out for the better. It was a refreshing change to play a game that seemed so innocent and honest with itself. Even the protagonist, Dust, starts out innocent - he follows the trope of the amnesiac hero, having just come to in a forest with barely a memory of his past self. There's plenty of baddies to slice and dice your way through, sure, but Dust: AET is really just a journey of self-discovery that, as you play through and the pieces come together, slowly morphs into something truly epic. It gives you a rush unlike any other to fight your way through the final level, and to get to the final boss and pulverize him multiple times, even until the very end of the game, made me the most satisfied I'd felt with any game in quite a while.In conclusion, this game is criminally underrated. No review, including mine or any other, will completely do this game justice. You have to buy it to fully understand just how Dodrill's inhumanly hard work all paid off to create the best experience I've received from a video game in a long time - and you will, too.And for those who get tremendously upset over the fact that this game contains anthropomorphic animals, who cares? Playing this game won't turn you into a flamboyant, hyper-sexual sparkledog of a furry. It is something that almost everyone can enjoy, as long as you remove any prejudices about this game from your mind. Unfortunately, that seems to be the main thing holding people back from playing it. "

												Before I start, I have to say something, if you're looking for some short review of this game, this is probably not the right place to search but I'd like to encourage you to read those ""few"" words I have in my mind for quite some time.The game itself is a work of art, a masterpiece, practically made by one man who just wanted to show and share his story, it took him almost 4 years to make it real. It's not just a simple platform/slasher game with a pinch of RPG. This game gives you what AAA games don't, when you play it, it stays in your mind and your heart for a long time, you just can't stop thinking about main characters and their quest until you turn this game on again. Then, after 15-20 hours of playing which is a very long time for an indie game, the end comes leaving us with emptiness and one thought in mind... why it had to end so ""quickly""?But that's enough of my jabbering, lets talk about the structure of this game.The playthrough gives you a lot of pleasure, both of fighting hundreds of enemies and of finding well-hidden secrets or collecting your ""friends"". You can reach some of them only before the final bossfight, which is a great opportunity to backtrack a little and find out what we missed during our journey. Exploring the world isn't something that the game force you to do so, you just want to do it yourself. Why? Because the environment is just marvelous.A hand-made graphics and backgrounds are one of the biggest advantages of this production because it looks like a fairy tale that you can live in. You can explore it and admire such a fantastic and well-planned world. Every single location has its own charm and atmospfere without any unneccessary elements that could distruct us. Literally, every little piece of it is in the right place.Of course this game has some flaws and bugs but it just doesn't matter when you're experiencing such a wonderful adventure. And lets say something about it. You can't say a bad word about the main plot, if that was a movie, the author would definitely receive an oscar for it. The enjoyable mixture of both main and side quests gives you a wide range of every known and unknown feelings human ever had. I'd like to say it that way... from happines to sadness with sorrow and anger along the way in only 10 seconds.Let me say something about soundtrack too. Maybe while beating opponents to death, it's hard to pay attention to music playing in the background but when we stop slaughtering everything around, it's nice to hold on for a second, watch the view and listen to those wonderful tracks. This music is magic and it fits perfectly but listening to it without playing Dust is as much pleasurable. Ideal for a quiet, alone night with a cup of tea...And at the end... what about the fighting system? At the beginning you might think that simple sword-swinging combined with jumping isn't going to drag your interest for a long, even if it looks astonishing, but during the game we can find various of unique moves and techniques that can provide new ways of making incredible hit-combos up to 1000 hits!There's much more I would like to say about this game but no amount of simple words can express the way I feel after playing this, for me prefect at any aspect, game. I hope my review will give you a proper answer to the question: ""Is this game's worth playing?""And one last thing, you may think that 15 euro for this game is a little to much and you may be right, you can just buy it in a bundle or wait for a discount but... this game is worth much more... 15 euro is nothing for such an experience like this that not many games can give you, really, honestly.Thanks for your time and have fun, you'll have it, that's for sure.(and sorry for possible mistakes in this text)			"

												This is everything an action rpg sidescroller can offer! Fluid combat, gripping story and characters, nice music, good voice actors and a good gear system for upgrades and armor.This is a game that I highly recommend to anyone. It's major selling point is actually it's combat that is so fluid, smooth and makes you feel like a total badass when chopping up your foes.Worth mentioning is also that only one guy made this game (not counting voice actors and artists working on music) in only four years!

												Great game. I really enjoyed it. The game looks really nice. Even though there is one weapon, you are able to do a few different moves and fidgit attacks. The game is metroid styled and you will have to return to some areas if you want to get the extra stuff. But just have fun hacking and slashing your way through.The voice acting isn't too bad and the characters look nice. The soundtrack is beautifull. It's really great.Though the game isn't that long and there isn't really a replay value. It's worth picking up for a good experience. If you don't have anything against furries atleast.. Because the game is full of them.I would pick it up when you get the chance. Maybe during a sale if you really prefer. But no matter when you pick it up.. You should pick it up if you enjoy a metroid styled game that looks amazing. Just hack 'n' slash to the end~			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Dust: An Elysian Tail Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: 2D; Action; Adventure; RPG; Metroidvania; Platformer My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 14-21 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Casual gamersREVIEWDust: An Elysian Tail is an interesting little item.  It plays as an exploratory 2D-sidescroller / action-platformer— a genre colloquially dubbed “metroidvania.”  Captivating, hand-painted artwork and a stellar soundscape merge with solid gameplay mechanics and a trope-riddled, but well-told, narrative to form the end result of a pretty enjoyable game experience.  Be aware: this game was designed to be kid-friendly, and does have an overall essence similar to what you may find on children’s Saturday morning cartoons. The gameplay essentially boils down to 2D hack-and-slash combat and mild exploration.  The combat is fast paced, fluid, responsive, and quite fun at first.  But, to be honest, it does grow stale as the game goes on.  You have the same attack abilities by the end of the prologue that you have at the end of the game— and it isn’t that many.  You will quickly see the best strategy is to just spam a few buttons while hopping around, and that’s basically what the combat becomes.  The various difficulties spread the gamut from “for children” to “for masochists,” with some sweet spots in between.  Although, even on “Hardcore,” with some grinding you can raise your stats to a point where it becomes easy… if you have the patience.  Furthermore, there are a lot of secrets to discover and treasures to find throughout all the levels, which to me was more exciting than the combat.  You will unlock new movement abilities as the game progresses, which allows you to reach new treasures in all the levels.  This also was slightly annoying because often times throughout the game you will spot a treasure that is tantalizing you just beyond your reach; but it then becomes that much more satisfying when you return later to collect it with your shiny, new double jump ability. The story is overloaded with tropes and clichés.  Right from the start: you are greeted with a main character with heroes amnesia, but a great power within; you are greeted with a cute-but-ditsy, comic-relief sidekick; and you are greeted with another sidekick who knows your destiny, but won’t just come out and say it… just to name a few.  From there, the story does develop into something more substantial and decently interesting, yet still quite cliché.  Also, as I alluded to earlier, the game has an overall identity akin to what you find in children’s cartoons.  And the characters and voice acting do not stray from this identity.  Thus, some of you may find some of the dialogue and acting to be annoying or childlike.  Although, personally, I thought the voice acting was pretty well done and enjoyed most of the scenes— but I am easily amused, and am unquestionably a child-at-heart.Dust: An Elysian Tail is definitely a good game.  There are a lot of great elements at work making it a true gem.  It does get a little stale towards the end of the game if you are returning to previous areas to 100% it, but if you just play through the game and don’t bother with that stuff then you will probably finish before it goes flat.  I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre and would say it is a safe bet for the average all-around gamer. Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Initially Dust: An Elysian Tail was supposed to be a cartoon, titled Elysian Tail. Most of the work was done just by one person, Dean Dodrill, who was an artist, animator, screenwriter, producer etc. Development lasted 7 years and it seemed that Elysian Tail will never be finished. And may be so would be if Dean Dodrill had not decided to turn his project into the game.　TOTAL RECALL　　The protagonist (Named Dust) wakes up in the woods and doesn't remember anything about his past. Immediately he meets new friends who will be with him all the way. Wise and calm speaking Blade of Ahrah and the keeper of this sword, a charming flying little creature (Nimbat) named Fidget. By the end of the game, we'll know who is actually Dust and what hides his past.　ELYSIAN TALE　　From 2D game with cartoon furry characters i didn't expect epic or exciting stories. But in fact, everything is different. The story begins with a fairly quiet atmosphere of a small adventure, but ends by epic confrontation between the two armies fighting for their cause. And the personal story of the protagonist is intriguing to the end of the story. I can’t don't say special thanks to the awesome work of actors. I want to underline a terrific job of actors and artist. With their help, the game fascinates and keeps interest until the end.　DUST IN ACTION　　Dust: An Elysian Tail is 2D beat ‘em up action RPG. Combat system uses 4 buttons with which you can perform various combos. In the game is not very many kinds of enemies, but their combinations create a variety of interesting situations, making fights interesting enough. Boss battles can be quite difficult, but still interesting.　DUST TO DUST　　Quite unexpectedly (at least to me) the game was not just entertainment for few evenings, but very exciting story with charming characters and interesting gameplay. Watching the final credits, i had only the pleasant sensations. Wants to be back to this enchanting world to see more adventurous of the Dust and Fidget.　　Special attention is worthy of the music written by the composer HyperDuck SoundWorks. Alluring beautiful songs which helps plunge into this fabulous world and enjoy while playing Dust: An Elysian Tail.　Multiplayer:　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　　Co-op:    Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned  for 10-20 hours (Depending on the chosen difficulty)　　　　 Surprisingly interesting story　　about furry, telling us about the inner　　demons, worthy of the good movie　　(or cartoon, probably).　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Amazing story and cutest companion Fidget [9/10].

												Dust is an impressive game considering it was made by a single person.  It's not only longer than most games (especially at this price range,) but more polished as well.  While the game does have some rough edges, it remains very high quality overall, much more so than many games produced by larger teams.The game is made in classic metroidvania style with maps made from sizable rooms and areas you can return to later for secrets once you have obtained new abilities.  While the game is split up into a number of different maps, fast travel is very limited, only allowing up to 2 entrance points for most maps.  This makes backtracking rather tedious, though you can buy an item from the shop that lets you exit the current map from any save point to get out faster.  It's worth going back and searching for all the easter egg characters though.Dust features some fantastic art and while I'm not really a fan of the anime-style characters, they are very well-made.  The larger-sized characters shown in dialogues are obviously low resolution though for some reason which makes them stand out from the rest of the game.  The game world and the different graphical effects for combat abilities are just as well done, some of the best I've ever seen even.The story is also very well-written with a good variety of characters and excellent voice acting.  It's not just another cliche ""save the girl"" story which is a nice change of pace.  I don't quite understand why every character seems to have a different accent while living in the same village though.The combat system is where the one-man development team shows its weakness however.  While the combat looks and feels good, the controls aren't terribly responsive.  Executing combos requires you to press the attack buttons much faster than the animations play so I frequently found myself attacking several times after defeating a group of enemies due to queued up actions.  The main problem though is that the combat is just too easy.  Dust feels like a god, able to stunlock the majority of enemies in large groups with basic attacks and block almost any attack, even from bosses, though blocking it's pretty unnecessary for most of the time.  The game tries to compensate for this by making enemies hit very hard, which is a poor design choice shared by most modern games.  In addition, airborne attacks will lock on and dash towards any nearby targets so it's not really necessary to aim and you also have a very powerful airborne spinning attack which helps you dodge attacks as well as doing heavy damage.The combat system starts to show more balanced and challenging combat near the end of the game when enemies start using more varied attacks and dodge your attacks more.  Unfortunately by this time you will have obtained snowballing gear and a full-screen stun attack which when combined, makes quick work of any enemies short of the last level.  The only actual challenging part is the final boss fight which makes for a very sudden change from the rest of the game.The other big weakness of the game is the loot system.  The items themselves are well thought-out, though mostly direct upgrades.  Some of the late-game items are ridiculously powerful though, causing a massive snowball effect which can be enjoyable, but just makes the game even easier.  Where the item system really shows its weakness, however, is in the drops.  I have never had such a big case of ""what the hell do I do with all this money"" in an RPG.  Gold and crafting materials drop nonstop, and by selling a crafting material to the shop, you cause it to be stocked, gaining one in the store every couple minutes.  By the end of the game there were more than 200 copies of half the crafting materials stocked.  What could I possibly do with them?  Later in the game, you will also find tons of blacksmithing blueprints, the vast majority of which will be useless or not craftable until after you can already buy the item.Despite having a lot to say about the weaknesses of the game, they are only very small marks against it.  The game is still fantastic overall and one I would not hesitate to recommend.  Even though the combat is very easy and the controls a bit unresponsive, it's still fun.  Overabundant loot and useless blacksmithing recipes don't affect the game much, though it makes me wonder how much better the game could have been if these things were improved.As a last note I did run into a few bugs in the game.  There's a persistent stutter every couple seconds while playing that seems to pop up whenever you enter a new map and clears up after a couple minutes.  It's a bit annoying.  The game also crashed trying to play the ending cinematic which is a first for me.			"

												This is a game that I had been meaning to play for a while now. The visuals in the screenshots look absolutely stunning. Dust has been out since early 2013 and it has that real polished feeling of a fantastic game.  Essentially this is a hack and slash, RPG, side scroller. The combat system is basic, but does exactly what you need it to do. All of the attacks look and feel satisfying, as well as the parry system which normally is something that gets overlooked in a lot of games like this. The musical score behind Dust is somewhat of a masterpiece too. I am surprised they haven’t released just the sound track as it is beautifully crafted.  The level design on offer here is interesting too. Each ""zone"" is split into separate areas, which can be a little daunting at first because they are all huge. One gripe I did find is that the map in game isn't very clear and can sometimes cause confusion as to where you actually are on it. As I said above, the combat system is basic, so this means you can master it very easily. There are a few combos to learn as you progress, as well as a welcome addition of a crafting mechanic. I also liked the feature where if you sold something to a shop, they would then stock this in the future so you can buy multiple copies of it; this is really helpful when you are trying to craft your armour and weapons. This took me roughly twenty hours to complete everything on offer, main story line, challenges and side quests. The game did feel slightly repetitive towards the end of the last chapter however. I would really recommend you pick up Dust: An Elysian Tail, you can more often than not find it on sale, but I would still recommend this at full price. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												I'll be honest, I only bought this because the Humblr Store had it on sale and it was a pretty looking game with furries that took itself seriously instead of being a mascot title. That's a rarity, especially in the kind of mainstream stuff you buy on Steam or XBLA.That was the reason I bought it at first, but I finally got around to playing and it wound up being the best $2.99 I ever spent and a game that might actually break the top 10 on my list of all time favorite games.The first thing you'll notice going in is that the graphics are BEAUTAFUL and there's some real nice fine detail in the animations like the fabric of Dust's clothes rippling as he moves. The effects like explosions, projectale attacks, and lighting are also really pretty and can result in some great atmosphere and awesome moments during combat. It feels almost like an interactive cartoon at times.It also ran maxed out flawlessly on my 750ti/FX-8320 at a solid 60FPS that only dropped to 51 during loading and cutscenes, but I think that's more an issue with how the game load assets than something that more horse-power or optimization is going to fixThe second thing is the story is great and will more than likely bring you close to tears on far more than one occasion, I can only describe the emotional rollercoaster than ensues from the ending of the second chapter onwards as something that wants to break you one way or the other. The story has some fantasy cliches, but it uses them well to paint a world that world that likable because it would be unashamably idealistic if it wasn't at war. I'd almost say it remained that way in spite of itself because all the drama and heartache makes it feel very much like you're earning a happy ending for all the people you help along the way.The game also has a welcome sense of humor in it's lighter movemets that comes from hanging a lampshade on common RPG tropes like stuffing huge items in your pockets or random fetch-quests. The gameplay is a simple side-scrolling RPG with Castlevania exploration and some pretty hefty rewards for putting the effort to cheack everywhere and uncover every secrect in the gameworld. The combat is very much a button-mashing that relies on timing and keeping up with on-screen action to rack-up combos and avoid getting hit instead of complicated combos or a huge arsenal of moves. So yeah, I'd say this is worth a buy and a place in anyone's libraiy.			"

Dust: The Best Tail I've chased and played with in a whileThis is the story of Dust, a person with extraordinary capabilities. When I first met Dust, I did not think much of him. He felt generic, not showing his face, having amnesia and struggling to find out where he came from. I did not connect much with the furry man, as such a story is hardly original.Fortunately, his gameplay did connect with me from the start. He hacked and slashed like a true soldier, finding keys, treasures, abilities, upgrades and many more fine, fun things in true MetroidVania fashion. One could even find a small funny easter egg related to the horrible CastleVania II when you look hard enough(You'll chuckle when you find it). With such gameplay and 2D graphics, one might ask if such a game has still the right to exist amongst contemporary gamers. The answer is a loud and clear YES.From Whence it CameAs I travelled through the world of Falana, I was amazed how much I did start to connect with Dust now. The man was truly regretful of his past and sought to redeem himself through every possible noble deed he could manage. My little companion Fidget started to grow on me too. Being a flying whatever-the-♥♥♥♥-its-name-is with a high-pitched voice and a knack for being scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and knowing everything better, the little critter soon turned into a lifelong friend of mine.And of course there was Ahra, the mystical and mysterious (Wow, never thought to use 2 words in the same sentence starting with 'my') sword. What was his purpose? What was our purpose with him? What did he know about us and what did he keep silent from us? The plot started to deepen, becoming ever more emotional from chapter to chapter. The journey felt like a personal growth, a new sense of understanding the world. Rising PhoenixHacking and slashing through hordes of enemies is fun, but not necessarily very hard. Granted, I finished the game on normal, but even on normal I did not die many times. Fortunately, there are two extra difficulty levels (tough + hardcore), which can be set from the very first playthrough. As mentioned, Dust can be upgraded and level up, giving you the option to invest more in Dust's defense, attack or Fidget (the flying critter has interesting powers). Items can be crafted from materials that you gather from fallen enemies, such as pendants, rings, armor and augments. The only downside to the crafting is that you do not actually see Dust wearing the item. Also old school I guess. If grinding to get all the materials you need isn't your thing, there is a nice mechanic with a travelling salesman that follows you throughout your travels. Sell him one piece of a particular material he doesn't have and he'll ""catalogue"" it. After that, he will update his stock over time and provide you with the materials you once sold him....And the Dust SettlesAfter clearing the final area and defeating the final boss, I realized something. I actually cried at the ending of this visually stunning video game. Being created by just a SINGLE person (aside from the story and music), this game is something very, very special. For little money you get at least 10 hours of gameplay, make that 20 hours if you're a completionist like me.The gameplay is solid, the controls are fine and the story and progression are perfect. This is an indie game which could easily be viewed as a triple AAA title.Gameplay: 7.5/10Story: 9/10Controls: 8/10Graphics: 9/10My final, personal score: 8.5/10			"

												Imagine if Disney joined forces with Rankin/Bass[en.wikipedia.org] (producers of 1977's The Hobbit[www.imdb.com], 1982's The Last Unicorn[www.imdb.com] and various cartoons like ThunderCats[www.imdb.com] and SilverHawks[www.imdb.com]) and made a beat 'em up RPG. Now imagine that instead of all that, one guy made a game that pretty much equals what you'd get otherwise. He didn't have the relentless marketing or the massive capital of Disney, etc., yet he still sold 1 mil plus copies of Dust, and why? 'Cause it ain't bad, ain't bad at all.The star of this game is the combat, which needs only one word to describe it: fun. Right there, Dust nails the cardinal rule of gamemaking: make it fun. And it is. Early on, you obtain the bulk of your magical-talking-sword-fighting mechanics with a whirling dervish sword attack called the Dust Storm and magical projectiles from your cheerfully snarky companion, Fidget, which combined make it possible to let loose ridiculous combos on your opponents, by combining a few staple sword moves with the two aforementioned special moves and the fact that Dust Storm will launch you into the air so you can endlessly slash at monsters all the way across the screen, high up into the air and back down again with nary a pause in the combat 'til they're all dead. Again: fun. Simple, uncomplicated fun. There's a lot of combat across 10+ areas, and if you backtrack (which you will if you want to track down the secrets/collectibles which include a lot of fun little nods to other indie darlings) it does unfortunately get a little tiny bit old because the earlier enemies do not level with you, but it's such a small gripe because it's still just plain fun to tear the crap out of them with the incredibly responsive swordplay. If I had any caveat about the combat it would be to advise you to play the game on a harder difficulty than normal; I more or less suck at twitch combat and I found myself breezing through the majority of it on normal. So, just a thought.My enjoyment of the combat in Dust far outshined anything else during my time with the game, which is great because -- and here's where I have to be a little bit of a jerk -- my first impressions were less than sparkling. I picked up Dust in a Humble Bundle, and probably would not have bought it by itself because it is marketed exactly as how I described it in the beginning of this review: it heavily features anthropomorphized animals in the Disney tradition and the story and voiceacting has a distinctly ""anime"" feel to it, and to be completely honest, neither of those are what I look for in games. Or anywhere else for that matter. I'll leave it at that; suffice to say, I was not expecting to be wowed by Dust from the first few minutes of the game. Having played through it, I would have to say that Dust hits the sweet spot of having great appeal to its core audience and at the same time having enough artistic chops to satisfy the rest of us who aren't perhaps into the same thing. There's a lot of comic relief in the banter between the main character and his companion, and a few touching moments in the story, an otherwise plain ""who the hell am I"" plot. It's not as bad as it could be, though some of the voiceacting really borders on laughable and/or unlistenable at times. This is all just my opinion, of course, so don't hit me or anything; fact of the matter is that this will appeal to some people and not others. If you can get past the trappings of the story, there is an awesome game waiting underneath, it's just a question of how much eye-rolling you're willing to put up with.And here's another reason you should just suck it up: the art in this game is freaking gorgeous. Every new level is hand-painted and lovingly animated, with special mention for the waterfalls in the underground levels. Just pure eye-candy, and it looks even better while you're kicking tail all over the place. It is clear that the development of Dust was very much a labor of love, because I repeat, the art is beautiful!It's a very fun game, it's an amazing achievement for such a small studio, and it serves as a good reminder not to judge a book by its cover.

New review because my old one didn't do it justice:I haven't been playing it for long, but my mind often drifts to it. It's one of the few games in recent years I almost played through twice (my Steam library grows almost daily, so that kinda means something) and which I have very fond memories of.It's a very special title because it was designed with much love and confidence and shows so in a variety of ways. If I had to name a game that not only looked like a charm but worked and felt just the same it would be Dust: An Elysian Tail. It was backed up by Microsoft as an original XBox Live Arcade game and took almost four years to make but was created mostly by just one guy. Dust: AET is a Metroidvania action platformer (meaning you discover new powers along the way and do some backtracking with them) with a clean interface, gorgeous art, fantastic music, nice story, adorable characters, great voice acting, solid combat, rudimentary leveling/gear/crafting/shopping mechanics and platforming of mild/average difficulty.Despite what some other reviewers/players/press people say: I love the voice acting. It's warm and colorful and fits the equally colorful style of the game (which does not mean it's an immature game; although some young deers running past me gave me some Disney vibes and some overarching topics include classic ""teenage""-ishy things like the protagonist and his sidekick growing with their responsibilty along the journey there sure are some darker moods and themes too like war and genocide). Some people don't like the VA or certain characters but I think they are being unfair or misunderstand something. I think the VA is nailing it down and just like it was meant to be. it's cute and sweet and just nice, with much heart and soul that could be credited to a set of relatively new/inexperienced but maybe even more so passionate VAs. This is one of the few games where I had urges to look up contact data of the voice actors only so I could thank them for their efforts. I think I know bad voice acting when I see it and Dust: AET has none of that.The music is fantastic. Again, in this game specifically, I noticed a behavior I don't see too often, least not that I would've been aware of it in other games as much: Some levels I loved to roam a couple of more times, or stay in them for a bit longer than I really had to, so I could keep listening to the powerful tracks running along some more. The always very beautiful art even in the somewhat ""gloomy"" levels added to it and made the game, with all the other things it has to offer, a constantly enjoyable and remarkably well-rounded experience from start to end.The story is kinda interesting and ends fairly conclusive. Some questions remain unanswered though. Apparently there was more planned to it, what turned out to be game was originally meant to be an animated film called ""Elysian Tail"" and you can tell by some lore ideas that are sometimes brought up but not elaborated too much. Like what exactly the talking sword you're wielding is (there were meant to be seven of those, it seems, but the game never brings that up) or how your funny and adorable sidekick ""Fidget"" came to be a ""Guardian"" of that sword in the first place. So, I'd love to see a sequel sometime in the future when the creator feels for it (well, all who appreciate this game as the gem it is seem to do). And maybe a Fidget plushie.

			I like this character. I already uploaded a video with the same title, but I was running through the game again and I figured I'd record a few of her lines of dialogue.		

Old review:Fluid and fun combat, beautiful art, great colorful voice acting, well-enough outlined and varied characters and some pretty fantastic music. A very well executed action title. The story holds some interesting points but the overall scheme has been seen before (mysterious hero with no memories of his past helping some rebel faction fighting some evil force). The combat, crafting and leveling seems a bit underdeveloped (only few combos, button smashing was often proving to be enough on ""normal"") but that didn't really hinder my fun with it. Probably best played on ""hardcore"" or ""tough"" difficulty - ""normal"" felt easy too me except for some boss battles. "

												Buy the Game.Play the Game. Regret finishing the Game. Replay it again for nostaligic feels and tears.Many tears. Overall, this game is everything you can want in a game. It's engaging. It has a certain level of difficulty that you eventually will overcome with practice. And the side characters are so engaging and unique, that you almost believe they are your everyday folk that you seen in real life. Dust and Fidget, the main characters, have a funny and unique relationship. You'll look forward to all the anime cut scenes within the game because they always almost make you laugh. Now what are you doing? Buy the game! Play it! And lose yourself in this wonderfully drawn, gaming world!			"

												You're Dust, a mysterious being without memories of his past. While you fight your way through monsters, you'll eventually discover what you are, where you came from and where your path will lead you. ""Dust - An Elysian Tail"" is best described as an action-rpg-platformer i guess.You'll jump and fight your way through hordes of monsters with your sword throughout multiple levels, gain new abilities while you progress and level yourself up while finding/and or crafting (which is kept very simple) new gear to make you even stronger.The graphics are beautifully drawn and very colourful. The 2 main characters, Dust and Fidget, his sidekick, are pretty memorable and their dialogues have some decent humor in it.I really enjoyed it and would recommend you'd give it a try, if you like this sort of genre.

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an awesome action platformer! The story in this game is just fantastic... I felt excitement, compassion... and I even dropped a tear! (As far as I know, only 1 other game made me cry). The feelings are really strong in this game. There's way more to the game then just the story though! The platforming is good and the combat is fine. The art is simply amazing and the music is extremely good also!I can't believe i've stopped playing about 1 hour in when I bought this game back in 2013. I came back to it just a few days ago and I had to play it until the end when I really got into the story. I've finished the game way past bedtime...I actually really like the item system and character stats. You have to put your skill gems where you want your strength to be and it affects how you will play the game. I love finding new materials and crafting items too, it's quite simple, but well done. The metroid-style layout of the map is very enjoyable and the numerous save points makes the game a non-frustating experience.Honestly, apart for some aspects of the combat (such as no food cooldown and clunky movement during melee strikes) and the game only taking 13 hours to 100%, this game is perfect. I would recommend anyone to purchase this game if you want a good story and an amazing game in general!			"

												Dust is quite an amazing game if I do say so myself. I had no idea how much I was going to fall in love with this game. The storyline really sucked me in, I enjoyed the voice acting as well. The art and soundtrack is far beyong amazing in my opinion. To think only 1 man created this entire game blows my mind. I was never bored in this game, I always enjoyed my gameplay and combat that I dragged out the gameplay as long as I could. I'm going to play it all over again for sure. I really think everybody should give this game a try, you have nothing to lose. :)			"

Posted: November 1, 2014
												Dust: An Elysian Tail...To be honest, I only bought the game due to the viusals on the previews. Those alone seemed to be amazing and played a decisive factor. At first, given all the reviews, I was a bit sceptycal. I was afraid that it would be an over hyped game by the community and in the end it would something bland. Fortunately, it wasnt the case.So the big plus on Dust:+ amazing visuals (except cut scenes - those appear to be from early free flash games)+ cool combat system. Amazingly fluid!+ cool soundtrack+ interesting level construction+ Easy to play and to master + gameplay length just rightThe bad:- Story is rather generic (it has a couple of twists, but nothing unseen before or trully unpredictable)- may become repetitive at times- can´t seem to skip some cut-scenes.- perhaps a ""nightmare"" mode should be consideredI think those minus can even be neglected / forgotten given the quality of the game. I can imagine myself playing it over again in a couple of years time.I had fun playing this game. I took my time to make my character quite strong (I think I was level 50  - 52 when I finished the game. I had a lot of fun in some levels, and loved the final boss battle. I have finished the game, recovered my last save, gained a couple of levels only to play the final boss battle again.I thought that the game could be a bit more difficult. Appart from a couple of situations that were actually tricky, you can almost go through the whole game without actually feeling that you are in an eminent risk of dying. However, this is a dream game at every level for a younger audiance.My recommendation - get the game and play it. You will often find it on steam sales w 75% discount (I have seen it like that 3 or 4 times until decided that I should buy it), but after playing it, I feel that the full price would be a fair deal.Hope the analysis was useful for all the undecided.Cheers,Latinnus			"

												I admit I got this game while it was on sale but wish I bought it for full price. Don't judge it as a ""furry"" fandom type game all because the world has anthro animals in it. The game is just the same and care taken into it as any game with human characters.- Beautiful worldThe environments and backgrounds are stunning and lovely, giving each area a breath of fresh air. I had fun going back to other maps just to learn of secret rooms.- Great Combo SystemThe combo system is spot on in my opinion, specially for keyboard users with minimun controls so anyone can pick it up and try all of the combos without having to master the game. Not many games like this are spot on for keyboard users but this one is for sure.I had so much fun comboing the enemies and it never felt like a chore, you really feel the damage you are doing in every swing of your sword.- No Material GrindingThe shop system is a  lovely touch, trade in a material you found and the shop will restock it over time, helping to lower the need to grind for materials so you can focus on the story.- Beautiful StoryI was shocked and crying when I found out who Dust was, for ages I was curious from others reviews thinking it couldn't be any different then most cliche games have but I am so happy I was wrong. You really feel sorry for the characters including a few NPC's who you do quests for. One of the more original plot-twists to a story I have seen in a while, specially for a video game.- Funny CharactersThis game is full of sad and funny characters all standing out from one another. I don't think I need to mention how Sassy Fidget can be while also being adorable. Some NPC's also have some lively comments to add into the humor of the game and make them appear more lively and not just there to be mere NPC's.I really would recommend this to anyone, not just those who are into the Hack & Slash genre of games. It is really fun and well worth buying.			"

Gorgeous gem of a gameJust to get straight into this: I fell completely for the unique charms of this game. During summer 2014 I've played a lot of Dust: An Elysian Tail, and I enjoyed every single minute of i. It's basically a 2D sidescroller hack and slash game, with some lightweight RPG elements. You play as Dust, a strange character who doesn't know where he is, who he is or what he has to do. There a two friends on your journey: a magical sword, and one of the most cute characters EVER in a game: Fidget, who has to look after the sword. It took me only minutes to fall in love with Fidget, especially thanks to the exceptional voice-acting. The story may look bland at first sight, but actually is very good and cleverly conceived: there is one main storyline throughout the game which unfolds in an often unexpected but still easy-to-follow way.As far as the actual gameplay is concerned, Dust mainly focuses on swift attacting combo's (which are ideally suited for an Xbox 360 gamepad, the game actually being an Xbox-port) and some jumping and puzzle-solving action. None of these are really difficult, but there are some hidden places which need skill to be found, and six arena's that offer a good challenge to anyone. Combat combo's are limited, and once one gets up to strength by levelling up, things get a bit too easy. During the last third or so of the game, I felt like incincible strong, almost invincible, only to realise at the very end I needed all my strenght for the final boss fight. I strongly suggest playing the game on the ""hard"" difficulty setting - it will be difficult during the first hour or so, but then the extra challenge really pays of.Visually, Dust is stunning. The combines a gorgeous 2D sidescrolling scenery with a handpainted look with very distinctive figures of all characters, used during the dialogues. Some of these are so cute that I'd like to have them printed out and hung above my bedside. The visual style gives the game an unique artistic look: it feels like having a soul of its own, just like a good comics book or a series of drawings. Soundwise, Dust is a blast as well, with very well suited music, and absolutely fantastic sound-effects, not to mention the exceptional voice-acting.All in all, this is a gem of a game, a non-pretentious masterwork with a touch very much of its own. I can't think of any other game using the same visual style, nor the adorable cuteness of Fidget.Overall score: 8.5/10Go and get it, and enjoy it to the full.			"

												This is definitely worth a playthrough unless you're one of those people that's had a terrible childhood where your parents abused you and you weren't allowed to watch awesome 90's cartoons like Bucky O'Hare and Ducktales, instead you grew up watching That's So Raven and other junk which make you go OMG FURRY this is! Anyway...This game is a side scrolling fighting story-driven game that does a lot of things good and a few things merely ok. Everyone harps on it being 'furry' but I think that's just kneejerk reaction. It's just got animal characters in it. If this is furry, so is Ducktales. No one will be yiffing anything. The combat is fun, but does wear a little thin near the end thanks to not much variety. You have a sidekick who is a squeaky voiced flying mouse bat fox creature, but she actually ends up being not annoying (at least in my experience) because she's a bit sarcastic and tends to be overly genre-aware break the 4th wall to crack jokes. The story feels a little rushed in places, but not bad. From what I understand, the dev basically had to work 20 hour days for a couple months to crank the game out, and while I can see some rough patches overall it's a pretty fun experience. The best way to describe it without spoilers is if you combined the fantastical art style and platforming of Earthworm Jim games with the gameplay and character advancement of modern 2D Castlevania games, plus a bit of Klonoa thrown in for character design and story. Dust takes all of those elements and makes a very satisfying experience out of them. Also Dust has one killer Camel toe so there's that.My score for Dust: An Elysian Tail is:4.5 Dust Camel / 5 Toes			"

												You do not remember your past, but everyone else seems to remember everything of what you represents. Dust is your name, but who really are you? I do not usually care about the storyline in games, but Dust: An Elysian Tail has kept me very interested from start to finish. Very early in the game you find a magic sword, who knows everything, but will not tell you anything! The magic sword wants you to take him with you as he will guide you on your journey ahead, and you use him for combat. You will be companied by a tiny, little, flying creature called Fidget who had been protecting the sword until you showed up. Fidget is my favourite character in Dust: An Elysian Tail. She is very adorable and makes you giggle, so cute. However she is not only there for the humoristic side, she is very helpful for combat and to learn new skills as you progress your game that are very effective. Dust: An Elysian Tail is a platforming game with simple RPG features. You follow your main quest while also being handed side quests that mostly are about finding missing people or finding an item and hand it back to that person. You earn experience and loot by completing quests and defeating enemies, which allow you to level up and upgrade one of the four passive skills. The game also offers a crafting system where if you find blueprints you are able to craft the loot if you picked up the required materials for it. The RPG element does not go deep in Dust: An Elysian Tail as it is very basic but otherwise is implemented very well. Dust: An Elysian Tail is a short game, but it is generally very enjoyable during the entire play through. I like how the story goes, how the game is being played, and I love the art style a lot. It is very pretty to look at, glittering and colourful. I especially felt dragged in during the snow levels, mixed with the soundtrack. Oh, and Fidget! Fidget, Fidget Fidget~!My only complaint is that the cutscenes of Dust: An Elysian Tail. There are only like three of them, and they come at the end of the game, but they are very awkward to watch and not well done at all. Compared to everything else about the game, the cut scenes just fall hard and should not have been there. I was disappointed they had to resort to cutscenes. However it is a very minor complaint.

This game had some very nice art and very great gameplay ONE PERSON MADE THIS.Little big game one of my all time favorite Pro + heartful story+ Action and controls+ Art is beautiful and immersive+ The beautiful music + Attention to the details and animations (stepping on snow, butterflies from grass etc)+ The easter eggs you can find you will know from various games+ Control vibrations can save your life for certain moves. Cons - some cutscenes are a bit cheap but it is an indie game- voice acting is decent, sometimes voices are higher in sound quality and sometimes it seems far off so could had done more to the audio

												Frankly, this game got me back into gaming, after only a few hours of playing it. But now that I've finished it, and am on the way to 111%, I think I can give a fair and balanced review, apart from the fact that I love it.This game is a modern classic. As everyone else has said, there's a lot of metriod-vania aspects to the game. And the platforming reminds me exactly of the first rayman game ;p. Especially dem floating platforms. Oh boy, some of those levels in Rayman 1♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so much....anyway, I digress. The gameplay elements are very polished, if a little simple. The RPG elements fit in nicely with the rest of the game.The controls are surprisingly good and responsive. If you keep dying, it's not the games fault. You just aren't very good at it. The story..alright, it's pretty predictable, and cheesy at times, but I liked it. So that *obviously* means it was good. If you go for only the story, it's a short game, but still fun.Oh, and the visuals, soundtrack, sound effects? ...perfect. I've heard plenty of people complain about the voice acting, but I thought it fitted in well with the game. Maybe that's just me though.I can't say much that is bad about this game, because I genuinely can't think of much to say. I would point out that there are some repetitive parts, but I didn't find the whole thing repetitive, because every stage looks so beautiful and usually a new element is added for each new area. All in all, this has to be my one of my favourite games on steam. Certainly worth $15, and if you get it cheaper, it's a steal.I won't give a numerical rating, but know this; I highly doubt you'll regret getting this game.Sounds like the review is over, eh? But the scrolly thing isn't at the bottom. Yes, there is more to come, but feel free to ignore it.This game is good, and can I just say, if you genuinely think it's a fault that the characters are anthros, please read on, and wake up.Why does this bother you? It doesn't mean it's a furry game. That's like saying rachet and clank is a furry game. Does noone else think this adds an extra charm to the game? Imagine this game, or ratchet and clank if all the characters had been human. Alright, it wouldn't have ruined the game, but I reckon it wouldn't have been as fun.So please...just accept a brilliant game for what it is.			"

												An action/platforming RPG in the vein of Castlevania, Dust drew me in, hook, line, and sinker. The game puts you in the shoes of an anthropomorphic amnesiac called Dust, and teams him up with floating friend Fidget and wizened talking sword Ahrah. Together, the three of you travel the land of Falana, righting wrongs and uncovering the secrets of Dust's true identity. The plot walks a tight balancing act between family-friendly and dire darkness, and while it's successful overall, some characters (Fidget) do tend to add a somewhat childish, yet still charming flavor to the tale. Despite the world's somewhat medieval vibe, the dialogue is wholly modern, which is oddly jarring, but in a Disney-film-set-in-the-olden-days-but-everyone-talks-like-it's-1990 sort of way. The banter between the three leads is mostly fun, and goes a long way to establishing them as companions — and eventually, friends. As I mentioned, the game unfolds much in the same way as the Symphony of the Night flavor of Castlevanias: explore a variety of locations in 2D space, gather new equipment and ability upgrades to slowly expand your movement possibilities, fight lots of enemies and bosses, help out others via side quests, and gather hidden treasure. While Dust only has access to his sword and several of Fidget's magical projectiles, the tight physics and the outstanding combat keep the game feeling exciting all the way through. Mixing and matching various attacks and combos is thrilling, and combined with the awesome animation, the battles are utterly chaotic and begin to seem like one epic, violent dance. The final level and battle of the game are an utter symphony of carnage. Fortunately, the controls are tight, and you're very much in control of every slash, smash, and dodge. Dust occasionally turns to face a target other than the one desired, but it doesn't happen nearly often enough to really bother me. Also, while the entire game felt very fair, there is one particular enemy late in the adventure that can break all of the established rules of battle. Parrying you while facing the opposite direction or knocked down to the ground and dodging into the background with far greater frequency than even the final boss, this enemy felt a little cheap — though this is admittedly a nitpick that only affects the final hour or two of the game. Visually, Dust looks like what every Disney game from the 1990's aspired to be. The hand-drawn background art is gorgeous and diverse, and the character models are big, colorful, and move with a fluid grace that gives Rayman a run for his lums. There are numerous particle effects like rain, wind, snow, and ash, and tons of dramatic lighting and blur effects during combat. If 2D graphics were food, I would eat Dust all day. The musical score is deep, emotional, and diverse, and lends a huge degree of weight to the various locations and scenes it underscores. There's plenty of audio feedback during combat and in menus too, and all of it lives up to the high-water mark set by the graphics and music. The voice acting is generally pretty good — Dust in particular gives a great performance — but a few here and there (Fidget) are a wee bit cutesy for my taste. Still, no character's voice is outright bad. The PC version automatically detects your control setup and changes the menu layout to suit your choice of mouse and keyboard, keyboard, or gamepad. Keyboard/mouse combinations are certainly serviceable, but the best way to play is undoubtedly with a controller in your hands. There's also a nice selection of knobs and dials to prettify your visual experience if you've got the hardware for it. Considering all of that, Dust absolutely makes a great transition to PC. The game has a set of four difficulty options, the usual suite of Steam achievements, and several challenge rooms for you to struggle with, as well. Playing on hardcore difficulty and completing 100% of the game took me in the neighborhood of 19 hours, so there's certainly plenty of game here for the price, too. Dust was undoubtedly a labor of love by its creator, and it shows. This game oozes craft, artistry, and love, and shows it off in every facet of its design. There's great gameplay, graphics, music, and heart here, and I have no reservations whatsoever in wholeheartedly recommending it to anyone that enjoys these kinds of games.A Must Play "

												Awesome game. Great art design, music, story, and characters. Just fun to play. Game was made by ONE guy doing all the animations and the coding and it looks like a AAA title. Only had help with the music and story. Must buy for Indie fans and ARPG fans. One of the best console to PC ports ever. PErfectly ported. Full gamepad support, k/m, AND keyboard only.The game has a very cute set of characters and may give you a few tears as well. Fidget will either annoy you, or make you go ""dawwwwww"". Made me go ""dawwww"". The game is a fast paced action combat in a side scrolling form. Characters are all anomorphic style. You are able to level up with RPG elements, and you play as a guy Dust with his sidekick Fidget. Fidget adds a new element to your fighting style and unlocks new powers as you play. You combine with Fidget to make even more powerful combos. There are a bunch of Easter Eggs in this game too actually. With some really odd puzzles giving homage to some of the greatest Indie titles ever. The treasure chests are sometimes hidden ad clues are given with notes you find as well. You will love seeing some of the amazing alternate worlds that the Easter Eggs provide. Sending you to strange areas to find them in short little levels that try to use the mechanics for the gme and Easter Egg you are looking for. It is relaly cool. Support this guy and buy this game. It is truly great and as one guy this is a great accomplishment and the game is incredibly fun. Game also has trading cards.			"

This is a semi open world 2D RPG with mechanics not dissimilar to a fighting game.  Great art style, the game is gorgeous  really fun/ in depth mechanics in dealing with enemies the soundtrack, my goodness, I listen to it while playing other games due its epicness. I believe this game suffers from the Psychonauts syndrome. Highly critically acclaimed, however no one heard about it. This is a beautiful game.

												The game itself:I have played it to a completion of about 83% in 15.5 hours, so it has a decent lenght, I absolutely adore this game and i realy wish for a sequelbut anyway, i am getting distracted, here are the pros of the game:+ a very epic and wonderfull story+ Characters who all have their unique charm+ gorgeous scenery and music+ a very fluid combat style+ no material ""grinding"" once you sold a piece of material, the shopkeepers will restock it themselfes overtime+ a very nicely done crafting systembut as with every game, there are contras altho i cant find many:- some secret areas are impossible to find without a guide or something (and thats something you WILL need to do  for some certain quests)- some may think that the game is to cartoony in terms of style, but thats something i personally love- platforming can be a bit unbalanced at times- you need insane ammounts of healing items on the higher levels			"

												Don't let the ""deviantart furry"" art style fool you, this is one of the best metroidvanias out there, a lot of emphasis on the ""vania"" part as there's a lot of influence from the old Castlevania games as well.  Combat heavy but not light on exploration.  Good characters and voice acting.  Great environments.  Lots of good action (though maybe a bit simple).  I really like the store system where you catalogue crafting items by selling one to a store, and after that stores start gradually stocking up on them, so you don't have to go grind for them yourself when you need them.

												The one most beautiful game I've ever played in my life. Amazing soundtracks, extraorinary scenery, voice-acting that is like melt butter, and a story - so brilliant that it left me collecting the burnt pieces of my heart spread across the floor.Dust: an Elysian Tail will always have a special place in my soul. I will remember this game to the day I die - and hopefully even after that. I'd like to send my warmest regards to the people who made this; thank you for the journey of my life.

 Dust: An Elysian Tail, The Best Indie Game Out There!  Dust: An Elysian Tail is a mix of Platformer, Hack n' Slash and Action-RPG, If you're a fan of one of these, you really should give this game a try.  The Story:	  It has a touching, Mysterious story, you get to play Dust as and get to know more about yourself as you proceed through the game, Accompanying Fidget and The Blade of Ahrah. The Gameplay:	 Dust: An Elysian Tail has a very satisfying gameplay, where you ""vwooshzheeooshzoozoosh"" as Fidget says, The soundtracks are mesmerizing, Environment is really cool in all parts of the game, It really makes you feel you're in a fantasy world. Unfortunately, the cutscenes are way below the game level, I feel like they haven't put much effort into it as much as they put into the game, Which kinda ruined some moments for me. Also the bosses are very weak, you can keep them in mid-air with Dust Storm, damaging them until they die.  The Characters: The main characters in the game are very unique, look and personality, Unfortunately some the side characters look generic and aren't very special, I'm talking about some of the side quest characters. It doesn't effect the gameplay though. Dust, Fidget and Ahrah make a perfect team! Overall:	 Dust: An Elysian Tail is a 2D Action-RPG + Platformer + Hack n' Slash game mixed together, It has a great story, music, and game mechanics, the only downside for me was the cutscenes and the unchallenging boss fights, I'll happily name it my Favourite Indie game of all time, and one of my favourite games aswell, I'll proudly give it  8.5/10	  "

												So, I just kinda nominated Dust for the ""Woaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh, Dude"" Award for December 2016 and because I never really told a lot of people what got me into the game and why I ""only"" got 24 hours or so here's a Review so I'll be finally free of this (not really existing) torture of questioning.[TBH I was actually only questined one time, but please! I need a god damn story to make the Review interesting. Sooooo this totally never happend, mkay. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A THING!!!]Dust: An Elysian Tail is in my opinion one hell of a game. The 24 hours of playtime I've got are more or less from one sitting where I played through every Side Quest and the Main Quest right to the final boss (and stoped then, because I was literally playing for 19 hours straight). As you might can guess from that statement this game got me real good. I'm in love with the whole universe the game is creating.But how did I get into this masterpiece of a game?Actually I didn't really... I only bought it in the last Summer Sale, because it was every other day on my recommended list and I never really knew anything about it more than it's named Dust. And then one day I thought, f**k it, and bought the game with the last money on my steam-Acc and never regretted it.But what is Dust?Dust is a 2D-Sidescrolling ""Beat'Em'Up"" with some elements of Hack'n'Slay Titles. You're fighting with a magical sword which name I kinda forgot atm (Shame might fall upon me xD) and with your magical and totally not satirical Sidekick Fidget, A Nimbat (Please don't ask me what exactly a Nimbat is... Because I couldn't explain it ^^"" ).Throughout the game you'll get some upgrades for your Armor, Attack, Health, etc. through grinding and/or buying/building stuff that looks nice in the ingame menu, and from a certain point onwards they're kinda needed if you're not perfect with every little attack you'll use.But this is with the genre not really a new thing to bring to the table.In general Dust not really goes out of it's way to try the new ultimate Upgrade of Game-Controls n stuff but rather keeps it simple and on the line one might've already played. But the Gameplay and (to a certain degree) the story didn't really keep me going, but rather the Characters (that are all totally awesome, especially Fidget. I love the Sidekick that comments on a lot of things you'll do, always with a grain of Satire and Ironie. Just the best!) and the Art.As I don't want to spoil anything from the story I'll keep shut about the characters but the Art... You're seeing that? IT'S FREAKING MARVELOUS!!! I'll just keep add with saying what most probably know, but Dust was (more or less) created by one individual (minus Voice Acting and Music if I' not completly mistaken ^^"") and for that the Art is just beautiful. That's something I could put on my wall and be like, yep, that was worth it!Not one design really stood out as being created with less interest than the others, I was kinda blown away when I saw everything ingame!But, because I know not everyone has the time to read through my ramble on stuff that aren't technical and aren't about distinct parts of the game I'll end it hear with a short and sweet Too long; didn't read.TL;DRDust: An Elysian Tail is a wonderful game with a really creative mind behind it. The Gameplay is like it should be and the Art and OST are ingenious. The Story though a bit cliché at some points is through it all interesting and even the Side-Quests are made so you want to go out of your way to Clear them.While I personally found the VAs perfect for their characters some might come off as a bit ennerving (especially the Sidekick Fidget) as they'll talk through quite a lot of Cutscenes.All in all I would recommend this game to more or less everybody. While some might find the Gameplay addicting, others will find their joy in the story and others will just look up R34 and will be happy with their lives.So buy this definitely, when it's on a Sale! When it's Full Price it's still it's money worth (I would argue even more) but I can see why some would be turned off. 14$ isn't much but like a wise guy (probably) said: Even the Pence will be a dollar in times of need...[Nope that last sentence is totally by me, a wise guy wouldn't have spoken about worldly topics :3)And with that I wish all of you whom reading this a beautiful day or night and I hope I've helped you in your decision.

Posted: November 29, 2014
												First of all.This is one of those games. The game where you actually believe in the adventure, where you actually feel yourself inside this world. It's a tale that goes on for a great period of time and makes you savour every single momment of it. And in the end. After dedication, amazing gameplay, character interaction. It's one of those rare gamesWhere you do not want the story to end.And who wouldn't really? This game is a jewel. This game is EVERYTHING you could ever possibly want. Lemme explain it to you.A bit of background. First of all this game was made by one guy. Dean Dodrill. Keep that in mind when I go on and say he spent four complete years on this project.Very dedicated guy for the content he made. I assure you. And I assure you. There is going to be more. Judging by the story content and every bit of plot it throws at you. Along with the confirmation of the developper. There is going to be more someday. Not now. But someday.Why am I excited? Here are my thoughts during the entire gameplay.The first thing you see when oppening the game are the graphics. A luscious rain falls on the background and as soon as you begin the game you realise something really, REALLY cool. (Sidenote This port on Computer really adapts itself well for an Xbox port. If my memory doesn't fail me you can plug an Xbox controller if you wish. But why would you do that when the Pc settings are so well ported?),  The game is hand drawn. In fact. EVERYTHING is hand drawn and well colored. The colors are flashy and memorable, including the amazing shade of blue your main character has. Every landscapes from plants to creatures to other characters, buildings. All of it is hand drawn.It's nuts. Every thing Was designed for it to be absolutely Stunning making me gaze in awe and wonder like a 10 year old a couple of times. So when it comes to quality. It is heartwarming. I love it. and it makes me think alot about Child Of Light and Rayman Origins which are both great.So you begin this game and the game throws you this simple almost fairy tale like story.You are Dust, A cloaked and straw-hat wearing swordman who has woken up in the forest, alone, who can't remember his own path, and his guided by a magical sword accross the land to repel the evil racist millitary campaign of General Gaius. And so you take on the fight along with your trusty Nimbat sidekick named Fidget to both save the land and remember who you are in the proccess.Recapped like that it, sounds like absolute cheese. But it's not. I assure you that this very basic and simple plot holds a lot more within it than you could think. You end up caring a lot towards both the main characters within the story. Your partner, Fidget, looking very similar to Daxter from the Jak series, probably has the most adorable and well thought personality that I have ever seen. Her voice her comments her attitude, everything about this side kick is incredibly adorable. And she actually helps you along the way by providing you some of the best attacks in the game when combined with the sword making you feel like she is actually really useful. Something rare from a sidekick.The story is one of those fairy tale stories that are meant to keep you enchanted along the way. And I absolutely love it. The gameplay works as a 2D beat em all type of games with a, although lacking in numbers, selection of very useful combos meant for every situation. As all the combos are worth using, you do not really feel the need to add any other combos into it. There is also a great parry system included which you need to use well in order to beat certain monsters.You also gain experience and money outside of combat allowing you to level the stats of your main character and buy items and equipments. Defeating ennemies allows you to gain ingredients from them for you to combine and create stronger weapons, rings and armor making it for a constant character progression as you wander the land.Quests are given to you giving your new locations and purposes to do things in exchange of very very useful rewards. Some of these quests are absolutely crazy with good ideas (The box quest being one of my favorite).Outside of combat. It is an exploration game very similar to Metroid. You search the land for secrets the map is separated into rooms and your characters gains new abillities as you advance making you feel this constant progression.Level designs are stunning. When I said you explore the land. You EXPLORE the land. With all of it's hazards you go through forests, plains, cavers, mountains, tundra's, ghost house's, volcanoes. Giving you a lot of variety for level exploration and enviromental hazards like poisonous mushrooms and  spikes, mines, avalanches, lava. Making it just a jolly good ride all the way.I cannot find a single flaw in the gameplay except for the higher difficulties setting.Those are only minor nitpicks. For example. Hardest difficulty setting, you are zero invincibility frames and hazards are increased in frequency. (Like poison mushrooms spraying on the floor more frequently). It makes certain environment hazard a complete atrocious pain and almost a difficulty spike in certain areas as the hazards are just shooting everywhere (You will see once you reach the cave level on the hardest setting). Another example would be that if you fell in a pile of lava. There is a good chance that on the harder difficulty setting you might get stuck endlessly in lava due to you having no invincibility frames making it a pain when.SPOILERFighting the last boss in a volcano filled with instant killing lava where as in a lower difficulty setting, you could easily jump away after getting lava-burned.END OF SPOILER.That's a very small nitpick though. The rest of the game is mighty fine and challenging in the other difficulties making it an amazing experience all the way through.And yes. For a beat em up. The game is 20 hours long on average. Which is almost twice as long than a usual beat em up.Did i say this game was made by one person?Should I really tell you if it's good or not? From what I said above, this game is an absolute godsend made out of gold and pristine quality.It was so good I did not want it to end.How many games have ever given you this feeling of pure commitment?It is one of the rare games I will never forget and treasure in my heart forever.So in recapPros:Amazing hand drawn graphic almost shimmering you blind with their beauty.Great combat gameplay with crafting and a level up system making you feel progress all the way through.Metroid/Catlevania exploration to the finest degrees rewarding you with both upgrades and easter eggs.Fidget.Very in depth story overall that starts off pretty slow and cheesy and slowly escalates into something great.Fidget.Fidget.It's only 15$ while it could easily top alot of triple A 60$ titles on the market.20 hours long gameplay which is a great bargain for only 15$.Great finale along with a certainty of a sequel (More Fidget) in the future.Cons:Unforgiving environmental hazards at higher difficulty.A sort of slow and cheesy start when it comes to story telling (Gets way better after a while)Boss fights are a little deceiving but great nonetheless.Other than that, It is pure gold and I recommend you to buy it for yourself. Buy it as a gift for your friends. Support Dean Dodrill (He deserves all the praises in the world). I can't tell you how much this game has claimed such a cozy spot in my heart. Probably one of my favorite games of all time.So get this game.You will love it i assure you.You will play this game gazing upong it's amazing story and gameplay. Laughing in joy.And will slowly reach the end of your journey and more and more you will feel this anguish building up inside you.And mutter.I don't want this tale to end. "

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a tale about a person who can't remember who he is, and must follow the guidance of a talking sword, and a flying thing named Fidget, to discover his past, and find out who he is.This is probably in my Top 3 Best Platformer of All Time list. It's seriously that good. The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and breath taking. This is the most beautifully hand drawn game I have ever seen, for real. The characters look sub par, but what is really beautiful is the enviroment you play on. The background is detailied and beautiful, and the land that you do the platforming on isn't confusing because of how good it looks, unlike some games, where the platforming sections look beautiful, but it's almost TOO detailed, to a point where you don't know if you're gonna land on a certain platform or not. This game does not fall in that category, luckily.I love a good platformer that also has good RPG elements. This game really has that: when you level up, which I will discuss how you do so later on, you get a skill gem. With this, you can increase one category. Attack, Health, Defense, or Magical Power. My personal favorite is magical power, you can twirl your sword so fast, it makes a dust storm, and then your companion Fidget can release magic, which by itself is harmless. But combined with your gust, it gets amplified. Using this ability is by far one of the most satifying parts of the game.Speaking of which...the combat in this game is fan freaking tastic. I've personally never been a huge fan of side scrolling combo based combat: but this game does it so well, that I don't mind it. What I like is that doing combos rewards you by not just doing extra damage and making you look cool, but also rewarding you with extra EXP. I really could never get into games like Street Fighter, because there were simply way too many combos and tricks to learn. This game has some basic combos, that you can use throughout the entire game, I'm sure of it. And if you're up to the task, you can try learning some of the more hard to pull of combos. You can also use the dash ability to evade incoming attacks, and, if you're feeling a bit frisky, you can also try parrying. The combat feels smooth, and is one of my favorite parts of the game. From defeating enemies, you can also get certain trinkets, materials, and equipment...This equipment can be equiped, and gives you slight stat boosts. You may also find blueprints, which can be brought to a blacksmith, to make ever better items. Speaking of blacksmiths, you need materials, which you can get from enemies, or to buy. If you have materials you don't think you have a use for, you can simply sell them for cash. I like this system, it gives you freedom as to what kind of playstyle you want. Want to be a tank that can absorb a bunch of damage, a cool mage, thanks to your friend Fidget of course, or maybe you just wanna be a badass swordsman who can take out crowds with your sword. The decision is entirely up to you.Now, let's talk less about combat, and more about story and character: as I mentioned at the start of this review, you follow 2 characters: Fidget, and your talking sword. Fidget is by far my most favorite character in the game so far: she's funny, and sometimes breaks the forth wall in the most humorous ways. And hey, I really like who ever voice acted her. Speaking of voice acting, it's phenominal in this game. I'm moderately surprised that a game like this had such good voice acting. Anyways, to wrap up the story, so far it seems promising, with some nice characters, and some possible forshadowing that you may catch on to, might I add.The soundtrack and sounds are well made. They feel smooth when they need to be, sharp when they need to be, and intense when they need to be. The music really sets in the enviroment, and while most of it is just ambience, it's still So, is this game worth buying? If you like platformers of any kind, yes, it is. I'm honestly having trouble thinking of any negatives of the game. It has perfect 9s-10s in every category. Music, art, gameplay, story, style, it's got it all wrapped up in one neat little package.			"

												Dust: An Elysian TailTo be honest, I had no idea what this game is, i never heard about it until i saw some reviews about it(but i didn't watch them),anyways, so I started playing it, and wow, it's really good!StoryThe story begins when you wake up with a talking flying fox and a talking sword in your hand, and you can't remember anything.so, you fight your way to a small village which is under attack, when you reach the village, you try to recall who you are, and what have you done...GraphicsThe graphics is pretty great! and the art is just gorgeous, all the characters are animals, and they look very cool and cute.Most of the game you run in a forest, caves, villages etc. and they made those places amazing! really good atmoshpere and feeling.i couldn't ask for more tbh, i just loved the graphics!GameplayThe gameplay is just addictive! the game is a platformer, so you run with your talking sword slashing monsters, and with the help of your flying fox you can cast spells too,you need to make combos to gain more xp and level up since it's RPG.they also implented blacksmithing, you can forge armour, artifacts etc. which is pretty fun and nice,there are substantial number of side-quests and you can also do challanges to gain prizes and achievments,so far i've encountered 3 bosses, which are pretty strong and challenging, so the gameplay isnt that easy, and i like it that way, also, you can only save at a certain spots so you cant just quicksave your way, which add to the challange.ConclusionI wasn't really sure about this game at the beginning, but after i played it, i found it really fun and addictive,the graphics are very nice! the art is just beautiful and the feeling sucked me in!the gameplay is just fun!!!for 15$ it's worth it, grab this game and play it, you won't be sorry!Be sure to play it with a controller, and if you can play it on a big screen it's even better :)Some screens: http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustLynx/screenshots/?appid=236090&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=grid "

												Overall I disliked this game, but its probably just not for me. I can see why others like it. Cons- Combat system is too simplistic. You will use the same moves over and over. Some moves are really not even useful against any enemies.- Game gets repetative fairly quicky, about the 3-4 hour mark. - Not a true metroidvania. Would call it metroidvania-lite. - Dialogue is bad to the point of cringey at times. Pros- Great art. - Decent story. - Fun hidden secrets for those who like treasure hunting.			"

												I got this game back in Jan 2015, I've been interested in this game a long time ago but it wasn't until recently that I got into playing it, and I'm glad to have enjoyed another good game in this genre.And so, I want to call attention to all who hadn't even tried booting the game, or to those who started the game but didn't take the time to at least finish the main story. Also to those who have this on their wishlist, better grab this game the next time it goes on sale!If you are just up for the main story, and I really hope you are at least interested on what/why/who Dust is; it shouldn't take over 12 hours to finish. The game's difficulty is just right and would go quite easy as you buy/craft & equip better items. This is a good game and it would be a waste not to go back and finish if you already tried playing earlier! Trust your guts and the tags that you see: Action, Platformer, Indie Metroidvania, RPG.To completionists going for 100% achievements it would take about 20 hours, I recommend starting with any difficulty higher than normal so everything can be done in a single playthrough. Also, try not to prepare too much for the final battle, I uploaded a video of my playthrough and it wasn't even hard because I took some time to equip some of the best items. Final chapter would be too easy if you've been trying to get all the best equipments before you got to this point.Cameo appearance from other indie games (Gomez, Super Meat Boy, Tim, etc.) will make you remember, appreciate, & crave for more good games in this genre; and I hope you got an itch to go play them too if you hadn't already. Overall it has been very enjoyable.			"

												Not even 15 minutes before I started writing this did I beat the game a second time, finish with 100%, and earn all but one achievement.  Despite the fact that this says I love this game, I will acknowledge that it isn't perfect.  Let's get started, shall we?First things first, for those of you who are uneasy about the furry tag this game has, I can personally assure you that the characters in here are safe for all ages.  The worst you'll notice is some language, yet even this is used rather lightly –almost not at all.The way the story is executed leaves me little to say in here without giving spoilers.  You play as Dust who has woken up in glade with no memory of who he is.  A talking sword called The Blade of Ahrah as well as the sword's little guardian, Fidget, accompany him on his journey of self-discovery.  Because of this kind of story, there is a lot of dialogue to go through.  Whether you can enjoy that or not I cannot determine.  Personally, I loved it.  All of the characters had personality, and it was well brought out with the voice actors hired.  The only exception to this, and this depends on your own perspective, would be Fidget.  Her squeaky voice and quirky personality will either be a hit or miss.  On a separated note, the only technical flaw was that the voice actors didn't use the same equipment.So, on to the gameplay.  The majority of your attacks will be with the use of your sword.  Even though Fidget provides some ranged combat, it will end up feeling like a brawler.  The controls are very responsive.  The actually difficulty of this game may feel a bit low, and this is something I had to find out for myself during my second playthrough.  A wide variety of items are dropped by slayed enemies, some more common than others, but all have their uses for crafting augments (for Ahrah), armor, pendants, and rings –of which the last you can wear two.  These items can enhance, or in a few cases weaken, your attack, defense, luck (chance of a critical hit), and Fidget's power.  Overall, very solid.The artistic side of this game is probably what can put this game above many others.  The artwork in here is stunning to say the least.  You might find yourself staring at anything and everything in this game.  It has all been hand-drawn by the one and only member of developer Humble Hearts, Dean Dodrill.  The soundtrack is likewise stellar.  Most tracks were created by the Northern Ireland duo Hyperduck Soundworks with a few others done by Funky Rustic, a.k.a. Alex Brandon.  The only times I felt the soundtrack was lacking was during the majority of boss fights, though even this is more so of my expectations.  I still listen to this game's soundtrack very often when I'm doing my weekly chores.  Challenging for me to find something I enjoy as much as this.Thanks for reading.  If you have any questions/comments/critiques on this “review” of mine, feel free to share.  I will appreciate it.			"

												For reference. I played through the game just once at the time of this reveiw. Didn't 100% it but I still finished the game.This is a really solid game which boggles my mind that this was supposed to be an XBLA only release? Its like if the Lord of the Rings movies went straight to DVD!Pros:-Fighting felt fluid yet easy to pick up and awesome to watch-Enemies actually varied their tactics. Yes there were recolors but they were not plentiful-Leveling system never felt grindy. Maintained a steady stream of level ups to match the enemies power-The soundtrack.-The artstyle. Some of the levels had me put down my controller and just stare at it for a whileBut every rose has its thornsCons:-While the platforming was fast it was also a tad imprecise for what it asked you to do. I faced death multiple times from a platform going too fast or another mishap because of the generalisitic controls-The story, while decent, was usually handed to you in a massive chunk. It was all about ""Tell, not Show"" which let the game down a bit-Some specific enemies are just ridiculous to the point where skipping them is almost required. Woe betide if you cant.-The Tale/Tail pun bugs me. but I'm just being pettyThose are my good and bad points about Dust: An Elysian Tail. I wish it didnt take me 1 night to finish (also please where is sequel. D: )			"

												Bravo, Dean Dodrill. You have made one amazing game. I feel like I am playing an extremely well made cartoon. Intriguing story, high quality voice acting, graphics I can't stop drooling over, gorgeous music, and addicting action. Everything is top notch. There are many times when I pull off multiple platform jumps or fighting combos with a huge grin on my face because it's just such fun. If you aren't a huge action fan, you can play the game on casual which makes the fighting significantly easier. There's so much more to this game than fighting monsters. I highly recommend.			"

Product received for free
""Dust: An Elysian Tail""  is a Metroidvania style platforming action-RPG in which you play as the protagonist, Dust, accomponied by sidekick Fidget on a mission to save Falana and it's inhabitants from General Gauis' wrath. The game was almost entirely made by Dean Dodrill (the creator) alone. He handpainted the games' visulals and vistas, wrote the story alongside Alex Kain and programmed the game himself.I played the game on the normal difficulty setting using a keyboard and a mouse and spent about 16 hours completing all the levels and collecting all the collectibles. I made short notes about what I felt was positive and negative about the game. The following are the positives and negatives of my experience of the game. Positives:	- You start you adventure with a descriptive tutorial in which you learn the basic controls. The tutorial also features the     beginning of the story and is almost perfectly integrated into it. - The game has smooth and solid platforming. Special skills are aqquired as the story progresses such as,  double jump and iron grip, which help you platform better and visit places which you couldn't get to early in the game.- Platforming is also quite challenging and there are many terrain based puzzles you need to solve to get to some platforms. There are many different types of barriers and obstacles and you often need to find alternative paths or make calculated sacrifices to health to overcome them.- The game also has a strong RPG aspect to it such as collecting materials for crafting different items, completing main quests and optional side quests and grinding for XP.- The graphics are really good in the game. The backgrounds are all handpainted and animated meaning they change dynamically as you platform and move. There are different terrains, weather conditions and day cycles which makes the game very immersive and atmospheric.- This is also an action game in which you need to learn different combos to defeat your enemies. The combat animations are smooth and satisfying. You see different animations while executing different combos which is really important.- The story is well-written and I personally like how it developed. There are also several reccuring themes and plot twists in the story. There is flow in how the story progresses.- There are many different characters in the game, each with unique backstories and motivations. Doing quests for these charachters enhances the experience of the game and makes it more fun. Some characters make hilarious jokes.- The voice acting is phenomenal and one can see the effort put into it by the actors and the director. I watched some uncut youtube videos in which the voice actors recorded their dialouges and man they were funny.  - The sound tracks was made by HyperDuck Soundworks. It is really good. My favourite is the ""Abadis Forest"" track.- There are many types of enemies, each with unique traits and charachter models depending on their locations. There is also a learning curve as each type of enemy has it's own combos and attack patterns.- You can level up from XP by defeating monsters and completing quests. The level cap is 60 as of writing this review. Going up a level rewards you with an ability point which can be used on four different traits such as attack, health, defense and Fidget's magic power.  Negatives:	- There is no enemy scaling and the combat becomes very hack and slash after you obtain decent weapons.-  The boss fights were a major let down. First of all there were not many bosses and second, they were short. Also mini bosses with some sidestory would have made the story much better - Some characters lacked sidestory and contextualization. I really enjoyed Fidget for example but would have liked more of her lore etc.- There is no way to obtain some items, except for them randomly dropping from enemies. It was frustraiting grinding and waiting for these random drops, as someone who likes to max their charachters in games.- There were some minor bugs I encountered and I had to restart the game once due to the screen getting stuck. Apart from that the gameplay was smooth. Final Thoughts:	Dust: An Elysian Tail has a solid story, combat, platforming, soundtrack and other things it advertises. The game is well optimzed and polished. There is flow in the gameplay and the game has replay value and potential. I would recommend buying this game for an enjoyable 15+ hours experience. 9/10	I received this game for review purposes from Steamified.

												After seeing the game in the Microsoft Sale for just 2€, and watching a huge amount of reviews calling this game ""close to perfection"" and giving rates like 4/5, 9,5/10, and even a few perfect scores for both profesional reviews, and even players from Steam, I decided to give it a try, to see what's the hype all about. And if there's something I can't stand, are lies. This game was NOWHERE close to perfection, and it does feel unfinished at times. I still had fun, and I still think this game is worth the purchase in a good sale, but let me explain everything properly, and as usual, I will start with the stuff the game does NOT do well:First of all, and for me, the biggest dissapointment I had with the game, is the difficulty. OR RATHER, THE LACK OF ANY. This game is HELL EASY. Want to know something else? I started my first playthrough of the game on the hardest difficulty, ""Extreme"", hoping to get an enthrilling experience, like when you play Dark Souls for the first time. And what did I found out? All the difficulty does, IS JUST MAKE ENEMIES HURT MORE. That's NOT difficulty, that's ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY. AND IT SUCKS. It doesn't matter if the enemies kill me in two hits, WHEN I CAN STILL KILL THEM IN ONE! Specially in this game, where the Devs put a lot of work into the Dodge moves. Yeah, enemies kill me in one hit, BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN HIT ME. THAT SURE IS EXTREME! IS IT ALSO POWERED BY MOUNTAIN DEW? This lack of difficulty reaches the highest settings of stupidity on the bossess. There are, literally, just 4 legit bosses on the game, and a handful of mini-bosses, that are nothing but enemies you'll find later in the game anyway. And are those bossess extreme? HELL NO, THEY'RE EVEN WEAKER THAN NORMAL ENEMIES, HOW IN THE ACTUAL F#CK IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE, MICROSOFT!? And if that wasn't laughable enough, you can buy gems that will revive you to full-health whenever you're defeated. They're just expensive, but I had a good amount of them when I reached the last stage of the game, anyway, because I had WAY TOO MUCH GOLD (more on that later). The only thing this difficulty does achieve, is making the dangers of the dungeons and maps become ACTUALLY DANGEROUS. The Ice-caverns, for example, where ice-shards drop from the ceiling? I liked that part, because it required some skill, timing and luck to dodge them, but getting hit once was an insta-kill. Another issue I have with the game, is that it's rather short. It took me 13 hours to complete it at 113% (I still don't know why the hell it says 113% and not 100%...), getting god-damn everything, rescuing every ""friend"", and all the side-quests done. If I didn't bother to do all of those things, I would have probably gone through the entire game in 6 or so. I did just spend 2€ on the game, so it's fine for me, but think about the people who paid full price. And no, it doesn't really have much replayability. Just a few achievements you can't get in the first run of the game (mainly because you have to choose one thing or another, but you can indeed get them on the first try by making two different saves).The third big issue about the game, is the Item system. Don't get me wrong in this, it's an amazing idea. But sadly, it feels rushed and unfinished. Nearly all enemies on the game drop a huge amount of different items you can use to make items. What's the deal? Those items you can build with blueprints, can later be bought anyway, so I found myself ignoring completely the crafting aspect of the game, and sold every loot-item I got right away. And I still beated the game without much trouble... And what I said before, I ain't kidding: A Goblin, or a Soldier, drop the same items as a ugly giant spider, or EVEN A GOD-DAMN FIGHT-JET. Only a few of them drop unique items, and most of them are either expensive, or only good for crafting. The last issue with the game, are the enemies. Like I said before, bosses are a complete joke (beated most of them without even taking damage, even the final boss, who has 4 fights in a row, that I beated on the first try, and didn't took damage on the first two), but the normal enemies are no different at times. Pretty much 80% of the enemies in the game will do nothing but to rush at you blindly, and if there's anything on the way, they might get stuck, or rather commit suicide by falling into a river of magma, or getting impared by spikes/ice-shards.  The rest of the enemies are okay, though...Except one. In the ""Graveyard-like"" dungeon, where you have to roam arround to find 4 items for a old-lady, you will mainly find 3 enemies: Zombies that share the same dumb IA as most enemies, Zombies with giant tumors on their heads that, for some reason, act as the Creepers from Minecraft and explode when you get near them, and Necromancers, who deal NO damage, and do nothing but spawn infinite amounts of Zombies, and Zombies with tumors. And can you kill them easily? NO. They only get damaged by magic, and magic is both not powerful, and not that useful. So, you will spend a few minutes trying to spam magic to kill him faster, while Zombies with tumors surround your♥♥♥♥♥ and you have to choice but to kill everything. And everytime one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s appear, I end up farming enough XP to level up once. That's just being dumb. Maybe that's why I was so powerful at the end of the game, those guys kept appearing, and when I left the area, I had like 20 levels more...Now, leaving all that crap behind, what does the game do good?The story, even though short, and a bit obvious at times (I saw the mayor plot-twists from a mile ago), it does get the job done, and it can get you hooked up for more. It goes arround ""Dust"", a young boy who has forgot about who he was, and seems to have been chosen by a talking sword. He, the sword, and Fidget, some sort of ""cat-bat"", then go in a long (or rather short) journey to find out who is Dust, what happend to him, and since were at it, save the world.The combat system has some problems, mainly a lack in melee combos, but it's quite cool while it lasts. Casual players could understand them easily, and experienced players would love them. During the game you also get some new attacks, like the Storm, or magic for Fidget...Even though magic is kinda useless. You see, it's only prupose is to get huge combos. And what do you get from combos? More XP. Spamming magic like a casual gives you huge amounts of XP, like I've said before, and it ends up making the game easier, especially when you notice the huge range it has.The soundtrack and voices are probably the highlights of the game. Even though I found Fidget a bit annoying at times, breaking the 4th wall without reason, the characters are well voiced, and the music fit perfectly.Something I also liked about the game, are the ""Friends"" I mentioned before. What are them? Exploring a bit arround might lead you to find some sort of box (that seriously reminds me of the ones you would see in the first Rayman games...You know, THE GOOD ONES), and by using 4 keys, you can rescue a character from another indie game (or even two ducks that are supposed to be the guys who made the soundtrack). And not only that, finding these easter eggs gives you a permanent HP buff. Maybe I was also unstoppable because I found most of them without any problem, but the ways you find some of them sure are original. For the Fez character, you go into a messed up 2D style. For the guy from Braid, you summon a god-damn tornado, making a sick parody of the Tornado-crap from Castlevania Simon's Quest (Does somebody actually remember that game? Good old times), and then end in a dungeon where the soundtrack only continues whenever you're moving.The game is, despite the amount of issues that make it look infinished, or at least unpolished, quite fun. I would not buy it for full price, but I do recommend it in a good sale. But still, Bastion is way better. Buy that instead if you haven't yet.			"

												Good stuff all around, with lots of sidequest if you're into that.The combat, while satisfying, also doesn't really change much at all once you get the general flow of things, so it tends to get a bit repetitive towards the end.Dust himself is my favorite character. It's rare for me to ever like the main character more than everyone else, but he's a cool guy.The game has pretty environments and a well-made UI, altough the character designs could use a bit more care and detail for the most part, but it is understandable as this game was made mostly by a one-man team!All in all, a great Metroidvania game with enjoyable combat and exploration.

												Honestly, this game is beautiful, the gameplay is extremely fluid combat is very fun and the metroidvania style is really well represented in the level design. The Sidekicks are pretty funny, the Nimbat is hilarious and her often silly behavior is a wonderful choice in contrast to Dust's cool demeanor. This game's story is really surprising, you can run through it, jaded, and ignore it if you want, the gameplay is fun enough and the personal evolution of your character and his choices by themselves are worth the price of admission, but if you start paying attention you'll uncover a rich plot covering issues like Racism, the Moral Struggle of Absolute Justice vs Acceptance, and little a brother not accepting the guy his older sister likes. The story, 30% in, is enough to start some conversations with a friend or gaming significant other :) The game will get a full 10 from me because for what it's worth, I can't find a problem with it worth nitpicking, but broken down this would be my score. Gameplay 9 Menus 9 Replayability 9 Graphics 10 Story 10			"

												This game is one of the most impressive games I've seen made by a single man. The main draw of the game for me was the combat system, but I ended up getting hooked by the story and exploration much more. The game is very reminiscent of old Metroid and Castlevania games, especially Metroid due to the fact that you will unlock new abilities through the game that can be used to access new areas in levels that you've already been to. There aren't an incredibly large amount of levels, but the levels still take a decent amount of time to get through and have plenty of secrets all over the place. Back to the combat system that I said interested me before, it is very satisfying but tends to get boring quickly. I found myself just repeating the same combo over and over since there was little reason to use much else. Also, I'd highly recommend playing sidequests rather than just rushing through the main story because enemies become VERY damage-spongey if you aren't properly leveled. Now, the story; I got quite hooked into the world this game created, despite it's somewhat childish appearance at first glance the story actually gets fairly dark at times while the writing still manages to have a good amount of humor(Mostly from your flying sidekick, Fidget). All the characters seemed well-written to me, except for the main character, Dust. Dust came off as an awfully generic reluctant hero, and what little character development he had seemed forced and out of nowhere. The voiceacting is also very good, aside from, again, Dust himself. I can't pinpoint exactly why, but Dust's voiceacting made me cringe often. A lot of people hate Fidget's voiceactor, but I found it well-done and fitting for the character.Now, one big complaint people have about this game is the artstyle. A lot of people don't like the sort of ""furry"" artstyle this game has, but personally, aside from Fidget, all the characters reminded me more of something you'd see in an old Disney cartoon than something you'd see in some lonely wolf-kin's DeviantART gallery. The artwork for the levels is also VERY detailed and well-done, and the animations are very impressive as well. Except for during the cutscenes, for some reason the pre-rendered cutscenes have AWFUL animation quality at times. There were a lot of cutscenes where I wished they had just stuck with the in-game dialogue and preset animations rather than a fully rendered cutscene.Overall, this game is absolutely fantastic, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys those old Metroidvania-style games and people who enjoy a good story. Don't be turned away by the artstyle, I assure you there is no yiffing involved in this game. ...Just don't look up any fanart.			"

												A very good member of the uncommon sub-genre of RPG platformers, Dust: An Elysian Tail puts you in the robes of Dust, a mysterious warrior both because of his shady looks and his amnesia. You are accompanied by Fidget, a flying weasel-creature, and the blade of Ahrah, a sentient sword of typically quirky appearance.Sending you on your way, the game amazingly avoids the ""stupid tutorial"", instead making the learning of all your skills part of the story. That in turn is delivered through dialogue between Dust and his new friends and any non-player characters (i.e. peasants) that give oddjob quests to keep you busy. Quests are pretty basic: ""bring me my stuff from over there"", ""save my friend from monsters"", ""bring 5 goblin hides"", but some are special or significant, along lines like ""you are totally cursed"" and ""save video game characters"", to mention a few trying to avoid spoilers. I'd like to emphasize that ALL of that is delivered through a spoken, animated dialogue. Especially I found it funny how Fidget lampshades your accomplishments and troubles by bragging and whining about them in many a dialogue.While strong in story, the gameplay and especially combat is the second important part of the game. You hack, slash and sweep through the air and enemy alike through all of the levels. Basic enemies, like goblins and zombies, are weak and at the mercy of the Dust Storm, my attack of choice that makes the enemies (and Dust himself) fly high in the air. Special enemies have special defenses and attacks, like having invulnerability frames, requiring parrying or using Fidget to make them vulnerable to attacks. Also, there are bosses every few hours. Combat doesn't even get boring after a while because despite repetitive it's always pretty awesome and there's that risk of getting hit and losing ""chain"".That is at least the case on Hardcore difficulty level. Combat isn't that hard: if you know how to play and like to challenge yourself, I'd advice to pick the hardest difficulty level because then you actually have to avoid getting hit and combat becomes ruthless at times. I tried it on Casual level as well and I can pretty much guarantee it's easy enough for those of you who like to only experience the story.Cartoony looks, the graphics are nice and well fleshed out. I especially liked how e.g. the map screen (level selection) has got several different scenes. E.g. sometimes Fidget is sleeping but she could also be eating marshmallows looking dreamy. I would also declare the game's various musical pieces to be spot on - there are no annoying ones either to my knowledge/preference.On Hardcore difficulty getting all the achievements (well, except for one choice-based one) the game got me some 20 hours of adventuring, constant combats, puzzle solving and treasure hunting. It would be hard to be disappointed with this one. Get it, play it and love it!			"

												When I get to play a good game the least I can do is tells others about it. And this is a good game. It comes with a well written story (but not too deep) taking place in a great set of scenery with adequate variety. The screenshots on the store can give you an idea of what's included. What I loved most is the simplicity of the controls which you can get the hang of quickly so you can enjoy playing the game fluently. For treasure hunters and completionists there are things to look for with the appropriate rewards, that do tend to make the game easier though. If you are looking for a hard game then you should not start on normal difficulty. "

												Been playing it all day now, and i just can't seem to stop my love for this game! After watching Totalbiscuit's review on it just now, i am even more amazed!It got reactive battle mechanismGood animation and environment artTouching voice acting, tough one can say childish (i think it's charming)A good Story (for so far i played it)And the battles don't get boring, as when facing some new monsters, one's combo's and tactics should be altered to get the highest combo's and least of damage.Then after hearing this was made by 1 guy over the course of 4 years...Simple Amazing! Music is only not by him but is from proffesional level too!I am just lucky I saw this in the sale, otherwise i may never even have heard of it. If one must buy it at the normal price, it's worth every little cent you spend for this!Onward to fan art!			"

												quick review(+)-Amazing, fast-paced, fluid combat system, and you can literally kill everything with a flying creature's magic abilities and a talking sword.-Furries-Good music, the song during the ending credits is astonishing.-Furries-Fascinating artworks on stages-Fidget-Responsive controls-Fidget(-)-I was expecting some sort of customizatons, like changing Dust's clothes or changing Fidget's appearance, turned out i was wrong. You can only upgrade your armors, sword and accesories through crafting, which is kinda boring. -I couldn't feel the hype when fighting bosses-Need more kinds of slashing moves and combos (+/-)The story is...mehh, not bad but not too good.Keep in mind that this game was made by a single man, which is incredible.8/10			"

												So if you woke up in the middle of a land you’ve never been to and have no idea who you are? You’d probably wonder, but what if… you had a magical talking sword and a little companion who doesn’t know how to shut her mouth? You’d probably be confused or more the less, terrified. Yeah, welcome to Dust: an Elysian Tail.Dust: an Elysian Tail is a 2-D indie fighting game that is good-looking, fun, and has a really fine story. First off and most importantly: the gameplay is really satisfying. The combat system in the game is original and unique in a way that you can rack up to 100+ combos in seconds. Rampage destruction on your enemies and take them out first before they take YOU out. Be warned for if you’re not careful in the battlefield, you will be taken out. The gameplay is distinctive like that so you’re not completely this invincible warrior taking people out with one swing like in most games. Of course, the common enemies you find here are quite easy to kill; but also quite dangerous when they start grouping up on you. At first the game lets a few slips here and there, but as it progresses, it gets more and more punishing for each little mistake. But when you push out and get over countless kills, it’s all-the-more satisfying. When you get to that boss and take him/her out, nothing has ever felt more satisfying. Though, from time to time, the game will push you to your limit and you must push though. It’s excruciating at times, but it is genuinely worth it.As a reward for this, if you complete combos or take out a group of tough enemies, you will be given experience. The level-up system in the game is interesting for you can level up certain things every time you do so. So you can continue your path of terror. Like Skyrim, Dust: an Elysian Tail gives you that rare thing to be able to level up anywhere you want to, unlike most games where you have to level up certain things to be able to proceed correctly. Now, let’s move on to the graphics, where it’s about as good as the gameplay.… if not better.Dust: an Elysian Tail has about the finest hand-painted world. Yes, you heard me, everything in this game was HAND MADE. This is mostly Dust’s strongpoint; the world, characters, and even down to the details in the menu are beautiful. The flora, the towns, the strongholds, and even that flow of lava that’s going to kill you in a few seconds, are all gorgeous. This amazing art-styled graphics are combined with anime-style characters; to add to that, they’re animals, furries if you will. Now I can already see some of you already turning away from the game. Personally, though, this doesn’t change anything at all. Personally it goes well with the overall game, makes the game’s visual presentation more effective. The story is also quite wonderful…Now, the story is about…Hah, I got you there didn’t I? I’m not going to spoil it (or much of it). But I’ll say that the story is purely wonderful. It has the perfect blend of characterization, humor, and masterful storytelling. Just get the game; I will say it’ll be worth your time.Downsides?Not much, besides a few bugs and a few A.I. glitches. Sometimes the game can get irritating to get by, but overall not much going against it. So just get Dust, it will be worth it.Personal Gamer Score:9/10Recommend this game for those who want an awesome game with a good story, art/graphics, and an excellent game with good gameplay. But I may not recommend it for those who dislike anime-style graphics or sometimes time-to-time irritating gameplay.			"

												     Dust is a great game.  The whole cutsy animated look isn't really something I'm used to so there's moments where I'm thinking ""Wow that's really overly cutsy borderline furry""  lol  like the Figet character whos your sidekick in combat throughout the game, but the game has a very deep and rich story with a tremendous amount of voice over content.  There's a lot of talks with characters in the game and the way Dust doesn't remember anything makes for a very rich and engaging story where you are constantly discovering in pieces what hes about and what your purpose in the games story is.  It's the kind of deep story that most games lack now days.       The learn as you start playing way they teach the mechanics of the game is also very well done.  All of the little tutorial tips as I learned new moves actually displayed the name of the button that I had remapped certain actions to instead of a preset default key mapping.  I was glad to see that the game knew I'd changed primary and secondary fire and correctly displayed it when guiding me through, most games fall short with this but not Dust.  This game really has a very polished and good feel to it.     The combat is great hack and slash fun and the secondary fire with the ability to add in extra damage from Figets ability gives it some fun choices that work better for certain enemies.  Overall this is a definite must buy for anyone who likes a good hack and slash game.  Cutsy animation that some may hesitate at but if you want a taste of that hack and slash fun and the deep story I mentioned just watch the video trailer on the Steam Store page here and it's clear that this game is standing above most other games in its class.

												I'm going to be objective (as humanly possible) with this review because I know a lot of people truly enjoyed Dust, which is great. As a huge indie game supporter, I am ecstatic to see games like Dust do so well. I'm not trying to hate on it, but I personally did not enjoy Dust. Let's take a look: Pros:+ The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the prettiest games I've ever played.+ The controls are very tight and feel good. There is no slipping. Very important for this type of gameplay. Good job here.+ I don't understand how a single person made this game. Major props because this game is very long compared to other titles which were made by one to two people.Cons:- It's really important to connect with the characters in order to enjoy your time in the game. Unfortunately, the main character in this game has zero personality and I cringed every time he opened his mouth. He does transform in the end into someone with character and zeal but it took 8 hours for that to happen. For 90% of the game he is possibly the most boring protagonist I have ever witnessed. I understand his ""beginning personality"" was part of ""who he is"" but it made for an extremely boring character. - The combat is beyond oversimplified. You basically use the same two abilities over and over again. With the type of combat that exists in this game, I feel like some really cool intricate combos could have been created. Where is the strategy? Where is the strategic planning? Where are the ridiculous crazy combos? - The enemies for the first 80% of the game are also oversimplified and unimaginative. You can use the same strategy for almost every enemy you encounter barring a select few with specific abilities.- The item choices are so bland. There are almost no ""choices"" you have to make between items. 95% of the time, they simply just become better and better. They have no tradeoffs. This causes the game to become very linear and simplified. - The storyline was... borderline acceptable at best. I felt like so much effort was put into the end of the game that the entire 90% of the rest game was just left out. The ending was good. I liked the ending. Nothing happens though for the entire rest of the game. Overall, Dust is very beautiful visually, and I enjoyed the message at the end. Unfortunately, Dust feels like a shell that was never fully developed and lacks depth. The characters are bland, the combat is oversimplified, and the item choices are made for you due to having very little tradeoffs.Dust takes about 8 hours to complete.5/10			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is, simply put, a masterpiece. A modern classic, thoroughly humble in spite of its gorgeous presentation, it is a game that firmly stands among a gamer's fondest memories: Zelda, Metroid, Castlevania, Dust. But to say that this game is on the league of the classics from which it draws inspiration, is not enough. For Dust is, in many ways, better than any of those games, as it has learned and grown from them, not copied. Ocarina of Time, however wonderful our memories of it may be, is a game from the last century, and it shows. Not the case with Dust. This game runs in any resolution; it has hand-drawn high-resolution sprites; it is able of seamlessly changing between controller, keyboard and mouse inputs on the fly; it has charming and very well directed voice acting; great sound effects, graphic effects, cutscenes, dialogues, soundtrack. The technical details alone should be reason enough for you to try this game. Its wonders do not end there, however, for Dust is also a heart-touching story, unafraid of being naïve and juvenile, a fairy-tale in all the best ways — that manages to be mature where it counts. No wonder this is the work of a loving father: this is a game I'd raise my child with, confident that not only would he witness a great work of art, but that he would learn valuable lessons along the way.If you are at all capable of enjoying platformers, give this game a try and allow it to enchant you.

												I recommend the game to any brawler fan! If you liked a game like Shank 2 for instance, you should definitely play Dust : An Elysian Tail. It has a nice story and some RPG feature with quests and items to collect and craft. The best part is to get very big combos (over 1000). Moreover the graphics are sweet and it is a real pleasure to play through the game.Have fun!			"

												I wish Steam had an 'Ehhhh...' option.Let's start with the good - Dust looks great, controls well, has a passable soundtrack, and the writing can be quite funny at times. I laughed often at the deuteragonist Fidget's lines, and while she was entirely grating at first introduction by the middle of the game I only found her likeable.Unfortunately, main man Dust himself never improved much. He goes back and forth between being some edgy amnesiac dude to bland to a bleeding heart. He doesn't improve in motivation or reasoning, even after his exposition scenes. The villain meanwhile twirls his mustache at every turn while literally slaughtering men, women, and children alike. Fun.This game never really marketed itself more than a simple beat-em-up, but the mechanics here are beyond simple. You have essentially four attacks - a ground clear, a ground slam, an air knock-up, and some attack where you spin through the air. Fidget also has the ability to shoot projectiles which are amplified by your spin attack, but there's very little difference between the 3 options and they don't interact with your other attacks in any way besides juggling enemies. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was varied in other ways... but it's not. Enemies are basically all reskins of each other and the best way to play is button mashing due to the number of mobs that can clutter your screen. The game has a parry mechanic, but outside of it happening randomly the only times you bother to make use of it are for enemies designed to require its use. In fact, none of the attacks in your repertoire feel particularly natural to use - they all seem as effective as one another and there's no combo system to speak of. There is some degree of animation canceling utilized via crouching, but again it's pointless to use given how Dust requires absolutely zero strategy or mechanics to speak of.Level design is passable at best and at worst makes you want to tear your hair out. Levels are simply too long for what they offer. Like the gameplay, they're repetitive and on the rare occasion things are mixed up, it's in an annoying fashion. I have absolutely zero idea why anyone would think that hazards that essentially explode randomly would be a good idea, much less to cover entire sections of levels with them. And surround them with spike traps. I certainly love having three hazards explode at once, leaving no opportunity to dodge, only to send me into conveniently placed spikes so that I may die without option. Fun.Anyway, regardless of all these multiple faults I did, I suppose, have some fun with Dust. Despite the terrible story, the repetitive gameplay, and the occasionally annoying level design, the game did offer some honestly cool moments. The animations and sprite effects when dealing with a group of enemies can look amazing, and stuff like grabbing a guy with your sword then slamming him into a group of enemies takes a long time to get old.With that, I'd recommend Dust to the younger gamer. It's something I would have loved at a young age, where flashy effects and simple gameplay were the bee's knees, but for anyone else I'd probably pass.			"

												Dust is energetic like a tornado. It has its artistic touch to it.There's great gameplay, graphics, music, and heart here, and I have no reservations whatsoever in wholeheartedly recommending it to anyone that enjoys these kinds of games.The PC version is an excellent port, offering a steady framerate, crisp visuals and well-established controls. If you missed out on this grand adventure when it was on the Xbox 360, here’s the perfect opportunity to fix that.Highly entertaining, substantial and a visual treat.An absolutely must-have for any PC user. This adventure is an eye-popping effort, with tons of frenetic battles, exploration and fun.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is ""that furry game"".That's the best title I can give it, ""that furry game"". It has all the regular staples that can be attributed to furry culture and the fandom as a whole. Exceptionally good animation, and very lazy writing.When I say the animation is good I mean I could stare at some of the animation in this game and know I'd never be able to produce anything half as good in my lifetime. The character animations in this game are nothing short of magnificent. I am in awe of the visuals in this game. It stands out very well compared to it's competition.At the same time what kills this game for me is it's terrible derivative plot. The plot to Dust: An Elysian Tail follows all the regular cliches. An amnesiac brooding hero, a plucky sidekick, a wise old mentor, a quest to save people etc. It's a story I have seen hundreds of times and it completely and utterly destroys my enthusiasm for this game. Had the designer taken the time to flesh out the story further, it really could have been up there with the greats like Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid.			"

												Okay, before you start reading this review, I want to get you with the mindset that this game isn't a ""masterpiece,"" a ""10/10"" or anything like that, but it is still a really good game, nevertheless.Dust: An Elysian Tail is a good game, really: it has beautiful landscapes, the combat feels good, the characters are very good in terms of voice acting and writing and the story is good.However: The game is easy even in higher difficulties (except maybe the final 4-stage boss and when you get stun-locked with environmental hazards) because you can just put your levels in damage and one-shot everything, the cinematic scenes are also kind-of low quality even though the rest of the game looks beautiful, the game lacks combos, and the game also somewhat deceives you with your progress (I apparently finished the game with 53% done, but you'd expect the secondary stuff is less important.)Even though the game explains you (Dust) who are you and about this world, it really felt like it needed more explanation story-wise - like, really; Gaius didn't seem to be so much of a bad guy, and the game doesn't tell you why he wanted the Moonbloods dead (or maybe it was a very simple and silly thing and I missed it.)Bad things aside now, overall, the story is this game is about Dust, a boy who missed his identity all of the sudden and now carries the Sword of Ahrah who guides him, and also Fidget, who also defends the Sword of Ahrah itself. Dust, Ahrah and Fidget are the main protagonists of the game, Dust being the player.Fidget acts as an assistant, and also a comic relief character, sometimes breaking the fourth wall (I hate fourth wall breaking, please don't do it, developers), and during combat she can use magic which synergizes with Duststorm, Dust's signature move (I think?)Since telling you the entire story would just spoil it, I will just tell you it has a good story, although rather short if you rush it.I do recommend you buying this game, but maybe in a sale for half its price, or at least for 7-9 euro. That's how much I would give it, in my opinion.			"

												One of the best platformers you can get on PC and it's made by 1 person (if you don't count soud designers & Voice actors)Right when you jump in, you'll have a hard time believing that only 1 person could create this game, and this feeling will last till the end of the game. It's beautiful hand-drawn world that you are going to fall in love with.You are playing as Dust, which is a boy that can't quite remember who he is or how he ended up where he is right now, shortly his swords begins to talk to him, but it's not going to reveal much. And after that, you are going to meet your sidekick fidget. She can be a bit annoying but it's a cute character that's making the game more interesting. She is not there just for the heck of it, she is a guardian of the sword your hero weilds and she decides to follow you if you are not going to retur the sword and in fact, she proves to be useful on your jurney.The combat is flawless, fluid and responsive. Even tho there's alot to do, you'll be right at home with the mechanics. you are not only going to be killing stuff with your sword, you are going to learn some magic too and that's where fidget is going to proof useful to you. She cast it, you make it better. It's as simple as that.You are going to be picking up some loot and coins alog the way, it's a RPG game after all complete with vendors and some crafting. While you can't craft yourself, you are going to meet a blacksmith, that's going to craft you whatever she can, you'll just have to find the resources and pay a fee. In the end, the gear can change how you play and what bonuses your character is going to have. You are also leveling up and each level you get to choose what stat are you going to increase.You get quests as well as side quests and each is unique in its own way. I'd suggest you to complete every single one, it's worth your time. You can also find challanging places in the wrold. You have to complete certain challanges in them (run through an area fast and destroy all targets).The story is easy to follow and yet it's great. You may think that you know who your character is after a while, but in the end it's all quite different and surprising. Each character have its own individuality, which makes it even better.The music is one of the most important aspects of any game for me and here it's outstanding. I love the soundtrack, it's memorable and is making the game even better! I guarantee you are not going to be disapointed.I 100% the game and I would play it again, any time! It's full of nice references from other games that don't get in the way. It's working great with both a controller (it's ported from xbox after all) and keyboard. The PC port is one of the best ports out there, some major AAA devs could learn a thing or two (I am not kidding).If you like platformers and you don't own this game yet, for the love of god get it! It's well worth the 14€			"

IntroI want to start off by saying I would not call “Dust: An Elysian Tail” a bad game. I would, however, call it a mediocre game for someone like me. I want to explain my criticisms of this game, and I want to emphasize that there are people to whom I would recommend this game, and I will expand on that point at the end.My main criticisms of this game are:StoryI recognize that this criticism is mostly personal preference, but I found the story good by video game standards but not movie or book standards, which is not saying much. In addition, I felt that the story took a left turn in Act III that was not built up to much at all, but the characters acted like it had been foreshadowed all along, which was kind of annoying.CombatThe combat system is acceptable but not great. It’s mostly button-mashing and there’s not a lot of variety in the moves you can perform, so by the end of the game, the combat will feel quite repetitive. There are ways to counter enemy attacks and other special moves, but when enemies fill the screen (as they often do), it’s very difficult to see when enemies are attacking, which often makes button-mashing the most effective strategy.RPG SystemI would only consider this game an RPG in the loosest sense. The RPG system in this game boils down to “you get stronger as the game progresses.” There are no interesting choices to make regarding your stats or playstyle. As you level up your stats, the game forces you to keep them roughly equal, and you’ll eventually be able to max out on everything anyway.DifficultyThe game has a difficulty selection screen at the beginning, which is not a great way of setting difficulty in general. Fundamentally, the game does not play well on higher difficulties. As I said before, it can be hard to see when enemies are attacking, so you’ll often be hit without much warning. On higher difficulties, in which enemies do more damage, this can lead to quick deaths out of nowhere. Movement is very loose, which means that you can die repeatedly without it ever feeling like your fault. Ultimately, any difficulty in this game feels frustrating rather than rewarding.ConclusionMy criticisms above are more than enough for me to give this game a thumbs-down. However, “Dust: An Elysian Tail” certainly has numerous redeeming qualities. The artwork and voice acting are great, and I can’t say that there’s anything wrong on the technical side of this game.I would recommend this game to people who plan on playing it for the story and artwork, and I would definitely recommend playing on the lower difficulty levels. If you consider yourself more of a “hardcore” gamer, I suggest passing on this game in favor of a different 2D metroidvania game.			"

												What anazes me about this game is the fact that aside from the voice acting and the soundtrack, it was made by only 1 guy over a period of 3 and a half years. 1 guy did all of the art assets, all of the design, and all of the code. The combat feels really smoothe. It is a lot easier if you counter and dodge properly, but it is by no means a requirment for doing well. The story is the biggest part of the game. It's very well written and getting into the characters is not hard. It has a number of pretty light hearted moments, and I find muself cracking a smile every time Fidgit breaks the 4th wall. The character interaction between Fidgit and Dust is very enjoyable, which is good because you'll frequently find yourself caught up in a conversation based cutscene.Little, but important, the menu allows a lot of customization. You can do everything from remap the buttons to resize and reposition your health bar display. It's such a small thing, but I'm amazed this sort of functionality isn't standard in every games options.Most of the characters in the game are anthropomorphic animals. If you have a problem with that, don't buy it. You'll need to save your money for a therapist to help you work out whatever issues you have that make you percieve things like Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in only a sexual context. I mean, Christ people. Anthropomorphism has been a thing for THOUSANDS of years without people going ""ewww yucky"". If you're put off by that, you have a problem.			"

The only problem I had was with the backtracking and teleport system, though it is probably there for ballence, but I'd rather not clear an erea just to move to the next area and come back to see it fully populated again (This problem only really bugged me at the end, but heck, it's supposed to be difficult.Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody looking for a rich story and amazing world.

												For a few weeks now I have been looking for an rpg that I could lose myself in on this 2007 macbook pro that only has 256 mb of vram on an old video card and 3 gigabyte's of ram. The search has been long and hard.... then yesterday I during the Steam Autumn Sale I picked up Dust...Oh my god! Dust is such an awesome game, and I don't know why I have completely ignored this game in three years since it's release. I am a gamer who got into gaming with games such as Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, Castlevania, and Metroid. This game has elements of all those, and it stokes that nostalgia nerve so hard that I just want to experience more of this game.On top of that the story is great and has tough emotional moments that will make you think twice about your actions. The music is so pretty and it always fits the mood of what's going on. In fact, there are many times when the music stops cold, leaving a feeling of either dread or just calmness, depending on the situation.The art style and character design is kind of unusual, where every single character you meet is some kind of animal person, but that is cool, again it's a throw back to some of the quirkier games in the 16 and 32 bit era.The combat is also a lot of fun. It is fast, you'll be using your mouse to kick up a wind storm, put a little magic from your helper in the mix to create a wide variety of effects.There is a wide range of difficulty levels that will suit every gamers needs, so you can go for hard mode and have a real challenging experience that really requires you to respond to things and be on your toes, or you can go on casual difficulty and just enjoy the story and the exploration side of the game.Overall, if you've grown up on games from the 16 and 32 bit era, if zelda, metroid, and castlevania are some of your favorite retro games, you will love this game.For someone looking for another 80s/90s syle exploration rpg, I highly recommend this game.

												Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm even bothering to write a review of Dust: An Elysian Tail.Everybody already knows that this game is awesome. Tens of thousands of reviews have been posted. I believe that everything that needs to be said about the game, has probably already been said. Furthermore, I can't make up a bunch of complaints and flat-out lie, just so I can be ""Mr. Contrarian"". If were to present an argument that Dust isn't really all that great, first I'd have to convince myself, and that isn't happening. Why do I think Dust is great? It's mainly due to the controls and level-design. If you've played this game, then you're well-aware of the protagonist's abilities, particuarly his uh... tornado spin?(Press Y button while in mid-air*). This move homes in on enemies, and can even cause Dust to be launched miles into the air, if he's aiming for a flying enemy. A neat trick is using a Lightning storm, then following with the tornado, as enemies are lifted into the air by the electricity. There's a certain joy to be found in soaring through the sky, even when there isn't an incentive (such as treasure).At the same time, Dust's ability to practically fly isn't a hindrance to the level-design. There are a few shortcuts, and maybe even a sequence break or two, but there's nothing that comes off as really awkward. Due to Dust's mobility, he doesn't really work in a pixel-precise-platformer. Thus, all of the platforms in this game - moving or otherwise - are wide enough. I'd say that on average, they're more than two ""Dusts"" in width. Now hang on a second. How does one measure ""Dusts""? In platformers, it's always important to consider the character and their relationship with the world. Take Super Mario Bros. 1 for example. The smallest block in SMB1 is only slightly wider than Mario. This gives players just enough time to react, but they don't have to constantly measure their jumps. Having to adjust your landing for every single jump not only affects the pacing of the game, but it also becomes tiring for the player. Another example is the first Sonic the Hedgehog game. Sonic is a faster character, so the platforms he lands on tend to be twice as wide as he is. There's more that could be said here, but it would all be irrelevant to this review of Dust: An Elysian Tail. In short, platforming in this game works, because the player has enough freedom to move around. The combat also benefits from all of the mobility. There are many tools to play around, and even if they're at times unnecessary, they're still appreciated. If a player wants to tornado through all of the enemies while tossing storms everywhere, that's fine. They can just as easily stay on the ground, and decimate everything with the sword alone. Switching between multiple styles is seamless, and it works wonderfully. Oh and if you haven't noticed this before. In the final area, if you perform an air-grab on the flying ships, the game pauses for a suitably epic second. The game doesn't do this for any of the other enemies (even the final boss), and that's really cool.Other than that... Well, I'm afraid I don't have anything else to add. This is a superb game, but you already know that.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is in a group of few games that touch your feelings in a unique way.With rpg features, a beautiful 2D world and a well-done combat system, this game already grab the attention.But in my opinion, the singularity of Dust is the storyline that composes the game. The story captures you and if you are a melted butter like me, prepare your handkerchiefs.So, in terms of storyline, if you like FF VII, Legend of Dragoon, The Walking Dead: The Game, FF X and many others games that messes with your feelings, then Dust: An Elysian Tail is the perfect game for you!

												A beat em up platformer set in a vibrant, detailed landscape populated by amateurishly drawn anthropomorphic characters.   The music and the gameworld illustrations are Dust's strongest elements. Both are soft and airy, but complete in their sound and aesthetic. In these elements the games childish nature is a benefit. The view is colored by imagination, the music dreamy.  Where the illustration felt inspired in the backdrops and visual effects, it fell short with character renderings. In this regard the game is rife with inconsistency. Where some character renderings seem polished, other renderings of the same character may seem like they were rushed. At their poorest the characters are drawn with little detail, in strange poses, out of proportion, and filled in with lazy coloring.  The aesthetic shortcomings can do harm to suspension of disbelief, which is already made vulnerable by cliche anime tropes and voice acting. The story is paced well, with a likeable protagonist, which helps to ease the parts which are harder to swallow. It's a mixed bag, where the delivery is sometimes charming and then overwhelmingly juvenile.  While exploring Dust's beautiful landscapes you will find the odd puzzle sections, treasures, and map areas which are inaccessible without certain abilities - a la metroidvania. The mechanics are fluid and responsive. The sound effects and animations provide useful feedback to usher you through battles with hordes of enemies that provide a comfortable challenge. Dust: An Elysian Tail is enchanting in large visual sections of the game, and so sets itself to disappoint with other elements. The gameplay and story are objectively servicable, but potentially polarizing among different players.  I recommend you give it a try.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a wonderful take on the standard ""Metroidvania"" formula. You have a large world map that you can openly explore (or travel around with nifty waypoints) much like in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Throughout your adventure you'll visit a variety of different locations, level up your character, and meet a variety of different characters. While the voice acting is satisfactory at best, the combat, graphics, and soundtrack are all phenomenal.The first item that must be discussed is the art style. While it's not as active and vibrant as other 2D games (like Rayman Origins or Rayman Legends) it still is beautiful enough to hold it's own. Everything has a hand-drawn look to it and the animation is fantastic. Combat is another area where the game excels. You're given a talking sword as your main weapon but receive several upgrades and combos to fool around with so combat doesn't get stale. Having the option to counter enemies in a 2D game is always a great addition as well. Getting 100% for this game wasn't particularly difficult. Most are story related and there are a few missable achievements if I recall but nothing too difficult. Overall it was a very fun game to 100% and quite satisfying as well.I would highly recommend Dust: An Elysian Tail to any Metroidvania fans or 2D side-scrolling fans in general. It's a fun game that looks great and plays very well.8.5/10			"

												I definitely recommend, if you're a metroidvania fan.The cycle of getting loot to better your character, to get stronger, to get more loot, to get stronger etc, plus getting abilities to explore secret areas in previous levels; It's super satisfying. The backgrounds are painted like an old Disney film and the character animation is incredible, the art style and colouring on the characters are kinda iffy, but given how well animated they are, it's understandable.It's definitely worth a try. This game (minus the music) was made mostly by one person! "

												Originally released for the Xbox 360, Dust: An Elysian Tail is proof that ports can be done near-perfectly if you just pay enough attention and respect to the material. The port to the PC side of things is so impressive, it blows other studios out of the water, beating out large developers and publishers like Activision and in some cases even EA.Dust: An Elysian Tail is beautiful in all its artwork. Visually unique, stunning, and well crafted. With unique characters all designed and drawn by one person, Dust AET really showed the focus and talent that Dean Dodrill has. While voicework, soundtrack and a few other aspects were done by contract, it was all pulled together by one person and that makes this even more impressive.Combat is tight, quick, and avoids the pitfalls that cause most brawlers to fail in my eyes. I don't have to feel like I'm spamming buttons to do what I want to do, instead there's a weight to actions that give a clear cause-and-effect between button presses and combinations that provides for a better sense of play. The RPG aspects of the game allow for a level of customization which also is an added benefit to replayability.The soundtrack, contracted through Hyperduck Soundworks is nothing short of impressive. While previous offerings by Hyperduck didn't particularly impress me (mostly in part due to the game they were designed for didn't catch my attention), Dust:AET's soundtrack is one that grabbed me from the title menu all the way through. Tracks compliment not only environment, but the overall ""goal"" for passing an area. Large sweeps of various instruments while keeping a higher tempo help build an urge to get through zones in open environments.  Heavier claustrophobic tracks help reinforce the underground nature of various caverns and all the tracks push you to want to see what is on the next screen.You would be excused if you weren't sure Dust: AET was a native game for the PC. Extensive PC options for video, audio, and controls are something that even massive publishers fail to do are all present but it even has options to customize the size of the UI as well as position. The game plays well with keyboard and mouse (though admittedly I preferred to play with a controller, having the best of both worlds makes the PC an excellent platform), and it even scales extremely well for slower PCs and laptops.This is a great platformer, and if you're looking for one that is technically competent, an excellent experience, and one that manages to strike that chord that most art pieces try so hard to do then Dust:AET is a game you simply must get and play. Whatever you do, make sure you have either excellent speakers, or headphones. Audio design is just that great.			"

												A colourful, characterful, entertaining game. The gameplay is reasonably easy to pick up even for someone not experienced in the genre, the puzzles are often challenging without being overly frustrating, the story is decent and there is a reasonable amount of content.It is not without its flaws - the ending really falls down a bit both through overblown writing and by turning combat into a confusing mess by flooding it with both allies and enemies, and the game is prone to sharp framerate drops even on a GTX1080 - but the good definitely outweighs the bad.

												I will make this short and sweet because this game is just that much fun to play. The story is dramatic has good and funny voice acting,subtitles,characters,etc. The game is extremely colorful is full of great animations and unique monsters and bosses to fight. The locations are varied from woods to frozen mountains which themselves draw you into the game even further.The combat is simple and fantastic, you gain new abilities along the way as you play.There are a good number of difficulty settings to choose from.The game has a good number of completetionist type achievements and secrets to find for you 100% players.As far as gameplay length, you could beat it in about 10 - 15 hours depending on how much exploring/secret finding you do.I am a big action adventure and action rpg fan so for me when looking at all the animal themed characters I was a bit cautious thinking I was in for a kiddy adventure but it turned out to be a real gem. I hope the developer makes another Dust game I enjoyed this just that much.			"

												I've just beaten this game.It's just amazing.9 out of 10 to me.Pros:-Stunning artworks-Great music-Combat system is easy to handle and its sound effect is addictive.-Nice storyline, many choices needed to be made-Voice actors are doing a great job! +A+b-Easter eggs like meatboy, FEZ, there's event a scene with full retro support LOLCons:-Cutscenes animations are kind of glithy? Higher resolution video needed.-Why they are animal characters! Human can be much better!-At the very end, Fidget's projectile is over-powered. There are many multiply boosting items for Fidget, I upgrade my attack and fidget, but in the end, fidget is much more effective dealing with enemies.			"

												This was a ridiculously fun game. The gameplay shines as extremely fast paced. You earn experience by chaining up huge combos, ensuring a continual stream of hacking, slashing and causing explosions to fly around the screen. One thing to note is that you may want to consider using a controller rather than a keyboard.Sadly, the game's storyline is pretty weak and left a lot to be desired - You play as Dust, the mysterious hero who wakes up with (DUN DUN DUUNNNNN) amnesia and ends up finding himself on a quest to save the Moonblood (AKA, reptile) race from genocide at the hands of General Gaius and his legion of racist mammals, learning your destiny and true nature along the way and blah blah blah... it's pretty standard generic fare, and in my opinion, left a lot of important details unspoken that I REALLY wish would have been expanded on. It also creeped me out a bit how oddly sympathetic General Gaius was portrayed despite basically being lizard Hitler. Despite all that, the characters are pretty likable and full of personality, and the voice acting is well done.Visuals are the other area where this game really shines aside from gameplay. Almost all of the graphics are hand drawn, with the exception of water renderings and Dust's sword (which admittedly causes an odd juxtaposition with his hand-drawn sprites). The locations, although generic (forest level, cave level, snow level, lava level etc), are all beautifully illustrated and provide gorgeous eyecandy.If you can forgive the weak story in lieu of the strong gameplay, then I highly recomend Dust: An Elysian Tail			"

												Honestly, if there was a neutral option I'd use it. However, there isn't, and I decided to lean against recommending this game, if only because I feel that, while not bad, the game is certainly highly overrated already.You can read some 12,000 reviews raving about how awesome this is, so let me summarize here why I'm not recommending this game to all my friends like 96% of the other reviewers would have me do: - Gameplay: standard action platformer, really. You gain some extra abilities as you progress; however, they are almost all direct upgrades to a special skill you can perform. To my knowledge, there are no sidegrades (at least none that you get in the first 11 or so hours - I haven't finished the game yet), and all your core abilities and attacks remain the same. The enemies get harder, of course, but since your stats increase too, I haven't felt much of a difficulty curve. There are select few special enemies that can be interesting to fight, but they are found seldom and between each notable encounter, you're going to have to kill hundreds upon hundreds of grunts, super grunts, tough grunts, grunty grunts... - More on gameplay, but regarding the platformer aspect: it really isn't the focus of the game. As such, while there are some instances of interesting level design, most of it just functions as terrain for the fighting. ...And now you see my problem: since the fighting (at least on non-hard difficulties) basically involves repeating a perma-stunlock combination of moves over and over until everything on-screen dies, there isn't much to do in this game. - The story: ah yes, the story. It's what ties the game together; what makes plowing through waves of grunts worth it, to get to the boss battle and get a cutscene and get on with the story. Unfortunately, the story, as far as I have seen it, is highly cliche. I can't really comment on the entire main plotline, since I haven't finished the game, but here's what I have seen: - - - You start in some sacred clearing in a random forest, with amnesia. What an original plot device! I'm sure the game won't be about the main character trying to regain their memories while getting mixed up in a quest they don't understand helping people they don't know, which is actually very much tied into what the character did before losing their memories, only to emerge changed and a better person than they were before! - - - Oh wait, that's exactly what happens. - On the same note as the story, the sidequests are all extremely cliche. You know the usual model of the protagonist just going around, having everyone unload all of their worries on him, and then going to find various monster loot, misplaced keys, and random trivialities that really have no consequence whatsoever in the bigger picture? Yeah, that's exactly how every single sidequest in this game is like. Back when Zelda et al. did it 20 years ago, it was fine, not only because the technology of the time didn't allow anything too complex, but also because a) this particular format hadn't been beated to death yet, and b) there wasn't really much precedent for better quests, so there was nothing to take example from. But this is a 2013 game, it can do better! Or, apparently, not. - This was made by a single person. While some people talk about how this has let them put their all into the game, unhampered by a marketing department or disagreements in the team, etc., in my opinion this also has a downside: there is a limit to the creativity of a single person, and I really feel like a second or third pair of eyes helping develop the game could have only made it better, and a lot of the aforementioned problems stem from this.CONCLUSION: this game is alright. I got it at something like 90% off, and more or less enjoyed the 10 or so hours I put into it. It's definitely not one of those horrible indie games that seem to be built solely for marketing (and screaming ""Look! I'm a new and innovative indie game, unhampered by the conventions of the gaming industry, and I'm definitely not a poorly-executed cash-grabbing attempt!"") and not actual entertainment. But if it's not on sale, I still think it's not worth the money.			"

Its freaking worth it even at full price. pro: - Fidget is super funny. - combat system easy to execute and feel smooth and fluid. Parrying with sword is nice with some slo-mo effect.- fantastic control on Xbox 360 Controller and even on keyboard though i prefer controller for platforming games. - okish story line i guess.- lots of side questing, treasure hunts and friends to rescue. - beautiful hand drawn scenery. - Cheap. the game itself worth more than most AAA game you can buy. con: - even on hardcore, sometime it just feel easy especially when you upgrade to the most powerful armor and weapon. - wish the cutscenes is of better quality.

												I liked and enjoyed this game so much that i ran here to post a reccomendation, i suggest this to everyone that likes a game that can offer a good plot, nice mechanics for being a simple side-scrolling hack n' slash.Let me explain,The mechanics and the combat system are very nice, not too difficult to understand, smooth and filled with spectacular effects, but they can be a little repetitive during the end game. The game engine runs smoothly and the graphics are awesome, they're filled with colorful maps, characters and enemies.The plot and the storyline are good, it's filled with well-made characters with good voices and different personalities, the main character itself is epic.I enjoyed the soundtrack very much and it is well fitted with the situations, with the scenes and with the different areas of the map. I liked the puzzles and side-quests too, they can take you some time away because they're not easy to understand, you must explore the map and understand exactly what you must to do to make your way to the game ending.The only thing that i feel a little bad about is that once you finish the game and the side quests hardly you will play this again because it hasn't a high replay value, you're not going to feel at the same way of your first time on this game.In the end it's a game that is worth to buy and play. If there will be a sequel i will buy it.			"

												This game is a truly amazing piece of work.  Its story is compelling, engaging, and touching on many levels; the art is beautiful and brilliant in every area, never once lowering in quality.  Every second of this game made me want more and more of it right up to the climax, and I can't wait to see what he makes in the future!  References to other games abound, but never do they go overboard or make the game any less enjoyable, remaining subtle enough they're easy to overlook at first, then that 'ah-HAH' moment makes it all worthwhile.  I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who enjoys platformers and terrific story.			"

												How good this game was really surprised me, it's a really cool platformer. The combat is fluid, everything is easy to understand. And eventhough you only have one weapon through the entire game, it doesn't really matter as you can do a couple of moves and have your friend, Fidget, attack as well. The acting in this is alright, the story is honestly a bit meh to me. Your sidekick Fidget is either going to annoy the hell out of you or be adorable - to me she was adorable.I also really love the artstyle of this game, which surprised me a lot since I'm not too into anime. It's really beautiful and unique, not the kind of game that I'd normally play. The game is a bit short though, I finished the main questline in about roughly 13 hrs, to complete the entire game it'd probably take about 16-17 hrs. All in all, I'd recommend this game. Would I pay full price for it though? Probably not, due to the short amount of gameplay. But if it comes on sale again, I'd definitely pick it up if I were you.			"

												After completing this game, i thought its time to write something about it.. so here i go:Dust is an interesting game with a dual soul. On one side we have the fantastic bright colorful graphics. On the other side a story, that is by far more serious than the graphics let the player expect. These both sides are mixed up with good fluent control/fighting system and an outstanding Soundtrack, from Hyperduck Soundworks.The characters which appear during the playthrough arent polished and mostly to flat. Thier look (esp. the final boss) arent just serious enough, a few more details could fix that easy. The whole story around Dust is good, but it feels like things went way to fast in the last 10% of the game. I liked the voice acting from Fidget very much. I smiled more than one time during my playthrough because of it.What i really disliked, were the environmental hazards. On touch, it let you fly around like you got a critical hit from the Hulk. It was really annoying at some parts.Overall i can recommend this game and give a neutral 8/10(For me its a 9/10 because of Fidget).			"

(I played on the highest dificulty setting) The cutscenes were not bad, aswell as the fight simulation. Story is getting more interesting and you can't like put the controller down and watch a video, because it is such a good game.The only thing, that I disliked much in the game is the difficulty. Like: I died like 30 Times (Yes, I counted) in the intire game. Maybe I suck or something, but I still love this game. It is one of my favorite games by far and I will definetly recommend it, if you like hack n' slash adventure games.5/5 Awesome.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an fantastic game. Beautiful hand-drawn art, visuals and animations, fantastic soundtrack and voice acting, as well as characters and story. Combat is fluid with every button press and sword swing.Your main character, Dust, is an energetic, humorous furry warrior who (like in many games) lost his memory and goes on a quest to find out who he actually is. On this quest he is acompanied by Blade of Ahrah (a talking blade, yes) and Blades diminutive guardian Fidget which makes for a lot of fun throughout the game. Story is beautifuly written and both main and side quests offer you hours and hours of playing without getting bored. Combat style is as many would say is ""easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master"" type with usually dozens of enemies on the screen and with many possibilities and tricks makes for a very good combat system.There are some cons here and there like enemies and bosses being very easy early in game (but they get a lot harder in later parts of game and make for formidable opponents), some items being overly expensive early on and as much as Dust have nice moves and attacks, few more combos or attacks would always be nice.All in all, Dust: An Elysian Tail is everything you could want in an action rpg, and it is one of my most favorite games of all time.I would highly recommend this game not only to RPG fans, but to all gamers out there to atleast give it a try.My score for this game is 9.5/10 and I have enjoyed it from beginning to very end and so will you :D			"

												For those unaware, this game was a labor of love by (mostly) one man over a period of nearly 4 years. Even without the context, this is a very well made game with lots of polish. This game is full of quality visuals and animation.In terms of writing, the game is weak: characters are shallow, serious dialogue can you make you cringe and the story falls flat. Some of the humor worked well, but it is the serious moments that the game struggles with. Maybe I was not the target audience, which would be fine, but the game tries so hard to focus on narrative that I felt like I should mention that the story and characters are average at best.There are a few different buttons for combat and lots of repetition. There are a handful of combos and powers you can use, but you can really just get away with button mashing for most enemies, which is a shame because the combat is smooth. What's worse than repetitive combat is how much you will have to do it as enemies respawn every time you return to an area and sometimes you can't leave until you beat them.  I think the problem is that your character can easily just zip around destroying everything in sight, and it makes for stale  combat. Playing on the harder modes did offer some challenge for certain parts (read: the first 2 minutes of gameplay), but mostly I was death incarnate, which is incredibly dull. Personally, I am fine with plain combat (like most of the Castlevanias). This game tried to do something a bit different, I just wish it was executed better. (this could just be preference because I enjoyed Guacamelee and Valdis Story.) There are some light RPG elements, but really there are just some generic stats you can increase when you level up and a few points in certain areas turns you into an unstoppable whirlwind of destruction. The exploration felt like a nice slice of metroidvania. I also liked some of the cryptic notes that help find secrets, and some of the references and cameos were neat (the Castlevania one in particular is pretty elaborate). However I found the platforming to be a bit lukewarm:sometimes the controls didn't feel as response, but some sections played well. I also found that Dust had Assassin's Creed's flaw in terms of economy: the game leaves you too rich to really care. There is also a crafting system but it just falls in with the economy's folly.Basically the game has fast paced combat that grows old quick and has too much fluff, offers little challenge, and focuses on it's weaker aspects (platforming and story). This game is certainly good looking and polished, but the story, combat, and characters do drag the game down quite a bit.It's a flawed and stylish game, but by no means extremely awful. I wish there was a way to offer a neutral response. I didn't hate it, but I only enjoyed parts of it at certain times. Mostly it was just bland, but functional. I only listed this as a positive review because people seemed to not handle a negative responses too well. Replaying it on harder mode and going further past %100 help me appreciate some of the finer parts of the game, but I still wish it didn't try to tell a serious story; it does humor better.			"

												Despite very anime-like appearance I gave this game a chance. It was totally worth it. This is a very tame Castlevania-inspired platform slasher. Here I use word ""tame"" as an opposite to ""hardcore"". As a casual gamer I had no trouble progressing through the game at all, and that was on hard difficulty.Extremely smooth combat controls, everything works when it's supposed to. The game autosaves + allows to create your own saves. Challenge areas are optional and are just that - challenging. A lot of other areas are optional and require coming back with upgraded or new skills to explore. The only negative side I can think of is - it's too short. 10 hours into the game, I'm at 75% of storyline and about 80% explored everything.Would definitely recommend.			"

But once you gain better equipment and a higher level you will compensate even the highest difficulty.I spent around 20 hours for a full playrhough.

												This game is amazingly fun to play though some aspects were a bit tedious. The combat is fun, and this game really should be played with a controller. The references to other indie games was neat, and unlocking them was crazy satisfying. The soundtrack was also great. I gotta say though, the knockback distance is really ridiculous, and often irritating. You also have to backtrack a lot, which is something I dont mind, but not everyone out there likes that kinda thing.  The voice acting was a little bit over the top, and personally, the character designs, personalities and art style doesnt really float my boat. I still completed the entire game though, (I think it was 117%?) and I really did enjoy it.			"

												I absolutely adore the detailed fluid animation of the main character. The ambience in this game and attention to detail are top notch. If you are considering getting this game you should do it. The fighting is very old school hack and slash fun. This is probably the nicest side scrolling game I have played in years. Nice voice acting too :D			"

												This game is some good fun. Side scrolling, scrolling the sides, yep. Beating things up. And some nice metriod-vania style platforming. Though there is the downside of this game catering to furries. If only I could read properly, I believed the title was ""Dust: An Elysian Trail"" until the moment I turned it on. Overall, furbait aside, it's pretty fun to play through.			"

												Looking past the fact that this is major grimdark furbait, it's actually pretty good. Combat flows well, and exploring is fun. My only complaint would be a lacking moveset. Combat begins to get repetitive near the end of the game.			"

												Very few games have kept me this interested into the storyline, and it's no joke that the controls are easy to learn but hard to master. The game sets you off very nice and easy, making an almost perfect transition from area to area while you learn more and more. And as you get farther, the story only gets more interesting. Maybe the animations in cutscenes were the smoothest, but it's still utterly beautiful!I'd honestly have to say the only, the ONLY problem I had with the game, was how challenging the game came to on the final boss. It was like playing a game on the easiest difficulty all the way through and then trying to kill the final boss on the hardest difficulty just to see what would happen. The final boss was just very hard. But it was still an epic ending to such a beautiful game.I rate this 9.5/10, it is definitely worth $15!			"

												Beautiful, deep and charming Metroidvania-style adventure-brawler that features an endearing cast of heroes and villains, tight 2-D hack'n'slash gameplay, light RPG elements and a world of visually and mechanically varied locales that are a joy to explore.Give it a go if it sounds like your thing, I only wish I tried it sooner.

												Not long time ago, in not a far away galaxy, Dean Dodrill creates a beautiful game, with little fairy story - Dust: an Elysian Tail.We playing as Dust, creature with 2 souls and speaking sword. He has a companion - Fidget, little cute nimbat. Dust should pass hard bloody path in which revealed the mystery of his identity.Gameplay is pretty simple: kill the enemies, complete the quests, open the treasure chests, lift up your level, collect and buy useful items. And all of it accompanied really beautiful graphics and soundtrack. I can spend many hours looking at the characters and background, Dean make a really great game, I love it. But the game is very short, bosses are easy to beat (even the General Gaius, last of them) and battles with monsters eventually makes you bored (monsters respawn, when you get back at the section of level).My verdict: if you like side-scrollers, furries and want to play as a character with amnesia, this game is your choise! Buy it, you will hardly be disappointed.			"

												I love MetroidVania type games. You start out weak, but as you progress, you get more powers to play with and more strength, and you can go back to enemies that gave you trouble early on and give them what-for.Dust: An Elysian Tail pulls that off really well. The game gives you a robust combo system to fight with from the start, so you don't have to wait 5 hours to really feel epic. The gameplay in general is such that every fight feels mostly fair, since with some finesse you can combo your way to victory.As for the art style, I can say it's not for everyone. I quite enjoyed the whimsical nature, but it's probably not for everyone.The one problem that I had is that it's really short. You could burn through it in 6-8 hours, and it has little replayability, since you explore pretty much the entire map by the end. Completionists would have a bit more, but I left wanting more.			"

Combat is not a strong part of the game as there are not much of variety and all you need is Fidget with dust storm. If you're familier with this genre you can have your first run on the highest difficulty wihout much challenge (maybe except those random hazards).			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a 2D action-RPG platformer. It reminds me of games we had on the SNES-console. The game is almost completely programmed by one person. You play a character named Dust and you’re suffering from memory loss. You partake in different quest to find out the truth about yourself.It’s an action game that’s best played with a controller (I played it with an Xbox One wired controller).The graphics are beautiful and look hand drawn and are nicely animated. The game has good sound effects and music. The story is fully voiced with good voice-acting.With the experience points that you gather while fighting and completing quests you can level Dust and craft new items. While completing the levels you gain new abilities.It took me 14 hours to complete the game. Replay ability comes from completing all the quest and difficulty modes.The game supports 2560*1080 resolution.I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is awesome. It features stunning graphics, a perfectly blended score and voice acting far superior to most games I've played in my whole life (really, in my case that means something, gaming since the glorious CBM 64 times!).The game is so well crafted you could easily find yourself lost in playing it for only enjoying the fabulous scenery. In fact it is so damn good the game could easily feature the Disney logo in front and it would be an honour for the company that brought to us so many lovely and memorable movies (and I'm quite sure it would be an honour for the developer to ... ;).There is love and workmansship squeezing out of every detail of the setting and aspect of the game. The only letdown is that it's relatively easy, so don't expect something like a Castlevania or Metroid out of it gameplaywise, but keep in mind that this very game here was made merely by one person only during a period of four years devoting all his developing skills to just this one game. And you don't get to see things like this happen very often these days anymore. For 20 years now I always thought that this is a good sign for quality in games and seeing this game now is the proof that my believe is right.And the gameplay ... omg the gameplay ... To say it in one word it's gorgeos. You can control the game perfectly with whatever input device you throw at it. The player and the enemy animations plus the scrolling are fluid like golden butter in the mildness of a sunny summer's evening driping from a bunch of freshly cutted bread.For my part I even enjoy the story very much. I can't understand the complains of some of the other reviewers. For a game like this it is absolutely fullfilling all of my deeds I have to a decent action platformer with RPG-elements like Dust is. You got the whole pack here: Tragedy, Revenge, Mystery and Suspense. And that's only the main story line. On top of that there are many sidequests offered by various NPCs from within the games different locations. And the NPCs are so well and lovely implemented in the game, with so much heart that has been put into their design you will have no other choice but to help 'em out.For me this game is one of the best games I've played for a few years now. The only concern I have about it is that it has an end, and like with everything as good as Dust it will most likely come too soon ... But what the heck ... at least you've got two more difficulty settings if you played it through on normal. And for the not so pro-players amongst us, there is even a Casual difficulty setting so that really every single player can enjoy this game independently from what their gaming skills might be.If you enjoyed games like Aztaka you should absolutely get this.If you played this game through and want some more you should probably get Aztaka ... :)I got my copy of the game on a discount sale but I'd say it's easily worth even the full price.

												Calling this an ""Indie Title"" feels like a bit of an insult since most indie titles that are highly regarded tend to be lazy 2D pixel art with gameplay that is merely either old 2D Mario or some 2Deep4U minimalism disguising mediocrity and low budgets. Even IF this game was mediocre, the fact that it was entirely made by one person (minus the music and some voice acting) would explain why it was so.But it isn't. Kudos to actual effort on the part of an indie dev.I will say that some of the choices in voice actors were sub-par, and the art style looks like a weird mixture of 90's antromorphic western cartoon characters placed in a typical anime setting, so it comes across as odd. You juxtapose the serious with the Looney Tunes-ish and it comes across just as “Loonatics: Unleashed” did; which is to say it's off putting. But your mileage may vary and you may or may not like it/mind it. I'll leverage that critique by saying that the soundtrack is expertly done and worth a download.With that out of the way, what he have here is a 2D hack and slash with some light (and I mean very light) ""Metroid-vania"" elements. You have various maps that branch off to different pathways that eventually lead either to a dead end (boss fight, treasure chest, etc) or to the world map screen. You have quests that villagers give you, and these are typically “on the way” so they're easily completed as you're moving the story along, you merely have to explore the maps fully and not go directly to the next objective. When you gain the ability to slide and the ability to climb moss, you can fully explore maps and might want to backtrack a few (emphasis on few) to go up areas you previously couldn't. There's exploration here, but not a TON of backtracking.Unlike Metroid-vania titles, the map isn't one huge map either. Rather, you have a world map screen where you can select the various areas in the game, which keeps all the backtracking and exploration in 'sizable' chunks that are easily done with. It keeps things 'cleaner' and I definitely enjoy it. It's a game about exploring linear maps that branch off but not a lot of back-tracking, so “light Metroid-vania”.The combat is so-so. I don't have any complaints, but I do wish there was more complexity. Since most enemies hit for very little and have very simplistic attacks I can see why your own battle mechanics are simple. Even the bosses are easy to take out (shockingly easy), so there's no need for complexity when everything around you is so simple. Later on you'll most likely just fly over enemies to move to the next map screen, since there's nothing exciting here, albeit nothing is broken and all works as intended. You CAN have a lot of options in combat whilst maintaining the inputs and mechanics simple and basic, so a few points off for that only because games like Muramasa have spoiled me on how good combat can be.I'll also give a critique on the levelling up system: I can't go down a strict attack route and have to have my lowest stat be no more than 4 points behind my highest stat. It's not a HUGE deal but I never put points in vitality in most games, and being forced to is a bit annoying.Overall I'd say the main draw of the game (at least for me) was exploring the maps fully and fulfilling quests. The combat is lacking, but it “gets the job done” and the exploratory nature of the game leaves you something to fall back on and enjoy. The quality on this game is impressive for a team of one, and it ultimately stands on its own as an above average experience in the 2D hack and slash department that carries its own weight. Holding it back a bit is the so-so combat, but otherwise it's an enjoyable experience. If a sequel gets released I'll definitely purchase it...maybe on a slight discount, but I'll be there. Above average: 6 out of 10.			"

												To be honest, this is one of the best games I've ever played so far.Initially, I was rather skeptical of how this game will appeal to me as I was never a big fan of hack & slash games and the slow and mundane plot in the first few minutes almost confirmed my suspicion. Thankfully, things caught up quickly and soon I found myself lost in the world of Dust.The artworks and soundtracks used in this game are top-notch from the start to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed the aesthetical aspects of the game and I applaud the developers for putting their efforts. The story as a whole was excellent and the characters are among one of the best written ones I've seen. You'd need to play this with a gamepad though as playing on a keyboard may not be ideal in numerous fights and can give a different (or perhaps  a less enoyable) experience as a result. Anyway, there is also a pretty good variety of combat skills to choose from and you will be able to use them in various situations such as searching for treasures or going against different enemies. It's a rather big world out there so do try to explore all parts of the map.The only negative I could think of were the lags during the cutscenes. I've already experienced it twice during my playthrough and I had to reload a save and complete the level/fights again to watch the cutscene once more. Not a potential game-breaker but they can be annoying.In a nutshell, I highly recommend people to try this game out. I got it during the sale so it was definitely worth the money. However, even without any discounts, its price is still rather acceptable for a game of its calibre. An amazing game that will give you a whole lot to think about when you play it.Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!			"

												a simple and beautiful 2D platformer action RPG that you must have. if you love action RPG, don't think again to play Dust: An Elysian Tail, and when you start the game, you can't resist to complete your epic journey on this game.things that make this game fantastic are the art style, all of the sounds from this game, and the story.really, the art style is very unique and beautiful to me. your visual experience with this game is too hard to compare with another game because of it's uniqueness. maybe not all of you will find this kind of art beautiful, but i am sure you will surprise that this kind of art can deliver an action RPG game very beautifully (yeah, all of the action is very beautiful on this game).a great visual and a great sound is a perfect match. can you imagine, a game that feels like very real, it's like you really talking to the person on the game, swing your sword, and the massacres (you will often do this on this game, but still, beautifully).and the story. a great visual and sound, need a good story to complete a well written epic journey. with a visual and sounds like you have in this game, you can't help yourself from falling to the story. 	the story is twisty, a great onethose three, the art style, the sounds and the story, will always accompany you on this game while you enjoy the story. followed with many secret / side missions this game is almost perfect, the leveling and upgrade system is very fun too. but just one thing that less enjoyable from this game, that is the combat which is very repetitive. but it's okay for a beautiful and very cool combat, it's like the combat in Kingdom Hearts (at the very first time i played the combat, it was remind me of KH), repetitive combat still can be fun. you will want more story in the end of the game, but with more combat choice absolutelyoverall this game is one of the best action RPG for me, 9.5/10			"

												a pearl on steamamazing artwork and story (thank you dean, i appreciate your timeless masterpiece)back to the roots of multicolored 2D sidescroller hack and slash jump and run one man show with a fidget on his side, the bearer of a talking sword and a touch of RPG elements combined with gorgeous multiple combo special effects using the whole environment. please note that this title is not a challange like modern blockbuster so therefore the gameplay is not really complex, but not too easy at all to enjoy this journey.i absolutely recommand this game, but only to steam gamers who like the genre otherwise you won't be happy with. i bought it in the latest summer sale and after I finished it, I won't play it again but for the price of 2,79 € it's really worth it.8.5/10			"

												This has to be one of my favorite independent games out there today. While it took me a moment to adjust to the type of animation and voice acting, I ended up really enjoying the characters, story and combat. The hand-painted backgrounds and visual effects were quite beautiful. It was also pleasantly surprising to see characters from other popular independent games pop into the game as “friends” who added bonuses to health when found. I’m very impressed with Dean Dodrill’s skills and would love to see a sequel or a new game from him in the future! Read the full review! [geekatheartily.tumblr.com] "

												I was very excited to write this Games' review after Five minutes of playing .... This is really one of the best Game I've Played in 2013 or maybe of all-time ...everything in this game was simply PERFECT .... the gameplay, the story, the environment ,and the characters ....when a friend of mine recommended this game to me he told me this game is ""the Side-Scrolling God of War""I loved every character in the game ... specially Fidget .. I think I'll start dressing my cat as a bat .However if there is one bad thing in this game ... it would by the lack of weapons .. you'll play the whole game with only one weapon .. plus Fidget can throw a 3 types of projectiles ..But still the game would be perfect if it had more than a weapon . I was using Fidgets' Projectiles most of the game . Anyway My Rating for this game is :Dust: An Elysian Tail - ( 9 / 10 )			"

												It's a gorgeous, moving, clever, and often funny work of art, AND a very very fun game.  The animation and artwork are fantastic, making you feel like you're playing an animated movie; the (fully voice-acted) dialogue is well-written and tells the story effectively, and the gameplay is a thoroughly explorable Metroidvania-style experience, with a combo-based combat system that allows you to either engage small groups of enemies with parries and suplexes, or sweep across a room, moving from group to group to bombard them with magic and spinning slashes (or both at once).  Gameplay pacing is done well, navigation is done well, all the ""little things"" are done as well as the ""big things.""  I'm only about halfway through it, and the only complaint I've had was one particular room filled with spikes that was a pain to escape.  Amazingly, it was mostly done by one person, I can't recommend it enough.			"

												This game definitely scores a 10/10.Dust: An Elysian Tail kept me playing. I started out using a mouse and keyboard, which worked well, but when I remembered I had a Logitech F310 USB controller lying around, the game really began to shine. The different difficulty levels add a boat load of replay value; a fight you had no issue with on your first playthrough suddenly becomes more daunting on your next playthrough, all because you upped the difficulty this go round. If you want long fights, max out the difficulty. If you're just in it for the storyline, set the difficulty as low as possible and the game does all but walking and jumping for you. Controller support is phenomenal, the levels are beautiful, the storyline is gripping.There was one small issue, and that's the placement of one mission. During this mission, you are tasked to hit a high hit combo, but I noticed that, generally, you've leveled up quite a bit before you even make it this far. This creates an issue where, by the time you get your combo halfway there, you've knocked out all the enemies. Luckily there's an item in game that weakens you, but that seems to be the item's only purpose. As stated previously, it's a small issue, but it does tend to be a nuisance.Despite this, I can only hope for a sequel. "

												To me, this is a passion project game born, but made in the wrong time in a way.If it we're made during the Jazz Jackrabbit time, where it was cool to be a furry animal blasting people, without thinking about people dressing up as furry animals and jacking off to the idea, this wouldn't be a thing to even think about, and to enjoy the game for what it is.If you still choose to enjoy the game for what it is, and not think about the stigmata of it being somehow related to anything furry involving rabbits, you will find the result of a one-man project. And, this game is pretty damn good.You play as a fella named Dust, who has amnesia, and you are aided by a weird winged creature that guarded a talking sword that you now own, after it came to you. With that information in mind, you are supposed to figure out what happened to you, and what to do as you go on your journey.The game itself is pretty damn simple and good, and the secrets, although few, are either are well hidden (especially the indie darling group), or require a powerup later on in the game.Overrall, It's a pretty simple exploration game that deserves a playthrough.

												3D will never hold the same place in my heart as 2D, and this might be the most beautiful 2D game I've ever played.  The environments and character animations are absolutely gorgeous, completely immersive.  And beyond that the gameplay is just plain fun!  I'm a complete sucker for the ""Metroid-Vania"" style of side-scrolling combat with light RPG elements, and ""Dust"" nails everything that makes that particular school of design so enjoyable for the obsessive-compulsive ""must find everything"" backtrackers like me.  That having been said, it's not perfect.  The bosses, as have been noted by many others, are a bit lackluster (none quite so much as the final boss); the anime cutscenes can't live up to the beauty of the in-game animations; and, much as I hate to say it, the main story arc didn't quite live up to its full potential.  It's the last one which will probably get the most people up in arms at me, as the story has been near-universally praised from what I can tell.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's *bad.*  The characterization is fantastic, and all of the little moments with Dust and Fidget in particular are both amusing and, occasionally, touching.  It's just that these little moments, I think, work better than the big ones.  All in all, the highest praise I can give to ""Dust"" is that it left me wanting more.  I would LOVE to see a sequel.  If this is what Dean Dodrill can accomplish virtually single-handed, I can only imagine what he would produce with a dedicated team.  I absolutely loved this game and know that it is one which I will be revisiting over and over again.  Well done.			"

Posted: August 2, 2014
												This is a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers it in style. A straightforward, side-scrolling platformer with simple button-mashing combo-style hack n' slash combat, pretty graphics, and a relatively interesting storyline. It's got a very stereotypical anime-esque appearance, but there's beauty in the simplicity of the game. It's extremely well developed, easy to pick up and play, and nicely eyecatching. The animation is wonderfully smooth, with very subtle background effects, and a wide variety of environments to move through as you open up more of the wider map. I tend to think of this game as being a bit simple, but it's a work of art and it's hard to believe that it was entirely the product of one person. It must have been a labour of love, and that effort shows through. Dust is an interesting character and, almost despite myself, I became engrossed in his story and the way in which it unfolded. I was expecting something very basic and repetitive as this is a 2D platformer I bought during the sale, mainly because I'm a sucker for pretty artwork in games. I didn't expect much beyond a couple of hours of simple gameplay and levelling up a few times before polishing off a boss and ending the game all in time for tea. A week later, after running through the game twice (I upped the difficulty level the second time around) and earning all of the achievements, proved me totally wrong. At first I was skeptical; I found the characters to be a little bit twee and stereotypical, but as they and the story line developed I got hooked. It's suitable for all ages so don't expect any gore or adult themes, but there's a certain appeal in the innocence of the game; it's certainly not boring, and there are enough challenges and changes to keep you interested despite the fairly repetitive nature of platform gaming. It may appear cartoonish but there are some serious moral themes discussed and life lessons to be learnt. Picking up new abilities throughout the game gets you returning to previous maps to complete things you couldn't do earlier in the game, which nicely prevents it from being a linear run-through from one level to the next. It's hard to criticise this game because it doesn't promise any more than it delivers. You don't feel short-changed by the simplicity of the game play or the slightly ""cutesy"" characters. It's easy to play through, which might be disappointing if you're looking for more of a challenge. It is fairly repetitive but the enemies do get tougher as the game develops, matching your character's development. The challenge arenas are the only places where you can really push your skills to try to get that elusive four-star rating. The other downside is the boss fights - it's a button-masher so just keep hitting the combos for long enough and the boss goes down, it's as simple as that. But again, it's hard to criticise because the game delivers exactly what it promises. It's enjoyable but not astonishing. I recommend it as a pleasant and pretty game to play, a nice bit of simple escapism that isn't going to challenge or frustrate you.			"

												What can I say that hasn't been said about this game? Coming from someone who has yet to play Castlevania or Metroid for that matter, I found this to be an amazing game. The soundtrack and the visuals are outright gorgeous. The story is also a great tale to tell; dark, yet humorous at the same time. Not only that, but the characters are also great, varying in many memorable personalities. I don’t mind the choice of art used, especially as I feel it would change the story too much if it was otherwise. My only problem with the game is that the combat can be a bit repetitive at times, but not too much, thankfully. This is literally why I am going to learn about programming; if one man can create nearly everything aside from the music and voice acting, and turn out something that gets such ratings as it got (9-10/10’s), this paves the way for others to do so too. I completely recommend this, as it serves not only as a great game, but as a pillar for others to follow their dreams as well. Thank you, Dean Dodrill; for everything.			"

												Having seen it prasied by Totalbiscuit some years back, my interest was spiked. But it fell of my watch, and only later down the line when it was included in a Humble Bundle did I recall it. Awesome visuals, great soundtrack, responsive controls, and it was all made by a single man (bar the music). Plus its options menu surpasses most triple A titles. It's a labour of love and it shows, making it an under-rated gem of the indie scene.To put it simply, it's kind of like some kind of Disney movie but like, kind of not really because it's a game. But it's good. Go buy it.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a RPG-Metroidvania where you take control of ""Dust"", a misterious creature who seems to have lost his memories. Without an aparent reason he will be followed by a flying ""batcat"" and a talkative mystic sword, who will help Dust and guide him in order to know his purpose in this world, as also as to get his memories back. The game also provides a background of war and its consequences.Graphics: 8.5/10 - This game is absolutely gorgeus. Every visual thing is extremely polished and colourful, as well as an awesome handprint. This game proves that sometimes you just don't need a 3D graphics, triple A game to say ""wow, nice graphics"". Soundtrack: 8/10 - The soundtrack is also amazing, yet it comes to be quite secundary because of the pace of action the game is exposed to. All tracks goes into an epic/orchestra path and they're all as beautiful as the game looks like. Nevertheless, and as I said, this game is so fluid and fast that the own game's FX sounds overrides the soundtrack, making it hard to appreciate how good it is.Controls: 8.5/10 - As a non-casual player of Metroidvania games, I was pretty satisfied with Dust controls. Movement is fluid and once you learn its mechanics you won't have a problem here. Every mistake I experienced in this game was my own fault and not the game's one. Combos are really cool and they are set to let the players make their own strategies with all different movements. Duration: 7.5/10 - Dust: An Elysian Tail will provide you more than 5-7h of storyline (unless you rush it), and about another 5-7h if you go for the extras, such as new skills, completing sidequests. finding treasure chests, etc. As many Metroidvania games, this game has some RPG features, like character level progression, which can lengthen your experience and gameplay even more (it is always nice to farm your level!). Moreover, the storyline is surprisingly interesting, and might keep you playing without pause until the end. And yes, the whole story is pretty good. Definately not a disappoint.Difficulty: 6.5/10 - This game, compared to my idea of the average difficulty of its similars, is basically ""not too hard, but not too easy either"". Four difficulties can be chosen from the start and can be changed during your gameplay, and that means that on higher difficulties less HP recovery items will be spread, stronger (yet not faster) enemies, tougher bosses and HP damage, etc. Overall Dust: An Elysian Tail can be played by everyone and shouldn't disappoint either new players or the veteran ones. OVERALL: 8.5/10 - I was kinda hyped when I finally purchased this game and my expectations were dangerously high. However, Dust: An Elysian Tail answered to them VERY well. This game is another demonstration that a small company can make huge things into the gaming industry. I'm really happy I decided to try out this game, it was worthy and I feel this can like you all too because I found it really hard not to enjoy it.			"

This game is very much like that, a brawling adventure with over-the-top weapons, capped w/ a good RPG element and beautiful hand-drawn graphics.You can smash through it with a handful of moves, but which handful of moves you need at any given time changes depending on the enemies you're facing, so it doesn't get artificially stale mid-way through like many brawlers do.

												Beautiful, fun to play, with an unique style and a mature plot despite the ""cartoon"" characters. Probably one of the best Indie games of the year and a true example of how a metroidvania should be done.			"

												Dust simply put is one of the best games I have played. I loved every bit this game had to offer from the fantastic story and artwork, to the soundtrack and combat system. This game has everything you expect and more. To the team that developed this game, brilliant truly a master piece. Thank you for the fantastic experience.			"

-Quick Review-Dust: An Elysian Tail is a 2D Side Scrolling action RPG game, which has great voice acting, and a nice quest system that you can play through in a little less than a day.WARNING: Make sure to save, and not trust the Autosave. The game autosaved over my original copy; I had thought that it was my own save that was updating… this was regrettably not the case. Good bye days worth. Please learn from my mistake. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Dust: An Elysian Tail starts off very confusing, the story just kind of drops you into the game and says “Hey, you’re the hero, here’s a talking sword and an annoying fairy thing, go save the word!” Now that I think about it, this isn’t really an uncommon trait in video games.I won’t spoil the story, but I like how the main character looks, the game is very Asian-cultured,  you have your annoying side-kick who just makes your character look better, it has all it needs to have to be a good game… The only down side is that the game goes by really fast.Game Play:  The game play starts out very fast paced, I knew before I left the starting zone that I was going to enjoy it. The game is based on gaining exp through “combo’s” which you obtain through getting hits on enemies. You’ll figure out neat ways to go about doing this while you play the game and unlock new abilities.Fidget (The side-kick / flying wombat / fairy-thing) throws magic, Dust uses a Magic sword and you use those two in collaboration in the air or on the ground. That’s what the game comes down to. Knowing when to fight in the air, and how and when to fight on the ground.Achievements: The achievements on this game are fun. I started the game right away on Normal difficulty, got nearly everything then reset my game and descided to replay on tough to get the final few achievements I missed.When I started the game on Normal I was very over confident and thought I could just zip through the game without needing to learn where my heal button is… That didn’t work out so great, so it’s not “easy” but it’s not “Super Meat Boy”. Most of the achievements can be obtained relatively easily once you’re familiar with the game.Price: Dust: An Elysian Tail at normal price is going for $14.99, I would say that the game is priced fairly for the quality you will get. I only put 22 hours into the game, but I did rush a bit and had to look up a guide for the “find all your friends” achievement… The price might still be a bit high for someone with a strained check book.As I say on most of my reviews, you may want to wait for this game to go on sale before you buy it, but it is definitely worth buying. Additionally it is currently in the Humble Bundle for the next eleven days! You might want to jump at the chance to get it now with a few other indie games: https://www.humblebundle.com/ Conclusion: I enjoyed this game, I felt that I got my money’s worth out of it, the story was excellent, the quality was impressive, the game play was fun. I don’t know what else you could ask out of a game like Dust: An Elysian Tail. I say this is a “Must Have” for anyone who enjoys 2D Indie Games.			"

												Итоговая оценка - 4,43/5Более подробный разбор ниже.Когда небо было голубее и трава зеленее, мы играли в классические нынче платформеры. Эта игра перенесла меня туда, и я вспомнил, что меня ""цепляло"" - всё было интересно и в новизну. Проработанные и красиво нарисованные локации населенные, такой же, проработанной и красивой фауной. И да локации весьма разнообразны: от зелёных лугов с разрушенными остатками былой цивилизации и тёмного подземелья, до заснеженных горных вершин и вулканических земель - всё очень ярко и запоминающееся. По всем канонам платфомеров присутствуют и секретные локации, на которые попасть не всегда просто и очевидно. Если для некоторых просто необходимо пройти дальше по сюжету и получить новую способность (да тут способности будут выдаваться по мере прохождения сюжета, но об этом дальше), то для других нужно воспользоваться как чьими-то записями или же просто интуицией. Когда Вам в последний раз хотелось пройти игру открыв все секреты и локации? Я уже давненько не помню такого. Именно это отпечаталось у меня в голове после полного прохождения данной игры. Ибо автору удалось облегчить поиск секретов ровно на столько, что бы это оставалось интересным, но не вызывало мучений.Боевая система же в игре сделана, по-моему мнению, в угоду возрасту игрока (рейтинг 10+), без наличия рек крови, но вполне интересную на высоких уровнях сложности. Среди обзоров наткнулся на фразу о том, что все бои проходят за одной, изредка двумя кнопками. Странно видеть такие замечания к слешеру, коим по-сути и является этот платформер в боевой части. На самом же деле в игре присутствует парочка комбо, но действительно хотелось бы больше комбинаций т.к. со временем эффектная анимация приедается и становится немного скучно. Скуку помогает разбавить сложность, т.к. протагониста могут положить на лопатки всего несколько ударов, а так же наличие нескольких нетипичных врагов, к которым необходим особый подход.Так же присутствует и РПГ-составляющая: система уровней с прокачкой одной из характеристик, которых 4 (на самом деле их 5, но прокачивать можно только 4) и которые не могут разниться между собой не более чем на 4 очка; а также система экипировки персонажа артефактами которые влияют на все 5 характеристик и еще несколько игровых моментов.Как платформер игра не так хардкорна, как тот же Mario, Darkwing Duck, но на некоторых местах заставляет изрядно понервничать и сжать контроллер покрепче. Да я сказал контроллер, игра пришла к нам на ПК-платформу прямиком с Xbox360 и изначально была ""заточена"" под геймпад и в процессе игры ни разу не хотелось пересесть за клавиатуру. Ну да ладно, вернемся к самой игре. Чтобы собрать все секреты необходимо открыть все способности протагониста, поэтому придется возвращаться вновь на локации. Кстати, после зачистки локации, враги появляются вновь стоит только выйти за её границу. Это сложно отнести к явным недостаткам, но создает некоторое неудобство, которое по мере прокачки протагониста будет всё меньше и меньше.И наконец сюжет. Он имеет как излишнюю пафосность и какой-то детской наигранностью, так интригующую составляющую (сюжет не по книге/фильму/игре, а свой собственный, хотя и имеет в себе парочку-другую штампов) и юмор, который действительно способен вызвать улыбку. Но всё же он сделан , по моему мнению, опять же в угоду возраста игрока.P.S. Игра проходится за 8-12 часов. Я же столько наиграл банально из-за низкого уровня знания английского - что заставляло меня перманентно держать в оверлее гугл-переводчик (хотелось просто подтянуть уровень английского, а происходящее было вполне интересено, чтобы не отбивать желания понимать происходящее).P.P.S. Кстати интересный факт, что над игрой работал по-большей части один человек около трёх с половиной лет. Я думаю это и помогло стать игре такой какой она задумывалась...			"

I honestly enjoyed this game, there were tons of quests which were optional and slightly different play styles as well as really fun achievements to go for. I will admit that the ending to me felt kinda off... the voice acting kinda dropped near the end but still it was a fun game and I am honestly glad I played it.			"

I loved doing achiements, And will reply the game a little to collect them all. Worth it too, I have no problems replaying this game. It was so much fun. The only reason i rated Gameplay 4/5 is because sometimes some deaths are annoying by silly stuff. Like getting stuck in a corner because of a gaint. Or falling into lava because you can't see whats below you when in the air. But really, Worth the full price.			"

												A short, beautiful game that tells an unexpectedly satisfying, meaningful story. As a platforming beat-em-up, it's not particularly difficult or complex, but the strong vocal performances propel the game forward in an immersive, compelling way. Upgrades and new abilities are well-paced throughout, allowing you to choose whether you'd like to keep pushing forward, or backtrack for hidden treasures. I will separately note that the musical score is also extremely strong, with Hyperduck providing BGM that is memorable and very much a pleasure to listen to.With so many games featuring a laundry-list of tacked-on features or grindy content filler, it is refreshing to play an exploration game that gets to the point by focusing on its core competencies, and does them well. This game was recommended to me, and I now recommend it to you.			"

												First of all, it is mind blowing how smooth this game plays. It has the feel of a professionally made game by a well known team. If you enjoy action rpg in somewhat of the style of ""Metroidvania"" Castlevania game, then this game is for you. If you act now(at the time that I'm typing this), you can get the game for only 3 dollars. It is a steal for how well made this game is. Plenty of action, material to collect to make new items, quests to do for npcs, etc.The only issue I've had so far was the game crashing on me upon going to the world map to chose a new area to go to. It doesn't always happen. I suspect it will be resolved at some point, and it isn't too gamebreaking, as long as you save often. I am thorough pleased with my purchase of this game, and I highly recommend it to anyone else that enjoys these type of games.Edit: It should be noted that the crashes on world map only happened the first two times I tried to go on it. It has been fine after that, So it was probably just my comp, since I was on it for a while.Edit2: Having finished the game, I may have some minor nitpicks, but nothing major. Mostly the artwork in the final scenes looked odd with the eyebrows and eyes going through the hair. It makes it look out of place, compared to how professional everything else looked. Other than that, this game has been really solid all the way through. Touching story, and leaving the door open for a sequel. I've had a blast, and I still gotta play this game through again on a harder setting at some point and finish up what is left of the achievements. I probably would have paid the original price. But hey, this is on steam, so 3 dollars was really nice for the amount of fun I've had with this game.			"

It just feels good to look at.The gameplay is fun aswell. While it's satisfying to smack everything up in the air and spin  around as a furry tornado, it feels kinda shallow. Or that might just be me spamming buttons throughout the game.Howeeeveeer.... The voice acting in this game was... not enjoyable. It feels like a less than good dubbed anime.It's not enjoyable.  But it's forgivable. It's not a grand terrible voice acting but it feel cringy to listen to at times. Not enough to make it mute the game anytime people open their mouth.This game gets   8 furries out of enjoying a postage card.			"

												Dust has truly captivated me. Not only the character but the game as a whole. Dust as a character is a young man struggling with his past, present and future. He wakes up not being able to remember who he is or how he got there, thus starting a journey in the search of those lost memories. Sounds quite cliche, but it has been fabulously executed, exceeding my story-related expectatives.Dust as a game is impressive. The story is simple but deep, everything you do and everyone you meet have something to do in this game, the backgrounds and BGM are breathtaking and the gameplay is intuitive and absolutely great. Even the english dubbing has been properly done. The various side quests it includes (Cirelian Trials, secondary missions, finding treasures and friend cages, finding materials for building your own equipment, etc) add up to the game experience.A must-play game. Give it a try and you'll be fascinated by the beauty it holds. "

												After I saw the trailer for this game I was really excited to play it, so much so my boyfriend bought it for me in an attempt to get me playing more PC games. Although at first I thought maybe it was a little too childish for my age, I quickly forgot that! Dust creates an exciting world that completely immerses the player and pulls them along. I found this game was hard to put down and from discussing it with others I found they also had the same experience. It might seem like a more Kid-friendly game, which is how one friend initially described it to me, but I find it appeals to a large audience of all ages.  I loved the story line and the art style and music. Perhapse I might sound too biased towards the positives of this game and not really elaborate on flaws, but as I said before this game is addicting and I don't think there are any major flaws that would really turn a person off from this game. I find myself going out of my way to complete every little aspect to perfection just so I can get more playing time cause I'll be sad when its finally done. =) I really love this game and if you're hesitant to buy I hope this review helps.

Bosses tend to 1-hit you and small creeps still finish you off in 2-3 hits, giving you a real challenge. Dodging will be most important which results in Aerial Dust Storm becoming your best friend.

												A close friend of mine gifted me this game during the Christmas sales from last year, and oh my god, I really loved that game !Since my native language is French, I was playing with the French subs. The voices were still in English, but I gotta admit the translations from English to French are perfectly correct. I think the voice acting is excellent, the game concept as well. It's also an addicting game to me, and I really loved the story ! I also enjoyed the animations. It's very well made ! Even thought the ending was a bit sad, especially when Dust sacrified himself into the lava.. I also noticed there are some minor glitches. It's about the items getting stuck into the walls. For example, I wanted to get my chicken, I tried to get it, but it was stuck into the wall so I couldn't get it sadly. But anyways, I highly recommend this game ! If you like adventure and platform games, then you should give a try to play this game. I'm sure you'll enjoy it !			"

I played both Ori and Undertale at around the same time that I played Dust, and all three have shown their own love of story, characters, and gameplay that can be very difficult to find in other developers' arsenals. Dust is one of the best games I've ever played, and especially up there with the rest of the amazing indies.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a game that by this point in time really shouldn't need any introduction. The game has won multiple rewards, received much praise, and delighted many gamers, but how well does it hold up to all that hype?In my opinion, very well, Admittedly the game does have its flaws, but when you stop to think about the fact that the vast majority of the game was made by one man, said flaws become much more forgivable. That said, the only note-worthy flaw with Dust: An Elysian Tail is the story, as it is rather generic. That's not to say that it's bad, but it's certainly nothing that you haven't heard before. However, that doesn't prevent Dust: An Elysian Tail from being a highly entertaining gaming experience. While the story may not be all that fresh, it does still manage to be entertaining, thanks mostly to Fidget, who will be your faithful companion throughout the game. You may have heard certain folks compare Fidget to Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but I have no idea where they're drawing that comparison from. Fidget isn't some annoying creature with no purpose but to point out the painfully obvious and pester you every 5 minutes by reminding you of what you should be doing to advance the plot, but a fully realized and fleshed-out character with lots of humorous dialog. Without Fidget, Dust: An Elysian Tail would be far less entertaining in the story department, but thanks to her and her dialog/commentary, Dust's story becomes far more interesting.Gameplay-wise, Dust: An Elysian Tail is more or less your standard ""Metroidvania"" fare, with side-scrolling action, lots of areas to explore, platforming, you know the drill. However, Dust: An Elysian Tail also has RPG elements, such as stats, a Level Up System, Magic, loot, crafting, and items that will increase your stats. Granted that Castlevania: Symphony of the Night also had RPG elements, but Dust's feel a bit deeper than that, more in line with games like Muramasa: The Demon Blade than SotN, albeit the combat isn't quite as deep as Muramasa.Graphics-wise, Dust: An Elysian Tail is beautiful game. All of the visuals were hand-drawn by Dean Dodril (the game's creator) himself, and they're gorgeous. However, words alone can't do it justice at all, so take a peek at the Screenshots and see for yourself.Sound-wise, Dust: An Elysian Tail is beautiful as well. Hyperduck Studios did an excellent job on this game's soundtrack, and they really deserve more recognition for their work. Every bit of music in this game hits its mark, perfectly reflecting what's going on in the game around it.There's really not much more that I can tell you about the game, it's really something that you'll have to experience yourself. At $14.99, the game is well worth it, and I'm sure that you won't regret it.			"

												     So my Good friend Taylor told me about this game.  My first impression was that it looked too cartoony and childish for me, then I saw the trailer.  My curiousity peaked at that point.  Taylor bought me the game and I started to play it and here I am telling people to get it.  But some people out there ask why I believe you should.       Dust: An Elysian Tail is about a man named Dust who wakes up in the middle of the woods with no prior memory, a magic sword, and a cute sidekick named fidget.  His memory restores throughout the story.  The story has a common foundation but with an amazing twist.  I do not want to spoil any of the AMAZING story so the topic will end here.       The Gameplay and art style was unique.  Dust is an action-RPG hacky-slashy game where the premise is simple, bonk the bad guys with the sword and they die.  That's atleast what I thought it would be until you unlock the ""K"" move.  The game then becomes the most pleasureable display of explosions and lights I have seen since beat hazard.  The amount of hits you can get in a single fight will make your jaw drop.  The enemies dont scale as well as they try.  They see to go from easy, to semi easy, and then straight to down right annoying!     Verdict:  I Strongly suggest anyone pick up this game.  If you love explosions, a beautiful artstyle, anime, and a one of a kind story.  BUY THIS GAME AT ONCE.  9.5/10                                                                                                                                                   -Amerika "

												So after 2 and a half years of development, we'd finally get this game: Dust: An Elysian tail.And please tell me if you get the gabe newell reference, but this game was worth the wait in every way.Throughout the game, i'd search for plotholes and flawed gameplay mechanics, and needsly to say, i couldn't find any.Dust's controls are the opposite of stiff. The game is really responsive to controls, and it leads to some fun platforming and fast-paced gameplay. And while this game does have a rush bros disease of slow walking and fast rolling, I had an easy time ignoring it to the game's combat.Not only are you given a however small variety of attacks to dish out pain with, there's loads of combos that you can test yourself to execute and memorize with your keyboard, and you get rewarded for each combo. Not only do you get extra experience, you also get achivements, and your enemies of course die faster. While that does sum it up, this game also has its way of disapointment. At the beginning of the game, you're given the blade of Ahrah, Fidget, And dus'ts glorious control to utilize and THATS. IT.Later in the game, you're informed ahrah is only ONE of the blades of elysium; Why couldnt we find and use the others? I wouldve liked more variety than just being stuck with 2 weapons to use. Fidget got more than one mode of attacking, why cant we?Gameplay aside, the graphics, which are hand drawn by the way look GLORIOUS. They dont cause any eyestrain and there isnt a spam of color palette like rush bros had. The game is really pretty to look at and i hope you buy it for that reason.Now, lets go to the plot. In the beginning you see an unknown warrior charging through a variety of people for an unknown reason, and later find out he's killed by a child. In the next scene, you see our main character, dust, kneeling in the middle of an unknown forest. This is the game's first point of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. You know why? THERES NO REAL CUTSCENES UNTIL NEAR THE END OF THE GAME. Otherwise, all you get is pictures that might as well mimic a slideshow along with text, it really made me depressed toward how such good artwork was put to waste. Anyway, we're introduced to our 3 protagonists, dust, fidget, and the blade of ahrah, which as i said earlier is the main weapon you'll be using throughout the game. We then see that dust has forgotten his past and that he summoned ahrah for yet another unknown reason. Dust doesnt even know why he did it, but he chooses to ignore it and go on a quest to find out more of his past, kill a bunch of racist knights, and simply bring justice where justice is needed with the help of fidget and the blade of ahrah. This is why i like indie games like this, they keep the plot simple and fast to keep the player wanting to play their game. You might call it lazy, but it works. So after all that said, I do like this game for a variety of reasons, (One i'd rather not say) And also, I think that this game has perfect potential and setup for a sequel. If there were a game called Dust 2 (No pun intended), I really hope they'd keep what made this game good and add onto it.			"

												A truly beautiful game, that will enthrall you with it's lush 2D environments, fluent combat and well-written characters. Dust has brilliantly designed maps, that will encourage exploration and the pace at which new elements are introduced to the experience is just right. The fact, that there isn't an aweful lot of variation in enemy types is easily overlooked in the progression of the motivating story. And don't forget the humor, which there is plenty of. I you like yourself some feel-good action, don't pass up this gem.			"

- A lovely platformer with beautiful art style, visual pleasing but a tad repetitive combat at times and a main plot that will keep you interested till the end.Review score: Recommended Game⇓ Personal Review ⇓StoryYou play as Dust, a warrior who got woken up in a forest by a magical blade named Ahrah and its guardian Fidget who from there on are your companions throughout the rest of the story. In short; Dust must work towards retrieving his/its memory in order to bring Justice to a land terrorised by monsters, war and other events you'll encounter. In the beginning and mid game the story was not really something to write home about BUT it was interesting enough for me to keep playing the main plot line and it got more interesting as I progressed towards the end. I can't comment on side missions, didn't play them.GraphicsEach area has it's own unique environment and beautiful art style with accompanying enemy mobs. None of them are in my opinion dull or generic. Aside from the beautiful 2d graphics the combat graphical effects are pleasant to watch at and fit right in.GameplayCombat itself was interesting for me due to the variety of enemies encountered. There are enough guides to explain the easy to remember combos for you to use. There could have been a bit more complexity on that part but that gets balanced by the enemy's difficulty as you progress through the game. In the beginning and mid game most of them are easy to beat (depending on difficulty mode) but towartds late game I died a lot =).Aside from enemies there are some environmental dangers to be dealt with in certain areas, each specific to the level you're playing in. They're not super unique but it does give more depth to the gameplay.			"

												This game is both figuratively and literally a work of art. The beautiful music, painstakingly detailed environments, and passionate voice acting blew me away. Then Fidget and all 304% of her adorable-osity sealed the deal. At first the story didn't really spark much interest--being the typical ""all powerful mysterious warrior with amnesia traversing the land helping it's people while trying to regain his dark and mysterious memory""-- but as it went on it started to pull me in. It's best described as a cross between Okami and Rayman Origins with a little bit of Kingdom Hearts sprinkled on top. (Pros and cons below.)Pros:-Beautifully orchestrated music-Painfully detailed environments and weather effects-Very touching and emotionally impacting. Feelings of pain, sorrow, love--concepts of life and death are handled maturely like they should be and conveyed to the player-Excellent, passionate voice acting-Exciting and tense momentsNeutral:-The humor is 50-50. There are some funny jokes. There are some dry jokes.-Storyline may or may not provide the player with much interest.-The difficulty fluxuates. Some areas are very easy, some areas suddenly♥♥♥♥♥♥you.Cons:-A bit on the short side-Typical hack'n slash with redundant combat-VERY few combos to use; especially for a hack n'slash-Hordes of respawning enemies can be a bit overwhelming and annoying at times-Boss battles are complete jokes. Normal enemies are more life threatening than the bosses-Practically no replay valueConclusion:-6.5/10. While the gameplay and hack'n slash elements are regretably limited, this game is a work of art. It's a 2D game that has infinitely more heart and soul put into it than most overrated 3D Micheal Bay games out today. It is TRULY a work of art and deserves as much support and recognition as it can get for its BEAUTY instead of gameplay which unfortunately is below par. Of course artistry isn't for everyone. This game is not for everyone. But that doesn't stop it from being truly beautiful.			"

												I had some good fun with this indie game. A large majority – perhaps all of my enjoyment – comes from its fun combat system. Chaining together extremely large combos is very rewarding. I also admire the fact that *one* person did all the programming and art, that’s extremely rare. You go, Dev! That said, I played at least half-way through the game, and don’t care at all for the story. So, if you’re looking for good combat, I would recommend this game…but if you’re looking for an engaging story (or any at all), I can’t recommend this game.			"

I don't want to fight anymore.  I don't need to figure out who I am.  I'm happy with just being Dust.  But it can never be like this.  I know that if I don't keep fighting, there won't be anyone left.  And that's the hard part.

												Note - I originally played this game through when it debuted on the Xbox Live Arcade and only recently had a Steam copy gifted to me.In short, Dust: An Elysian Tail is the best 2D platformer/brawler story-driven experience I've ever had. Period.Gameplay-wise, this game is very easy to pick up and takes a lot of focus to master.  Granted it's generally possible to breeze your way through the game by maxing Fidget's magic first, the melee combos and building chains is great fun.This game is also aesthetically pleasing to the maximum, I couldn't fault someone for thinking this was a professionally animated movie (maybe because it almost was) for the beautiful character and environment design.Throughout the story things evolve from very tongue-in-cheek tropes to the very serious and emotional later stages.  All along the way humor is balanced with serious moments perfectly.As far as I'm aware Dust is largely bug free, and the options menu is something to take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of even modern AAA titles.Seriously, if you haven't already get your hands on this game.  It's cute, fun, sad and well worth the price even now.			"

												Even though I am not much into furries, this is now one of my favourite games. And explaining why seems to be the most difficult thing I've ever written.Let's start simple, the music is pretty damn gorgeous! There are only a few games that fit flwalessly to the game and are really enjoyable to listen independetly as well. None of the tracks gets annoying over time and they support the game flow from start to finish.The story is well-written, and even though I normally prefer darker and more brutal atmosphere in my games, having a fairy taler occasionally can feel refreshing. And this one really does! The two main characters are really fun to take through the solid yet somewhat simplistic main story, their interactions with each other never fail to characterize them both and their bond. Some of the supporting characters are not so strong, though, but it didn't really bother me.But the real meat here is the fighting system and especially the controls. I've never played a game with as tight control set as Dust. If you die, it's your own fault for making a balant mistake. You really feel like you are in control at any time. The system itself is really simple, yet it never got boring in my first playthrough. Every fight was thoroughly satisfying and the platforming, while I usually hate it, felt natural and fun to play.The only bad thing I can say is the difficulty level, which is too easy for me. And the fact that after completing this game, other games feel dull and colourless... =DDust is easily the best game I've played for quite a while. If there is any chance you'd enjoy a good metroidvania platformer, give this one a try. I give it my biggest recommendations!			"

This game was an absolute blast to play through, especially for a genre I generally don't enjoy (this being the Beat-Em-Up aspect of the game, not the Metroidvania aspect of it). The world is highly open and fun to explore, with absolutely incredible atmosphere and a slightly cliché though very well polished story. The music as a whole is solid, though admittedly I only really found myself truly attached to a few songs in the game. It fits the world though, and it knows when to pick up and when to slow down. The characters are pretty enjoyable, each of which having their own unique qwerks and characterization to make each individual character in the game so compelling. It helps that the voice acting is honestly pretty good. The anthropomorphic-animal-type character design is offputting at first, but it really didn't detract from anything.All of this is topped off by one of the most fluid, reactive, and satisfying combat engines I think I've ever played. Combos are given to you relatively early so you have plenty of time to practice using them, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I haven't sent chills down my spine for some of the absolutely insane stuff I've been able to pull of. Despite having one weapon (two if you count his companion Fidget), Dust has a huge variety of ways to handle pretty much every enemy in the game, and very rarely does mowing down hordes of minions ever get stale. The artstyle helps ludicrously in this department, making each hit feel rewarding and managing to maintain a long-lasting combo stupidly satisfying. This game has its share of Action RPG elements in it as well, with stuff like shops, level ups, and various equipment options to choose from as the game expands.All of this made the game such an absolute thrill to play, and if you can manage to snag it for the deal I got it at (Three and a half dollars!? What!?), there's no question as to whether you buy this game or not. This game is nearly flawless.Oh, and pretty much all of this game was made by one person - Dean Dodrill. Incredible.			"

												This is a great game with a good art style, interesting story and ♥♥♥♥ing great combat. Which is good because there's a lot of it, but no matter how many more mooks appeared I never got tired of killing them. I'd recommend you buy this game just for the fun as hell combat alone.Also, your companion, Fidget is pretty much the most adorable companion character to have ever been concieved and is a joy to have around.

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an amazing 2D side scrolling combat game. Not only does this game have an awesome combat system but it has a great story as well. There are also RPG like elements in the game as you level up with experience and can upgrade your gear. Great sounds, music and artwork throughout the entire game. The game took me ~15 hours to play through which includes getting 100% in all the areas and completing all the quests. I highly recommend this game!			"

												It's just a beautiful ARPG that is a mix between Metroid and Muramasa.The sound and musik is wonderful, the game runs really smooth and the gameplay is fantastic. Here are some pros and cons for you.Key Features (Pro)-Every dialog in this game is voice acted-Large Maps, feels like the RPG Castlevania games-Leveling up system, status values, equipment system from weapon to rings and amulets-Areas welcome you to backtrack there later, lots of paths can only be opened with abilitys you earn later on-Teleport system that gets you to already activated points-A Large crafting system with random blueprint drops from quests and monsters-Huge replayability, challenges and multiple difficulty settings-Casual mode with infinite health, good for beginners (not recommended to use)(Contra)-It may be a bit too hard for those who are not experienced with this genre.-The Furry designed world and lore might not appeal to everyoneIn my opinion this is one of the best Indie games I've ever played, and is also better then Muramasa or some of the RPG Castlevanias.The only similiar games that can still beat Dust are Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid.Rate: 9.4/10			"

												I highly recommend this game.The graphic and music are just incredible. I have to say that it has the most amazing graphic I have ever seen in its plat former genre. I feel like playing a 3D game in a 2D game, which is kind of weird. The sound effect is pretty realistic, whenever I get into a cave, the game changes how the sound works. This is just amazing!The game play is just good. If you enjoy hack and slash, this is right for you. I do not really get the story; however, I just enjoy slashing down foes. I would recommend using a console over keyboard though. If only this game has a multi-player system, Dust would be a no brainer pick on popular Steam games. "

												Dust: An Elysian Tail has the soul of PSX/PS2 living within it, the entire time I played I was feeling very nostligic and happy, reminded me of all the great 2D hack/slash RPG games from back in the day, ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"" ""Valkyrie Profile"" and ""Odin Sphere"" spring to mind.The smooth animation and beautiful backdrops are very pleasing to the eye, loads of special effects and carnage litter your entire screen with the screams of the 1000's you slaughter from start to finish, Sound design is very good overall, voice acting was a little weak in some areas, great in others, the games soundtrack is very solid as well, every tune fit each occasion and was wonderfully executed.Lots of sidequests, a dozen ""friends"" to be rescued, loads of treasure, a decent amount of magic spells and equipment with plenty of upgrades to keep you busy, fight after fight the game kept a great pace, enemies never felt too overwhealming nor did they feel to easy, overall I had a blast playing this game, even tho it's not perfect, it's well worth the purchase and I'll be looking forward to any sequels in the future.8/10 "

												Dust is a 2D action-exploration game in the famed 'Metroidvania' style, with some pretty cool elements to it. It actually reminds me a lot of ""Muramasa: The Demon Blade"" (if you've ever played or heard of that). As with Muramasa, the first thing you will notice are the stunning hand-drawn visuals and animation. The look of the characters and backgrounds during gameplay are quite beautiful. Additionally, the characters all have detailed animated portraits that appear on-screen during conversations. It just looks fantastic all around. The characters themselves are all pretty good, assuming you can stomach a cast full of anthropomorphic animals (and a seriously cutesy flying bunny-type-thing sidekick). The voice acting and plot are generally good as well. Gameplay consists of 2D sword combat with light platforming elements. The combat also has a few cool twists - your sidekick has projectile attacks that can be combined with a special sword technique, resulting in some spectacular combos and on-screen fireworks. It all looks and feels really cool once you get the hang of it. Eventually you will become just  ridiculously powerful, making the game very easy, but it's still good fun. As with similar games, you progress through various areas that unlock as you gain additional abilities. There's also a ton of extra stuff to do (such as side-quests), if you are into 100%-ing games or completing achievements. If you are a fan of this type of game, this one is well worth your time. Highly recommended. A-Technical notes: I highly recommend using an Xbox360 controller for this one. Although I haven't actually tried the keyboard controls, I just can't imagine them working well enough to easily pull off the actions required by the game. Plus, these types of games just control better with gamepads anyways. Anyways, just be aware of this... you've officially been warned.			"

												I had this game from months ago and didn't bother to play long. I thought this game was going to be boring so I don't bother to play long, but today i played again and found out that my first impression of the game is wrong.. I actually love it after 1 hour of playing. I guess I wasn't fond of a ""rabbit"" as a main character and his accompanion flying cat thing (I forgot what her race name -- again), and I didn't like the control LB-RB to dodge and your first attack will be on counter direction from where you jumped to, took me about 15 minutes until I used to the control.But after an hour of playing and see the worldmap, the village, the sidequest and everything. I think my first impression was wrong. I keep playing it for hours and found out that this game is actually highly addictive. I think the problem with me was just happened on first hour of playing, I just didn't get the feel of the game  (well, this also happened to me 14 years ago with suikoden II --but later I beat this game for 10 times, with all characters +best ending without guide)I don't want to say much, to avoid spoiling the game. you better play it yourself :)I recommend this game!

												Have been years I do not appreciate a game like this one; the characters, the storyline, the mood, the humor, the art, everthing on it catched me in a way that made me feel inside the game. I have to admit, in my opnion, the gameplay it self is a little weak, it should had more functionality, not talking about the fight system, it is great, talking more about the game should have more functionalities, at middle of it the gameplay becomes repetitive a bit. But honestly, I don't see such creative, catchy and full of emotion storyline like in that game in years. I really loved the game, the emotion of the characters, the suspense, the fear, the hope... I recommend this game, even for people who does not like that genre of game style. For me, the best thing in this game, is the essence of the storyline that makes you feel real emotioned.I give my most sincere congratulations to everyone who made this game.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an action adventure side scrolling game that has strong story element. If you're looking for the game as such with fair pricing then this is a good one for you.Playing the game from the start to finish is truly a rewarding experience. The story writer knew how to make an engaging background history, to implementing the plot through the game progression (and of course having full voice cast and interesting character developments). And I gotta say, the voice actors did make a wonderful job. They could show that a voice can deliver strong emotion throughout the game. Moreover, the ending truly was well written, and a strong point to playing Dust: AET until the finish.Graphic is is is,.... bad... for furry chars and cartoon haters. Ha. Well no, I'm kidding, the graphic is an incredible touch. I love how they designed the levels and the characters. Dust is cool and tough, Fidget is irritating when she starts to whine but she's especially endearing to see. The animation overall and the level designs are flat out gorgeous, full with lightnings in battle and vibrant colors. Gameplay, though, is a bit too easy and repetitive. Being an 'easy' side scroller platformer, you literally can overwhelm enemies with Fidget + Arrah's combos and that's all you need to win thru the levels. That's with the hardest difficulty btw. Bosses can be a bit tough, but unlike we have seen on other platformers. Once you know how to block and spam the combos, the game's piece of cake. A bit skill is required when playing the challenges - but it's a sidequest anyway.Other Side Quests, sadly, don't offer much added value. There are maybe 20 or so, but none of them are memorable for me. Mainly just give you some small rewards and a joy knowing you've completed what the game has to offer.There's a small RPG element - mainly you can level up Dust (and get him extra HP/stats) and equip armors on him. Blade is not replaceable - you can only arm Arrah, the rest is replaceable. Not much I can say, it's kinda shallow mechanic as there's not enough varieties on armors to make it interesting. Just equip the best ones and you're set.As always, playing with xinput based controller for all Microsoft-related games is recommended. The button mappings feel natural, so there's no need to mess around.Game length is a bit short for my preference - only about 10-15 hours even for completionist. Being short, and of course the major lacking point is replayability. My recommendation would be to pick this game up. Can't go wrong playing Dust - it's one of great indie games that everyone must play.			"

That said, those are tiny nitpicks, and on the whole this is far and away one of my favorite games in my Steam library, amazingly well-done from start to finish.			"

												After just one playthrough, Dust: An Elysian Tail proves to be an absolutely beautiful game with a very satisfying combat system. The amount of destruction you can do by the end of the game is mind-blowing. It's basically an action RPG with the elements of a Metroidvania and it works extremly well. The game is also very user-friendly in terms of sidequests and treasure hunting, making a complete run of the game really fun. I still have a few treasures left to find, but I'm very close. The story is great, the soundtrack is great, and the characters are great. Although, I will say that some cutscenes do go on for a long time. You can skip them, but for anyone who enjoys a good story, there's a ton of dialogue in this game, despite the game being fairly short for an RPG. So, be prepared for that. If I had to say one negative about the game, it's the fact that at times, when there are a ton of enemies and attacks on screen, it's hard to keep track of where you are. This isn't a dealbreaker, but I did die a few times due to now knowing where I was. Overall, if you're looking for a very solid RPG with beautiful art, an engaging story and cathartic combat, look no further than Dust.			"

												First off let's get the obvious stuff out of the way: This game is gorgeous, and the audio is amazing. Okay.Dust surprised me with it's ongoing and expansive story, i really just thought it would be your standard 2D sidescroller (which i was perfectly ok with given it's beauty) but was gifted with this RPG-like story. The voice acting is on par with games like Final Fantasy, and the characters really resonate with emotion and believability. While the gameplay it's self isn't breaking any new ground, it is a solid sidescroller with RPG elements to the character progression. I firmly believe that if Nintendo had had the technology we have today, this is what 90% of the library for the NES would have looked like. It is an instant classic, and a game that i tell dozens of people about per day (i work in a call center and sell more Steam games than i do our own products haha. OOPS.) So take it from me, Tech Support Agent #52146, this game is for you if you ever played a NES game and smiled. Also, if you like cutesy creates.. the nimbat Fidget is just friggin adorable.			"

												Very high on my list of favourite games, if not first.Colorful backgrounds, cute fluffy characters and an amazing story is just a few things I love about this game.I was taken so much by it throughout my play. Wish it was longer, but then maybe it would lose its charm.Combat and leveling simple so it wouldn't take away your focus from the story, but not so dull to get bored by it.Soundrack and voice acting absolutely awesome, gets me so immersed. Double thumbs up for the voice actors for a job amazingly well done.Not sure I would like a sequel though. Although I loved this game so much, I wouldn't mind if it stayed on the first game since it doesn't really feel like it misses anything. Would definitely play another game of this, but can't say I can't wait if it happens.I think almost anyone could find something they like in this game.Also, Fidget, best character ever. :D			"

												10/10I have played this games for hours upon hours now. The graphics, for being such a simple game, are very, very well done. The characters are fun, creative, and delightfully comedic. There is also quite a bit of story to the game.The puzzles are not the most difficult, but they are fun. The game gets progressively more challenging as time goes on, but it is still not difficult to play. So anyone that plays will have a good chance to learn the game while it is still simple enough to play.I love the story, I love the characters, and most of all I love Fidget.(Edit 1/2)As of now, I've completed both Tough and Hardcore mode of the game. I'm deathly in love with the story, and more so with the ending. The challenge in Hardcore is NOT to be underestimated and it is seriously something that demands the utmost effort. The mastery trinkets at the end (the x2 Attack and x2 Defense) I would recommend the Wisdom pendant (x2 Defense) for the sake of surviving against Gaius in Hardcore mode.  Hardcore genuinely presents the most challenge I've had with a game in years.I've put in a total of about 40 hours into this game. There isn't, I confess, much replay value unless you're a challenge ♥♥♥♥♥ and you just really enjoy burning your way through a game on the hardest difficulty. The Lightning attack is probably a bit overpowered, even in Hardcore because of how easy it is to distance-target enemies and just hide on ledges that they can't reach you on when you link it with DUST STORM.All in all, this is my favorite game of 2015. Absolute, hands down. I highly recommend this game. I've played ""big name release"" titles like DMC that present fewer hours of play time than this.			"

												After reading some positive reviews for this game, I decided to pick it up during the Steam Winter Sale and I am glad I did! The core of this game is the fighting and the fighting is great. You will be flying around the maps (literally) swinging your sword hitting enemies. It looks awesome, feels awesome, and is just awesome in every other category. The game also gives you several combos that each have their uses. Your companion, Fidget, also gets a few kool spells that can combo with your sword swinging. To be fair, let's throw in a downside. Fidget's damage is so minute compared to Dust's damage until the very end of the game where items give crazy bonuses to her damage. I really just used her spells for style (and it does stagger enemies for a little bit so that's always helpful). This game also looks beautiful and has great music. However, we need to address the graphics style. The characters are all anthropomorphic animals (I wanna say they most resemble a cross between a dog and a fox?) in an anime style which may turn some people off. Back to the music part, I would look forward to completing an area just to listen to the World Map music.The game has a wide variety of settings to customize to your personal preferences and your computer specs. There were a few moments (mostly towards the end) where my frame rate took a hit but with the amount of particle effects and action going on, it was understandable and it didn't last long. The controls are solid and can be played with a keyboard/mouse or a controller. The game even allows you to switch your input method on the fly and which adjust tooltips accordingly so. Now for a quick lists of things I did not like. - Fidget's damage is lackluster until the latter parts of the game.- You will almost never be at full health. I played on the Tough difficulty and was always around ~25% health the whole game.- Some monsters deal absurd damage (one particular enemy will just snipe you with it's tentacle and pretty much insta-kill you). No matter how much health or defense I had, enemies just seemed to kill me in just 1 or 2 hits.- There are some exploding enemies which resemble Bombs from Final Fantasy which are just annoying.- The healing system is questionable. You have a hotkey for healing items (food) which instantly refill your health. You can spam this button as long as you have enough food to eat. It makes the game very easy if you have ready to eat.- Last one, I promise. In some parts of the game, the camera just seems way too close to Dust. I wouldn't mind it if the camera just moved back a little bit so I can where I am going.(Please note that although these are things I see as problems with the game, the pros FAR outweigh these cons. These issues will rarely take away from the game.)			"

												Dust in one word would be easiest put as a marvel, giving you wonderful extravagant art and animation, a beautiful, well-written story and the perfect amount of adventure and action to scale with it all. It has been for -ever- since I’ve felt this strongly towards a game. If I were to give it a rating I would give it a 10.5/10 for the soul fact that by the end i nearly cried. For anyone that thinks about getting Dust, you won’t regret it in the least, get it while you can.			"

												This game is awesome. The story is full of incredible plot, it's really emotional and you will surely get attached ot the main characters.The game itself handles great, the PC port is brilliant, and the combat is very fluid.It makes up for a long playtime, and great soundtrack to listen to while slicing through enemies.

												10/10 Imo and I'm gonna tell you why.(I especially think it's worth a buy as it holds as much if not morecontent of most $60 single player games)-Graphics-I seen one minor glitch but it didn't hinder gameplay and it only happened once.Elsewise absolutely clean game.So textures vanishing,blur effect spazzing,endless screenshaking glitches.None.Everything blended beautifully and the cutscenes were no different.-Character and development-As much as I'd like to say story,anything that I say can be held as a spoiler relating to story considering you start off completely blind to the ways of this world.But the characters my goodness the development is fantastic.I've never seen such consistant realism in character personality and development in those who change as the story goes.The developer nailed it from amazing voice action,to perfect emotion in every line!Alot of people don't like Fidget but personally she's a favorite.She's only annoying if you don't like comedy reliefs going off things inside the game.Dust,the main character develops dramatically in his own away along side afew characters as you go through.Even Fidget.If you want great characters and story theres a setting in the game for players just playing for the view and...well story.There aren't alot of NPC but there are plenty enough to have their own voice actors,motives and cares.Has a actual ""Village"" feel to opposed to your average ""run to town to shop and leave.""-Combat-Fluent,smooth,extremely responsive.So responsive I went back to afew other games and almost thought I was lagging.On higher difficulties than normal combat is brutal,relentlessly pressuring and even fustrating at some parts because your first move can easily be your last.It doesn't feel like your fighting trashmobs you just run through.Feels more like most these enemies are boss minions.Unless you grind or over powerthem,it's gonna be a nice run for your money.The game does lack a solid defense when can be handled with parry system (holding your light attack to force a clash) or by jump cancelling/dodging.This is beginning stuff so no spoilers ;P It's harsh but it brings out the challenge later game.-Leveling system is fairly simple.you level up and you choose between Fidget,Defence,HP and attack.Matters alot in the beginning because it will define how you fight thingss.Which is great for diversity!It's simple,much like the gear.So you'll spend more time clashing than having your eyes glued to pause menu or wik looking for gear to farm.-Bosses-I know how people feel about it so I'm not gonna name.But...I would normally take a point off for this...yet I'll keep it legit.All but afew bosses felt very easy...like incomplete.Maybe it was my position that trigger a ai to spam 1 move.But I've only died against about 2 bosses.1 of which was my own fualt for being so hasty xD.Maybe I got bad ai that run.But the ones I struggled against was epic.Gotta see it for yourself though,no spoilers :P-Replay Value-In my opinion I say this game has medium/high replay value.Based off how seriously you play this at first.I cleared this 100%.I may someback and do it on the hardest difficulty another day.In the end this game comes out 10/10.It knew what it wanted to be and it was that.It plays great,story is awesome,your promised to lose track of time playing this game with headset on.It's graphics are fantastic and even I have to admit.This is nothing in this game that really complain about except 1 boss...not a spoiler but the boss is artifically difficult on a bull scale.But I dout that'll kill the fun of this chaotic game.I hope the developer does another.

												An excellent play-through.It's good for a solid ten hours, six if you charge right through, and I'm on 18 trying to 100% the game. Still not there.The music is nothing short of amazing, the art style is beautiful and Fidget is the most annoying thing you will ever come to love.The only detriment lies in the animation sequences you trigger from time to time. They just feel sub-par compared to the polish inherent to the rest of it all.All in all, well worth the money.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a game to which I have no bad words to say. It is a 2D hack-n-slash action RPG in which you play as Dust, a somewhat confused warrior with no memory of his past, as he journeys through the land of Falana in search of his identity. The story is well-written, moving, intriguing and exciting right to the end.The combat in Dust is simple but effective, with a depth to it that keeps it from ever growing stale. The enemies, too, are delightfully varied, with many requiring different techniques if you want to fight them effectively.The game is populated by many memorable characters, and all of them have their own superb voice actors and unique personalities. Some of them can seem two-dimensional, yet they are all believable characters, helping to make the vibrant world come to life. Most notable is your constant companion, Fidget - a cute, lovable and entertaining little creature who never annoys and is amazingly helpful, especially towards the end of the game.But what really stands out about Dust is the beautiful environment. Each area has its own aesthetic, perfectly realised by the scenery and complemented by an excellent soundtrack. Moreover, you are encouraged to explore this world, with over twenty side-quests, XP bonuses just for talking to new people and dozens of little secrets littered around the world, some of which are very interesting in their own right.If I had to make one criticism, it would be that the blacksmith is not as useful as she perhaps should be, since her fee for crafting an item is the same as you would get for selling it. However, this is a small complaint, and not one moment of gameplay is a disappointment. I count Dust among the best games I have ever played.			"

												Amazing art! Every once and a while when I was playing, I would just have to take a moment to step back and enjoy looking at it. It has a great mechanics and story too. The last bit of the game was a difficult but well done ending. Having half health for the first half of the game (that is all checkpoints will heal you to) is a little annoying but once you get regen it's much better. The fighting is really fun. You just look at the screen and Dust just goes vwooshzheeooshzoozoosh!			"

												An absolutely beautiful game with fluid animations and solid brawler mechanics.While there is very little in the way of weapon variety, you're still provided with a range of options for taking out enemies from your basic brawler combos to parrying and aerial throws, all of which are animated gorgeously. Despite being limited to one weapon, you do earn additional magic powers and movement skills, such as double jumps and wall clinging, as the game goes on, which help open up new areas to explore places you couldn't before.The majority of the skills you learn in the tutorial will be your bread and butter through a majority of the game. Thankfully, enemies later in the game do test everything you've learnt, so relying on a single tactic won't do you many favours, with some being only vulnerable to parries and others to magic attacks.Combined, the combat looks and feels great and doesn't outstay it's welcome for the 9 to 12 hours it takes to beat the game.The game also borrows a lot from RPGs with a level up system, side quests and a crafting mechanic, allowing you to build upgrades from blueprints dropped by enemies and found in chests. The upgrades usually add an additive or multiplicative effect to stats, item drops or health regeneration, which doesn't occur naturally otherwise.The entire game is fully voiced, which is an impressive feat for an indie title of this size. There are points where the dialogue feels forced, which can be chalked down to a problem with the script at points, but the main cast do a pretty spectacular job with their characters and help compliment the animation work nicely.If you have any experience with videogames in the past at all, I'd highly recommend playing the game on the Tough difficulty setting, as the Normal difficulty is far too forgiving. The Tough difficulty gives you a good reason to buy and use consumables without piling things on enough to make you ever feel overwhelmed.Mentioning the game is programmed and animated by one person is a moot point, but one that's bound to be brought up if you read up on the game on other sites or reviews. The game easily oozes enough quality and polish that, outside some late game cutscenes, you'd never realise or believe one man did all that work over four years.I highly recommned this game so much, that I even spent time writing out a review of this length. Hopefully, it's filled with enough information to make you consider trying it out. :)			"

												A true masterpiece of a game. Dust looks great. has amazing soundtracks, badass and smooth looking combat filled with a ton of effects, precise and well made controls, an interesting story and tons of optional content to explore.Dust itself plays like a highly polished metroidvania game - you make your way through areas, later on you get new moves that allow you to discover optional paths and treasures in areas you have already visited before.During your explorations, you will meet some civilians that offer you sidequests which reward you with additional items and experience points.This, ofcourse, makes Dust stronger in a variety of ways. Experience Points are self explanatory, you collect them and get level ups (level cap is 60), each level up rewards you with one skill gem that can be used to upgrade your health, attack, defense or fidget (fidget is your companion and can be treated like a magical stat).Every skill can be upgraded 15 times, but the game limits you in a way that your highest skill can only be 4 skill levels higher than your lowest one (your defense is on level 1, so you can't upgrade anything else past level 5).This sounds like a big limitation at first, but it helps alot by keeping the game challenging throughout all areas, otherwise you could just max out fidget and oneshot everything while ignoring all other stats.In addition to leveling you can also get stronger by finding / crafting / buying new equipment.Every area has different enemies that drop different items, and every area also has some places where you can buy and sell items. Enemies can also drop material items, those can be used to craft your own gear (if you have the required blueprints which also drop from enemies and from treasure chests).Equipment slots that you can fill are the following : armor, sword augment, amulet, 2x rings.Dust only has his sword in terms of physical damage, and if you equip yourself with a sword augment you will increase your physical damage output. the other items can also provide various other bonus attributes - automated health regen, better chance for item drops, more experience gain etc.The icing on the cake however is the absolutely amazing soundtrack. Rarely do you find a game where the soundtrack adds so much to atmosphere and fun. You enter a new area and listen to the music, and you are just like ""damn, that sounds amazing"". Even with Dust being an extremely colorful game, the music still manages to provide a dark and mysterious atmosphere when needed, which really makes it a joy to play. example track :

Depending on the difficulty level (4 available) you choose, you will get around 10-15 hours of gametime when going for 100% completion - and trust me, you will go for 100%, since the game manages to make backtracking and exploring a lot of fun.No matter who you are, i can only recommend Dust to you. It has been the best game i have played for ages (since the release of Final Fantasy 10 i guess) and you will definitely not regret spending money on this masterfully crafted gem of a game, especially if you like metroidvania games with stylish combat and great music.10/10 would buy again.

												I always love a game with a well-written, compelling story and deep, memorable characters.  This game has them in spades!  I admit in all honesty that the ending to this game nearly made this 40-year-old man cry.  Fidget is absolutely adorable, and Dust himself is a conflicted character with a mysterious past that will surprise any player who loves a good story.The action is fun and varied, with challenging, satisfying combat sequences and some light puzzle-solving.  If I were to take the traditional 2D concept of Metroid and put it into a rich, colorful fantasy world full of anthropomorphic animal characters, I would approach what Dust: Any Elysian Tail has to offer.Moreover, I am still astounded that all of the code and artwork were done by a single developer.  Check out this game!			"

												Wow this game is amazing!It took me 14 hours to beat this game on normal mode (only because I suck at playing games) and it was 14 hours of awesome!   The art and animation was amazing, and even the story was pretty good. I promised myself I wouldn't cry at the end and that was the only thing that kept me from doing so. The enemies are unique and well-developed, and fun to fight (well, most of them are).However, it still has a few bugs, such as pineapples that won't explode, and although a good majority of the controls are really easy to use, some of them are clunky and unintuitive. And the keyboard commands in the inventory screen aren't very user-friendly. But that's me being nit-picky.Overall, this is a VERY good game and if you like story games and action games, this is a good one to play through. Awesome, I loved it.-SG7 ( :) ) "

												What every other Indie game should've been. A fun, exciting and creative idea for a game that strays away from your typical Minecraft/Infiniminer clone and utilizes an art style of its own instead of your typical ""SNES Style"" graphics you'd see in almost every release that other developers churn out and brings out a story line and soundtrack that you'll remember throughout your life. This game maybe another sidescroller fighting game, this game still brings out a challenge to everyone and allows you to find secrets within the game if you're up for it. If you don't feel up for a higher difficulty and rather spend more time on following the storyline, they give you the option for a lower difficulty. For best experience, play it with a controller and not a keyboard. Be careful though, if you're using a certain move too much, you'll take damage. This may be a pain for people (like me) who have a nasty habit of mashing buttons while battling creatures. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for an indie game that doesn't play off the fame of Minecraft and the likes.			"

While the game cannot be replayed after it is beaten, multiple saves can be made to make room so that you can go back and complete side quests. The crafting, which is really easy and useful, is always handy to upgrade Ahrah, your sword, and Fidget, your nimbat ""accomplice."" The story is very indepth and easy to get sucked into, and enjoyable enough for me to listen to the dialouge. I would absolutely recomend this to a friend. Hacking and slashing through waves of enemies is quite... pleasant.			"

												Very polish game. It has great combat and great art.Attacking, launching projectiles, juggling the enemies to keep the combos up, evading if you notice the enemy starting their attack animation, and parrying. These are the essential for combat. And Dust has polished its mechanics to perfection. It's a lot of fun doing all the above. It makes you feel like a badass once you start to get into the rhythm.But its a relatively easy game for action players. I've finished the game in tough mode on my first try. If you've played other action games like Devil May Cry, I'll suggest going straight to tough mode.I'm a completionist, so it took me 15 and a half hours to finish (plus 30 mins to rush a new game on the casual difficulty to get to a certain quest to get 100% achievement). But I've noticed a lot of ways to speedrun this game and I think it can be beaten in less than 5 hours if you don't do the sidequests.Summary: Highly recommended for the great combat. The game is very polished.			"

												OH MY GOD. As a hardened video gamer... I'm openly admitting that this made me cry. This is hands down - One of the best video games I have ever played. Just as good as - portal 2 and the half life series. The work, the artistry, the touch is like a true gem - a full gorgeous landscape with memorable characters. The music is just fantastical and made Dust fully engaging and funny. I've always been a fan of games like this. The story is beautifully told and the emotions that are bought out are just... wow. This game is one that I will cherish forever and will show to my friends.Here is a quote that basically sums up this game for me:""I bought this game not knowing exactly what to expect but it was well worth it. I talk this game up so much and not even I know why! One thing is for sure tho, it hit me right where it counts and my life is changed because of it.""This game has literally put other stories to shame.Again.. It made me CRY.Give this game a shot.			"

												I thought this game was going to be a cringeworthy fur-freak game. Turns out, its not that half bad. The overall quality is great, the music is awesome, animations are smooth, however, the voice acting is just meh. Dust's voice can get really grumbly sometimes for no reason, but it doesn't seem to bother me much. Also, I find myself losing track of Dust, the main character sometimes in giant fights, with all the special effects going at a time, which is probably just my issue.  If you can get past the anthromorphic animal people, its a great enjoyable game that is definately worth it.			"

												This I can say without a doubt is one of the best side scrollers I have played. It's compelling story gives much meaning to pay close attention to the characters and the details. The combat is lovely, with amazing swordplay and detail in your every swing makes it all the better to participate in combat. The graphics are amazing without a doubt and becomes more detailed as you progress along as you're taken through amazing scenes from forests, to caves and mountains. And to finally top it off, would especially be the voice acting, without a clever display of emotions I would not have thought the same about this game as I do now. I recommend this game to others looking for good classic game with an amazing story, graphics and gameplay.			"

												Just a quick note at start: I may forget mentioning something in this review, I played the game over 2 years ago when which was the time when I was not reviewing any games. But now that I started making reviews as a small hobby, I figured I'd review this game too.Anyway, let's get into it:Dust: An Elysian Tail is an amazing game, a masterpiece and one of the best games I've ever played. It's a 2d game (by that I mean there's only left, right, up and down). You're playing as Dust, awakening in a forest, not aware of what happened to you or what you're doing there. You meet a little creature that I would describe as bat-squirrel called Fidget, who will be your companion for the whole game and with her, you set off on an adventure to discover your past. (There's a lot more in the story but I don't want to spoil it)Gameplay:Basically, four directions, left ; right ; down ; up, you are playing with an ancient sword called Ahrah and doing various combos with it by combining different keys, in order to get past your enemies. There's a lot of jumping, timing and precise button combining involved as the game can be sort of hard, BUT, you don't have to worry about that too much, there are a plenty of options, one of them being making yourself revive everytime you die, so basically invincible, if you only want to play for the story or find some part of the game too hard.I played on normal mode and easy (the invincibility one) against the final boss and the game took me 12 hours to beat, not to mention I did not do all the quests and didn't find all the easter eggs. So definitely, a lot of gameplay for the game's price. If you aim for all the achievements on steam it may as well take you around 20-25 hours, if not more.Graphics, design, art:Beautiful. The game looks exactly how it should in my eyes, the backgrounds, character artworks and everything fit the athmosphere. you have a lot of graphic options, even allowing you to move your ""HUD"", being a healthbar on the screen, so many details make the design of the game just perfect.Music is astonishing, I listen to the music creator's tunes to this day over and over, some of the songs are the most beautiful things I've ever heard and I don't think they'll ever get too old.But, the most astonishing thing of that all:The entire game (with the exception of voice acting and similar stuff) has been made by a single person! I know a lot of games made entirely by a single developer, but this is definitely the best one for me.Optimization/Controls:Perfect! I cannot complain about anything there. Can be run on a low tier laptop with no problem and the controls have no flaw.Summary:Pros:- Great story, tears almost rolled down my cheeks because of it after I finished the game (in a good way)- A setting that literally allows you to play the game just for chilling and story- A long gameplay, the main quest will probably take you at least 6 hours if trying to do it as fast as you can on easiest difficulty, if playing in non-invincible mode and wanting to do sidequests it may take something between 10-15 hours. Playing on hardest difficulty and for all the achievements could take around 20-25 hours?- Amazing music pieces- Well-memorable characters all throughout the game- Perfect graphics/art- Flawless gameplay- Great narration- Flawless optimization and controls- Pretty much made by one personCons:- I cannot think of any, haven't seen anything worth criticizing in the gameConclusion & reviewer's final words:If you like stories, games of this type, option to make yourself unbeatable in games, good stories (of course not everyone may see the game's story as good as I thought it is), just generally chilling gameplay combined with great tunes and want to support a talented game developer, then I'd say go for it. If I'm not wrong, this game is fairly often on a bigger discount. I believe I saw it for something like 2,5€ before? Don't take my word for that though, not completely sure about it though. If I knew what to expect of that game before, I would undoubtedly go for it even for its full price, would be worth it for me. Thank you for reading my review and hope you have a good day.			"

												I have to admit, at first, I really didn't like this. Even right through to the end I found the characters and their art and voices to have an extremely amateur flavour. The entire thing seemed like a bog standard furry Flash on Newgrounds. Your companion especially is pretty much godawful throughout, with the occasional humourous quip. However, I persevered, and with a second launch of the game I started to overlook that initial shortcoming and start to get into what is in fact, a very good game. The settings and backgrounds were gorgeous and varied (why couldn't the artist that did that do the characters?) and I also liked the majority of the monster designs. The levels had a satisfyingly open feel with a nice sense of scale and immersion; I especially liked the zombie meadow level. The combat, levelling and crafting systems work well (although my completionist nature did seem to make my character rather overpowered towards the end of the game, making the final boss fight extremely easy), and the game has a decent amount of varied and interesting equipment to kit out your character with. While primarily an action game, I found many of the hidden treasures and their puzzles quite satisfying, and especially liked the secret 'Friends' and their bonuses. The hidden Trials were also quite a lot of fun to master, giving a little bit of extra to the game. I also found the story good with an interesting setup, although suffering from the standard aribtrary development stifling (AKA ""You'll find out later because no reason other than it'll make the story longer"").Overall a good an unique contender in the Metroidvania genre, worth picking up if you're into that sort of game and don't mind the characters and amateurish aspects.

												I could not bring myself not to do a review on pretty much one of my favorite games. This game is one of the best platformers I have ever seem. Or Brawler.. or RPG.. or all of them. It is really mixed on what it is.Now, the fact that, in my opinion, that you are buying a $15 (Or Regional Equivalent) that took 4 years, and only by ONE person.  ONE . (His name is Dean Dodrill, praise him fo what he created)It's backstory in sales that it was an XBLA Title, during the Summer of Sales (Or whatever the hell it was called) and it was ported to PC. Which, most say the PC port is the best because of how much its graphics are better and run smoother. Christ, I even am playing this on a laptop with max settings and it runs just the same with the lower graphics! Pros (Settings): Full on great graphics. Everything is hand-drawn, and the fact that there is just SO much great graphical abilities, it just oozes creativity.Great Controls. The game has easy-to-learn controls. LMB is to attack, RMB is for Dust Storm, MMB is for Fidget's Projectile attack. Don't have a mouse or have one of the worst mouses out there that scurries away before you plug it in? The game also binds a couple of keys on the keyboard when you need them! It also comes with Gamepad Support.Cons (Settings):No ""low"" resolution. It means that if your framerate sucks (Which I doubt it would), it can only be put to normal, and then you have to turn down resolution all together.Now, the gameplay is great. It has one of the tightest responses there is. Breathing on your ""D"" key would make him move mabybe 1/1000 of a millimeter (Not really) And it just has a great system for combat. It is simple, and easy to play.Pros (Gameplay): Easy to learn combat system. It even gives you a move list in the ""How to play"" option.Responsive Controls. Can't explain that further.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Quests. Sure, there are fetch quests, which almost every RPG has, but it does it with a twist, either meaning you have to get a certain ability or you have to defeat a certain enemy and hope they drop. Or, if you are like me, you cataloug every material you have.Catalouging System. This system is simple. Sell a material that vendors don't have Catalouged, come back later, more of that come in. There are 42 items to cataloug in all, ranging from rare drops from strong enemies, to extermely common, *cough* Maggots *cough*, and easy-to-find ones.Pretty much a 3 basic attack system. 3 basic attacks. Swordplay, Fidget's Projectiles, and both combined using Dust Storm.Cons (Gameplay):A buggy ""No Escape"" system. What happens is that if a group of enemies are nearby, you can't move on to the next area until you kill them. Which is good, but the fact that you can just do a perfectly-timed Dash and go through it.Lack of weapons. Your only weapons are Ahrah and Fidget's Attacks, no bows or shotguns, or special little bombs. This is 45% good, 55% bad, as for the fact that enemies can kill you in the air or with cheap high-damage attacks with no block ability.The Story is a great narritive. It truly is. It's not a yiff and anthro fanfic like most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would expect, but instead it is a great story of loss, death, and redemption. I rarely see how even the character is actually something else than he thinks.Pros (Story):A highly believeable story. This story is actually like as if you knocked your head on something, went into a coma, had terrible amnesia, remembered your bad deeds (or at least what you think you did), and redeem yourself for what you did.The furry/anthro undertone can be removed and nearly nothing would be changed but the mood. Things are usually explained. As I mean this, either what happens is explained through dialouge, notes, or the unfolding story. I.e. There is a large enemy known as a ""Trolk"", and they ae explained that they can only be killed by stunning them, mainly because how thick their skin and sheilds are.Cons (Story):Independent Voices. This is only reflecting the bad of it, which is the microphone and recording quality. They are actually different, some are obviously extremely far from their microphone, while others are actually talking in the right sense.No real ""Choices"". The only choices you really get are that, in a side quest, you choose to add poison ivy to an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s clothes. (Either way is an achievement). Sure, there is only a ""Good"" ending, but that means what would be the bad? Overall Score:9.5/10This game comes so close to being perfect. It really does. It is just annoying that you can't really feel fully immersed if the guy you are speaking to sounds like he talks in a very soft manner for a large person, or that it caught a small background noise. This game isn't meant for speed running, hence why some mechanics are in place. I truly recommend you buy this, because this is a masterpeice of a game.			"

												This game was a huge pleasant surprise. Got it as part of a bundle, played it when my internet went down.The characters are likable and fairly well-rounded. I thought fidget would be annoying, but it turns out not so. The plot was good up until the last 10% of the game, at which point I thought it could be better.The combat was fun, even though I always tended to do the same thing to clear the screen of enemies in 5 seconds.I played on normal, and only died a few times at the beginning, but harder difficulties might have made the game too long. I was getting bored of the combat in the last hour or so, so it was a good thing I chose to play on normal.It's definitely a good one-time game.7/10			"

												Not too accustomed to writing reviews, so forgive me if something seems shortsighted or off-kilter here.That being said, I feel the need to give this game the recognition it deserves. It isn't often that a game comes along and leaves me with my mouth agape, shocked at the ratio of quality to manpower given to bring something to fruition. It was basically a one-man job, with a few exceptions to music, voice-acting and parts of the writing. This is not a game that makes you think that at all.Beautiful, strong, crisp, varied, colorful aesthetic that leads to gorgeous graphics. Music that evokes that classic, childlike sense of wonder of exploring, excitement, and adventure. Every time I would just bring up the map screen to teleport to a different area, it's evoke a powerful sense of nostalgia from me.Combatwise, everything is done with a blade and elemental ranged attacks, with ways to mix and match them all together. It's basically like a side-scrolling, platforming brawler with a nice degree of variation on enemy types and available tactics on taking them down.The story starts off somewhat simple, and feels like it's treading familiar territory for a little while, but quickly becomes more complex as it goes on. I won't give any spoilers, but needless to say, I wasn't expecting the game to do what it did later on, close to the finish.If I have any nitpicks, they are few. The lip-synching on the characters is a bit off, without much difference between the few mouth movements available. The voice-acting, while quite good overall, tends to give certain characters voices that don't quite fit, in addition to there being rather uneven sound quality amongst the performances. Still, these are both very minor issues, and I stopped noticing them after a while. It's just something I thought I should mention.Honestly, I could go on with this, but I don't want to keep you waiting. Overall, Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the best games I've played in quite a while. It was a stellar experience, and I think that anyone who is able to make a game like this almost by themselves definitely deserves support. I recommend it to just about anyone.			"

												Developing video games is tough, even from the outside that seems obvious. It's not impossible, but it's one hell of a challenge, one that takes patience, time and talent to name just a few of the requirements to make it in the industry. So designer Dean Dodrill's accomplishments with Dust: An Elysian Tail is one to be applauded. Having developed the vast majority of this charming action adventure game himself, it's clear throughout that this is Dean's baby, resulting in a game that's beautiful, fun and one of the most captivating 2D side-scrollers I've played in years.Dust: An Elysian Tail tells the story of Dust, a being with little knowledge of his past or his own identity. He's Awaken from slumber by a talking floating sword called Ahrah and the swords protectorate Fidget, a flying bat slash cat creature thing. This strange partnership must band together to help Dust figure out both his past and future in the lands of Falana, which have been beaten down by the terrors and horrors of war. For a story, it's one that nicely contrasts against much of the games visual design and isn't afraid to touch on some mature story points from the death and killing of innocents to the terrible physical and mental impact of war on those that survive it. I found myself surprised by the direction taken by the story till the very end and it's an area of the game that held strong throughout resulting in a story that benefits in developing the world as much as it keeps the tale chugging along.Now upon it's release Dust received some criticism for its art style, which to some degree I can understand. It's most certainly not an ugly game by any regard, the wonderful 2D landscapes are gorgeous with an impressive level of attention given to almost every level of the game, but some might find themselves turned off by the furry like characters that popular the lands of Falana. Personally I was charmed with it's interesting cast of characters all voiced to an high degree resulting in a world that's more interesting than you'd think it had any right to be. Dust's small but useful sidekick Fidget in particular is an high point thanks to some great dialogue and cute voice work by Kimlinh Tran. It all results in an high level of polish that you can't help but admire considering the time and effort put in by the mainly one man development team.An action packed side-scroller, Dust is primarily inspired by the likes of Castlevania and Metroid with it's walled off sections that make traversal and map navigation part of the challenge. Anyone who's spent time with the genre will feel right at home here thanks to the fact that navigation is a breeze and finding all those treasures and secrets as always been part of the real fun with these sorts of games. An Elysian Tail is no different and while you'll be traveling a large variety of regions, you'll find himself traveling back to lands you've already visited in search of treasures that were once inaccessible to you. On his journey Dust will have access to new and varied powers that can be used to discover and access these treasures and even be used in combat. The powers range from the ability to slide under walls to secondary jumps to be able to double jump and reach higher points in the landscape. What's great about all these powers is that there just as effective in combat as they are when platforming.Falana is a land filled with a nice variety of baddies to swing your magical sword at and thankfully combat remains fun for the most part, even if I did find myself button mashing most of the time. Enemies will reappear if you exit and reenter an area so it's possible to grind your skills and levels if you wish. One note I'd add is that on normal, Dust can be a little to easy and whilst there are a few challenges here and there, it's not exactly a difficult game so you might want to consider playing are a harder difficulty level if that's your thing. Leveling up and enhancing skills is a fun addition, as is the ability to craft and equip new items to wear, although some might find crafting items becomes a nuisance once you near the end. All that said, every gameplay mechanic at work plays well together resulting in an highly polished experience and one I had fun with until the very end.So Dust: An Elysian Tail is an impressive achievement by Dean Dodrill and his team of various contributors in the two years of development. It's an impressive achievement because you wouldn't guess that the majority of it's development was worked on by only one man. Rich in content, visually beautiful and sounding great, not to mention a story that's more memorable than you've come to expect from the genre, it all results in a game I'd highly recommend you play for yourself, even if you're turned off by the character designs. Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the most charming games I've played in quite a while. "

												tl:dr - BUY IT.I'm a gamer for more than 15 years and this is one of my favorite games of all time.Graphics - Absolutely gorgeous. Music fits the graphics. Fighting system is simple but very enjoyable. It's fast, easy (From complexity standpoint) and visually appealing (everything explodes, shines, combos goes up to few hundrets). It's a metroidvania with a light RPG elements. Story is kinda generic, but it's satisfying, The only problem I had was how the characters looks like. Enemies looks relatively good, but NPC have that very cheap furry/cartoon style. I would rather like to see more ""direct furry approach"" or at least better quality of them  (shading, color pallete, more details, etc.). The only good looking NPC is Fidget (that flying cat/bat thingy... She's a Nimbat.). Characters are very good written. Oh, and Fidget is The Cutest character in video game I've ever seen. A want a plushie of her :3  (so I can keep her foreveeerrr....) 	 Anyway, Game took me about 13h to fully complete it, it's relatively hard on ""hard difficulty"", I haven't encountered any bugs or errors. I was playing it on Windows XP (Steam says it requires Vista/7). No slowdowns. In other words - Works good. Nothing much to say, really. It's a fantastic game, you should go and buy it. It's definitely worth your money.			"

												So, where do I start... Possibly amongst the best games I've ever played in my entire life. It has some minor flaws, including a bug in the final boss fight which forces you to fight the boos all over again but other than that it's a masterpiece, a well polished PC port and a fine work of art. The soundtrack is relaxing and fits the game atmosphere very well. The combat is surprisingly satisfying, it combines brawling with hack and slash, in other words I can say that this is a Metroidvania ARPG Brawler. The combos are pretty good and the attack variety is somehow doesn't have alot of variety but it doesn't feel boring. The story is pretty great and overall that sells this game for me. I'm sure that pretty much anyone can enjoy this game and if you don't feel like paying full price for it, wait for a sale and then get it. I got it during a 50% sale but now I can safely say that the game is worth the full price, but this is only a matter of opinion. That said, please buy and play this, support the developer and MAYBE in the future there will be more games like this one.			"

												Adventuring into an epic tale of amazing sword skills and great action in this thrilling indie game! It is however full of furries, even if you're not into that, don't let it scare you away, or you'll be losing out on a very beautifully crafted game that has a lovely unique experience to offer! If you like your metroidvania's, then this is a must have! No exceptions.			"

												This game is absolutly amazing. When this came out of the Xbox 360 I continously hoped it would come to PC and now here it is. The story, the characters, the gameplay. It all comes together to give you an expence unlike any other. I can not recommend this game enough. Get it and play it.			"

												One of my favorite Steam games, and an adictive one at that. I beat it, and now need to go back to play it a few more times. While the game cannot be replayed after it is beaten, multiple saves can be made to make room so that you can go back and complete side quests. The crafting, which is really easy and useful, is always handy to upgrade Ahrah, your sword, and Fidget, your nimbat ""accomplice."" The story is very indepth and easy to get sucked into, and enjoyable enough for me to listen to the dialouge. I would absolutely recomend this to a friend. Hacking and slashing through waves of enemies is quite... pleasant.			"

												This is the story of Dust: An Elysian Tail.Your name is Dust. You are a furry that questions his (its?) sexuality. You meet another flying furry named Fidget and a flying sword and that sword tells you that the last party was ""intense"". You go to Aurora village and ♥♥♥♥ everything that has a hole because that's what furries do.Oh no wait, that's the story of a furry fan fiction I've read on the internet. But it's close enough. This game has furries, RPG elements, stylish fighting and wobbly character portraits. 8/10.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a game to which I have no bad words to say. It is a 2D hack-n-slash action RPG in which you play as Dust, a somewhat confused warrior with no memory of his past, as he journeys through the land of Falana in search of his identity. The story is well-written, moving, intriguing and exciting right to the end.The combat in Dust is simple but effective, with a depth to it that keeps it from ever growing stale. The enemies, too, are delightfully varied, with many requiring different techniques if you want to fight them effectively.The game is populated by many memorable characters, and all of them have their own superb voice actors and unique personalities. Some of them can seem two-dimensional, yet they are all believable characters, helping to make the vibrant world come to life. Most notable is your constant companion, Fidget - a cute, lovable and entertaining little creature who never annoys and is amazingly helpful, especially towards the end of the game.But what really stands out about Dust is the beautiful environment. Each area has its own aesthetic, perfectly realised by the scenery and complemented by an excellent soundtrack. Moreover, you are encouraged to explore this world, with over twenty side-quests, XP bonuses just for talking to new people and dozens of little secrets littered around the world, some of which are very interesting in their own right.If I had to make one criticism, it would be that the blacksmith is not as useful as she perhaps should be, since her fee for crafting an item is the same as you would get for selling it. However, this is a small complaint, and not one moment of gameplay is a disappointment. I count Dust among the best games I have ever played.			"

 Dust: An Elysian Tail  Story and Characters: 9/10 Dust: AET has one of the most engaging stories I've ever had the pleasure to experience. Characters are varied and all have some special quirks that make them all memorable. The dialogues in this game have these ""quirks"" just the right amount to make these characters seem more like individuals that you are interested in rather than just a squad of generic beings that you come across and smash A to skip the dialogue as fast as you can. Voice acting is great overall but at times could be heard that some of the voices weren't necessarily by a well-known professional, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but definitely noticable. Gameplay: 8/10 There is not much to say about the gameplay. Quite generic ""smash buttons until baddies disappear"". There is a special ""move"" called DUST STORM that you get quite early on and that is probably what you'll be spamming for the next 8 hours or so. I played the game on NORMAL difficulty and I would suggest NORMAL for this game if you're looking to play it for the story, since it has some of the epic moments of ""Oh god. I'm gonna die soon but so is the enemy"" but it also makes moving between areas easier and more relaxed since you don't have to spend 10 minutes per group of enemies. Graphics: 8.5/10 This game isn't filled with a billion small particle effects or four tons of bloom and still managed to amaze me in nearly every area I went to. The cutscenes have a charming hand-drawn look to them that is beautifully executed and that makes them nothing to sneeze at. Music: 10/10 Down right amazing. The music always fit the feeling I had while playing. Epic soundtrack. Can't say much more than that.You'll most likely get 8-12 hours out of the campaign but will probably get 20+ hours if you plan to 100% everything and get all achievements (I don't know for sure, haven't done that yet) . Overall: 9/10 This is definitely a game that I will remember and will most likely play through again in the future. I'd definitely say this is one of the best games I've played recently, and even one of the best I've ever played. Even though the gameplay aspect becomes quite frustratingly repetitive towards the end, the story kept my interest in the game very high. I definitely suggest picking this up if you're looking for an engaging story-driven game with beautiful visuals that is not too hard for a casual gamer.			"

												What every other Indie game should've been. A fun, exciting and creative idea for a game that strays away from your typical Minecraft/Infiniminer clone and utilizes an art style of its own instead of your typical ""SNES Style"" graphics you'd see in almost every release that other developers churn out and brings out a story line and soundtrack that you'll remember throughout your life. This game maybe another sidescroller fighting game, this game still brings out a challenge to everyone and allows you to find secrets within the game if you're up for it. If you don't feel up for a higher difficulty and rather spend more time on following the storyline, they give you the option for a lower difficulty. For best experience, play it with a controller and not a keyboard. Be careful though, if you're using a certain move too much, you'll take damage. This may be a pain for people (like me) who have a nasty habit of mashing buttons while battling creatures. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for an indie game that doesn't play off the fame of Minecraft and the likes.			"

The story, gameplay, and the artistic appeal of the game is what really makes Dust: An Elysian Tail a unique, RPG experience. The reason I bought this game is because the combat and art looks a lot like what Vanillaware would create (the developers who made Odin Sphere, Muramasa: The Demon Blade, and Dragon's Crown), which made me an instant buyer at first glance.If your into awesome combat, beautiful story line, and an amazing art style, then this game is definitely for you.

												Just a quick note at start: I may forget mentioning something in this review, I played the game over 2 years ago when which was the time when I was not reviewing any games. But now that I started making reviews as a small hobby, I figured I'd review this game too.Anyway, let's get into it:Dust: An Elysian Tail is an amazing game, a masterpiece and one of the best games I've ever played. It's a 2d game (by that I mean there's only left, right, up and down). You're playing as Dust, awakening in a forest, not aware of what happened to you or what you're doing there. You meet a little creature that I would describe as bat-squirrel called Fidget, who will be your companion for the whole game and with her, you set off on an adventure to discover your past. (There's a lot more in the story but I don't want to spoil it)Gameplay:Basically, four directions, left ; right ; down ; up, you are playing with an ancient sword called Ahrah and doing various combos with it by combining different keys, in order to get past your enemies. There's a lot of jumping, timing and precise button combining involved as the game can be sort of hard, BUT, you don't have to worry about that too much, there are a plenty of options, one of them being making yourself revive everytime you die, so basically invincible, if you only want to play for the story or find some part of the game too hard.I played on normal mode and easy (the invincibility one) against the final boss and the game took me 12 hours to beat, not to mention I did not do all the quests and didn't find all the easter eggs. So definitely, a lot of gameplay for the game's price. If you aim for all the achievements on steam it may as well take you around 20-25 hours, if not more.Graphics, design, art:Beautiful. The game looks exactly how it should in my eyes, the backgrounds, character artworks and everything fit the athmosphere. you have a lot of graphic options, even allowing you to move your ""HUD"", being a healthbar on the screen, so many details make the design of the game just perfect.Music is astonishing, I listen to the music creator's tunes to this day over and over, some of the songs are the most beautiful things I've ever heard and I don't think they'll ever get too old.But, the most astonishing thing of that all:The entire game (with the exception of voice acting and similar stuff) has been made by a single person! I know a lot of games made entirely by a single developer, but this is definitely the best one for me.Optimization/Controls:Perfect! I cannot complain about anything there. Can be run on a low tier laptop with no problem and the controls have no flaw.Summary:Pros:- Great story, tears almost rolled down my cheeks because of it after I finished the game (in a good way)- A setting that literally allows you to play the game just for chilling and story- A long gameplay, the main quest will probably take you at least 6 hours if trying to do it as fast as you can on easiest difficulty, if playing in non-invincible mode and wanting to do sidequests it may take something between 10-15 hours. Playing on hardest difficulty and for all the achievements could take around 20-25 hours?- Amazing music pieces- Well-memorable characters all throughout the game- Perfect graphics/art- Flawless gameplay- Great narration- Flawless optimization and controls- Pretty much made by one personCons:- I cannot think of any, haven't seen anything worth criticizing in the gameConclusion & reviewer's final words:If you like stories, games of this type, option to make yourself unbeatable in games, good stories (of course not everyone may see the game's story as good as I thought it is), just generally chilling gameplay combined with great tunes and want to support a talented game developer, then I'd say go for it. If I'm not wrong, this game is fairly often on a bigger discount. I believe I saw it for something like 2,5€ before? Don't take my word for that though, not completely sure about it though. If I knew what to expect of that game before, I would undoubtedly go for it even for its full price, would be worth it for me. Thank you for reading my review and hope you have a good day.			"

												I played this during school, 21 hours and counting (was in offline mode). This is truly, one of the few 2D games I've really played and enjoyed. The story, gameplay, and the artistic appeal of the game is what really makes Dust: An Elysian Tail a unique, RPG experience. The reason I bought this game is because the combat and art looks a lot like what Vanillaware would create (the developers who made Odin Sphere, Muramasa: The Demon Blade, and Dragon's Crown), which made me an instant buyer at first glance.If your into awesome combat, beautiful story line, and an amazing art style, then this game is definitely for you.

												Dust: AET is quite possibly one of my favourite games of all time.  If not the number 1 spot.For me, the game blends beautiful visuals with a compelling storyline, with great characters, cracking gameplay, and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard from an indie title to boot.It's not the longest game in the world, but you can stretch it if you love to get immersed and want to play it for all achievements (which, by design, will take a couple playthroughs anyway).  At times, the voicework is a little... wooden, but never really anything that will absolutely take you out of the story if you're having fun.I can't recommend it enough, huge props to Dean Dodrill for creating this work of art.

												Dust is fantastic. A friend showed me the game long ago when it first came out, and I just recently got it for myself on this account. Getting to finally go through the game in full is awesome. The gameplay is simple, but still has plenty of flexibility between the swordplay and the magic. The art is fun, and the voice acting isn't so bad! Particularly the characters who 'matter'. Obviously many side characters don't have as much focus, but Dust, especially Fidget, Ahrah, and Haley are amazingly well voiced. And the many references are a lot of fun too.Did I mention Fidget is the best character ever? Because she is.			"

												Let me start by saying I cried twice while playing this game. The second time it took me a while to stop.Never before have i played a game with a story so strong and heart-tugging that i had to constantly stop just to take a deep breath.Dust: An Elysian Tail is a side-scrolling adventure like no other. The character development. voice work, and plot are so prefected i can't even begin to describe it.The gameplay is smooth and flawless. While yes, you can only have one sword (It's essential to the plotline), its one hell of a sword. The enemies, minibosses and bosses are colorful and unique, and through my 10 hours of playing my first game i never stopped experimenting with combo's. (That 1000 point combo.... damn!)Your little companion, Fidget, has to be the most adorable character i've ever seen in a game of this type. I fell i love with her sarcasm and tough-girl act immediately. Her range moves also helped me through many a tough spot. But really the main reason i like having her around is becuase i can always count on her to make me smile in the darker parts of the game.This game may be rated E, but thats a stretch. Some moments in this game really play your heart strings. Like i said before, i cried twice, and i dont cry often. The story makes this game, it really does.The item and shop system is a masterpiece. I found myself returning to familiar places to collect up on new supplies to sell, trade and send to the blacksmith for better stuff. There are hundreds of items from sword augments to armor to food (Don't eat the Mysterious Wall Chicken. It's mysterious.) to jewelry. The soundtrack hit spot on in this game. I did, more than once, find myself standing still on a level just to hear the beautiful, spooky, or just plain awesome music.The average playthrough of this game is about 10 hours. That;s how long it took me. If you rush you could probably do it in 8. if you take the time to do all the side quests and collect all the best items you could be at this game for 50 hours or more.It's worth it though. NOTE: Once you complete the game, you cannot return to the world. make sure you do everything you want to BEFORE you take on the ending.This game is (If played in normal or higher) not a cake walk. It's a hard game that challenges you to experiment and get creative. There are moments where you will be gritting your teeth. The final boss battle was so intense i was off my chair. (If you play on casual, the game is MUCH more relaxed, since the death sysem reverts to a ""Lose EXP, but keep playing"" system.)As far as visuals go: My god. The game is beautifully crafted. Never before have i seen a side-scroller quite like this. It's just breathtaking, it really is.All in all, this game is a masterpiece that deserves far more attention than it gets. Buy it now, i promise you you will not be sorry.10/10			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an elegant masterpiece.I actually bought this game on a mere whim, when I felt I wanted to try a new game, and this was on sale, so I decided to give it a shot. That has turned out to be one of the best game purchases of my life.So, why should you buy Dust: An Elysian Tail?First, the beautifully hand-crafted art is to die for. Second, as an action-packed platformer, the combat system is easy to learn but hard to master. You'll take awhile before you learn how to snag achievements like That's More Like It (Successfully complete a 1000+ hit combo) and The Stuff of Legends (Earn a Four-Star Rating in EVERY Challenge Arena), which makes it that little bit sweeter when you do.Third, apart from it's main storyline, there are many side-quests and secret locations to conquer and discover. Looking to uncover them all? Don't stop at 100% completion, it goes up to 117% completion. Amen.Last, but certainly not least, is the compelling storyline. There is a fine balance between humour and drama. You'll be hooked to follow the storyline up till the grand finale.Your parents probably told you to never talk to strangers, but I need you to trust me and do yourself a favour by purchasing and playing this game. You have no idea what you're missing out on if you don't.			"

												I'm not very far into Dust: An Elysian Tail yet, but my first impression is that this game is beautiful, to put it simply. The artwork, character design, and level design are created with a level of detail that is breathtaking. Mechanics wise, this game flows well. There are several different ways of playing: with an Xbox controller, keyboard, or mouse and keyboard - I went with the final choice. It does feel slightly ""button mash-y,"" but the game still requires a level of skill and adaptation, as there are several different combos and attacks that can be used with different combinations of keys.Overall, this game is worth every penny that you would spend on it. I can say this with confidence after only playing the game for 35 minutes. Oh, and that number won't stay at 35 for long.			"

												Dust an Elysian Tail is a wonderfully constructed game that I would recommend for anyone who has the cash to spare. Right of the bat you are immersed into a bright, colorful world with environments that are ever changing.The voice acting is superb and  helps really breathe some life into those whacky animal-like characters that are littered throughout the entire game. As far as replayability value goes there are different difficulty settings and the level up system forces you to spec your hero in certain ways, adding weight to each point you spec with. The game has over 20 different sidequests each with there own different challenges assuring the player that they will never be bored. Slap an entertaining plot ontop of the above and you get Dust.Overall I give it a 8/10 Graphics +Content +Replayability +- "

												I played through the game on Hardcore difficulty and enjoyed it. This is one of the best Indie games I have played. It has amazing artwork, great sence of humour and intersting characters. The story keeps you interested and you will want to know what will happen next, who is everybody and why things are happening. There are some references from other games (some are very well hidden) but not too hard to find if you use your head. Some negative points worth noting:I used xbox 360 controller to play and sometimes found that using analog stick to perform certain actions might cause you to do the wrong move. This is really annoying when you try to do trials where time and precision is crucial. I failed so many times when my character jumped instead of ducking and sliding or vice versa. I do however recommend playing with a controller even though keyboard and mouse works great, controller is still better.You will probably want to play it once because once you know the story there will be no point in playing again so if you played on casual you are simply wasted your time because it was too easy and you can finish it in few hours. There are, however, 25 sidequestes which you can complete and you won't get all achievements unless you do them all.Difficulty curve is not ideal. On harcode mode is really hard to start that will cause you to die over and over until you reach some levels or keep killing same enemies over and over. Later on it when you level up and get some items it becomes too easy. Simply be patient and you will enjoy the game without any annoying issues.Overall it is great game that is worth your time. I spent over 30 hours and got all the achievements.			"

The artwork is fantastic, the characters are all loveable, everything is properly balanced and the storyline is as rock solid as it comes.  But, those aren't what had me so enrwrapped in this game.  The emotional rollercoaster that this game puts the player through marks this as one of my all time favorite games.  The high and low moments that lead up to the ending scene leave the player cherishing all of those good moments and snarky conversations.The only thing else I can say is to buy it, buy it, buy it!  Seriously, I don't think I could stress enough that if you don't already own this game you're missing out on a fantastic story.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail looks a little different than your typical action/adventure game, but its similarities should keep you around for a while.The game begins with you, ""Dust"" waking up to find yourself in a forest with no memory of your past or how you ended up at your location. As if it wasn't strange enough, a magical sword finds you and speaks to you, followed by a small, annoying creature. They accompany you on a journey to find who you are, why you awoke with no memory, and why you were chosen to wield a magical sword.Presentation: 8/10The story isn't groundbreaking but is enough to get anyone to wonder what's in store for a protagonist with amnesia as he travels through the country. Dust is a kind character, who helps those he can (if you complete the quests) until he finds his past. The game adequately tells the tale from start to finish, but you can never really tell how much of an impact you're making by the end.Graphics: 7.5/10Cute cartoon artstyle settles well and takes your mind off the fact that Dust: An Elysian Tail was designed and programmed by a single individual.Sound: 7.5/10The pleasant music never stuck itself in places unneeded, a good addition overall. The voice acting was good for some characters, but never made Fidget any less annoying.Gameplay: 8/10Fluid, fast-paced and with different options to attack your enemies, the combat was well received. There are many items to acquire, along with the secret non-playable characters hidden throughout the game. My only gripe is the hideous transitioning of the camera as you fly through the map.Overall: 7.8/10A good purchase if you're looking for some action/adventure. With only limited replayability, the game can keep you busy for several days before you find yourself with not much else to do, but for a well-polished game, its price is definitely worth it.			"

												This game wasn't quite what I expected.  It's one of those titles where the enemies are pretty tough & do a lot of damage, but are slow and telegraph their attacks.  Your character, on the other hand, is fragile and doesn't hit very hard, but can attack with great rapidity.  So, your only chance of winning (esp. on the higher difficulties) is to keep your foes stunlocked  with an all-out assault, chaining hits and special moves together to never give them an opening.  As I've stated before, I don't really like fighting games, where you have to pull off specific key combinations with millisecond timing.  This is pushing things a little, but I was still able to use the combos they had programmed in, which is fortunately not that many.  This does limit the depth of the system and mean the combats can get very same-y after a while, though.So, it feels kind of incongruous.  Your protagonist is basically a walking abattoir, chewing through monsters with gusto.  Except he's also supposed to be a rabbit, I guess?  And all the other characters are cartoon animals too?  The story similarly veers back and forth between srs bzns and light-hearted banter.  It doesn't help matters that the game is one of the worst offenders in the Cutesy Sidekick That Never Shuts Up category.The art and animation are top-notch, considering this is a small-budget title.  It's not quite up there with the Odin Spheres of the world, but damn close.  The whole game is a bit on the short side, and probably much shorter still if you don't bother  hunting down all the sidequests and collecting everything.  That said, I had a lot of fun with it, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action-RPGs.			"

												Great game! Even after playing for a few min I could tell this would be awesome. This game is a 2D wonder, easy to get going without hours of practice and can keep you busy for hours. Graphics are great, music is awesome and repeating levels (to get all achievements & treasures) is a pleasure. I started off playing the game in “normal” difficulty. I am about to start again in the “hardcore” difficulty now just to get the final achievement.Definitely worth adding this game to your collection.			"

I don't really care, but the thing that sells this game to me is the sheer determination of the development for this game.  It's a long story, so do some research yourself.  Great animations, likeable characters, and an amazing soundtrack.  Truly an experience.			"

												A Metroidvania with RPG elements. Visually, the game is amazing, bringing gorgeous graphics and animation, excellent gameplay. However, it has (so far) a clichéd story we've seen several times before, delivering yet another amnesiac protagonist, which is the game's weakest point (really, we don't need another of those)...But that being just one low point, this game is still very much recommended, especially if you're a Metroidvania fan. As an extra recommendation, ignore Easy and Normal difficulty modes entirely and start playing on Tough for your first playthrough. It's the one I started on, and it seems to deliver a good balance, being challenging at times but not to the point of being unfair.And if you need something more to convince you, it has Mysterious Wall Chicken.

												This game is great! If you wanted a short answer...you're welcome! This game is a story driven action platformer with many ninja like battle skills.Mostly made by ONE MAN!  Now for specifics:  Over 90% of this game was made by one guy!!! This game has a wonderful, magical soundtrack. (Truly memorable to me.) The characters are well written, but some of the ""fringe characters"" has amature voice actors. Main characters still sound very nice! Battle animations worthy of a good TV cartoon! Vibrant...is how to sumarize the setting. Even includes rescuing heros from other games who then hang out with you in a secret hide out! 9 out of 10			"

												It's so hard to believe that this beautiful game was constructed from the ground up by the hand of a single individual over the course of nearly five years of his life as a passion project. Smooth animation, amazing sound quality, beautiful artwork style and music tracks, responsive controls, and brilliant gameplay. This game is the shining example of what the indie community is capable of doing. This game in indie game standards is nearly 100% perfect. The voice acting in the game is not as bad as people may claim it to be. Granted at some times during cutscenes, some voices are a little hard to listen to at times, meaning its not the best but its not bad by any means. The art style choice of the game may give some thick-skulled individuals on the internet a bad first impression. People should look at the art design as NOT being a nod to the furry community, but rather look at it as what the art choice was for some early Disney films like Robin Hood or Lion King. This game caters to several game genres including RPGs, Metroidvanias, hack & slash or beat em' ups, platformers, and even puzzle games.There is no reason why anyone should have to miss out on this incredible expierence. Whether its on sale or at full price, this game will show you that its worth every last penny. There is only one complaint I can honestly say about this game. Though it has several difficulty settings, if you are familiar and well-aquainted with Beat em up side scroller games than this game can be very easy for some of you. The only time the game can be honestly challenging to everyone is on the hardest difficulty setting. Other than that one complaint, the game is sheer perfection. If you buy this game, you will not regret it.			"

												I discovered this game from a friend. The artwork looked fantastic, the setting and story sounded fun, and the game play seemed like a classic nod to Metroid and Castlevania. Started playing and was instantly hooked! The controls were smooth and intuitive, game mechanics were fun and familiar, and there were some delightful surprises along the way too. Game length is a little short, but what's here is so incredible that I don't mind. I'd rather play a short game that hits all the right notes than sink 100+ hours into something passable. And speaking of notes... the soundtrack rivals the art in terms of beauty. This is easily one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time. I highly recommend it and will definitely be revisiting it from time to time.			"

The combos you can execute may be few, but a proper combination, and some patience, will see that you get through a level without damage.Fans of side scroller hack and slash and other hack and slash games should consider buying this game.

It's something I wasn't expecting from a game like this, so that was a nice surprise!The difficulty is really balanaced and exploring and finding treasure in the game is rewarding as well.

The story was alright, I thought it became a little predictable after a while.  The gameplay was very good.  I played with the keyboard only controls and didn't have any problems.  Combat is fairly simple, I found myself just executing the same combo's after a while, but the game does attempt to throw you off with differing enemy types in each new area.  The puzzles were somewhat simple, but well executed.  Another nice thing is it runs fairly well on older computers/laptops.			"

												After playing video games (both on consoles and home computers) for over 27 years, it's not very often I come across a game that actually impresses me; Dust: An Elysian Tail just so happened to surprisingly become one of those experiences.  I'm not going to rate this game on a 10-scale, or point out its cons and pros, or even give you a play by play of the game mechanics, story, etc, etc.  No, just know this: if you were born in the 80's or early 90's (because of nostalgia) and like atmospheric, approachable yet challenging, heart-tugging, and inspiring games (because this game was basically made by one dude!), then you will be ever-so grateful that you picked up this unique treasure!

												Step into the shoes of Dust, another hero with amnesia, and travel a Metroidvania-esque world to slay monsters, talk to NPCs and find hidden treasures!The gameplay is, all in all, rather simple. You run around, jump and kill a lot of stuff. You kill stuff by swinging your talking sword and employing the abilities of your flying squirrel-thingy Fidget, which sometimes bears resemblance to such annoying sidekicks like Navi from the Legend of Zelda.The fighting itself is pretty simple. Your standard attack is a 3-hit combo, on the ground and in the air. Combine with your special ability and your sidekick you create some nice combos. You will also learn some new moves along your way, but they're primarily for traversing the world, which - in best Metroidvania-manner - has a lot of places you can't get through until you have the ability needed for it.If you want to explore and get absolutely everything, you'll have to do a LOT of backtracking, but you can also use teleport stones that make it a bit easier.Besides fighting and finding treasures you'll also encounter many NPCs you can talk to. Talking might reveal information and sidequests. You will also get experience from talking to NPCs, which I find a really nice little feature.Crafting is also present. Defeating enemies or opening treasure chests might get you blueprints and material to craft the items from the blueprints. To make that a bit easier you can sell material to the shopkeepers, who then add them to their inventory, which makes it possible to purchase those materials from them. Quite handy if you can't or don't want to find them on your way around.The game looks absolutely incredible btw. Beautiful levels accompanied by a nice soundtrack.Not a big fan of the character design though. I don't mind antropomorphic animals in the slightest, but I just didn't like how many of them looked.Also worth mentioning is the voice acting, as it's quite good. Not all were that good, but mostly it was very well done.All things considered a really nice game with a decent story, good gameplay and gorgeous visuals :)			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a masterpiece, plain an simple. The world of Dust is presented with amazing scenery and hand drawn and animated characters accompanied by beautiful music. You take control of an amnesic swordsman on a journey to discover himself and every character you meet along the way is voice acted and memorable. Not the least of is Fidget a character accompanies you the whole game and provides much of the game's needed comic relief. There is a real sense of joy as you uncover more of the story as you play, and help Dust learn more about himself (as well as hear what Fidget has to say about various encounters).Gameplay wise Dust is a 2D metroidvania platformer. As you slice baddies you earn experience which you can use to improve your stats as you see fit and equip and craft items to further enhance your stats. Over the course of the game you and Fidget also gain further abilities to allow more freedom in not only disposing of your enemies but also reaching new areas. Apart from the main story there are a number of side-quests as well as hidden arenas to test your skill. And it is all a blast to play. I would really recommend a gamepad to play, especially an XBox 360 Controller.The most impressive thing about Dust: An Elysian Tail is the fact that apart from the music, voice acting and part of the story, Dust was created, programmed and drawn entirely by one man,  Dean Dodrill. So in a way Dust is like an American equivalent of Cave Story. I know that may sound like a stretch, but honestly this game has brought me a lot of joy and fond memories and I would highly recommend this to anyone.			"

Some parts of the game was very weird in a way with how the combat worked, but other then that it's a really good game. Get it, it's worth every penny!			"

												Its just like those classic games you still remember. The graphics may not be the greatest but the story line damn well is.Its an adventure mixed with hack and slashing. Slash through alot of enemies, get the next item/upgrade and defeat the boss.I personally love those games and this game is no exception.			"

												First, I'd like to say, if you like action, and I mean 'mowing down large groups of monsters with a couple clicks' action, this game is an absolute MUST HAVE. This is one of the most visually appealing games I've ever seen. It also gives you that warm, godlike feeling when you defeat a boss or flatten a particularily hard to kill group of monsters.Good Features:-Anime-style art and beautiful graphics-Easy to master controls-RPG-style inventory-Gripping storylineComplaints:-Side quests open up new areas too often, and usually take forever to complete-A skill tree would be nice			"

												As a furry/disney-esque take on the metroidvania genre, Dust is certainly pretty unique. I love metroidvanias, so I enjoyed Dust. The story was pretty good, but not great. The quests and trials available helped keep things interesting. Overall, I would say Dust is a pretty good game, and definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre (especially if it's on sale).			"

Battle dozens of enemies at once with an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master combat system, take on a variety of  side quests from different characters , discover ancient secrets and powerful upgrades hidden throughout the massive, open world, and uncover the most charming story.It reminds me of classic Castlevania with a touch of Megaman.  = )			"

												Its pretty good, suffers from that same problem lots of RPGs do where combat later on devolves into a single OP strategy but by the end its not even about the combat its about using your crazy powers to jump around and explore. Also the character designs are offputting, its hard for me to take this plot about genocide and war seriously when general Gaius has such big eyes. I don't even know why I remember that. 110% completion get it.			"

												Now, I'm not one for side scrollers, but chalk this up as one of my exceptions.  If there's anything this game lacks in, which in my hours of playtime I found little lacking, it certainly makes up for in its ... well everything!  The artwork is fantastic, the characters are all loveable, everything is properly balanced and the storyline is as rock solid as it comes.  But, those aren't what had me so enrwrapped in this game.  The emotional rollercoaster that this game puts the player through marks this as one of my all time favorite games.  The high and low moments that lead up to the ending scene leave the player cherishing all of those good moments and snarky conversations.The only thing else I can say is to buy it, buy it, buy it!  Seriously, I don't think I could stress enough that if you don't already own this game you're missing out on a fantastic story.			"

Fluid movements and crazy battles. A good variety of enemies, voice acting was really well done. The animation was just gorgeous. The visual style mesmorizes. The use of swordplay and trajectory weapon is something unique to this game.If you want a metroid fill, this is a good game for it. It is NOT a short game. You get your money's worth and more here.My only gripe is the main villain, you'll understand if you play, but it doesn't detract from the joy of playing this game.I can not recommend this game enough for action-adventure guys.

												I got this game on sale with low expectations, but was blown away.  I really enjoyed the colorful and bright environments.  I thought the voice acting was well done.  The story was alright, I thought it became a little predictable after a while.  The gameplay was very good.  I played with the keyboard only controls and didn't have any problems.  Combat is fairly simple, I found myself just executing the same combo's after a while, but the game does attempt to throw you off with differing enemy types in each new area.  The puzzles were somewhat simple, but well executed.  Another nice thing is it runs fairly well on older computers/laptops.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an elegant masterpiece.I actually bought this game on a mere whim, when I felt I wanted to try a new game, and this was on sale, so I decided to give it a shot. That has turned out to be one of the best game purchases of my life.So, why should you buy Dust: An Elysian Tail?First, the beautifully hand-crafted art is to die for. Second, as an action-packed platformer, the combat system is easy to learn but hard to master. You'll take awhile before you learn how to snag achievements like That's More Like It (Successfully complete a 1000+ hit combo) and The Stuff of Legends (Earn a Four-Star Rating in EVERY Challenge Arena), which makes it that little bit sweeter when you do.Third, apart from it's main storyline, there are many side-quests and secret locations to conquer and discover. Looking to uncover them all? Don't stop at 100% completion, it goes up to 117% completion. Amen.Last, but certainly not least, is the compelling storyline. There is a fine balance between humour and drama. You'll be hooked to follow the storyline up till the grand finale.Your parents probably told you to never talk to strangers, but I need you to trust me and do yourself a favour by purchasing and playing this game. You have no idea what you're missing out on if you don't.			"

												Bright and colourful action-RPG with simple ""good versus evil"" story. Graphics and animations are beautiful. Makes exploring the levels searching for hidden items even more enjoyable.Combat is simple but fun - you have only three buttons for it: basic attack, special attack and projectile attack, and by combining them you can chain truly massive combos - one sidequest requires you to perform a 1000 hit combo.You'll like it if you liked Ys or 2D Castlevamia games.

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #52 - Dust: An Elysian TailI found Dust to be a really easy game to pick up and enjoy. The gameplay consists of a mix of exploration and combat.  Combat is pretty fun.  It does involve a lot of button mashing, but there are lots of different button combinations you can use to perform different attacks.  It starts out pretty easy but once you start getting into your first boss battles, it will start to present a challenge.  But really casual players will appreciate the inclusion of a difficulty setting in the options.  It does include an easy mode for people who just want to enjoy the story without too much of a challenge.I'd say the strongest part of the game is definitely the art. The characters and backgrounds are very well done.  Dust is a beautiful game, which is great given the emphasis on exploration.   There is some platforming involved as you explore, but I didn't find any of it particularly difficult.  Dust really seems to go out of it's way to be broadly accessible, without feeling dumbed down.This is going to end up being a short review, as I'm really challenged to come up with anything I didn't like about Dust.  Everything from the art to the music and sound to the fighting and the story just all come together.  This really feels like a game that anyone can enjoy.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a masterpiece, plain an simple. The world of Dust is presented with amazing scenery and hand drawn and animated characters accompanied by beautiful music. You take control of an amnesic swordsman on a journey to discover himself and every character you meet along the way is voice acted and memorable. Not the least of is Fidget a character accompanies you the whole game and provides much of the game's needed comic relief. There is a real sense of joy as you uncover more of the story as you play, and help Dust learn more about himself (as well as hear what Fidget has to say about various encounters).Gameplay wise Dust is a 2D metroidvania platformer. As you slice baddies you earn experience which you can use to improve your stats as you see fit and equip and craft items to further enhance your stats. Over the course of the game you and Fidget also gain further abilities to allow more freedom in not only disposing of your enemies but also reaching new areas. Apart from the main story there are a number of side-quests as well as hidden arenas to test your skill. And it is all a blast to play. I would really recommend a gamepad to play, especially an XBox 360 Controller.The most impressive thing about Dust: An Elysian Tail is the fact that apart from the music, voice acting and part of the story, Dust was created, programmed and drawn entirely by one man,  Dean Dodrill. So in a way Dust is like an American equivalent of Cave Story. I know that may sound like a stretch, but honestly this game has brought me a lot of joy and fond memories and I would highly recommend this to anyone.			"

												This game.. this game man.Dust: An Elysian Tail is a very mysterious game at the beginning, of which then things slowly unfold and make sense at a fair pace.  You'll constantly want to know how or for the matter why Dust is here and why he's able to do all these moves and fight like a warrior.  Anything described story wise is a serious spoiler and you really, really, really do not want to spoil this amazing game so it's being skipped.Gameplay wise it's a hack n slash with some RPG elements thrown in that actually mix well.  You have your health, stamina to do specific abilties, can craft items once you find a blacksmith, sell materials to a shop owner so they can restock up on them for you to buy later.  Obviously you level up too, where you can set in skill gems to tailor towards what you want to have on a high priority.  Still gotta put in some gems on the lower leveled ones in order to keep building up Dust to a powerhouse.There's plenty of sides to do, things to unlock and discover, all the while enjoying the incredibly detailed and well drawn art.  The art alone is a very colorful and well done style that is impressive for a mostly one man game.  Almost could say it inspires some to get into drawing.Don't let all the talking anthro animal stuff fool you, it's like An American Tail, movies like that of which could have been some inspriation to having these type of characters.  So it's not because the creator is some furry or furries in general, just don't.  Don't let that one single word sneer you away from this game.  You'll regret it, heavily.It's hard to give this a 9/10, it's just so damn well made and entirely perfect, including the port to pc.  A quick note about the pc port. It's amazing what can be done if you take your time doing it, not rushing it like some of these major ass♥♥♥♥ companies do today with their half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ports to pc from console.10/10 solid, it deserves that well.

												I played through the game on Hardcore difficulty and enjoyed it. This is one of the best Indie games I have played. It has amazing artwork, great sence of humour and intersting characters. The story keeps you interested and you will want to know what will happen next, who is everybody and why things are happening. There are some references from other games (some are very well hidden) but not too hard to find if you use your head. Some negative points worth noting:I used xbox 360 controller to play and sometimes found that using analog stick to perform certain actions might cause you to do the wrong move. This is really annoying when you try to do trials where time and precision is crucial. I failed so many times when my character jumped instead of ducking and sliding or vice versa. I do however recommend playing with a controller even though keyboard and mouse works great, controller is still better.You will probably want to play it once because once you know the story there will be no point in playing again so if you played on casual you are simply wasted your time because it was too easy and you can finish it in few hours. There are, however, 25 sidequestes which you can complete and you won't get all achievements unless you do them all.Difficulty curve is not ideal. On harcode mode is really hard to start that will cause you to die over and over until you reach some levels or keep killing same enemies over and over. Later on it when you level up and get some items it becomes too easy. Simply be patient and you will enjoy the game without any annoying issues.Overall it is great game that is worth your time. I spent over 30 hours and got all the achievements.			"

												Simply enchanting.What makes a truly great game? Well, in my personal opinion, a great game isn't about showing off the best graphics or having mass appeal. A great game, to me anyway, is a true work of art and that's what I feel this particular one is. The visuals and soundtrack are two of the things I find to be the most remarkable about Dust: An Elysian Tail. Gazing into the vistas and listening to the BGM almost made me feel like I was playing one of my old all time favorite games ever. Legend of Mana. I felt that every track complimented each scene well and was enjoyable to even just stop and listen to for a moment without being too distracting at the same time.The movement and combat are fluid and easy to grasp. You rarely ever feel like the game is ever at fault for any mishaps. Combat is very fast paced and stylized like in Devil May Cry. It even has it's own little combo counter for those who like to show off their skills. And while your arsenal of attacks might feel a little limited, watching the protagonist soar back and forth across the screen in a whirlwind of blood and death never seems to get old. Level progression is also well balanced. I never felt like finding the newest upgrade for my equipment ever impacted the difficulty of the game too drastically or was ever essential for advancing in the story. Speaking of, the story isn't too bad either. The dialogue between the protagonist and the inhabitants of Falana(the in-game world) is humorous and well written, yet there have also been a couple parts that jerked a tear out of me too. As a bonus, throughout the entire game, you'll find lots of little references and easter eggs from other games dotted out through each map, if you're a big gamer of course.  It's also refreshing to play a game that doesn't require you to make some kind of moral decision at every turn for once. If there were anything at all I'd change about Dust, it would probably be the way the NPCs were animated. I just felt that the animations between the NPCS and protagonist clashed a little bit and while it's not a big detail, it certainly would have added some polish to an already amazing game.So if you've got some scratch to spare and enjoy games that are more art and less mass appeal, this one is definitely worth picking up.

												Dust is fantastic. A friend showed me the game long ago when it first came out, and I just recently got it for myself on this account. Getting to finally go through the game in full is awesome. The gameplay is simple, but still has plenty of flexibility between the swordplay and the magic. The art is fun, and the voice acting isn't so bad! Particularly the characters who 'matter'. Obviously many side characters don't have as much focus, but Dust, especially Fidget, Ahrah, and Haley are amazingly well voiced. And the many references are a lot of fun too.Did I mention Fidget is the best character ever? Because she is.			"

												Dust: AET is quite possibly one of my favourite games of all time.  If not the number 1 spot.For me, the game blends beautiful visuals with a compelling storyline, with great characters, cracking gameplay, and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard from an indie title to boot.It's not the longest game in the world, but you can stretch it if you love to get immersed and want to play it for all achievements (which, by design, will take a couple playthroughs anyway).  At times, the voicework is a little... wooden, but never really anything that will absolutely take you out of the story if you're having fun.I can't recommend it enough, huge props to Dean Dodrill for creating this work of art.

												The game is cheesy, at times predictable, and the dialogue had me groaning from time to time.And yet I loved every second and couldn't put it down. The story is engaging, the characters relatable, and certain twists can really get in your head. Combat is fairly straightforward, but takes enough thought and practice so as not to hit 'grinding' level. Overall it's really stuck with me in spite of its simplicity and cheese factor.			"

												This game as you can see is called Dust: An Elysian Tail... it didn't catch my attention. This game is about a blue fighter animal human named Dust with no memory of the past what so ever. His companions are a talking sword that guides Dust. His other companion is Fidget which is the flying orange Nimbat which is flying next to Dust in the screenshots. Also what really took my attention is the artwork and dialog. The artwork isn't like SUPER FANTASTIC ARTWORK THAT LOOKS REALISTIC, the artwork is nice bright and dark at the sametime. Me, as an artist in training and wanting to do an artistic job in the future, can see that this took some sort of work to make. Also it was made by an independant designer Dean Dodrill. Enough talking about the art. The dialog in this is good in my opinion. Not too much, not too little. I hate games with so much dialog but I also hate if I can't understand what is happening. The game is also a ""furrie."" What that means is that it as human-like animals. I never played games like these or watched anything like it, so it was an experience. (I don't see anything wrong with it.) The game is a side-scroller with RPG element. Those never were fun to me but Dust: An Elysian Tail was! 9/10 (Battle System made it not 10/10.)			"

												So, where do I start... Possibly amongst the best games I've ever played in my entire life. It has some minor flaws, including a bug in the final boss fight which forces you to fight the boos all over again but other than that it's a masterpiece, a well polished PC port and a fine work of art. The soundtrack is relaxing and fits the game atmosphere very well. The combat is surprisingly satisfying, it combines brawling with hack and slash, in other words I can say that this is a Metroidvania ARPG Brawler. The combos are pretty good and the attack variety is somehow doesn't have alot of variety but it doesn't feel boring. The story is pretty great and overall that sells this game for me. I'm sure that pretty much anyone can enjoy this game and if you don't feel like paying full price for it, wait for a sale and then get it. I got it during a 50% sale but now I can safely say that the game is worth the full price, but this is only a matter of opinion. That said, please buy and play this, support the developer and MAYBE in the future there will be more games like this one.			"

												tl:dr - BUY IT.I'm a gamer for more than 15 years and this is one of my favorite games of all time.Graphics - Absolutely gorgeous. Music fits the graphics. Fighting system is simple but very enjoyable. It's fast, easy (From complexity standpoint) and visually appealing (everything explodes, shines, combos goes up to few hundrets). It's a metroidvania with a light RPG elements. Story is kinda generic, but it's satisfying, The only problem I had was how the characters looks like. Enemies looks relatively good, but NPC have that very cheap furry/cartoon style. I would rather like to see more ""direct furry approach"" or at least better quality of them  (shading, color pallete, more details, etc.). The only good looking NPC is Fidget (that flying cat/bat thingy... She's a Nimbat.). Characters are very good written. Oh, and Fidget is The Cutest character in video game I've ever seen. A want a plushie of her :3  (so I can keep her foreveeerrr....) 	 Anyway, Game took me about 13h to fully complete it, it's relatively hard on ""hard difficulty"", I haven't encountered any bugs or errors. I was playing it on Windows XP (Steam says it requires Vista/7). No slowdowns. In other words - Works good. Nothing much to say, really. It's a fantastic game, you should go and buy it. It's definitely worth your money.			"

												Not too accustomed to writing reviews, so forgive me if something seems shortsighted or off-kilter here.That being said, I feel the need to give this game the recognition it deserves. It isn't often that a game comes along and leaves me with my mouth agape, shocked at the ratio of quality to manpower given to bring something to fruition. It was basically a one-man job, with a few exceptions to music, voice-acting and parts of the writing. This is not a game that makes you think that at all.Beautiful, strong, crisp, varied, colorful aesthetic that leads to gorgeous graphics. Music that evokes that classic, childlike sense of wonder of exploring, excitement, and adventure. Every time I would just bring up the map screen to teleport to a different area, it's evoke a powerful sense of nostalgia from me.Combatwise, everything is done with a blade and elemental ranged attacks, with ways to mix and match them all together. It's basically like a side-scrolling, platforming brawler with a nice degree of variation on enemy types and available tactics on taking them down.The story starts off somewhat simple, and feels like it's treading familiar territory for a little while, but quickly becomes more complex as it goes on. I won't give any spoilers, but needless to say, I wasn't expecting the game to do what it did later on, close to the finish.If I have any nitpicks, they are few. The lip-synching on the characters is a bit off, without much difference between the few mouth movements available. The voice-acting, while quite good overall, tends to give certain characters voices that don't quite fit, in addition to there being rather uneven sound quality amongst the performances. Still, these are both very minor issues, and I stopped noticing them after a while. It's just something I thought I should mention.Honestly, I could go on with this, but I don't want to keep you waiting. Overall, Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the best games I've played in quite a while. It was a stellar experience, and I think that anyone who is able to make a game like this almost by themselves definitely deserves support. I recommend it to just about anyone.			"

												Sidescrolling RPG with very clean, beautiful graphics. Really good soundtrack, although it doesn't really stand out while playing. The character designs and their personalities are really well done, as is the dialogue. Lots of funny moments involving the main character (Dust) and his side-kick (Fidget.) The story is good but isn't very deep. Most of the gameplay revolves around sidequests or things not super directly related to the story's main premise. It's not until the last chapter that you even really learn the spoilers.The combat is very smooth and fluid, although it really starts to get repetitive a little over half-way in. The only real reason I didn't notice it so much is that you can build hits together for combos, and so I tended to always try to beat my previous record during fights. There's only a tiny bit of variation to the combat later on in the game, but it feels like it's introduced a bit too late and isn't all that different and exciting. I would have really liked a more complex system with more variations, but the combat is still really good just due to how smooth it is. The only negative I really have about the combat is that the game will often orient your characters automatically towards  an enemy or nearby object... so you'll be fighting something or trying to move into a specific position, and your character will somewhat auto-lock onto the thing it thinks you're trying to attack. It's fairly frustrating when it causes you to get hit during combat and break your combo.The last chapter drags on for an extremely long time as far as gameplay goes... it's a lot of fighting over and over. The story during this chapter really ramps up though, so it urges you to press on to see what it all means. The last boss battle is too ridiculous and drags on far beyond even the most patient person's attention span. It reminds me of Cave Story, where the game's flow is very well done, and ramps up as you progress.. but then the final battle is just way over the top to the point of being much harder than any other part of the game, and really frustrating.There are lots of things hidden away for you to find, namely keys that are used to unlock chests with goodies inside, and a bunch of ""friends"" which are just cameos of characters from other games. They're all fairly well hidden and it's fun to figure out how too get to keys that are just out of reach.Overall, this is a really well done game with a sizeable amount of gameplay. If you're trying to 100% it, you will spend many more hours trying to perfect  the challenge areas and get all the collectables.			"

												I am not a fan of RPG type games at all. However, when I first saw this game the art is what really caught  my eye. I saw it to be what looked like a beat em up type of game, which I absolutely love those. Considering it had the tag ""RPG"" in it I was a little iffy on whether to get it or not. Steam summer sale came along and I decided to just give this game a try.• The story is wonderful, had me all the way from the beguinning.• The soundtrack is just as beautiful as the artwork for this game.• The dialouge is lovely, had a few chuckles here and there.• Characters are outstanding and their voices are amazing as well, Dust is seriously my favorite right now.I do not regret getting this game, it has become part of my favorite games to play.  From what I know that this game was pretty much made by one person which I am shocked to know that one person managed to create such a beautiful game. I rate this 10/10 definetly!			"

												One of the best RPG games I have played. A few hours into the game and I was hooked with it's beautiful art style. Dust: An Elysian Tail truly has a wonderful storyline as well with it's excellent music and voice acting. The game is very polished and you can feel the love that went into developing this gem. Every hour spent with this game is like a breath of fresh air and I highly recommend a purchase to anyone who fancies this genre. Pros: great story, great dialog, spectacular art style, cameos from other indie game characters (fez, braid, super meat boy etc..), very cheap, many hours of pure fun, main character is energetic, humorous conversations :) Cons: bosses are easy, some repetition from backtracking and revisiting environments (in order to complete some side quests or unlock achievements), could have added a little more moves with Dusts combatOverall I would give this game a 9/10.

												The second I finished this game, I said to myself, ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that was a good game."" I cannot recommend this game enough. The gameplay itself is fun and rarely gets stale, the music is captivating, and the storyline is perfect. In addition to that, the characters are loveable and unique with a truly spectacular voice cast. An excellent game overall and one that will stick with me for a very long time to come.			"

												After playing the first chapter I am very impressed...The combat is as good as anything else I've played, but thats the easy part.  The writing, music, voice acting, animations/presentation and quirky character develppment all come together well to make Dust surprisingly good.Easily one of the best indie titles I've played.  You can really see the attention to detail, dedication, passion and quality that went into making it.  If you haven't played it, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  Go through at least the first chapter before you make up your mind.  I'm confident it will draw you into the world and keep you wanting more.  You will not be disappointed.  :)			"

												Dust... Ah, Dust...I could go on about the great writing and the beutiful world, but one is already apparent and the other would keep us here for hours, so I'll just talk about the gameplay.At it's core, Dust is actualy a simple game. there's your standard combo, and a couple branching moves including a launch, for bringing your fights to the sky, and a grab move, both of which are inisiated during your standard combo. In other words, your entire moveset is unlocked straight off, and is suprisingly small.So does this mean the game gets boreing fast? I suppose that depends on your own mentality. If your looking for a game with clear advancment such as unlockable skill trees, classes, and such, this is not for you. This game will get stale fast.If your looking for a game about mastery, this is the game for you. Just because Dust's moveset is small does not make it easy to master.You will spend hours upon hours honeing your ability to chain dust's various attacks together, with each passing minuet becoming more fluid and building up larger combos. You'll start learning when to group enemys up and when to pick out the straggelers. You'll learn which moves flow into the next. You'll learn about dodge-canceling. You'll learn about how to effectivly use the dust storm. You'll learn when to use Fidget's magic, untill eventualy you'll be wracking up 1000+ combos without batting an eye.Dust is, at it's core, a game about mastery. Thats all there really is to be said.			"

The soundtrack is great, visuals great, combat great, characters great, voice acting great - all by one guy. Just buy it It's worth the money, especially in the sale.			"

												An excellent action adventure, beat 'em up with a good story and some RPG elements. The graphics are colorful and gorgeous and mixed with the excellent music and sound effects makes for a stunning experience.The game mechanics and combat is really good and somewhat unique making it fun and challenging depending on the difficulty one choose. Controls using mouse and keyboard is tight and responds well after minor tweaks to the setup. The Xbox 360 controller should work just fine as well according to a friend of mine.All the characters in the game are Furries which depending on someones preferences might add or subtract to the experience. The english voices and dialogue are good but not spot on. Especially the dialouge with main character where he mostly calls all the enemies monsters all the time, gives it a rather childish feel to the otherwise adult setting of the game.			"

												I expected this to be a Disney-like side-scrollers (judging from the looks) but then I was in for a very nice surprise!Yes, this is a side-scroller with all of the traditional elements (secret rooms, keys, chests etc). However, it successfully mixes in some RPG elements such as levelling, gearing and crafting, always keeping everything very simple. The system is enjoyable and the combats as well with all the combos and abilities.Let's drop the line ""story sucked, it was cliché"" guys, it is getting cliché. There is at least one particular (very important!) non-cliché moment also. Some years ago, I would have been ashamed to admit that I've giggled many times with Fidget and that now I want a flying bat-cat pet, but I'm too old to care about sounding mature (""unleash the rainbow unicorns!"" I say). Her humour IS CHILDISH but somehow in a good way, hard to explain. Voice acting was great in my opinion. Some dramatic moments are too short, but I guess it is a good compromise or else it could turn out annoying.I really disliked the design of the last 3 (of 6) areas, the background makes it hard to focus on the main character. Specially the 6th area, you simply CANNOT see him, and in the 5th I disabled weather effects. Otherwise, exploring the areas is fun.The game has 4 difficulties, and on the 3rd it was not too bad (except the very beginning). Some of the achievements are challenging, but not overly frustrating. You can finish the game with 115% completion, though there isn't an achievement for that (do you need one? we don't need one). You can find characters from other modern games locked in cages in secret areas *achievements bell rings*. That's some sort of homage to the modern classics, instead of the cliché ""oh, I'm gonna pay homage to those games that everybody already paid homage to!!"".Yes, you read it right.No homage to Mario. No homage to Link or Kirby. Suck. It. Cliché. Haters.Spoiler: I almost cried when I saw The Kid from Bastion and Tim from Braid.

												This is a pretty ingenious game that has very good controls and a (predictable) really engaging story. You play as Dust, a warmblood who awakens with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He meets Fidget and a talking sword named Arrah and the three embark on an adventure to discover who he is and what he has to do.The game is a 2D/3D hybrid, much like the style of Shadow Complex. The game has a map system, hidden treasures, and powers that you must acquire in order to go back and find things you might have missed or need to progress.There's also an element of RPG, where by killing enemies, Dust earns XP and can upgrade his stats using skill gems, in the area of health, attack, defense, and Fidget.The combat is very enjoyable and is friendly to people who just like to button mash and those who like to use combo moves. The game rewards you with bonus XP for higher hit combos, so it's in your best interest to not get hit.You can earn money and materials to buy and craft new items to make Dust quite a force to be reckoned with.The voice acting is a little cheesy at some points, but it's pretty enjoyable, and most of the actors they got fit their parts.Some say if you don't really like Anime or ""Furries"" then you shouldn't play this game. I say, that's really not true. Whether or not you're a fan of either, the game is a lot of fun. It's probably a solid 10-11 hours of gameplay if you just want to get through the game, more if you are a completionist. Highly recommended.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the few games I completed entirely, multiple times. I love this game for many reasons: the music is absolutely amazing, the background and characters are beautifully rendered and react to wind, rain and fighting, the combat has about 6-7 combos in total but you have so much freedom of movement that it feels like your pulling off 15-20 string combos, and the story is amazingly compelling. The sidekick you have through the game, Fidget The Nimbat, made me laugh many times and is a really good asset in combat. The combat rewards you for having long unbroken combo chains (there is an sidequest that has you get a 1000 hit combo) and reminds me of something Platinum Games would make. There are many little nods and easter eggs in the game from all of gaming history. They can be usuable items to the merchant to treasures you find in the world. The game really rewards exploration with items and money and health upgrades.The one weakness Dust: An Elysian Tail suffers from is the boss battles. It is usually one enemy that you fight , and it becomes trivial because you dodge their attacks and chain combos on them when there just standing there. The boss battles can be overlooked if you get really interested in the story.I would reccommend you play this game of the ""Tough"" difficulty, because normal is too easy for most people. The ""Hardcore"" difficulty is best saved for a second playthrough because you take more damage and enemies take less damage.I cannot reccommend this game enough to anyone that calls themselves a gamer. If you can get over the fact that the characters are anthromorphic animals and it is metroidvania styled , you will see a compelling story, beautiful design, music that is on par with Super Mario Galaxy, and a combat system that allows you to chain combos indefinitely.

												This little game rewards persistence. I don't mean that in terms of grinding for gear, like in WoW, but in terms of spending a little bit of time unfolding the story... if you like a deep story little twists, and grippnig emotion. That is where this game shines, even if it takes a little to get into (maybe 2h before the story gets interesting).The other noteworthy thing to mention is the soundtrack, it's quite beautiful. No one else seems to talk about it here, so I wanted to make sure that it gets a mention.*yet to complete this game, but I spent a fair bit of time offline with it, thus the ""short"" amount of play time.***OK, I have 99% completed this game - with only 1 achievement outstanding, I wish that I had known this earlier. If you want to get all achievements in this game, start it on ""tough"" difficulty. I had decided that I wanted to 100% this game by about 1.5h - and didn't realise this was one of the requirements. So now i have another 11h of gameplay ahead of me to replay the entire game, just to get this one achievement.*The difference between 100% on Casual vs Tough is 17h vs 20h, if you play it through to completion the first time. it's probably more rewarding, too.The only complaint that I have about the game, is that you cannot skip the ending credits. Seriously.You get warned before the final boss battle that there is ""no turning back once you go past this point"" so you have to go and get everything in the world before you face him, if you want to 100% (actually about 117-120% I believe ingame).It's not a bad entry into the RPG series, as you always feel like you are progressing, never like you are grinding. actually, I levelled up faster than the enemies progressed, so by endgame, I was OP 1hitting almost everything, and 2shotting the hardest minions-type enemies in the game.

												This is the ONLY game I have EVER played where I actually read the credits at the end. Why you ask? You probably havent but I am going to tell you anyway... This game is so beautifully done that I felt by the end of it it deserved the time to read the names behind it. I really can't find anything to fault with this game. It is, simply put, charming in its delivery. The characters are great, the story is very well delivered and keeps you invested in the what is going on while giving adequete spaces between story for action and mini puzzles.The combat, while simple, also has a degree of complexity that does take some time to master but when mastered makes you feel like such a bad*ss while also punishing your mistakes (keep in mind I only played this on the hardest difficulty setting and quite frankly, at times, it was a f*cking nightmare. It may well be quite easy on the easiest setting).Level design is very well thought out with a great mix of miniture puzzles (to find loot and 'friends'), hazards and a great assortment of enemies to go through.There is even a simple crafting system and an RPG style levelling system that is also VERY well done as it is simple yet effective in what it does. What does it do? Gives you what I would call 'Freedom Control'. Your free to choose the way you are controlled. 'This armour is the best you can get at the moment (controlled)... now would you like to buy that, craft it by hunting enemies for materials by grinding or buy the materials needed?... Your call chuckles."". It works very brilliantly. Even with the leveling system for Dust. While you can be a powerhouse hitter and kill everything in a few hits, you cant be SUCH a heavy hitter that you die in one hit yourself.I would recommend this game to everyone. Not that I think everyone will enjoy it on the level I did but because it is so well done that it deserves to be played by lovers of games. It is masterfully done.			"

												So I got this based entirely on the recommendation of multiple friends.When I first saw the rating of E10, I figured they were out of their minds (At this point, I was starting the game, so I guess you can gather how much faith I have in my friends in total). They weren't.Keep in mind that action/platformer is about my least favorite genre ever. Happily, Dust doesn't go the route of making the platforming an exercise in pixel-perfection, but rather one of thinking ahead and planning. For me, it's much more satisfying to fail five times and know that there's still three routes I've not tested, than to fail fifteen times because I'm jumping a frame too soon.Now, the combat isn't overly complex, and it's very easy to get excessively powerful. But that's OK. I play most of my games on normal, at least at first. For this one, I felt pretty secure in adding a difficulty level. It doesn't QUITE match the game to my skill level then, but it made the game ""difficult"" enough that I could die if I stopped paying attention to my health. No idea how normal plays, but Tough feels about right for me anyway.The game draws you in with humor, but the real lasting attraction is that the game handles its characters as if they were actually people. It's not quite novel quality characterization here (let's be honest, very few characters have enough lines to develop much), but it's a refreshing change from action games where an NPC's toughness is directly related to how much profanity they can use.On the whole, I recommend this game.

												An utterly gorgeous game with a compelling storyline.The combat, of course is not perfect but no game can truly be perfect.Rarely does a game get me attached to its characters, let alone anthropomorphic animals (Who'd have thunk it?) But really, this game is utterly amazing and it dictated my emotions throughout its entirety.			"

												Created (designed and programmed) entirely by one person, Dust is a beautifully articulate love-letter to seminal games like Castlevania, Metroid, Ys and Devil May Cry. It’s full of secrets to uncover, areas to explore and enemies to kill in fantastically over-the-top ways. Getting a 1000-hit combo during a fight with dozens of badguys is not only immensely satisfying, it’s also almost effortless.The story may not be that unique or special, but it’s charming enough. The graphics are lush, and wonderfully animated, betraying how it was all done by a single individual’s hard work over the last three years. But the real soul of Dust is the confident combat system, which struts up to you the moment you start playing, takes you by the hand and encourages you to have fun. It’s not Bayonetta levels of sophistication , but it doesn’t have to be. The combination attacks are simple but empowering, launchers take you into the air with ease, and the Dust Storm (a kind of magic attack with several spells to uncover) has you stun-locking herds of enemies, experience points exploding around you like New Years fireworks.If games are a dialogue between the player and the game’s creator, then playing Dust is like sitting down with an old friend who’s back in town, full of fresh stories to tell and eager to reminisce with you about the good times.

												This is a pretty ingenious game that has very good controls and a (predictable) really engaging story. You play as Dust, a warmblood who awakens with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He meets Fidget and a talking sword named Arrah and the three embark on an adventure to discover who he is and what he has to do.The game is a 2D/3D hybrid, much like the style of Shadow Complex. The game has a map system, hidden treasures, and powers that you must acquire in order to go back and find things you might have missed or need to progress.There's also an element of RPG, where by killing enemies, Dust earns XP and can upgrade his stats using skill gems, in the area of health, attack, defense, and Fidget.The combat is very enjoyable and is friendly to people who just like to button mash and those who like to use combo moves. The game rewards you with bonus XP for higher hit combos, so it's in your best interest to not get hit.You can earn money and materials to buy and craft new items to make Dust quite a force to be reckoned with.The voice acting is a little cheesy at some points, but it's pretty enjoyable, and most of the actors they got fit their parts.Some say if you don't really like Anime or ""Furries"" then you shouldn't play this game. I say, that's really not true. Whether or not you're a fan of either, the game is a lot of fun. It's probably a solid 10-11 hours of gameplay if you just want to get through the game, more if you are a completionist. Highly recommended.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the few games I completed entirely, multiple times. I love this game for many reasons: the music is absolutely amazing, the background and characters are beautifully rendered and react to wind, rain and fighting, the combat has about 6-7 combos in total but you have so much freedom of movement that it feels like your pulling off 15-20 string combos, and the story is amazingly compelling. The sidekick you have through the game, Fidget The Nimbat, made me laugh many times and is a really good asset in combat. The combat rewards you for having long unbroken combo chains (there is an sidequest that has you get a 1000 hit combo) and reminds me of something Platinum Games would make. There are many little nods and easter eggs in the game from all of gaming history. They can be usuable items to the merchant to treasures you find in the world. The game really rewards exploration with items and money and health upgrades.The one weakness Dust: An Elysian Tail suffers from is the boss battles. It is usually one enemy that you fight , and it becomes trivial because you dodge their attacks and chain combos on them when there just standing there. The boss battles can be overlooked if you get really interested in the story.I would reccommend you play this game of the ""Tough"" difficulty, because normal is too easy for most people. The ""Hardcore"" difficulty is best saved for a second playthrough because you take more damage and enemies take less damage.I cannot reccommend this game enough to anyone that calls themselves a gamer. If you can get over the fact that the characters are anthromorphic animals and it is metroidvania styled , you will see a compelling story, beautiful design, music that is on par with Super Mario Galaxy, and a combat system that allows you to chain combos indefinitely.

												Great game. I really enjoyed it. The game looks really nice. Even though there is one weapon, you are able to do a few different moves and fidgit attacks. The game is metroid styled and you will have to return to some areas if you want to get the extra stuff. But just have fun hacking and slashing your way through.The voice acting isn't too bad and the characters look nice. The soundtrack is beautifull. It's really great.Though the game isn't that long and there isn't really a replay value. It's worth picking up for a good experience. If you don't have anything against furries atleast.. Because the game is full of them.I would pick it up when you get the chance. Maybe during a sale if you really prefer. But no matter when you pick it up.. You should pick it up if you enjoy a metroid styled game that looks amazing. Just hack 'n' slash to the endBeautiful action RPG - interesting combat style, great writing and storyline, and lots of terrific side quests and puzzles. Beautiful artwork, scenery and music. Combat can get a little bit repetitive, but I'm a big level grinder, so that may be why. Can't wait for the sequel!You're Dust, a mysterious being without memories of his past. While you fight your way through monsters, you'll eventually discover what you are, where you came from and where your path will lead you. Will you be a righteous soul or an evil spirit?Okay, you won't make any big choices throughout the game, so ignore the last sentence, i just liked the sound of it ^^""Dust - An Elysian Tail"" is best described as an action-rpg-platformer i guess.You'll jump and fight your way through monsters with your sword through multiple levels, gain new abilities while you progress and level yourself up while finding/and or crafting (which is kept very simple) new gear to make you even stronger.The graphics are beautifully drawn and very colourful. The 2 main characters, Dust and Fidget, his sidekick, are pretty memorable and their dialogues have some decent humor in it.I really enjoyed it and would recommend you'd give it a try, if you like this sort of genre.This is definitely worth a playthrough unless you're one of those people that's had a terrible childhood where your parents abused you and you weren't allowed to watch awesome 90's cartoons like Bucky O'Hare and Ducktales, instead you grew up watching That's So Raven and other junk which make you go OMG FURRY this is! Anyway...This game is a side scrolling fighting story-driven game that does a lot of things good and a few things merely ok. Everyone harps on it being 'furry' but I think that's just kneejerk reaction. It's just got animal characters in it. If this is furry, so is Ducktales. No one will be yiffing anything. The combat is fun, but does wear a little thin near the end thanks to not much variety. You have a sidekick who is a squeaky voiced flying mouse bat fox creature, but she actually ends up being not annoying (at least in my experience) because she's a bit sarcastic and tends to be overly genre-aware break the 4th wall to crack jokes. The story feels a little rushed in places, but not bad. From what I understand, the dev basically had to work 20 hour days for a couple months to crank the game out, and while I can see some rough patches overall it's a pretty fun experience. The best way to describe it without spoilers is if you combined the fantastical art style and platforming of Earthworm Jim games with the gameplay and character advancement of modern 2D Castlevania games, plus a bit of Klonoa thrown in for character design and story. Dust takes all of those elements and makes a very satisfying experience out of them.Also Dust has one killer Camel toe so there's that.My score for Dust: An Elysian Tail is:4.5 Dust Camel / 5 Toes			"

												A 2D brawler with both Metroidvania (exploring, side-scrolling, revisiting to unlock and discover more) and RPG elements, Dust is a fantastic game. A fantastic port. Supremely rewarding with a definitely defined art style and direction, it's one of the finest action-adventure games I've ever played. Art and programming done by one dude, this game oozes action, animation, humour and direction. It can be a bit cheesy and cliche or annoying in very, very small doses, but it's usually done in a way that's on purpose, for a certain character or the like. Sure some things about the style might put you off and I can't blame you, but you're really missing out on a smart, responsive, customizable, extremely rewarding action platformer. And I'm generally not even that style of gamer. What can i say. Totally worth it.			"

												The story of this game is around Dust, an anthropomorph that wakes up in the middle of a forest with no memories. You travel the lands trying to figure who you are while also helping out the people you meet along the way. I think the game focuses the most on its art and its story and although I don't have a harsh opinion on its game mechanic, I feel like there could've been more than just reworked art to same monsters-types.Combat & ControlThe combat system is based on a series of combos that is very easy to learn and different types of monsters & abilities are introduced along the way. The combos are easy to learn and pretty repetitive, but I didn't mind. Abilities were introduced throughout the game and are essential in being able to go back to previous maps to get previously obtainable treasure while also necessary to move ahead. I used an XBOX controller so it was a pretty easy ride for me and I liked playing this game when I just wanted to sit back in my chair and bash some buttons. The jumping was a bit annoying at first because I think it didn't have a ""push down longer to jump for longer"" mechanic so every jump was the same distance, even if you would give just a slight love tap to the jump button. Overall, I didn't mind the repetition of the combos and the new abilities   kept the combat and exploring the world a bit more interesting. As for the monsters, there were a lot of variety but there was definitely some ""reskinning"" going on as you enter different zone. For example, there was a type of monster that would explode if you got to close and in another ""snowy"" zone, it was just redrawn blue with snow on it. I thought it was cute, but it did leave something more to be desired in fighting new types of foes. Still, I'd like to emphasize that there was still a lot of variety and there's no harm in using the same monster-type at a higher skill area.World ExplorationAlthough there might have been some reskinning, I think I was able to look past it because each zone usually brought a new way to explore the world or puzzles that you had to solve to get the ""treasures"" scattered across the land. Like I mentioned earlier, you get introduced to new abilities and these abilities help you reach new places. For example, in the beginning of the game, Fidget points out a wall of vines that you have not yet learned how to climb and suggests we come back later. There are definitely some treasures that you would not be able to reach without certain learned abilities and would have to come back later to get them. And if you don't want to get them, that's fine too. The treasures are not vital in the end-game and are only for bragging rights and exploring the world. You also have to use these abilities and navigate around the map to get to the next zone so each area isn't just a mindless journey of button mashing.Art (Voice Acting, Graphics, Music)I've heard some people get really annoyed with the voice acting, and I can see where they're coming from. Fidget, your Navi-like companion, has a pretty squeaky voice and can be a little obnoxious to some and I found myself a little annoyed at some of the characters myself... Nonetheless, I think there was a lot of effort put into narrating pretty much every single line that is ever spoken in this game and I took the time to listen and read along. The backgrounds were pretty fantastic as well and there was just so much love put into every zone! I really loved the music as well and most them are very memorable! The only con is that there is just so much going on with aesthetic sometimes and there were some glitches with areas that were in complete darkness. Story Hey I admit it - I cried a bit and not just once! I can't really talk too much about the story without spoiling so I'll say this: they do have some cliche stories. Some ""ideas"" and plots didn't really resonate well with me either (e.g. Dust reacted differently than I expected to certain events, some plots didn't make too much sense with me, there were some missing plotholes...) Regardless, I thought it was quaint. Someone more critical than me might think the story was pretty sloppy... but who knows! Basically, this game isn't perfect but that didn't stop me from finishing it and obsessing over the hidden treasures... oh the hours I wasted! I suppose I'd recommend this game, but it may not be some people's cup of tea.			"

												TL;DR: It's worth the price and moreso if it's on sale. Is a good way to get into several kinds of games. Also includes a concept called ""FUN"".[Length - average]: This game is too short. Depending on how much of a completionist you are- my playtime would have been 3 hours less if I hadn't gotten lost a couple times while looking in every nook and cranny to get to some of the hidden locations for the lost friends before giving in to frustration and googling it. I also don't think it has a lot of replay value.[Difficulty - good]: There's not much to say about this, you've got the casual, medium, hard and 1-Hit KO levels. I would say some of the platforming and the 6 Trials are a challenge regardless of which mode you set the game to though.[Combat - excellent]: Being a sword-wielding-furry-assassin with a cat-like-bat-thing that can shoot lightning and fire, in addition to lightbulbs, who can then do screen-clearing combo attacks is kind of awesome...[Music/Sound - good]: I couldn't hear the actual music most of the time because of all the exploding enemies and other sound effects but when I did hear it, it matched the surroundings perfectly. The sound effects are also spot on and paired with the music, proceeded to make this 25 year old freak the heck out in Sorrowing Meadow (I would recommend not letting your young children see the spiders or mansions). [Voice Acting - good]: All the voices were decent which is saying something considering I try to mute that feature most of the time because of how bad it is usually. Fidget's voice actor, especially, nailed it in cutscenes with emotions or humor and her interactions with Dust really made me like the little sidekick.[Graphics - excellent]: I love the artstyle which is simple yet detailed at the same time and allows for even toasters like mine to run it flawlessly...unless you turn on weather and bloom effects which ruins the art and your framerate simultaneously![Story/Characters - excellent]: The story is very short and straightforward for the most part. It's not bad though because it's told well and the characters are what really brings it to life. I would almost describe the game's plot as a prologue or origin story because of...[The Ending - good]: Other than feeling empty because you have to find something else to play now- It satisfies you by wrapping up the main point of the game while giving you the craving for a sequel it so kindly dangles above you.

												After the short prologue we slip into the role of a fox called ""Dust"" who wakes up in the middle of the woods where we immediately have a conversation with ""Ahrah"", a talking sword. Right after ""Fidget"", the guardian of Ahrah appears. We find out that both of them will accompany us on our journey. And so we start our adventure. Initially very tutorial-like, we move forward getting familiar with controls and some important objects. As the game progresses, we get some useful abilities that allow us to explore the game to reach treasure chests or to do side quests. Sometimes we are in a region which contains sections we can't explore yet, once we have learned the required ability, we can return to this point. But not only we grow stronger, Fidget also learns some skills and is able to support us. Her abilities are very useful especially when it comes to a fight, we have the possibility to combine her skills with ours.On our way we get some side quests which lead us to different places, give us experience points and we find some useful items every now and then. There is also a dealer at different points where we can buy potions, ingredients and pieces of armor. During the main quest, we learn more about Dust's history and Dust in general, which gave me goosebumps several times. Furthermore, we can discover hidden arenas but at this point I won't mention what exactly is waiting for us in there.The graphics are comic-like and cute with small but fine animations and polyphonic music. This creates a good Atmosphere including dialogues between Dust and Fidget, which are very amusing most of the time. The differently designed areas provide variety. Not only our environment and the music changes, we also encounter new monsters with different and upgraded properties, where it is necessary to find out how we can beat them. The story was very touching and appealing. They did a great job with the combat system, its really fun especially when you run into 10-20 enemies at a time, you have the chance for long Hit-Combos, which give us more experience points.Overall, I liked playing Dust: An Elysian Tail very much.

												""Ashes to ashes...and dust to dust.""Expertly and exquisitely crafted over the course of years in the mind of animation artist Dean Dodrill, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a 2D Metroidvania action-RPG that does just about everything right - and impressively at that. The amnesiac Dust and his irresistibly cute buddy Fidget trek across landscapes of forest, flame, shadow, and snow, combining and unleashing Dust's unparalleled swordplay skills with Fidget's dynamic magical projectiles in a furious typhoon of combat against a range of foes and obstacles - all part of a journey seeking answers to salient questions: who is Dust, really? - and is there still a time and a place for a hero to save the world?Each region traversed throughout Dust's 12-to-20-hour journey offers both platforming challenges to be navigated and mobs of monsters to be obliterated. Dust controls quite tightly, and all of his (and Fidget's) commands can be remapped as desired. Virtually all of the scenery in the world of Dust: AET is a rich delight, owing to its lush construction and ace visual design and demonstrating how gorgeous and appealing two-dimensional media can become. Also of note is the game's masterful soundtrack. Urgent strings, delicate pianos, and ambient synth pads are but a few of the pleasing instruments wonderfully woven into memorable melodies and soundscapes by Hyperduck Soundworks, working smoothly alongside Alexander Brandon (of Deus Ex fame). Rewarding side quests and imposing challenge arenas stand ready to be completed; fun cameos (by other indepedent game characters) and dozens of shout-outs to gaming and animation supply much-welcome joy between moments of surprisingly poignant sorrow. The game's cast is interesting, well-written, and voiced competently; consequent empathy with the hopeful villagers instills a resolve to aid their plight and answer their prayers. Each of the game's facets was created prudently and smartly - that it is an absolute blast to play seals the deal.All in all, Dust: AET is one of the most rewarding games I've played in a while. It is, to its end, stellar. Congratulations, Dean: you *nailed* this one.			"

												I was disappointed a little bit in this game, but perhaps it is my fault. When I bought this game I thought it is a cute game. I knew it is not exactly or totally cute but I had not guessed what I will see.  Lets see my problems with this game first; My first weird feeling begun when 'Fidget' (the cute yellow Nimbat) is talking to the player (you). This threw me out of the story line. My second problem that only a few times at the beginning 'Dust' a little bit unreasonably rude with 'Fidget'. But after the beginning they will be fine. My third problem the world. This world a very cruel! Okay, I have already seen cruel things in game. But there are much more cruel what I expected! Many harmless people died there and you cannot help them. And at the end 'Everdawn Basin' when you destroy a plane and it feels down that kills your ally soldiers! I very dislike it, it is too much real! These my problems due I did not expect that much cruel.  The sheep, bunny and the deer are really cute. And the characters are likeable. And all these things have put into a cruel world and story.  So, if you guess it is a cute game, then please go deeper and check that what is waiting for you.   As the game it is good. The hand drawn characters at first look like too simple but I liked it. The game control, levels and crafts are simple, I could used to it easily. The English voice actors did a good job, every characters talking by empathy. I played with Gnu/Linux Xubuntu 64bit and there was only a few program errors over 68 hours playtime.  To the Achievement Hunters: Get all achievement difficulty: Normal  Good things: Likeable characters and cute sheep, bunny and deer. Good voice acting. Easy control.  Bad things: Too cruel story to a cute game. A few program errors over 68 hours playtime. At the beginning there are a few weird and unreasonably rude conversation.  I recommend this game to those who like the 2D playground, the hand drawn style view. I am not recommend this game to those who dislike the drama and cruel things with the likeable characters.			"

												From the people of the VGCats website, this game was born. Now this game was something that I never saw before....Either that or I did but I was just distracted by all the beautiful colors. The animation and graphics are beautiful, it had a certain vibe of calmness and beauty into one glorious game. The characters are very likeable, and the main character is a great character. References and abit of fourth wall jokes were funny to, and some of the lines the characters say are pretty funny, too. The game is great and shouldn't be overlooked. One of the finest Hack'n'Slash games I have ever played, and while it's not for everyone, it is something that you will not be disapointed by.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a Beautiful action adventure RPG 2D Hand-drawn and animated game. Whether you play for an absorbing story, exciting combat, or the joy of exploration, Dust has you covered. The main character Dust doesn't remember who he is. But he's teamed up with floating friend Fidget and wizened talking sword Ahrah. Together, the three of you travel the land of Falana, righting wrongs and uncovering the secrets of Dust's true identity. You gather new equipment and ability upgrades to slowly expand your movement possibilities, fight lots of enemies and bosses, help out others via side quests, and gather hidden treasure. Mixing and matching various attacks and combos is thrilling, and combined with the awesome animation, start flying back and forth while spamming magic attacks at bosses.There's great gameplay, graphics, music, and heart here, and I'm glad I picked it up on the steam sale. I would HIGHLY recommend getting this game!			"

												Upon completing the game in about 70 hours or so on its hardest difficually. It gave me a fair and just battle through the entire game. After going through countless waves upon waves of enemies, improving my abilities and skills therein I was overcoming obstacles left and right while upgrading my character to his peak conditions. Now a few things I gotta say for prase and complaints. 1. The game pulls off a very tough challenge in its battles where every boss or major enemy appears in a specific battle arena. You have to be observant while fighting these enemies and plan your means of attack. Esp. on the Toughest challenge mode. I cannot stress how satisfying this game is with how it brought out in battling hordes of enemies without slowdown at all!2. The Story is simple. Filled with rememberable characters. Though if I had to say a bit more with this short game it is all focused onto your main character. Nothing more. Sure you may do some side quest to help some of the worlds citizens to collect something here and there. But more or less it is fun and enjoyable experince.3. The time spent into this game is mostly grinding and Exploration because of my playthrough I was stupid (smart?) enough to play my first playthrough on the toughest setting. I died countless upon countless of times and over and over again I had to see the loading game screen. There are save panels applenty and with the right equips you can overcome any challenges. Just be sure to have the reflexes.4.At the end of the game I was engrossed in the world they developed. I haven't felt this way since well... Sonic the Hedgehog started development. There is always a hankering inside my mind that this isn't the end. No it is just the beginning of great things to come. If there was a prequal or a sequal to this game. My bet is that it will be day one purchase! Just make the game a bit more.....Substancial and more understanding. That is all! Props to the creators for this wonderful game!From Harvey Storm AKA Sleven			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail... A Good Hack'n Slash Game made by the incredble creator,Dean Dodrill.The Guy who poured his heart and soul for this gem,The features and especially the bodies of the characters are well designed. Especially Dust in his combat stance,His attacks are fitting with the mouse buttons. The enemies are really fun to beat as you are using a sword called Ahrah who seems to know something about Dust's past. and Don't forget about our dear creature,Fidget. as You are using her projectile attack with Dust's DUST STORM attack. The Results are incredible. Especially when it comes to that annoying Exploding enemy. Strategy can be used when it comes to tight situations.I also got to see Super Meat Boy in the game,He is one of the friends that needs to be rescued as well as the others.The Bosses are good as well,The Voice Acting was amazing especially Dust,Fidget and Haley's.If you want to play a Metroidvania Hack'n Slash game,then this game should do the job. Notice that it's game filled with furries. I especially don't mind,as I also hate the furry fans but this game is just impossible to ignore. I am really happy to see this game in PC instead of just an XBOX game alone.. The combat and the voice acting are great.-Voice Acting 8/10-Combat 9/10-Enemies 8/10-Story 7/10Overall: 8.5/10 - AmazingMy Opinion: Get the game if you want hack and slash with metroidvania combined!

												This is a great labour of love. can't find anything bad about it, i just like it and the idea that essentially (mostly) one guy poured open his heart for years to deliver this awesome game.This game is that good designed that EVERY big publisher/developer can only burry his face in shame. The options menu is astonishing, the tools the game gives you to set up your game tell you: Yes, this is a PC game. A REAL PC GAME. But... its not. It came out on console first and the developer took the time to port it REALY GOOD instead of dumping it on the PC as it is usual buisness these days. I mean ... the game detects if you use gamepad or keyboard/mouse ON THE FLY AND CHANGES MENUS ACCORDING, prompts the correct buttons etc... you can scale your ui, set it up etc... for a ""stupid little"" single player ARPG? Wow. Only 2 little things are missing and 1 is kinda major...1) you can't rebind controller buttons (you can rebind mouse/keyboard)2) You can - as of now - not change the language ... that is realy bad, because the game orients itself on your system default language and to change it you either have to change your system language or go into your install dir (of the game) and delete (/rename) your language folder so the game defaults  to english ...this wont bother you once dealt with once but with such an astonishing optionsmenu its... strange to be missing :)the gameplay is solid and feels good. I like the dialogue / voiceacting but thats a matter of taste i guess, this game is no gore/bloody/badass-game so beware Mr/Mrs Cowadooty.			"

												An amazing action game mixed with beautiful artwork and soundtrack make this game a joyful experience. Right away you can recognise all the hardwork put into this game and I have to say that it all works out wonderfully. In addition to the main story there are side quests that you can complete for extra money, XP, crafting ingredients and blueprints for various equipment. The only minor issue I've had with the game is that it can be a little too easy at the beginning if you're playing on Normal difficulty. However at a certain point the difficulty spikes up if you're under leveled and it can prove to be a little annoying. Other than that I really recommend those looking for a light action game to check this out immediately.			"

												It's hard to keep in mind this was made by on man. All the levels are beyond beautifully hand-drawn and combat is nigh on perfect, it feels worth while pulling off a combo and the level upgrades are enough to be noticed. The animations for combat, running, standing, jumping and all others are perfect and the cutscenes so well written and VA'd that you wouldn't dare hit that skip button. Single downside is that the game is easy on anything less then tough/hardcore.. but you gat an acheivement for finishing on either of those difficulties so silver lining xD			"

												Yes, yes, yes yes! I loved this game!Like many others have said, combat is indeed boring - it's a very specific style, so unless you're a huge fan of it there isn't much you can do to like it better -, and considering you get to combat quite a lot in a game like this, I was expecting to NOT recommend it, but... everything else was so fiiiiine I didn't even get bored for having to smash the same button over and over. Seriously, look at the screenshots here in the Store. The background is so damn fine you can just keep looking at it forever if you get tired of looking at the monsters getting cut.Combat excluded, this game is flawless.Artwork is GORGEOUS, the way the back and fore grounds blend is beautiful, soundtrack is actually very thought of (for a game of slashing monsters), voice acting is pretty good, writing (dialogs, papers/letters you pick up, story) is amazingly well done (did I mention this was mostly made by a single dude?) and other game mechanics make it up for the combat.There's one point where you get to the snow and it was SO magical. The snow in the ground will ""react"" in several ways depending if you jumped, if you just walked, if a monster walked, if you moved to attack... This is just one of the little details that made me like this game so much.Also, there's this ""extra"", which makes you go around freeing your ""friends"", and at the map you free them, the game changes to copy that friend's game. Like, when you're freeing The Kid from Bastion, you have an empty map that is filled with ground when you walk around, just like in Bastion. Or when you're freeing the little guy from FEZ, your screen gets cut in like 9 pieces all out of place, so you don't know where you'll end up if you walk off the screen. These were great!			"

The art, the music, the gameplay, I can't fault it. The game is balanced well and eases you into the controls and skills you obtain along the way.I almost feel bad I got this from the humble bundle and didn't buy it full price. I said before that I regretted buying octodad at its current price due to lack of content and the fact you can complete it within 2-3 hours. This game is the same price and its taken me 16 hours to complete, and i still have yet to find all the treasure, secrets, side quests and fully level up.

												The game itself is alright, It could of used some more balancing though.Don't take this the wrong way, I have enjoyed the game and I'm still not finished playing it. I just wish I could disable the specified things below to add to the challenge of the game.- Dust Storm: Really this is the most unbalanced thing in the game. The ground attack itself is pretty helpful, But even that had the inability to protect you from behind. As a result enemies could still damage you, Which balances it out. But once you unlock the ability to use Dust Storm in the air, You're practically invincible. On top of this, It can enable you to skip areas and obstacles entirely by homing in on enemies above you, and being able to fly the to the top of the area. All you'd have to do then is find the exit.- Fidgits projectiles: All this really does is add to the already unbalanced Dust Storm, And make it even more ridiculous. This practically disables the balancing of the ground Dust Storm attack, by enabling you to attack enemies from behind. Now you're immortal on the ground. Use it in the air, And it's even-more-so. The aerial version of Dust Storm already enables you to deal massive damage to enemies whilst not taking any damage, Add in any of Fidgit's projectiles and you can quickly kill everything that moves, Including some bosses. Really it's possible to beat the entire game only using this tactic.Really these are the two major things, It's not worth listing the others. Aside from the issues I did enjoy the game very much, and I would recommend it to other people. I just wish we could alternate the controls and disable certain things.			"

When you and your small little bat creature side kick can turn into army killing powerhouses you have no right to complain. Oh, and don't worry. I've got more playtime than a few minutes.

												It's seriously a really good game, seriously.I enjoyed the art style, the music, and the smoothness of the gameplay. The story was pretty good as well. Definately worth the time in my opinion. Only flaw is that the main antagonist has little to no flexibility (he's a very static character). There is not much of a reason behind his actions other than he is a bad guy.			"

												TLDR at the bottom.Before starting I want to say some things first:I am normally not a regular and great reviewer, but I felt this game really needs some positive feedback, also english is not my native language so bear with me please.I will try my best to describe the experience I had whilst playing this game.I will try to cover some story aspects first and the gameplay and graphics afterwards.At the end of the review I will rate the specific categories from 1-5 stars for each.Its really amazing what some people could establish with creating such a great game, I would like to thanks them for it.For the credibility of this review: I completed this game to 100%-whole story-all sidequests-all treasures-all achievementsReview - Dust: An Elysian TailDust: An Elysian Tail is a side scrolling combat game, it has the look and some - thank god - downgraded combat from Street Fighter 3/4.StoryThe story is heartwarming and very interesting. It never felt boring or long drawn out.You are starting as an unkown soldier who gets called ""Dust"".He is constantly trying to find an answer who he really is and soon he will realize that he will face a bigger threat than he actually thought of.As you progress you will remember more and more of the past and learn who you really are.Your cute, little flying companion called Fidget is  travelling beside you on the adventure, she is the gatekeeper of the sword.The sword that got awakend through your ""hands"" is called Ahrah and can talk to you. I would describe Ahrah has your mentor.The NPC' s in this game are all very unique. Each with its own dialogues and background story.By far the most interesting NPC is your companion Fidget imo. Her dialogues are funny and pretty well structured.The mainstory and the characters bound to the main story are well thought and I had a ton of fun doing and listening to the main story quests.While this game has a lot of funny dialogues and easter eggs it also has some really sad parts which made me sometimes cry.(Not sure if good or bad, lol)Dialogues:The dialogues are all unique and most of them are pretty funny. Some of them are sad.The element of sarcasm was used alot and.I really liked the voice acting in this game. It really felt ""alive"".Most of them are decent sized, but 10-20% are pretty large.Graphics:Its a cartoonish look with some really detailed combat animations. It really fits this genre and theme.Some of the environment changes as you use specific skills.Every area has its own climate.There are grassy, rainy, windy, snowy and dark areas.Not really much more to say.Combat/ Enemies:(I played this game from the beginning with a controller, never tested it with keyboard + mouse)The combat is pretty smooth and easy to learn. You are starting with only some bunch of sword attacks but as you progress you will get more and more useful combos and your companion also will gain new skills which you can combine  with yours while fighting.Pretty interesting is also the aspect that you can parry enemy attacks and counter them afterwards.As you progress - learn new skills - and master them, the game becomes more and more fun to play.At the beginning of your adventure the enemies are pretty weak and not a big threat. But as you progress through the game and discover new areas, the enemies will get stronger and stronger.Some of the enemies you will encounter are dodging and require some decent tactics.Progression:After every level up you gain 1 skill point. There is not an in depth skill tree.You can choose between 4 attributes. (HP, Damage, Defense and Skillpower)I dont really think an in depth skill tree would make sense at this game. It would only complicate and slow down the action oriented gameplay imo.All in all you gain level quite quick. Pretty fast leveling until ~40ish.Equipment/ Crafting:After some 2-3 hours into the game you will get to a blacksmith.In exchange for the blueprints and the materials you will get some really good equipment.There is a weapon slots, armor slots, 2 rings and 1 amulet slot.The equipment is not visible as you change it.You dont have to farm for materials.If you collect a specific material one, and sell this to a vendor, the vendor starts selling this specific material in the future.All in all the equipment and crafting is pretty simple.Sound:While the game was developed by 1 person, the sound actually came from a specific sound studio.Every map has its own sound and music.In most of the games I played, the sound got pretty boring after a while and I switched to some own background music.In my 15-20 hours of gameplay the sound and the music never got on my nerves.Sidequests:There are like ~20 sidequests beside the main story which you can optionally complete. They will grant you Exp/ Gold and sometimes items.At most of them you have to collect items, kill monsters or find some lost NPC's.Good thing is: You will complete most of them by actually following the main quest.Puzzles:Every map contains some puzzles or hidden treasures. Some of them are easter eggs from other games.After you enter a new map which contains a treasure, your companion Fidget will tell you that.Your minimap will also tell you if you collected all treasures of a map.A circle on the map means that you have treasures left to collect, a dot means that you collected all treasures of that map part.Most of them are easy to find and simple to unlock.Instances/ mini gamesThere are 6 instances called ""Cirelian Trials"", you will stumble across them while progressing through the game.The are a great help at keeping the gameplay fresh.They are basically a mix of jumping puzzles and speedrunning through a specific area.You have to make it through the whole trial in time, without getting hit by the traps and beside that you have to destory some sort of ""candle bearer"" to get points.After you completed a trial you will most of the time get really good equipment parts.Personal rating:Story: 5/5Graphics: 4/5Dialogues: 4/5Combat/Enemies: 5/5Progression: 4/5Crafting/ Equipment: 4/5Sound: 5/5Sidequests: 3/5Puzzles: 3/5Instances/ mini games: 4/5TL:DRI give this game a 4-5 out of 5.I had a blast playing this game, its much more worth as its actual prize.While playing I really felt the passion and the hard work dedicated to the creating of this game.Triple A games can really learn something from this game.Controller essential imo.

Very engaging story, remarkable combat system, rpg elements, and hack and slash all collide to make one of the best action RPG's in a long long time. Wether you are the type of player who loves to hack up every thing on screen, or an old school rpg player who loves a great story, or a player who loves hunting down secrets.. You can't go wrong with this game. Great voice acting, a superb soundtrack, and background/frontground graphics that make your jaw drop. 10/10 for sure			"

												It's hard to keep in mind this was made by on man. All the levels are beyond beautifully hand-drawn and combat is nigh on perfect, it feels worth while pulling off a combo and the level upgrades are enough to be noticed. The animations for combat, running, standing, jumping and all others are perfect and the cutscenes so well written and VA'd that you wouldn't dare hit that skip button. Single downside is that the game is easy on anything less then tough/hardcore.. but you gat an acheivement for finishing on either of those difficulties so silver lining xD			"

												Astoundingly pretty and incredibly fluid, it's perhaps a little too linear to be called a metroidvania but exploration is often rewarded. The dialogue and writing are perhaps the weakest point but they're not at all bad and if you really must, everything is skippable- objectives are clearly marked on your map. A strong recommendation, especially at a good sale price, but you'll want a controller.			"

												An amazing action game mixed with beautiful artwork and soundtrack make this game a joyful experience. Right away you can recognise all the hardwork put into this game and I have to say that it all works out wonderfully. In addition to the main story there are side quests that you can complete for extra money, XP, crafting ingredients and blueprints for various equipment. The only minor issue I've had with the game is that it can be a little too easy at the beginning if you're playing on Normal difficulty. However at a certain point the difficulty spikes up if you're under leveled and it can prove to be a little annoying. Other than that I really recommend those looking for a light action game to check this out immediately.			"

												Wow, what an amazing game. ""Dust: An Elysian Tail"" tell the story of Dust, a being who has no recollection of who he is but soon encounters a duo of companions ready to accompany him on his journey of discovery: a talking sword named Ahrah, one of the fabled Blades of Elysium, and its protector, a cute, little, nimbat by the name of Fidget. Together they will help Dust piece together his memories and defeat the evil General Gaius.This game plays pretty much like Castlevania and Dust incorporates new abilities as he progresses the story, abilities that are required to access areas previously unreachable so there is some backtracking. Dust levels up automatically so there's no manually assigning stats (this is only true for casual difficulty, in harder modes you can choose between manual and automatic stat assignment). The inventory lets you customize his armour, sword enhancement, rings, and pendant, plus there's a slot for food, which provides different types of healing, and another one for an odd assortment of items, from teleportation gems to treasure keys. Items can be bought at merchant posts or, alternatively, you'll find blueprints that'll allow you to craft your own, provided you have the necessary materials.Combat is very fluid and feels extremely powerful what can sometimes compensate for its repetitive nature. At some point, I decided to use the Dust Storm with Projectiles combo to settle conflicts quickly. Indeed, you can use it to defeat 90% of all enemies in the game without a hitch. So if you're looking for a game where you need to strategize combats, this isn't it.The dialogue and voice acting is surprisingly good and Fidget easily became my favourite. If this game has one glaring problem is that the instances where Dust gets to talk to Fidget or any other character in the game are separated by tons of combat and when they do appear they bombard you with lots of it. Personally, I would have preferred more, if shorter, dialogue events between fights to break up the monotony of combat.Needless to say, both the soundtrack and the art style are superb. The story has some twists and turns and, certainly, a few plot points are not explained as thoroughly as I would've liked (some not at all). I also think Dust reacted surprisingly well to the main twist, maybe even too much so. Some measure of outrage would not have been out of place I believe. However, none of this detracts from the fact that I connected with these characters to the point I shed a few tears at some heartwrenching moments despite having seen them coming from a mile away. It is that good.""Dust: An Elysian Tail"" puts many AAA titles to shame. It's a purchase well worth full price, clocking around 11 hours at around 85% completion, and an experience you won't forget anytime soon. I for one am looking forwards to playing more Elysian Tails...			"

There were one or two parts in the Cirromon Caverns that I found to be somewhat drawn out, but it was only a minor bother. I highly reccomend this game to anyone.

The ground attack itself is pretty helpful, But even that had the inability to protect you from behind. As a result enemies could still damage you, Which balances it out. But once you unlock the ability to use Dust Storm in the air, You're practically invincible. On top of this, It can enable you to skip areas and obstacles entirely by homing in on enemies above you, and being able to fly the to the top of the area. All you'd have to do then is find the exit.- Fidgits projectiles: All this really does is add to the already unbalanced Dust Storm, And make it even more ridiculous. This practically disables the balancing of the ground Dust Storm attack, by enabling you to attack enemies from behind. Now you're immortal on the ground. Use it in the air, And it's even-more-so. The aerial version of Dust Storm already enables you to deal massive damage to enemies whilst not taking any damage, Add in any of Fidgit's projectiles and you can quickly kill everything that moves, Including some bosses. Really it's possible to beat the entire game only using this tactic.Really these are the two major things, It's not worth listing the others. Aside from the issues I did enjoy the game very much, and I would recommend it to other people. I just wish we could alternate the controls and disable certain things.			"

												If you like anime you will find it easy to get into this RPG, if not you may still like the game but you may not get into it as much. As this game is a console port a controler is necessary for ease of play. The story is enthraling and you keep playing to find out what happens. Expect to spend ~ 11 hrs to complete the story and most of the side missions.overall - 5/5			"

												Dust An Elysian Tail. To put it short, it's an amazing game. The story is based on the character Dust who awakens in a deep forest with the Sword of Ahara and Fidget. Dust has no idea who he is so the three of them go on a adventure to find Dusts true identity.The game looks BEAUTIFULL. No matter where you are. The forests or the mountains. The graphics look great and never hurts your eyes. The voice acting is great. The actors perform there job pretty well and the only voice I get tired of is Figets because she never stops talking sort of like navi from ocarina of time. Graphics and sound aren't everything and Im glad to say that the gameplay is great. Having a metroidvania feel. You will destroy large groups of enemies with the occasional puzzle or platforming. Dust controls soo smoothly and attacks fast and quick. With Fidget you can shoot projectiles but with Dusks whirlwind ability you can make Dust and Figet extremley powerful and quickly defeat enemies. When you defeat enemies, you get expierience points and when you get enough you'll level up. This can increase hp, attack, defense and Figets abilities. I personally try to upgrade Figet first because dust storm is just op.You can do sidequests, craft items, etc when your not beating the snot out of enemies which gives the game some replayability. But it doesn't give enough.I don't really have anything wrong with this game. Except a couple of problems like one the game is pretty short it only took me 10 hours to beat the game. Two, its too easy. I didn't use a revival stone ONCE. And three I wish you could move faster than dusts regular dash attack. Because getting to one location to the next can drag after a while.Thankfully, Dust An Elysian Tail is a great game. Great graphics, sound and gameplay make this a title worth owning. Definately get this game while its half price  right now thanks to the winter steam sale. I'll give a 4.5/5 to this AMAZING  Tail.			"

												TLDR at the bottom.Before starting I want to say some things first:I am normally not a regular and great reviewer, but I felt this game really needs some positive feedback, also english is not my native language so bear with me please.I will try my best to describe the experience I had whilst playing this game.I will try to cover some story aspects first and the gameplay and graphics afterwards.At the end of the review I will rate the specific categories from 1-5 stars for each.Its really amazing what some people could establish with creating such a great game, I would like to thanks them for it.For the credibility of this review: I completed this game to 100%-whole story-all sidequests-all treasures-all achievementsReview - Dust: An Elysian TailDust: An Elysian Tail is a side scrolling combat game, it has the look and some - thank god - downgraded combat from Street Fighter 3/4.StoryThe story is heartwarming and very interesting. It never felt boring or long drawn out.You are starting as an unkown soldier who gets called ""Dust"".He is constantly trying to find an answer who he really is and soon he will realize that he will face a bigger threat than he actually thought of.As you progress you will remember more and more of the past and learn who you really are.Your cute, little flying companion called Fidget is  travelling beside you on the adventure, she is the gatekeeper of the sword.The sword that got awakend through your ""hands"" is called Ahrah and can talk to you. I would describe Ahrah has your mentor.The NPC' s in this game are all very unique. Each with its own dialogues and background story.By far the most interesting NPC is your companion Fidget imo. Her dialogues are funny and pretty well structured.The mainstory and the characters bound to the main story are well thought and I had a ton of fun doing and listening to the main story quests.While this game has a lot of funny dialogues and easter eggs it also has some really sad parts which made me sometimes cry.(Not sure if good or bad, lol)Dialogues:The dialogues are all unique and most of them are pretty funny. Some of them are sad.The element of sarcasm was used alot and.I really liked the voice acting in this game. It really felt ""alive"".Most of them are decent sized, but 10-20% are pretty large.Graphics:Its a cartoonish look with some really detailed combat animations. It really fits this genre and theme.Some of the environment changes as you use specific skills.Every area has its own climate.There are grassy, rainy, windy, snowy and dark areas.Not really much more to say.Combat/ Enemies:(I played this game from the beginning with a controller, never tested it with keyboard + mouse)The combat is pretty smooth and easy to learn. You are starting with only some bunch of sword attacks but as you progress you will get more and more useful combos and your companion also will gain new skills which you can combine  with yours while fighting.Pretty interesting is also the aspect that you can parry enemy attacks and counter them afterwards.As you progress - learn new skills - and master them, the game becomes more and more fun to play.At the beginning of your adventure the enemies are pretty weak and not a big threat. But as you progress through the game and discover new areas, the enemies will get stronger and stronger.Some of the enemies you will encounter are dodging and require some decent tactics.Progression:After every level up you gain 1 skill point. There is not an in depth skill tree.You can choose between 4 attributes. (HP, Damage, Defense and Skillpower)I dont really think an in depth skill tree would make sense at this game. It would only complicate and slow down the action oriented gameplay imo.All in all you gain level quite quick. Pretty fast leveling until ~40ish.Equipment/ Crafting:After some 2-3 hours into the game you will get to a blacksmith.In exchange for the blueprints and the materials you will get some really good equipment.There is a weapon slots, armor slots, 2 rings and 1 amulet slot.The equipment is not visible as you change it.You dont have to farm for materials.If you collect a specific material one, and sell this to a vendor, the vendor starts selling this specific material in the future.All in all the equipment and crafting is pretty simple.Sound:While the game was developed by 1 person, the sound actually came from a specific sound studio.Every map has its own sound and music.In most of the games I played, the sound got pretty boring after a while and I switched to some own background music.In my 15-20 hours of gameplay the sound and the music never got on my nerves.Sidequests:There are like ~20 sidequests beside the main story which you can optionally complete. They will grant you Exp/ Gold and sometimes items.At most of them you have to collect items, kill monsters or find some lost NPC's.Good thing is: You will complete most of them by actually following the main quest.Puzzles:Every map contains some puzzles or hidden treasures. Some of them are easter eggs from other games.After you enter a new map which contains a treasure, your companion Fidget will tell you that.Your minimap will also tell you if you collected all treasures of a map.A circle on the map means that you have treasures left to collect, a dot means that you collected all treasures of that map part.Most of them are easy to find and simple to unlock.Instances/ mini gamesThere are 6 instances called ""Cirelian Trials"", you will stumble across them while progressing through the game.The are a great help at keeping the gameplay fresh.They are basically a mix of jumping puzzles and speedrunning through a specific area.You have to make it through the whole trial in time, without getting hit by the traps and beside that you have to destory some sort of ""candle bearer"" to get points.After you completed a trial you will most of the time get really good equipment parts.Personal rating:Story: 5/5Graphics: 4/5Dialogues: 4/5Combat/Enemies: 5/5Progression: 4/5Crafting/ Equipment: 4/5Sound: 5/5Sidequests: 3/5Puzzles: 3/5Instances/ mini games: 4/5TL:DRI give this game a 4-5 out of 5.I had a blast playing this game, its much more worth as its actual prize.While playing I really felt the passion and the hard work dedicated to the creating of this game.Triple A games can really learn something from this game.Controller essential imo.

												Forget ""for the price tag"" or ""for an indie game"", Dust: An Elysian Tail is an amazing experience which really reignited a passion for gaming that I wasn't sure if I had any more.This is not an 'artsy' game, although it does sport some of the best artistic direction that I've ever seen in a videogame, accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack. The story and characters, whilst kept behind gameplay in priority, are likeable and easy to follow. A few inconsistancies here and there, but an enjoyable experience with enough sidequests and secrets to keep you playing for 20 hours, easily.The mechanics are tight -- if you die, most of the time you're going to feel like it was your fault rather than the game cheesing you out of a death. I only played on hardcore mode, because I found the difficulty on this level was at the perfect point between challenging and tedious. One of my few gripes about the game is that the save spots could have been more considerately placed. I often found that after dying, I was re-doing tedious but simple parts of the game. The save spots should be after the tedious but simple parts, not before them. I want to re-do the part I died on, not the three screens before it (here's to you, Sorrowing Meadows).I did run into two possibly Linux-only issues, one was some sound distortion in certain areas of the game which required me to reduce the volume, and another was an issue with one of the secret rooms not displaying correctly. I e-mailed the developer about the latter issue and within an hour, had a response saying it is being looked into this week.The game's difficulty curve is brilliant, introducing new concepts and abilities as the game goes on so as not to overload the player with one of those half-hour tutorials which most of us skip. The first area is easy, and the final boss will challenge all of your mechanical abilities. I suggest starting on the highest difficulty level and working your way down if it's not enjoyable, it feels like Dust was designed to be played on hardcore.There is plenty of endgame content, as I'm finding with over 20 hours played that I still find things to do and treasures I haven't found yet. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game, and struggle to recall the last time I had this much fun playing a videogame.Thank you, Humble Hearts. I look forward to the next one.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a sort of Hack n' Slash platformer game featuring cartoony anthropomorphic animals. The game starts with Dust, who is quickly met with Fidget after a magical sword flies to him. Dust is told of an ancient prophecy that doom has taken over the world and he is the legendary hero to save it. Reluctantly, Fidget joins with the promise that the sword will be returned to her after the silly venture. The heroes learn just how bad the world really is in peril.The game features an excellent, cartoony, fantasy world that no matter where you are it is astonishing and beautiful. All the environmental and particle effects are brilliant and bring the perfect mood to the game. The voice acting is a bit like an anime cliché, being somewhat overly dramatic and has pauses when speaking for effect. The characters are all charming by their appearance and apparent personalities seen through the game's dialogue and cutscenes. The game's settings are very customisable and really does its best to make it comfortable for you. The actual controls are probably the most fantastic bit of the game otherwise. They are really simple and mouse controls are precise, with the addition of smoothing, making it even more fluid. This makes the game fantastic to play, as the controls can be mixed just about any way you want with little to no flaws (that aren't your own, of course).This game is absolutely fantastic, especially for being made by just one person and a few voice actors.

												A smooth and very interesting platfomer/beat-'em-up game. If you're turned off by anthropomorphic characters, then this may be steer clear of, but you will be missing out on a very good story and very likable characters. Voice acting runds the gammit, somtimes good, sometimes passable, sometimes other, though rarely ever poor. Smooth gameplay, though it can cause lower-end PCs to slow down due to the detailed spritework and backgrounds. However, it rarely makes fights seem unfair, as the game runs smoothly enough, it rarely lags. Music and artistic quality is fantastic, even for a 2D sidescrolling beat-'em-up. It has some RPG elements, though they're not very important, since you only gain skillpoints to power up attack, health, defense and your little partner, Fidget. Difficulty could be a little higher, enemies rarely feel like a threat, as do bosses. But the game is so well done that that is a minor complaint. The controlls are tight and responsive, and this is probably one of the best indie console to PC ports I've ever seen. Also, I should note that it's made by ONE man, Dead Dodrill, who deserves every cent he gets. Over all, this game is fantastic, it does most everything it sets out to do with flying colors, I'd highly recommend it if you long for the nostalgic days of early video game mascots and Don Bluth type animation. Dust: An Elysian Tail is a definite favorite of mine.			"

												  Never did I expect to play a game made by a single person that, well, turns out, is a genius! Don't know if that's really the case, but Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the best games I have ever played! It's super smooth, funny, intense, always exciting and just overall fantastic! Although some might not like the set universe and the main characters, but for me they started as kinda neutral a bit mehy, and turned into really great ones with depth to them, interesting personalities, goals, just wow.   I didn't even once feel, like there was something missing, nor was the story too short or too long, difficulty level is also just right. For that reason I give this game a true 10/10.

												The game overall is good, story is interesting, visuals are really pretty, and the combat is dynamic.However, as much as I like it, i can't help but be irritated by some parts of it.Note, that partially it comes from playing on hardcore (highest) difficulty.In multiple places things like jumps and drops (especially while climbing on vines), need to be done almost pixel-perfectly. I guess you could ignore that if you can simply retry, but a problem arises if when you fail, you end up on spikes or some other damage-inducing crap.Also, on vines you just never know how exactly will Dust jump, which in many cases means spikes to the face..Undeniably the most irritating part of the game for me was a piece of Cirromon Caverns around the middle bottom of the map.It consists of 2 tunnels filled with spikes that you have to jump over, with mushrooms between them, that spill damaging particles. The thing is, that these mushrooms work completely randomly, and they give you effectively no warning - technically they flash around 0.5s before they do something, but it barely gives you time to dodge- oh wait, i forgot that YOU'RE SURROUNDED WITH SPIKES SO YOU CAN'T EVEN DODGE. And there goes half of your hp.So there's no way to predict that they're gonna produce these particles, it's hard to dodge them, and even if you do, you end up on spikes. Of course, they're technically a part of the background, so you can't even 'kill' them.While it's not impossible, it's close to being it, if you need/want to do it while not getting hit even once. You just need luck, lots of it.Oh, for some reason, if you take damage by touching the fire, you bounce back few meters as if you took a ♥♥♥♥ing sledgehammer to the face. Yeah.When it comes to enemies, there are 2 that are a real pain:Demons, who will flank the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and instakill you from behind (yeah sure, you can dodge, right? but only so much, and then you die). Sometimes they will also jump on you with a spinning attack and kill you before you notice them. Thanks for great camerawork, game.Necromancers, which you can damage only with Fidget's projectiles that use up energy, which is also used to dodge Explosive Zombies spawned right in your face by these Necromancers, that explode after 0.5s and instakill you..This is some bad level design.Don't play on hardcore, kids.

												with simplistic graphics and combat, this game has become one of my absolute favorite Story-based games.  Although this game is hugely combat based (it could be argued that it is a brawler) the story is very well synced with that fact.  I absolutely LOVED the story, from start to finish.that aside, what really makes a game is what makes it fun, right?  so, yea..the combat.ohhhh the combat.MY GOD!  IS IT GOOD!This has got to be one of the best 2D combat engines ive ever had the pleasure to play with.  ESPECIALLY for an xbox to pc port game (its never this smooth).  although i find it hard to get into single weapon games, this one did it right by giving you a versatile arsenal of combos and manuevers that make even the cannon fodder fights really fun.  whats more important, though, is that the combat engine is SOOOOO responsive!  i can scarcely believe how much this indie title outclasses so many larger developer titles with its combat engine.IT IS PERFECT.there is plently of room for petty personal complaint, but as far as pure, solid fact goes, the combat in this game does EXACTLY what it's supposed to.  there are zero bugs with it.What I truly love about this game, though; aside from the entrancing story line and exciting combat, is the art.  and take that word loosely, because im talking the whole spectrum.  The animation for character and level design is beautifully done!  The music is absolutely breathtaking!  this game itself, is a work of art as far as videogames go.  It was created and brought to life by one man over 4 years, and you can easily see the passion and talent in his work.this game is much like the older castlevania and metroid games (metrovania?), and in my personal oppinion, if it had been released in that generation (give some modesty to the graphics and sound qualitly, of course) it would have been an instant classic.  There is no circumstance in which i can justify not telling you to buy this game at its current price of $15.  i would easily pay twice that price for a game of this quality.One of the best, most fun games ive played in recent years.

												Reminds me a bit of the lion king. Its one of the few games with almost exclusively drawn content instead of CGI and gets the job memorably well done.At the same time, its also one of the few games where you can feel that the game has a soul and is not just a mass of coding for the purpose of making money off of the player. It is a story and it is art.The characters, their voices and personalities were chosen very carefully and even tho the whole of the game feels a little bit rushed and short from an old gamer's perspective, its a very memorable experience.If for nothing else, then i recommend Dust because i didnt think that games like these were still being made.

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an action side-scrolling platformer game with a very fluid combo system and well animated attacks, giving the player a sense of simply being awesome in combat. I've played a lot of games, but nothing is quite as unique as Dust. The game gives the player the ability to move freely throughout the world, going to whichever areas they so desire to rack-up XP, explore or find hidden secrets in past levels. The story in Dust is one surrounded by mystery, the protagonist, Dust, starts off with amnesia and cannot recollect a damn thing about his past, which I know is very cliche but it suits Dust's story just fine. The protagonist is alway accompanied by a cat-ferret-bat creature by the name of Fidget (who is also the cutest damn thing I've seen since Tali in Mass Effect), who offers humorous dialogue and grants the player a ranged attack. To clarify: I f*cking love Fidget.Dust's combat system flows beautifully, utilizing a mere three buttons for attacks, the combat is simple but at the same time awe inspiring, easy to pick up on and very well made, when the player whipes out his/her first batch of enemies you immediately feel like an incredible badass and leaves you itching for more. As the game proceeds you acquire new abilities that complement your already formidible attack options and keep the game from getting stale, all the while maintaining a steady difficulty curve alongside an easy to understand XP and level-up system.Graphics-wise: It's an indy game, you don't come into it expecting mind-blowing graphics. Dust uses a simple but lovable anthropomorphic cartoon art-style that is both charming and outright adorable, but also dark and serious when it needs to be. All perfected with an amazing musical score and top quality voice acting. As well, Dust makes numerous quips at the expense of the fourth wall and makes references to other games, like Resident Evil 4 and Castlevania. The one flaw I've seen thus far is a somewhat finicky platform system. Sometimes if you don't land on a platform at exactly the right angle you're going through, which in a platformer game is a real kick to the groin.In conclusion: Dust: An Elysian Tail is fun, fluid, and highly addictive. I definitely recommend anyone reading this to pick it up immediately.			"

												Dust is a great action RPG game. It has decent story and good amount of secrets to uncover. It has  a lot of influences from the old Metroid games from the map system to the ""come back when you have the ability to climb here"" kind of stuff.I really liked the crafting system, and the side quests give that good extra to the game.The one thing that bugged me a lot was how easy it is, the battle resumes itself as a compulsive button smash craziness. Even the bosses doesn`t require any level of extra ability. Many are even easier than a few regular monsters. If you want some challenge start off at least in hard mode.			"

												This game only has one fault to it, It is nowhere near long enough! I only sat down to play it twice and both times I just could not stop. I was intrigued by the story and it kept compelling me to play even more, just to see what happens. The exploration is really well done, In between the quests I had I would spend about 30 minutes exploring nearly every room. The Art in this game is phenominal, the backrounds were beautiful and the characters were really well done. Buy this game and play it if you are at all a fan of RPG's or Metroidvania style games.

												Dust provides a gameplay experience much like any other in its genre.  The control feel (I used gamepad) is fluid and easy to pick up.  The brawling mechanism is redundant at times, particularly when you are grinding to push yourself one more level on the tougher difficulties.  Animation in this game is truly something that kept me in it for the long haul.  The soundtrack is good enough that you don't really give it a second thought while playing, however its not the best by any means.  Characters in this game are likable (even more so if you are a fan of furries) however the story felt lacking in my opinion.  Slight changes here and there could have made this an extraordinarily memorable experience however without them I am left after two full playthroughs (120% completion) simply satisfied.  Great game if you can get it on sale or in a bundle.  There are some fairly interesting side plots to occupy time and for the purpose of extending game run time and this game has a tendency to give major throwbacks to old school gaming that always put a smile on my face.  I definitely recommend playing it through at least once to anyone who is in to this sort of metroid-esque game.			"

												With a generally robust combat system, Dust has a lot to offer moreso than other games in the genre. It's a really fun game with great combat, tight controls, gorgeous animations and backgrounds, vibrant color, decent voice acting and very great music that goes perfect with the game and story. Just don't let the prologue and first chapter put you down like me, the game REALLY picks up once you start chapter 2. It's filled with tons of sidequests and other things to keep you occupied. The PC port is perfect so far, I've found no flaws at all. Just make sure you have a controller handy to play it. You'll need one.  Definitely worth the $15 asking price.			"

It was nice to see the developer put emotion and uniqueness into every character, instead of having bland NPC's that repeat some innane bit of dialog.  The background art is beautiful, the music is surprisingly amazing, and the animated cutscenes are a nice treat.

												Easily one of the greatest action RPGs (and games overall) that I've ever played. It's a true masterpiece. The gameplay is solid and extremely fun (there's something very satisfying about being able to cause all of the enemies on screen to explode in a pillar of fire at once, which then racks up your combo counter). =3 The overall story is quite good, and worth playing just to know what happens. The graphics are beautiful, especially during rainstorms and blizzards. But what really makes this game shine is it's absolutely gorgeous soundtrack!!If you're into 2D side-scrollers, RPGs, or just good games in general, you should definitely give ""Dust: An Elysian Tail"" a shot. It's well worth it's price tag.5/5			"

												I was shocked, SHOCKED at how much fun this game was. It's not terribly difficult, but it is fantastically fun. It has some backtracking for loot, similar to Metroid, which is cool, although I know that a lot of nerds want to cry bloody murder whenever this happens, it's not TOO bad. Honestly guys? Why do you hate that so much? Either way, if you felt that backtracking is the unholy spawn of Satan himself, the game doesn't present itself with enough difficulty to actually HAVE to do it... If you wanted to like, make a political statement or something. Combat is fast and frantic, and presents itself with enough options to keep stuff interesting. One thing I found is that nearly EVERY strategy is a good one to accomplish monster murder, except not fighting, that is a terrible strategy. The story isn't going to win any Oscars, but its good enough to keep you interested, the voice acting is good as well, Figet is legitimately funny with her 4th wall jokes, so bonus. I only got stuck in a wall once, and that's the only technical problem I ever ran into, it was near the end of the game, so it already had me in it's smoothly animated clutches and I didn't mind too much. The game saves a lot, so if you ever ran into a bug it's unlikely that you would throw your beverage at your pets and start crying in the fetal position in your neighbors crawlspace or anything.

												Have no fear, this game is completly abstinent! But I think that's to be expected from a game rated E 10+!Dust is an action, platforming, RPG. The sole mechanic is the ""Dust Storm"", a special move that lets you glide through the air and attack enemies. This move assists in combat as well as platforming.The game's level design is split up so that you are platforming half the time, and the other half you are mowing down bad guys. It is unfortunate that there are only two distinct moments when you are doing both at the same time, and I would have appreciated more moments that combined combat and platforming.Many areas are blocked off at the beginning of the game until you unlock the special ability that lets bypass the specific obstacle blocking your way. These blocked off areas don't conceal anything super special, but I find a lot of joy exploring the map trying to find all the hidden chests.The story is well written and well executed, and kept me engaged the entire time. There were certain sad moments that didn't effect me that much, but the chills I got at the cutscene before the final boss made up for that! There were countless jokes thrown in along the way that made me laugh!Overall, I think the game was a pleasent expierence and I would strongly recommend it!			"

												Just.... WOOOOOW!Dust: An Elysian Tail is a side-scrolling hack'n'slash game, and for me, an awesome one.First of all, the graphics: they are just purely beautiful and colorful, the quality of design (maps/player/enemies) is perfectly looking like a drawn picture or anime/cartoon and nothing is ♥♥♥♥ed. Each detail is cured very nicely (foreground same as background and everywhere else on screen) and levels are all nice, even thou' they are all different (rain, snow, villages,...)Now, the controls: they are easy to understand and handling is really fast (keyboard+mouse same as controller). Action time is not boring after some hours passed on it.Lets talk about the music now: and it is great point of the game. its music and ambiant sounds are clean and perfect. You play with a quiet and magnificent music, zen and close to lyrical register. Ambiant sounds (rain, thunder,...) are very realistic. And the last point, the story: Story looks great, characters are attractive and beautiful and Dust (the main one)more than anyone else, 'cause he does not know his past... What will happen?Of course, there is a good humor in it (and also some litlle bad words :P) but you will appreciate close to all characters (except that Gianni, I still got problems to like him after the first met).Conclusion:[/b][/i]In other words. This is one of my new favorite games! A real love at first sight (and play if I can say like that ^^').Really, I recommand that game if you like scrolling games with anime/cartoon animations. It is a very delighting game, a true pearl for eyes and you can just stay on levels just for hearing the music.Then, if you play at it, just ENJOY IT! ;) "

												This game is one of those argument-ending 'Name one' games.""Games aren't artistic! Name one!""""PC ports are impossible, and they'll always be faulty. Name one that wasn't!""""Actio brawlers can't have major plot twists! Name one!""""Comic relief sidekicks are such a pain. Name one time that they did that right.""Well... this is that kind of game, yes. The controls are smooth, the voice acting is gorgeous, the soundtrack deserves to be called 'epic,' even the scenery is chewing the scenery, and as for the story? It's the kind of story where you think you know what the twist is going to be early on, but then they throw a curve ball at you and do something pretty unexpected, even unique. All three of the main characters (yes, the sword is a character) are at least interesting, Fidget is downright brilliant on so many levels, and even the shopkeeper has a story. Yeah, not even kidding. The freaking SHOPKEEPER has a story, and it's not even a bad one. Probably best played with a controller, because there were instances where I struggled because I forgot you could jump diagonally by holding two keys at once (eheh...) but perfectly serviceable with mouse and keyboard, and its options menu is spot-on. There are features that you wouldn't think even existed. This game is a classic. It's iconic. And the controls are simple enough for someone new to games to pick up. Basically, in the spirit of the season, it's a good game for gamers and it's a good experience for non-gamers. All the beauty and heart of a Disney classic mixed with the action of a Nintendo classic. Definitely worth a look.			"

												Absolutely phenominal.  Plays kind of like a sidescroller version of Ys (another good series if you don't know it; Oath in Felghana was especially great), has a relatively lengthy story, lots of sidequests (20~?) and if you like speedrunning, this game has a lot of tricks to master (currently mastering speedrunning myself on this game; dust storm op!).  10/10 would recommend to anyone.  Has difficulties ranging from Casual (easy, enemies do less damage amongst a plethora of things) to Hardcore (pretty hard, lots of things can one shot you, ai is much more difficult, and as stated a plethora more of things) and will keep you going for a while.  My only wish is that there will be a sequel of some kind, as the ending was very...open ended I guess (sorry I didn't mean to make a pun).			"

												To start of, the art-style and art-design are extremely beautiful, giving a lot of life to the game. The characters are also very likeable, well written and have good voice-acting. The plot of the game while well written doesn't really do anything too new but the world itself is so deep that it's still very easy to get sucked into the world. You can't talk about this game without mentioning the music. It's extremely well composed and memorable. I'd even say it's worth picking up the soundtrack so you can listen to it whenever you want.As for the gameplay, it's basically a metroidvania, with a lot of the mechanics you would expect from such a game. Something it doesn't have is multiple types weapons but instead a lot of effort was put into the combat to make it more enjoyable. While you don't have that many combos you can perform, you can easily go from one to the next, making the combat really fluent.The only real negative I have is that the ending didn't give a real closure to the characters and ending a game on a low note isn't something you want since that's what the player will remember the most. Still, there's too much to experience from this game for the ending to bring it down.

It's responsive, and everything is pretty to look at even while you're doing cool combos and jumping around. All the characters are interesting, and the story is really quite compelling.			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said a bunch of times:  Just get the damn game!!!!!  Dust is what a fun 2D platformer is all about.1)  It has a story.  It doesn't break new grounds, but most games don't.  With that said, it is told not only well, but at the right pace.  It doesn't drag, nor does it race along.  It has a well though out plot, and an ending that will stay with you.2)  It makes you explore.  It isn't the most complicated map, but it has enough visit and revisit spots to keep those of us that like to find everything happy.   There are several spots on map and moving to and fro is quick and painless.  The places themselves get progressively more difficult to initially spot where hidden treasures are, but not mean spiritied or impossible like some games I could name.3)  Voice acting.  It doesn't stand out at all and from me that is the greatest compliment.  I can't stand VA that is so over the top, or the opposite that is just so god awful that you want to turn the sound  off and read subtitles.  The VA meshes perfectly with the story.4)  Artwork.  It is a nice blend of cartoonish hand painted with effects mesh.  It is also a perfect fit for the feel of the game.5)  Combat.  Combat is easy to as hard as you wat to make it with the different combos, but definitely forgiving.  It's not meant to be a brutal test, but it offers enough of a challenge to be satisfying.6)  Fun Factor.  So many platformers have zero replayability, especially story driven ones.  You finish and move on.  I played, replayed because I missed a couple of achievements, and then played again just to enjoy.  This is a game that will stay in your library as an old friend that you will just have to re-visit every once in a while.Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hard game to challenge you this is not the one.  If you are looking for an absolute joy of an experience do not pass up this game.  I can't wait to see what's next from the dev's!!!!!  Cheers!			"

												A game with very pretty and hand-drawn aesthetics makes Dust: An Elysian Tail look like a moving comic book. The game consists of a few character progression mechanics with levels, stats, upgrades and item crafting. The real meat, however, lies in the smooth and fast-paced combat. While Dust doesn't reinvite the wheel, the gameplay is polished and fun. The story in the game sadly falls flat, relying entirely on clichés.			"

There is even a few challenge areas for those who are interested.  I will say, my game was slightly glitchy though. On the map screen and durring dialogue my screen would rapidly glitch/flash, or desync. I think this is more along a personal installment issue, than an issue with the game, though.			"

												Forget ""for the price tag"" or ""for an indie game"", Dust: An Elysian Tail is an amazing experience which really reignited a passion for gaming that I wasn't sure if I had any more.This is not an 'artsy' game, although it does sport some of the best artistic direction that I've ever seen in a videogame, accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack. The story and characters, whilst kept behind gameplay in priority, are likeable and easy to follow. A few inconsistancies here and there, but an enjoyable experience with enough sidequests and secrets to keep you playing for 20 hours, easily.The mechanics are tight -- if you die, most of the time you're going to feel like it was your fault rather than the game cheesing you out of a death. I only played on hardcore mode, because I found the difficulty on this level was at the perfect point between challenging and tedious. One of my few gripes about the game is that the save spots could have been more considerately placed. I often found that after dying, I was re-doing tedious but simple parts of the game. The save spots should be after the tedious but simple parts, not before them. I want to re-do the part I died on, not the three screens before it (here's to you, Sorrowing Meadows).I did run into two possibly Linux-only issues, one was some sound distortion in certain areas of the game which required me to reduce the volume, and another was an issue with one of the secret rooms not displaying correctly. I e-mailed the developer about the latter issue and within an hour, had a response saying it is being looked into this week.The game's difficulty curve is brilliant, introducing new concepts and abilities as the game goes on so as not to overload the player with one of those half-hour tutorials which most of us skip. The first area is easy, and the final boss will challenge all of your mechanical abilities. I suggest starting on the highest difficulty level and working your way down if it's not enjoyable, it feels like Dust was designed to be played on hardcore.There is plenty of endgame content, as I'm finding with over 20 hours played that I still find things to do and treasures I haven't found yet. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game, and struggle to recall the last time I had this much fun playing a videogame.Thank you, Humble Hearts. I look forward to the next one.			"

												Nothing much to addThe game is a marvelous piece of art. Although the storyline is relatively straightforward and perhaps predictable, its gameplay makes it up for it. As a Metroidvania, you are continuously being challenged of revisting areas once you have unlocked new skills. However, this doesn't mean you can't try it without acquiring the skills. The majority of hidden secrets and/or treasures in each level is designed that it can be visited when not having the right skill. Having the right skill does make it easier on the other hand, but less of a challenge. Had enough of visiting areas? You can always try to think of practicing your skills by chaining your combos. Besides its gameplay, the soundtrack is extremely well done. Each piece of music fits the moment making it a great enjoyment for the ears when walking through the same area again due to backtracking.However, the game does suffer from a couple of small glitches. Interaction windows popping up while being far away from the shops or savepoints and in battle does hamper the game a bit. While not necessarily gamebreaking, it might be experienced as a nuisance when trying to chain a combo hit.Conclusion:For a game that has been written, programmed and drawn by one single person is an amazing feature. Even more amazing is that all elements in the game fit perfectly together: the gameplay and the OST are very well thought and executed. However, it doesn't mean the game doesn't suffer from some minor glitches. Interaction windows that unexpectedly pop up might be a bit annoying, but are not necessarily gamebreaking.Pro:+ Great OST+ Amazing art work+ Challenging gameplay: difficulty can be adjusted when necesary+ Good level design: majority of the secrets can be reached early in game for a bigger challenge. Having the adequate skill later in game facilitates reaching these secretsCons:- Game suffers from minor glitches at times- Storyline is a bit predictable			"

												Have no fear, this game is completly abstinent! But I think that's to be expected from a game rated E 10+!Dust is an action, platforming, RPG. The sole mechanic is the ""Dust Storm"", a special move that lets you glide through the air and attack enemies. This move assists in combat as well as platforming.The game's level design is split up so that you are platforming half the time, and the other half you are mowing down bad guys. It is unfortunate that there are only two distinct moments when you are doing both at the same time, and I would have appreciated more moments that combined combat and platforming.Many areas are blocked off at the beginning of the game until you unlock the special ability that lets bypass the specific obstacle blocking your way. These blocked off areas don't conceal anything super special, but I find a lot of joy exploring the map trying to find all the hidden chests.The story is well written and well executed, and kept me engaged the entire time. There were certain sad moments that didn't effect me that much, but the chills I got at the cutscene before the final boss made up for that! There were countless jokes thrown in along the way that made me laugh!Overall, I think the game was a pleasent expierence and I would strongly recommend it!			"

												For a long time, I had dismissed Dust as mere ""furry"" bait. An unfair judgement, I know. Anyways, I finally gave it a try because Hardcore Gaming 101 had the game in their ""200 Best Video Games of All Time"" book. Notably, they recommended Dust over Muramasa, a game I also really love. I'm really glad I ended up giving Dust a try because it ended up being one of the most enjoyable ARPGs I've played in a while. The story was engaging (and surprisingly even moving), the combat was satisfying and the entire thing is damn gorgeous. The only problem I have with the game is that I actually really suck at these combo-centric type ARPGs. The last boss battle destroyed me and eventually I had to lower the difficulty to finish the game. I hope to return to the game on a higher difficulty though and actually properly learn the combat systems. Anyhow, I don't know if I can praise Dean Dodrill enough, because what he made is genius.

												For one person to make such a game is shocking and shows the love that he put in it.Pros: The combat is responsive and adds to a lot of fun which creates a simple and fun battle mechanics. The art/music is just amazing and adds to the immersion of the game. The game does pull some heavy hitting sad moments that don't always happen to in other games. The story, albiet kinda rushed, easily sucks you into the world and makes you care for characters you meet an interact with.Cons:Sometimes the VAs aren't the best. The story at the end does kinda feel rushed and might've needed to have 2 of Gaius' men for bosses to even out the pacing.All in all easily a 8.5/10 on the worst of days, which for an indie dev with only 1 guy is astonishing and I hoep to here more from him and this world he created with the other 4 blades!

												This game is one of those argument-ending 'Name one' games.""Games aren't artistic! Name one!""""PC ports are impossible, and they'll always be faulty. Name one that wasn't!""""Actio brawlers can't have major plot twists! Name one!""""Comic relief sidekicks are such a pain. Name one time that they did that right.""Well... this is that kind of game, yes. The controls are smooth, the voice acting is gorgeous, the soundtrack deserves to be called 'epic,' even the scenery is chewing the scenery, and as for the story? It's the kind of story where you think you know what the twist is going to be early on, but then they throw a curve ball at you and do something pretty unexpected, even unique. All three of the main characters (yes, the sword is a character) are at least interesting, Fidget is downright brilliant on so many levels, and even the shopkeeper has a story. Yeah, not even kidding. The freaking SHOPKEEPER has a story, and it's not even a bad one. Probably best played with a controller, because there were instances where I struggled because I forgot you could jump diagonally by holding two keys at once (eheh...) but perfectly serviceable with mouse and keyboard, and its options menu is spot-on. There are features that you wouldn't think even existed. This game is a classic. It's iconic. And the controls are simple enough for someone new to games to pick up. Basically, in the spirit of the season, it's a good game for gamers and it's a good experience for non-gamers. All the beauty and heart of a Disney classic mixed with the action of a Nintendo classic. Definitely worth a look.			"

												To start off, I liked this game a lot, it had interesting gameplay and story. Graphics 5/5The graphics works really well with the environment that the story and characters were trying to portray. Each area looked beautiful with its paint style graphics. Also for the most part each area had something different to offer in the way of environment. Story 4/5I was extremely interested in the story. The story was pretty dynamic for how short it was. The main part of the story is Dust trying to figure out his mysterious past while he essentially helps people in need. Stories like this has definitely been done before, but for some reason Dust's story catched my interest a lot more then some others. With this said, the story left a lot of questions unanswered. For example, what was the background story for General Gaius? The story painted an interesting picture for General Gaius, but by the end, they just left General Gaius as the main Antagonist with very little explanation of why he did what he did. Also, the story could have gone two different ways. I think there could have been a possibility for two endings based off your choices. This could have made the story a little bit more interesting. Gameplay 4.5/5The gameplay was fun and rarely got boring. The game was a mix of 2d platform, rpg and action. You gain experience by defeating enemies and gain bonus experience depending on how high of a combo you can achieve. When you gain a level you are able to put one gem like stat point into one of the provided stats. Although levels were important it was mostly the abilities that you gained through the game that helped you the most in battle. The abilities you gained also looked extremely cool. At one point you were able to gain a fireball ability and if combined with Dust storm you were able to light most of the screen on fire torching your foes. With the right timing you were able to get a 1000 hit combo or more which was also very fun to watch and pull off. There were also many collectibles to keep you interested as well as challenge courses. I found the challenge courses difficult enough to get me angry after the 20th attempt which was fun but also a painful experience. The cameo characters were fun and sometimes difficult to find as well. These collectibles and challenges were not needed, but was a fun diversion from the main storyline. For the most part the gameplay was very well thought out but there were a few issues that I had with the gameplay. The combat was fun but did get repetitive at times. I feel like there needed to be more variety of skills to use, to keep the game from getting boring. The issue of repetitiveness was some what remedied by the shortness of the game, but I feel if the game went any longer I would have gotten very bored with the combat. Also near the end of the game I felt like I was overpowered. This may not be an issue with the game though considering I was probably overleveling while I was trying to get all the collectibles and finishing all the challenges. Sound/Music   5/5Nothing much to say here. The music and sound effects made sense for the environments and situations. The music sounded very good as well. Replayability 2/5Im trying to replay the game on a harder difficulty for the last few achievements but I find myself to lack the motivation to finish the game for the second time. There really isnt any thing different if you play it a second time besides the possibility to obtain some achievements and playing a more difficult setting. So a game plus option would have been nice or maybe a secret chapter where you can play as General Gaius and so on. Overall this game was amazing and well worth the money.			"

												This game is superb. If you are looking for a great indie 2D action platformer, this is a game to get. The game mixes level-by-level gameplay of older side scrolling games with secret hunting and exploration of a metroidvania.  Fuse that with a combo system that actively rewards the player with bonus XP for playing skillfully and you have one amazingly fun action-platform-metroidvania-brawler-whatever-it-is-but-who-cares-it's-great. The first thing that will hit you is the amazing hand-drawn art and animations. This is an absolutely beautiful game to behold. The voice acting is a bit spotty at times but overall, well executed. The bomb sprout puzzles are a bit tedious but so satisfying when you solve them, bosses were way too easy but still fun none the less, some of the diolague can be excized as it outright tells you a puzzle solution, but it doesn't handhold so often that it becomes patronizing, and the ester eggs are just adorable. I haven't found half of the secrets this game holds, so there's still a lot of stuff left for me to do. But, I did complete the story; I will not spoil the ending but I will say it is an ending that leaves lots of mixed emotions, but in a good way. TL;DR the game isn't perfect, but no game is. This is the most fun I had in a 2D game since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Some nitpicks here and there but those could be attributed to the fact that the development team was one person, and a multi-man team could have made more mistakes than fixed them. Overall, this game is a 9/10, one of my favorites, and it definately deserves the overwhelmingly positive reception it gets.			"

It pulls off amazing combat with cool abilities to string attacks together, you'll feel like you are flying through the air a.k.a. ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" combat style...and while this happens you will enjoy beautiful music and graphics that are top notch...imagine Disney/Pixar quality in the best way.  Some people will tell you that this is an Xbox port but I believe that the author has stated that this game was originally written  on the PC.  I personally prefer to use a controller to play but it works with mouse and keyboard.  There is a lot to this game and you can go back and discover things that your character wasn't previously powerful enough to handle.  Combat is so fun repeating some areas does NOT feel grindy or boring at all.  Its hard to say that this is ""the best platformer on the pc"" because its so much more than just a platformer.  You really need to experience the amazing and fluid brawler/combat...Although button mashing will get you a little ways, you really need to have finesse when you play.  Adorable characters, amazing story...I hate to give things a numerical rating but in this case I'll give it 99 out of 100.  There is a LOT to this game and plenty of gameplay...the only reason I didn't give it 100 is I don't know if there will ever be that absolutely perfect game but this one is a razor's edge close to it. Once again--do yourself the favor of buying this game.  Encourage the developer to bring us more fantastic games.Not sure on this:  This game was somehow written by ONE person (and I believe he hired people to do voiceovers and music) but not certain.<3 Dust An Elysian Tail <3 "

												Gameplaywise, it's straightforward : you have one sword and learn several moves throughout the game. I thought this would limit the gameplay, making it boring at some point, but it didn't. The game is relatively short if you decide to do the campaign only, and becomes longer if you decide to do the subquest. You can find equipment to upgrade your sword & be more competitive in fights. The game itself is really easy, if you wish for a challenge, directly jump to the hardcore difficulty, where you really die easily if you gets hit (my advice : don't try to speedrun it, use combos & dodge as much as possible).Graphically : it's a cel-shaded style plat-former, who really take inspiration into Don Bluth's An American Tail animated movie in terms of artstyle (they even made the same pun). At first I thought it would be a problem since I'm really not a fan of the furry genre (due to what the Internet did to it, mostly) but it really only took inspiration in the Don Bluth movie style and never try to sexualize the characters like you can see many games do whenever they try to add androgynous animal characters. So yeah, I really felt I was watching an old animated movie, with the same kind of message Don Bluth himself would be able to convey (about war, destruction of nature, etc...)The story is cute, it's nothing great but it's very cute, very well acted, and I appreciate the voice actors' effort in the play.One big plus for this game is the music : the music is absolutely fantastic, and one of my favourite soundtrack in videogame's history. Not even kidding.It's charming, it's fun, it's pretty. The music is beautiful.It is a wonderful tail... I mean tale.			"

												This game is a pretty badass action sidescroller.  The environments are beautiful.  Music is spot on.  The game has decent voice acting, and enough of a story to continue hacking stuff up.  I would recommend starting the game on one of the difficulties above normal, as I found myself enjoy the game much more with prolonged fights and more punishing mistakes.			"

												Dust was by far one of the most engrossing games I've ever played. It fell a bit short sometimes then it threw me back in everytime. This was the first game to ever give me carpal tunnel, and make me call my PS3 Controller the 'n' word.The story was pretty good, and the characters were all rememberable and fun. I was told Fidget was annoying and I would get annoyed with her, but she eventually was a cute, caring partner character. Her skills helped me alot near the end of the game, and as for the game's end boss...Prepare your steroids and testosterone shots, babies because you're gonna have to become a ♥♥♥♥ing man, yo!I'd rate this game a 9/10. It's almost perfect but could of been a slight bit longer. I hope we get a sequel! That would make my life complete.			"

												This game, when i begun. The art and voice acting, grabbed me by my wrists and kept them on my mouse and keyboard till i finished it. I was shocked, that one person can make such a beautifull game which deserves a sequel which he is working on now. Anyway, the storyline and gameplay was such as awesome as the graphics and voice acting. Even with the better graphics off, it looked still as amazing as with the shading and bloom on. The game also has funny secret cages where special characters come out from other game, like Spelunky and Super meat boy. There in total 12 of them and keeps you playing the game as they provide as bonus for your health. (5% for every character freed) I would, totally recommend this game and even would shake the hand of the creator of such a beautifull and interesting game which makes you laugh and cry till the very end. Even there is a little bit of cursing in the game it's still a kid friendly game which everyone can enjoy.My score for this game is easy:Voice acting: 10/10Gameplay:10/10Graphics: 11/10!Story: 12/10!I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!

												What to say about this game...Well for one, I had this game since last year and after finishing the first time, I will say this: this is GOLD.  I do definitely see this as class A LP material.  I mean not only is this a great game to own but the story really gets to you. The action is non-stop and the cameos are a nice touch.  It's one of those games that I can say is worth playing over again just for sake of sidequest or just feel the need to have a go at it one more time.  If you really would like a game with vibrant colors and action from start to finish and a finely tuned voice cast to fit this story, buy this game..you won't be disappointed!			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a wonderful experience of a Side Scrolling Hack N' Slash game, and I'm here to tell you why.The game starts off with you playing as Dust, a... furry (?) who woke up in the middle of the forests who dealt with amnesia, and is awfully confused on whom he is, and is confronted by Fidget the Nimbat, and Ahrah the Sword. You set out on a perilious journey to discover Dust's past and face all kinds of wicked monsters across the world.The game features extremely satisfying and smooth combat despite it being limited to 2D, yet, it plays so well.The game's combo system works by pressing two buttons, one for slashing, and another for extra combos. You gain new abilities, most likely to help you in enemy confrontrations when you play more of the game.The game world is absolutely lovely and beautiful to look at, as well as the scenery you come across. It is quite expansive, as you head out to new areas to explore the world.The combat can sometimes get repetitive and tiring after a while, as the fight mechanics do not change, but the game can make up for this with it's wonderful speed and fluent style of gameplay, that happens so quickly. It is very awesome.The difficulty is not in any way lacking, unless if you have mastered the combat to the extreme, as it allows you to pick which difficulty you would prefer, easy, moderate, or hard.Sent on:3:02 pmThere are many characters and side quests to tackle on if you do not want to try and finish the main game's storyline, as they give you time to explore the world for secrets, treasures, and quests to start on your own time.It features a nice quick leveling up system, that once you've gained enough experience points, you can choose a stat you'd like to improve, as it keeps the game extremely fresh and impressive.The game allows you to craft new items to your liking that has stats you'd generally prefer to have and use, such as armor, sword buffs, pendents, rings, etc.Dust An Elysian Tail may seem short to some who've played and decided to go on a quick speed-through, but it is a fun experience nevertheless and I suggest buying at full price to support the developer 100%, since a lot of love andeffort to making this game. Kudos.HOPING SEQUEL COMES OUT IN THE FUTURE! MUAAAAAAH!			"

												I love games for their style of gameplay, and this game is top notch. The combat is complex and fast paced, and the combos are huge and graphically satisfying.I personally do not prefer the anime-like art style, but it is colorful and very beautifully executed.There is not much flexibility when it comes to leveling up and customizing skills, but there is a lot of depth to the game when it comes to the types of spells and combos you can do. It's also quite fun finding all the secrets and collecting powerups.Aside from that, I think the artistic aspect of the game itself is enough to recommend it.			"

												Dust is a side scrolling RPG action platformer with surprisingly good aspects for an indie game. You play as Dust, a character weilding an ancient blade while suffering from memory loss. Although the idea has been used many times before, it carries out well for the story. The story itself is unique and I myself enjoyed wondering what could possibly occer next. The envierments range from forests to graveyards, snowy peaks to volcanic regions, all of which vividly colored and highly detailed. The animations for each character are smooth and the character models are great. Each NPC has an interesting personallity that defines them and I must applaud the voice acters for such a wonderful job. The humor is good enough to make me laugh a little, which gives a few lighthearted spots in the middle of all this seriousness. At times, the game will even break the forth wall, such as pointing out how you can pick up a sheep and store it in your inventory. The ending doesn't disappoint and personally left me a bit shaky. The downside of this game is, it's short. I clocked in at 12.2 hours after beating the game and that's doing the main quest, plus some side quests, plus screwing around. However, it's well worth the experiance of playing such an original game.My final rating: 8/10It's a fantasticly done game with little to no glitches and great storyline, however it is short.			"

												A simplistic, yet stunningly beautiful art style and wonderful story direction combine to form one of the best games I've played in 2013. Dust draws you in and keeps you there, in those moments of action and story like few other (including AAA) games. Dust is action-oriented, but never difficult to play, mixing the best of reflexive/combo mechanics with a forgiving style that rewards the player for just having fun as much as executing spectacular hit streaks.

												It is rare to see a game like this be this well done. Dust: An Elysian Tail was made by one man, and the game has the quality of that you see with teams of hundreds working passionately on a project.The game itself is a 2D Sidescroller inspired heavily by games like Metroid and Castlevania. You will find yourself exploring a fairly large open world, looking for items, money, and powers which will allow you to explore areas that were locked to you before. The aesthetic style of this game is truly amazing as well. The use of varied colors really helps the world and its residents come to life in ways rarely seen in games today. I would find myself staying in areas long after I should have left just look at the visuals and marvel at how breathtaking the vistas are. While it is cartoony, it serves the game very well. I would also travel the long way through areas, ignoring shortcuts I had opened, just to listen to the music. The music in this game is nothing short of spectacular, with each area having its own theme that sets it apart from the others, whether it be a mountain pass that screams for adventure, or the haunted remains of an old estate with creeping terrors around every turn, the music sets the tone and atmosphere for each area very well.The combat in this game is a blast to play as well. You will find yourself slicing your way through hordes of monsters, with a small but very versatile moveset that never gets old. It is actually possible to have a fight last upwards of a minute, without ever touching the ground.Another point about the world of this game that I wish more games outside The Elder Scrolls series would use is the use of anthropomorphic animals. All of the characters are some kind of anthro-morph, whether it is a fox, rabbit, mouse, lizard and many others. I really enjoy this kind of thing, and it really helps the game stand out on its own, instead of falling into the tired fantasy traps of the overused elves, dwarves, orcs, and so on, which have been used to the point of being a checkbox for fantasy.In terms of story, this game is a marvel. The plot is surprisingly mature despite the E10+ rating, and makes a lot of ""Mature"" rated games look childish and infantile, and should last you around 11 hours depending on how many side-quests you do. I found myself genuinely caring for a lot of the characters in this game, while eagerly anticipating advancing the plot just to find out what happened next. During the story's darker points I was even moved to tears, which does not happen very often.For $15, you get a game that does everything right, and will stick with you long after you have beaten it.

												Dust: An Eylsian TailGenre : MetroidvaniaRating: 9/10Comment : Wonderful world, marvellous characters, great story and good gameplayDust: An Elysian Tail is one my all time favourite games. Gameplay wise it follows the standard metroidvania rules. As you start the game a lot of areas are unreachable for you but as you progress you learn new abilites with which you can reach those regions later on. The game also has two rpg elements. For one it has a leveling system. Unfortunately it is very simple and doesn't allow for a real specialization. For another it has items that you can equip. The combats are fast and fun to play but in the long run they lack complexity too. Nevertheless the fights and the rpg elements were good enough to keep me motivated. But what makes this game that good for me?It's the world, the story and espcecially the characters. The main characters (Dust and Fidget) are simply amazing. The writing and the voice acting are superb in my opionion. Anyway I don't want to spoil anyhting from the story so just watch the trailer and decide yourself whether you like what you see. I myself can only recommend the game and I hope a sequel will soon be released.			"

The game has incredibly solid mechanics, flowing combat, and a well written story. All of this work and art done by one guy and two musicians that could rival indie game studios with 10 times the workforce. This took a long time to come to xbla, and its a must have on here since its in full glorious 1080p, unlike the 360 version which was capped at 720p.

												Dust has a beautiful background and badly drawn characters. The characters are also vaguely to highly annoying. Luckily, the main character isn't bad, but your ""companion"" is almost as annoying as Navi. If you're lucky, you can read fast and skip over the voice acting/bad dialogue writing. The story is also subpar and fairly predictable.But, then you may wonder why I've played this game for 14 hours (as of writing this review.) Well, that's because the game play is just fun. It's not quite a beat 'em up but there are small hoardes of weak characters with some stronger ones thrown in (not counting the bosses.) There is a hit-combo tracker in the top corner of your screen and a minor quest, plus the steam achievements drive you to really try to continuously hit as many times as possible. It's not simple. It also contains moves that are done using certain button pressing and joystick controls in a row or in combination. Beyond that, it contains ""metroid-vania"" skills that give you access to new areas, further parts of the story, and treasure you missed when first going through areas. There are side quests and the ability to buy or make armor/rings/weapon-improving items. There are definitely some things that I just would rather not deal with with this game, but it's all in the cut scenes/story which is not a huge part of the actual gameplay which is good, because the game play is fun and continuously makes me want to move forward in the game. (Except for the very beginning which I played maybe a half hour of, and then didn't pick up the game for several months.)I'd recommend getting it if it is on sale for cheap because it's fun, but it's not really all that original, and it's not all that polished.Additional note: I cannot speak to how the game plays with a keyboard&mouse or just a keyboard (both options). I played this game using an Xbox remote as it seemed to be easier on my fingers since there is a lot of action-button pressing and thumbs do that better than fingers.			"

												Dust defines itself very well in action platformer genre with a mix of RPG element. It's battle mechanic let you freely perform a mix of ground combats, aerial combats, and magics to built up combo counter for better bonus exp and bonus item drops. Every level up grants you a point to increase one of the four stat category (HP, Attack, Defend, and Magic). This game also offer you sidequests to explore in each regions for hidden items, bonus, blueprint (to crafting accessory), and lot of references from other games. Most regions on the world map in this game are big and has a lot of room to explore.Personally, I am really enjoy Dust as for it's RPG element and lot of contents to explor in each regions in the game. All hidden chests in this game are not really well hidden though, the game rather focus to challenge your skill of a platformer than a puzzle skill; making this game quite enjoyable and enthertain to most audiences. Also, most hidden chests contain several kinds of materials and blueprints, a solid rewards of exploration in this game is to finding these blueprints which most likely to grant you access to a better gear quickly.There are two big flaws in this game, one fall in a repeatitive battle mechanics and one fall in a flat story. Player will get access to several new items and new magic while advancing the main quest, however, none of them significantly affect the play style. You will fall back to performing a usaul mix of ground, aerial, and magic all the entire game. Enemies in this game may receives a uniques identity in each regions (each chapters) but all of them mostly fall to the same three major types consist of Normal size, Big size, and Flying type; the strategy to fight off these three types throughout the game are the same, offer not much of a challenge to the player when accessing to a new area (except for higher HP and higher damage). I also found another disappointment in it's story. If you only focus on the movement of main story and main protagonist then you may find an enjoyment to some extent, but it is very sad that other major characters received no solid background and being rendered as pure good and pure evil with no clear reason; making the story simply not very interesting, at least to me. Also, at first the game seem like to grant player a freedom to make his own decision that could affect other characters (this option even significantly apply to one of the sidequests) but that's that. This freedom simply disappear in the later of the game.The final word is I really love this game. A metroidvania gamer like myself may find the most comfort in this game from exploration, it is simply fun to explore chests, get blueprints, and farming for materials. The amount of sidequests throughout the game are not much but, at least, acceptable. Even though the combat mechanic is quit repeatitive, it is still fun to roaming around the field with what the game has to offers. Also, Dust was actually released in 2012 so it is assumable for the game to receives a huge discount at this time. I recommend this is a good Action/platformer game you should at least try with no worry about it's prices when compare to all contents you will find in the game.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a really nice game. Just bought it on the humble bundle but I would totally pay 14€ for it. It's worth every cent if you are a fan of fast paced action games. But it's not everything Dust got. It's also a really nice RPG and Jump'n Run game at the same time, too.I don't care how anybody else is looking at this game, but in my eyes it's a masterpiece.For everyone who is using Win XP. Don't worry. The game runs on XP too and it runs at 40-60fps even with an AMD Athlon 64x2 4400+ with a decent graphiccard (using a GeForce GT 430).Best regards,Jyntax			"

												A short, but likeable game, Dust provides enough story to keep you interested, and gameplay fast and responsive enough to keep you engaged. At times the writing can get a bit threadbare, but there are some refreshing points, particularly the main antagonist. The voice acting is very good, and while the idea of a tiny comedic sidekick can be a cliché, Dust's answer is well rendered, actually useful, entertaining, and, perhaps most importantly, avoids being annoying.Yes, the writing could have gone leagues deeper, and I hate to say it, but I was less than thrilled with the ending. Still, I don't regret playing Dust, and if there's more to come someday, well, this setting definitely has life left in it.  "

												A game with a beautiful soundtrack, a lovely art-style, captivating characters, a unique story, ridiculously fun gameplay, deep character progression, great mechanics, and genious level design. Dust will please the completionists who want to spend hours getting all the little secrets and extras that modern games tend to leave out. I'm the kind of person who likes to seek out everything that is wrong with a game and then complain about it, because I believe it helps improve the specific game, as well as the industry in general, however, there are so very few things wrong with Dust that I shouldn't even mention them, really. Especially since they are things that I didn't like, but other people may enjoy quite profoundly. If you're thinking about buying Dust because you might like it, buy it, it's definitely my goty for 2013. Thanks for reading :) "

												CONS some of the acting is pretty cheesy I couldve slit some of the NPCs throats because I have to listen to their stupidy and it sometimes makes me just want to dig a hole and wait there until i die.  I dont understand exactly what the age range for this game is, yes I have seen some grown men on youtube play this, but honestly what was the exact age range the creator was looking for? There are dead corspes, and then theres a lack of blood, not to mention I feel the animation is expressed in a very kid-friendly way, idkI wish he would make those faces more attractive? Is really the eyes that struck me, its just, theyre so big, if I got a needle and tried poking one of their faces with my eye closed, theres a 90% chance I would hit the eye.The acting isnt very great for some___________________________________________________________________________________PROSThe Story line is really great, im going to keep this short so i dont give anything awayThe way the graphics move is absolutely gorgeousWaffle :DThe ending got me a little.Pancake :DIm running out of prosPotato :DDust is OP___________________________________________________________________________________In the end, the game is really good, although some of the characters faces dont match their voices (or their character at all) and I dont exactly know what target market hes going for, I suggest you atleast try the game!

												with simplistic graphics and combat, this game has become one of my absolute favorite Story-based games.  Although this game is hugely combat based (it could be argued that it is a brawler) the story is very well synced with that fact.  I absolutely LOVED the story, from start to finish.that aside, what really makes a game is what makes it fun, right?  so, yea..the combat.ohhhh the combat.MY GOD!  IS IT GOOD!This has got to be one of the best 2D combat engines ive ever had the pleasure to play with.  ESPECIALLY for an xbox to pc port game (its never this smooth).  although i find it hard to get into single weapon games, this one did it right by giving you a versatile arsenal of combos and manuevers that make even the cannon fodder fights really fun.  whats more important, though, is that the combat engine is SOOOOO responsive!  i can scarcely believe how much this indie title outclasses so many larger developer titles with its combat engine.IT IS PERFECT.there is plently of room for petty personal complaint, but as far as pure, solid fact goes, the combat in this game does EXACTLY what it's supposed to.  there are zero bugs with it.What I truly love about this game, though; aside from the entrancing story line and exciting combat, is the art.  and take that word loosely, because im talking the whole spectrum.  The animation for character and level design is beautifully done!  The music is absolutely breathtaking!  this game itself, is a work of art as far as videogames go.  It was created and brought to life by one man over 4 years, and you can easily see the passion and talent in his work.this game is much like the older castlevania and metroid games (metrovania?), and in my personal oppinion, if it had been released in that generation (give some modesty to the graphics and sound qualitly, of course) it would have been an instant classic.  There is no circumstance in which i can justify not telling you to buy this game at its current price of $15.  i would easily pay twice that price for a game of this quality.One of the best, most fun games ive played in recent years.

												One word to describe it? Mindblown.The moment I saw the screenshots and trailer for this game, I knew this game could be something special and I was ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! To put it simply:1. Story? Great story that both young and old audiences can enjoy.2. Characters? Very lovable characters (expect for the obvious ""bad"" guys lol) and I really like that most of them had ""side quests"" when talking to them and not just have them standing there, talking to you once and never hear from them again. I found myself revisiting a lot of them frequently, solving their issues as well as being rewarded for completing those side quests. Definitely love this approach!3. Graphics? Simply BEAUTIFUL/GORGIOUS WORLD with stunning views in almost all areas. While admittedly it took me some time to adapt to it (especially while running and fighting enemies), I got adapted to it rather quickly and have thoroughly enjoyed every level I played not just for the story/fights but also for observing the surrounding beautiful landscapes as well.4. Music? Absolutely brilliant! The music was calming at times, intense at other times, but it was always fitting to the scene and really helped get me totally ""immersed"" in the atmosphere of this great game!5. Fighting? Very fluid and you get more abilities (as well as power-ups for your companion ""Fidget"") as you progress so that you can revisit old areas and unlock hidden chests in areas that you weren't able to reach previously. Though, my ONLY ""criticism"" of this entire game is that, while you get new abilities/power-ups, you do NOT get any ""new combos"" as you progress, meaning you are stuck doing the SAME combos over and over again from start to the end of this game. So as a note to developers, for future similar games, please add more new combos to decrease the ""repetitiveness"" of killing the enemies with the same old combos over and over again.Nonetheless, the one criticism above does NOT have any major impact on my enjoyment of this game. Definitely a ""must-buy"" for those who enjoy stories that are told in an old style ""cartoony"" fashion with FULL VOICE ACTING for all dialogues as well as those who just enjoy side-scrolling fighting games in general.Final Rating: 10/10. (And hoping for a FUTURE SEQUEL to this game as well! :D)			"

												I picked this up on a whim when it was on sale for a couple bucks. I don't generally do side-scrollers, but the reviews got me wondering. Well, I officially LOVE this game. There are bits and pieces of various themes in literature and gaming throughout, many done so well, you might not catch them at first. Even the main character, Dust, has elements of the main character in the story Total Recall. Trust me, that's not giving anything away you won't guess in the first 20 min of the game... and it's nowhere near the whole story.The writing, controls, action, and level designs are well thought-out and implemented. Some of the ""twists"" really aren't and some are quite well done. In terms of gameplay, I've always liked the more intricate-but-not-overwhelming type of combat system used here. There aren't many combos, but with what there is, there's enough strategy between enemies that simply button-mashing won't get you through the entire game and it doesn't really get old... just comfortable. While made with a controller in mind, I finished the game just fine with a keyboard and mouse.While you can get most of the achievements with the first play-through, the achievement system within the game rewards you for geting them again on each play-through. There's only one that has a proper choice (two achievements, but you can only get one of the two on any given play-through) and the obligatory ""beat the game on (higher difficulty)"". I also though the additional challenge areas were a nice touch. I've only managed to get 4 stars on ONE of them so far.The animation is a bit clunky during the full-animation cut-scenes (of which there are only about 3 in the whole game), but the voice acting is spot-on and every character, no matter how small their part, has a distinct personality and not just some generic NPC plant with random sayings.I don't know if they plan to do another (I haven't looked that up yet), but I'd be on-board for a sequel, or at least a follow-up in the same universe. There's a lot they can still do with it, I think. But then, it's like finishing a good book; you really don't want it to be over. That was me after playing Bastion, after all...TL;DR version:Great game. If you have ANY enjoyment of story-driven action-adventure games, then: GET IT. PLAY IT. LOVE IT.			"

												Picked this game up on the recommendation of a few friends; have to say it was worth it. The graphics look stunning for a game made almost entirely by one person. The colors are very vibrant and really accentuate the atmosphere the rest of the game provides. The combat is very fluid, and it is quite entertaining using fidget powers with the dust storm flinging projectiles around the screen. Dust is littered with RPG elements from leveling up certain attributes to finding and crafting new equipable items (though his character sprite never changes). The story that unfolds as you proceed through the game is truly the icing on the cake which I will not spoil.However, Dust does suffer from its share of short comings. The replay value is not there, atleast from a new game file there isnt. You can collect all the items and most of the achivements in a single playthrough. The voice acting is mediocre and can sometimes be a little annoying (looking at you fidget..), but in the same breath has its moments. Overall I would rate this game an 7.5/10, and only because its a one shot wonder. So buy it on sale and enjoy!			"

												First of all, the design of the characters in this come from beautiful, hand-drawn animation. That alone, for me, gives it a reason to exist. Dust: An Elysian Tail is a very pretty game, and has more than a few surprises to back it up. A simple but sweet story, a likeable main character, and admittedly addicting combat makes Dust a fun little gem of an Indie game. There are some super sacchrine moments that border on narm and melodrama, but it's balanced out with enough charming moments that I can forgive it.And if your only hang-up about the game is that it's a darling of the furry fandom, get over yourself.

												At first glance I had a lot of assumptions about what this game would be, not anything to do with story or characters, but the type of genre the game inhabits and how it goes about that. In many ways it met those assumptions and while I was right it still managed to exceed my thoughts.A few screens and videos and to me this came off as a simplified metroid-like with a more straight forward beat-em up presentation. And my deep abiding love for any exploration based game was left mildly wanting to know that it really has more in line with Odin Sphere/Muramasa than Metroid it still has enough exploratory quirks to ever so slightly scratch that itch.What brings this simplicity bright, to me, is the trappings that are around the basic structure. The combat is fine to me, I don't find it completely compelling but it is satisfying in the way your character feels powerful and the agency through which you give him that power is what compels me through the game. Items, leveling up, quests. The depth is not great but it's all deep enough to just make the rest of it so easy to breeze through and feel constantly in a state of needing to get more from the game because it has the ability to give you more. I feel this lust for progress on the mechanical/statistical spectrum that drives me through the game itself elegantly.And that's not to say the story is creating any sort of roadblock to that. It's actually very well put together and while nearly cloying and childish at times it has an aspect that reflects back this younger version of yourself. Old Saturday morning cartoons, Disney movies, or even just any broadly aimed animated feature. It plays into that in a way that almost makes it okay to be so silly or ardent in child-like way. It's also interesting in how juxtaposed that is to the darker aspects of the story and how easily it accomplishes that without feeling overbearing or too self-serious. And it's startling how good the voice acting is in this game, disregarding some odd lines that sound re-recorded and not quite on point as the same voice from the same session.The gameplay itself may not be memorable to me but it really is fun to play and progress through. It may feel a little simplistic to start or jarringly sharp or oppressive in its presentation but I think its just so out of our usual context for that type of over the top character expression that it feels wrong at first, though over time it felt right at home.

												I loved this game. Has an amazing art style with a story to match. The gameplay is a flawless 2D Platformer hack and slash with a perfect blend of RPG element to it. If you liked games like OdinSphere and Muramasa then I definitely recommend this game.			"

												In short (and the game itself is short), this is a beautiful game. If you have a few hours to spare, you should give it a go. The visuals and music are both stunning, and I may even buy the soundtrack some time soon. The controls are pretty smooth (although pinpoint platforming sometimes gets a little troublesome), and while there are not that many combos to pull off, the battles are still fun and they make you look amazing as you pull off hundreds of chains and fly across the screen whilst tearing apart enemies. The characters and voice acting may be a bit cheesy, but I think it fits the overall style of the game and I found myself liking the interactions between them (primarily the two main characters). There are several side quests and challenge areas to do, so the possibility to deviate from the main storyline is there, if you like those kinds of things. I liked the number of side quests because it was not an overwhelming amount that caused me to lose sight of the main progression. If you're looking for a visually and audibly stunning hack-and-slash side-scroller, you should definitely try this game out!			"

												Absolutely phenominal.  Plays kind of like a sidescroller version of Ys (another good series if you don't know it; Oath in Felghana was especially great), has a relatively lengthy story, lots of sidequests (20~?) and if you like speedrunning, this game has a lot of tricks to master (currently mastering speedrunning myself on this game; dust storm op!).  10/10 would recommend to anyone.  Has difficulties ranging from Casual (easy, enemies do less damage amongst a plethora of things) to Hardcore (pretty hard, lots of things can one shot you, ai is much more difficult, and as stated a plethora more of things) and will keep you going for a while.  My only wish is that there will be a sequel of some kind, as the ending was very...open ended I guess (sorry I didn't mean to make a pun).			"

												This is a beautiful example of how to make a game when you don't have a Bethesda-class budget to play with.  The devs didn't try to go head-to-head with the latest hyper-realistic FPS or amazingly vast open world.  Instead, they took a very old, tried-and-true genre (the Metroidvania action platformer) and did it really well.The animation is smooth, and the sound is pleasant.  The storytelling allows itself some indulgent moments with overdramatic tropes, but then lightens up again with fourth-wall breaking, winking references to other games, and comedically petty sidequests for NPCs, rather than continually wallowing in melodrama.The style of gameplay is dated, and Dust can't compete on technical merits with big-studio offerings, but what makes this a pleasant experience is the degree of polish.  The devs put a lot of attention into this game, and it shows.			"

												To start of, the art-style and art-design are extremely beautiful, giving a lot of life to the game. The characters are also very likeable, well written and have good voice-acting. The plot of the game while well written doesn't really do anything too new but the world itself is so deep that it's still very easy to get sucked into the world. You can't talk about this game without mentioning the music. It's extremely well composed and memorable. I'd even say it's worth picking up the soundtrack so you can listen to it whenever you want.As for the gameplay, it's basically a metroidvania, with a lot of the mechanics you would expect from such a game. Something it doesn't have is multiple types weapons but instead a lot of effort was put into the combat to make it more enjoyable. While you don't have that many combos you can perform, you can easily go from one to the next, making the combat really fluent.The only real negative I have is that the ending didn't give a real closure to the characters and ending a game on a low note isn't something you want since that's what the player will remember the most. Still, there's too much to experience from this game for the ending to bring it down.

												Let me start off by saying this indie game is beautiful. The backgrounds are a joy to behold and the music compliments it well. Weather you are in the forest, in the caves, on a snow covered mountain or whatever, the environment is always very pretty to look at.Gameplay is wild. You hack and slash and spin and bombard your enemies into submission with the grace a tornado of ninjas. There really is something magical about it. I went through the game twice and throwing an enemy 80 feet into the air, flying up at him, grabbing him, and piledriving him back into the ground never lost its appeal. If I had oto complain about the combat, I'd say it can get very easy to lose track of what's going on in the chaos and that the player could have been given more attack combinations. However, as it stands it is visceral and amusing.Additionally the game has a Metroidvania style exploration aspect to it. It has keys to find to unlock treasure chests you find, some require upgrades to reach, and it has some puzzles to it help break-up any tedium you may feel from destroying you enemies all day.In short, if you like pretty, hack-n-slash, Metroidvania games you owe it to yourself to pick up this Indie title.

I saw the screenshots and the videos ofcourse but was still surprised when I actually sat down to play it. Considering the quests and side quests and how the game plays on top of the wonderful art style I would say this is a real nice game. (Oh and do play with a controller if you can)			"

												This game came out earlier this year and totally slipped by my radar till early this summer when I picked it up here on steam.  I am a fan of Anime and lately I have not watched alot since the stories have not been engaging enogh to capture my interest.  If Dust were a long running anime I would definetly watch this one.  The story is very engaging and the anthropomorphic characters are enchanting.  If you like throwback hack and slash side scrolling platform games then you will enjoy this one with the added bonus that you feel like your playing a cartoon to a certain extent.			"

Posted: December 9, 2014
												So this was a case of needing something to occupy myself with while my wife worked on her second and third playthroughs of Dragon Age: Inquisition, so I went through my Steam library looking for something I hadn't tried yet. After seeing that Dust was an RPG metroidvania I decided to give it a try.After playing this I'm realizing I have a fondness for metroidvanias; while Guacamelee is the golden standard against which I will judge them all (that and Symphony of the Night, of course) it turns out Dust was pretty decent. The art style was pretty, though why all of the characters were anthropomorphized animals (aka furries) is beyond me. It didn't really help or hurt the game, but it did take me out of it a little. Why do some of them wear clothes, but your sidekick doesn't?Speaking of your sidekick, Fidget, ohmygoodness is her voice annoying. The game is well acted, but getting past Fidget's voice is a challenge. That said the dialog is surprisingly funny. Fidget does work as decent comic relief, ""Why does it have knives for hands?! KNIVES FOR HANDS!"" The overall plot is meh (evil general with ambiguous motives is trying to kill off the natives - I mean Moonbloods) though I liked the section where you are helping people in Mudpot. I found those characters way more interesting.Gameplay is solid. Standard unlock-powers-to-access-new-areas stuff (though, again, nowhere near as awesome as Guacamelee). There's also RPG stuff such as leveling up and managing gear. You can find recipes and make your own gear out of stuff you pick up from bad guys. There's a nice mechanic where if you sell an ingredient to the shopkeeper then the shop will periodically restock that ingredient, so later when you find a recipe that needs it you don't have to go grind a mob.The game's difficulty was all over the board. Sometimes I would feel like I was burning through all of my healing items and revival crystals (generally when I pushed forward in the main questline without doing side missions/looking for all the hidden treasure chests) yet by the end I had zero trouble with the final boss. Seriously, he was a chump. Also not interesting. If you're going to have me empty a boss' health meter 4 times at least have him change forms or vary his attack pattern. Not that it mattered because, as I said, he was a chump. I didn't need to bother studying the attack pattern.This game was a pleasant distraction for roughly 10 hours (didn't collect EVERY item, but did get most) and was well worth my time (especially considering I don't even remember buying it). That said, if you're looking for a metroidvania and you HAVEN'T played Guacamelee then, obviously, play that instead. If you're a fan of the genre then this is probably worth your time.			"

												I was shocked, SHOCKED at how much fun this game was. It's not terribly difficult, but it is fantastically fun. It has some backtracking for loot, similar to Metroid, which is cool, although I know that a lot of nerds want to cry bloody murder whenever this happens, it's not TOO bad. Honestly guys? Why do you hate that so much? Either way, if you felt that backtracking is the unholy spawn of Satan himself, the game doesn't present itself with enough difficulty to actually HAVE to do it... If you wanted to like, make a political statement or something. Combat is fast and frantic, and presents itself with enough options to keep stuff interesting. One thing I found is that nearly EVERY strategy is a good one to accomplish monster murder, except not fighting, that is a terrible strategy. The story isn't going to win any Oscars, but its good enough to keep you interested, the voice acting is good as well, Figet is legitimately funny with her 4th wall jokes, so bonus. I only got stuck in a wall once, and that's the only technical problem I ever ran into, it was near the end of the game, so it already had me in it's smoothly animated clutches and I didn't mind too much. The game saves a lot, so if you ever ran into a bug it's unlikely that you would throw your beverage at your pets and start crying in the fetal position in your neighbors crawlspace or anything.

												I orriginally played this on the X-Box 360 and bought it here so access to the game will outlive my x-box (will likely purchase AGAIN if it makes it onto PS Vita) Dust is an oft times frenetic side scrolling beatemup with an aluring story that I wont spoil.   The game play is basic on the surface but has more depth involving the interplay between the proteganist Dust and his charmingly offbeat  and sometimes cowardly sidekick Fidgit.  Infact the dialogue between them makes the game, (especially some of her 4th wall breaking commentary such as an early fight when the talking sword Dust carries tells him to use the skill she has learned and Fidget tells him to just mash buttons).. Dust has mostly close up sword skills with the expected levels of upgrades and advancements, Fidget takes the place of you magic system with some impressive sometimes screen clearing special attacks.I don't recall a point where I felt the game was unfairly difficult, and found it highly enjoyable..Pick it up sometime :)			"

So good, i bought the album and and listening to it as i type this.Voice acting: 9.7/10  even compared to other games, the sound quality is crystal clear, but the voice actors convey emotion well. Good matches for their characters. Story: 10/10. Starts out Cliché, but this is where commonness ends. Some great storyline plot twists. Nearly left me misty eyed at the end. I'm going to wipe my game and give myself amnesia so i can enjoy the entire story again.I really hope that a sequel is made, this indie dev is incredibly good!			"

												I am generally not a fan of 2d platformers; I got more than enough of them during the 8 and 16bit eras.  However there are some exceptions that are so well made that I can't help but love them.  This is one of those exceptions.  From the endearing cartoonish art style and decent idle animations to the *truly* excellent sound and music design and decent voice acting (especially for an indie game!) to the well crafted gameplay, this is a top example of the genre and worth a playthrough by anyone, period.  Take it from a critic of the genre, this is a new standard bearer for which other 2d platformers should be judged by.			"

												For a long time, I had dismissed Dust as mere ""furry"" bait. An unfair judgement, I know. Anyways, I finally gave it a try because Hardcore Gaming 101 had the game in their ""200 Best Video Games of All Time"" book. Notably, they recommended Dust over Muramasa, a game I also really love. I'm really glad I ended up giving Dust a try because it ended up being one of the most enjoyable ARPGs I've played in a while. The story was engaging (and surprisingly even moving), the combat was satisfying and the entire thing is damn gorgeous. The only problem I have with the game is that I actually really suck at these combo-centric type ARPGs. The last boss battle destroyed me and eventually I had to lower the difficulty to finish the game. I hope to return to the game on a higher difficulty though and actually properly learn the combat systems. Anyhow, I don't know if I can praise Dean Dodrill enough, because what he made is genius.

												To start off, I liked this game a lot, it had interesting gameplay and story. Graphics 5/5The graphics works really well with the environment that the story and characters were trying to portray. Each area looked beautiful with its paint style graphics. Also for the most part each area had something different to offer in the way of environment. Story 4/5I was extremely interested in the story. The story was pretty dynamic for how short it was. The main part of the story is Dust trying to figure out his mysterious past while he essentially helps people in need. Stories like this has definitely been done before, but for some reason Dust's story catched my interest a lot more then some others. With this said, the story left a lot of questions unanswered. For example, what was the background story for General Gaius? The story painted an interesting picture for General Gaius, but by the end, they just left General Gaius as the main Antagonist with very little explanation of why he did what he did. Also, the story could have gone two different ways. I think there could have been a possibility for two endings based off your choices. This could have made the story a little bit more interesting. Gameplay 4.5/5The gameplay was fun and rarely got boring. The game was a mix of 2d platform, rpg and action. You gain experience by defeating enemies and gain bonus experience depending on how high of a combo you can achieve. When you gain a level you are able to put one gem like stat point into one of the provided stats. Although levels were important it was mostly the abilities that you gained through the game that helped you the most in battle. The abilities you gained also looked extremely cool. At one point you were able to gain a fireball ability and if combined with Dust storm you were able to light most of the screen on fire torching your foes. With the right timing you were able to get a 1000 hit combo or more which was also very fun to watch and pull off. There were also many collectibles to keep you interested as well as challenge courses. I found the challenge courses difficult enough to get me angry after the 20th attempt which was fun but also a painful experience. The cameo characters were fun and sometimes difficult to find as well. These collectibles and challenges were not needed, but was a fun diversion from the main storyline. For the most part the gameplay was very well thought out but there were a few issues that I had with the gameplay. The combat was fun but did get repetitive at times. I feel like there needed to be more variety of skills to use, to keep the game from getting boring. The issue of repetitiveness was some what remedied by the shortness of the game, but I feel if the game went any longer I would have gotten very bored with the combat. Also near the end of the game I felt like I was overpowered. This may not be an issue with the game though considering I was probably overleveling while I was trying to get all the collectibles and finishing all the challenges. Sound/Music   5/5Nothing much to say here. The music and sound effects made sense for the environments and situations. The music sounded very good as well. Replayability 2/5Im trying to replay the game on a harder difficulty for the last few achievements but I find myself to lack the motivation to finish the game for the second time. There really isnt any thing different if you play it a second time besides the possibility to obtain some achievements and playing a more difficult setting. So a game plus option would have been nice or maybe a secret chapter where you can play as General Gaius and so on. Overall this game was amazing and well worth the money.			"

The combat is fun and as soon as you unlock Fidget's powers, it becomes truly satisfying slicing through large groups of enemies at a single blow.And Fidget is the cutest and most adorable sidekick ever!!! *wants a Fidget doll*			"

												Just have to say that Fidget is love...    Fidget is life..for the new players... I recommend to start maxing your health and armor 'cause playing tanky in this game is the easiest way through even with the hardest difficulty.5/5    would play a 1000000 times 100% again :3This game is just basically a must have.

												This game is a 2D sidescrolling brawler, where you play Dust. Dust wakes up with amnesia and a talking sword next to him, and a strange animal that is like a squirel mixed with a bat. They go on adventure to discover what happened to Dust. A single playthrough is about 10 hours worth of gameplay, more if you want to go for the full 100% playthrough. It incorporates a castlevania style of gameplay as well, where you learn new tricks to overcome particular obstacles. There is only backtracking involved if you want to find all the secrets and hidden bonuses. The handdrawn visual style of the game is fresh and I personally liked it. The dev-team did some special effects too, but they sometimes obscured the screen a bit too much. Combat feels responsive with gamepad, but I cannot say if this also applies to keyboard. Towards the end I found the combat getting repettitive and I was getting a bit bored with the end stretch of the game. Still, I've very enjoyed playing it and as such I can recommend it.			"

I saw the screenshots and the videos ofcourse but was still surprised when I actually sat down to play it. Considering the quests and side quests and how the game plays on top of the wonderful art style I would say this is a real nice game. (Oh and do play with a controller if you can)			"

												This game came out earlier this year and totally slipped by my radar till early this summer when I picked it up here on steam.  I am a fan of Anime and lately I have not watched alot since the stories have not been engaging enogh to capture my interest.  If Dust were a long running anime I would definetly watch this one.  The story is very engaging and the anthropomorphic characters are enchanting.  If you like throwback hack and slash side scrolling platform games then you will enjoy this one with the added bonus that you feel like your playing a cartoon to a certain extent.			"

												So this was a case of needing something to occupy myself with while my wife worked on her second and third playthroughs of Dragon Age: Inquisition, so I went through my Steam library looking for something I hadn't tried yet. After seeing that Dust was an RPG metroidvania I decided to give it a try.After playing this I'm realizing I have a fondness for metroidvanias; while Guacamelee is the golden standard against which I will judge them all (that and Symphony of the Night, of course) it turns out Dust was pretty decent. The art style was pretty, though why all of the characters were anthropomorphized animals (aka furries) is beyond me. It didn't really help or hurt the game, but it did take me out of it a little. Why do some of them wear clothes, but your sidekick doesn't?Speaking of your sidekick, Fidget, ohmygoodness is her voice annoying. The game is well acted, but getting past Fidget's voice is a challenge. That said the dialog is surprisingly funny. Fidget does work as decent comic relief, ""Why does it have knives for hands?! KNIVES FOR HANDS!"" The overall plot is meh (evil general with ambiguous motives is trying to kill off the natives - I mean Moonbloods) though I liked the section where you are helping people in Mudpot. I found those characters way more interesting.Gameplay is solid. Standard unlock-powers-to-access-new-areas stuff (though, again, nowhere near as awesome as Guacamelee). There's also RPG stuff such as leveling up and managing gear. You can find recipes and make your own gear out of stuff you pick up from bad guys. There's a nice mechanic where if you sell an ingredient to the shopkeeper then the shop will periodically restock that ingredient, so later when you find a recipe that needs it you don't have to go grind a mob.The game's difficulty was all over the board. Sometimes I would feel like I was burning through all of my healing items and revival crystals (generally when I pushed forward in the main questline without doing side missions/looking for all the hidden treasure chests) yet by the end I had zero trouble with the final boss. Seriously, he was a chump. Also not interesting. If you're going to have me empty a boss' health meter 4 times at least have him change forms or vary his attack pattern. Not that it mattered because, as I said, he was a chump. I didn't need to bother studying the attack pattern.This game was a pleasant distraction for roughly 10 hours (didn't collect EVERY item, but did get most) and was well worth my time (especially considering I don't even remember buying it). That said, if you're looking for a metroidvania and you HAVEN'T played Guacamelee then, obviously, play that instead. If you're a fan of the genre then this is probably worth your time.			"

												What a fantastic experience this game was. Even on its third of four difficulties, I only felt genuinely challenged at a couple points, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it thoroughly.Aesthetically, the game is beautiful. Every area feels distinctly different, and none of it feels fake or half-baked. Characters and animations are great, and even the voice acting, for the most part, isn't bad.Storywise...I don't feel like I'm ever qualified to criticize a game's plotlines, but it felt good, solid, strong enough to carry the game.Functionally, things are spot on. Not once did I ever feel like I got screwed over by being unable to control myself precisely how I needed to. The game has a good system behind the numbers, even if the exponential stat growth does lead to being immensely overpowered in the latter parts.Plus, all the characters are anthros, and they're not badly done. It's not necessarily a furry game, but it certainly appeals to us.Buy it, play it, love it.			"

												Absolutely phenominal.  Plays kind of like a sidescroller version of Ys (another good series if you don't know it; Oath in Felghana was especially great), has a relatively lengthy story, lots of sidequests (20~?) and if you like speedrunning, this game has a lot of tricks to master (currently mastering speedrunning myself on this game; dust storm op!).  10/10 would recommend to anyone.  Has difficulties ranging from Casual (easy, enemies do less damage amongst a plethora of things) to Hardcore (pretty hard, lots of things can one shot you, ai is much more difficult, and as stated a plethora more of things) and will keep you going for a while.  My only wish is that there will be a sequel of some kind, as the ending was very...open ended I guess (sorry I didn't mean to make a pun).			"

												In short (and the game itself is short), this is a beautiful game. If you have a few hours to spare, you should give it a go. The visuals and music are both stunning, and I may even buy the soundtrack some time soon. The controls are pretty smooth (although pinpoint platforming sometimes gets a little troublesome), and while there are not that many combos to pull off, the battles are still fun and they make you look amazing as you pull off hundreds of chains and fly across the screen whilst tearing apart enemies. The characters and voice acting may be a bit cheesy, but I think it fits the overall style of the game and I found myself liking the interactions between them (primarily the two main characters). There are several side quests and challenge areas to do, so the possibility to deviate from the main storyline is there, if you like those kinds of things. I liked the number of side quests because it was not an overwhelming amount that caused me to lose sight of the main progression. If you're looking for a visually and audibly stunning hack-and-slash side-scroller, you should definitely try this game out!			"

												Dust is a superb action RPG that is well-animated with vibrant characters that is a joy to play. The controls are spot-on, the graphical style and animation are amazing and the combat system is simple and doesn't get in the way. The one weak point is perhaps the writing; some basic, reasonably important questions get left unanswered and it's a very cut-and-dry good versus evil tale.Dust is not a terribly complex game and doesn't try to be. What it presents is basic but extremely well-executed and was great fun from beginning to end. Any fan of action games should have it in their library.			"

												(Warning this is my first imperssions within the first 7% of the game, my full review is after my first rating)Warning: THIS GAME HAS FURRIES (Talking animals that look like people) AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE FURRIES YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS GAME!What do I have to say about this game? Well this game is quite fun. You are some form of animal warrior who has to fight monsters in EPIC ways. You weild a talking blade that will help you on you way along and you have a little cute, timid, flying animal to also asist you. The story is quite good and I can't wait to play more to see what happens next. This game also got voice dialoge (YAY THEY CAN TALK!) and is a bit over used. BUT don't worry you can skip whatever you want to skip. Cut scenes and all. So I may not be in a possition to say much but I can say I love the beginning and may add on to this review later.I give this game 9.5/10 because it is one of my favourite games in a long time but I don't really like the genre. Love this game. Brings the genre alive. I also wish it was 3D. Just saying.I HAVE RETURNED! Okay, I beat the game and here is the rest of my review.This game is wonderfull, the ending is a tear jerker and leaves you waiting and wanting a new game. Like now. When is it coming out? I want it. Anyway from what I found the story was perfect, the gameplay was awesome, the missions and everything were well balenced and if they wern't they were next to impossible to find. The bosses were a bit weak, but this game can't be any better. The voice acting is sometimes to loud or too quiet but it's close enough to be really good. It's all good and if you never bought it yet, BUY IT NOW! You are missing out.-Pengon88, YouTuber, Game Reviewer and full time Gamer. 9.5/10 and I am out!			"

												So, first of all, this is my first review.Difficulty: Normal; 17h played; lvl 46 - 47Something to the game and the chars.* The game is a 2D World in the art of the Trine game-series.* Each time you left a map-square, it will respawn (endless farm & lvl potential until maximum ?).* The combat system is simple but is entertaining; you have some combos you can easily do like jump hit 3 times and right click to throw your enemy to the ground, especially good in the late stage in my opinion.* There are 12 (?) friends you can ""unlock""; each gives you a +5% HP bonus.* Fidget seems extremely childish and annoying during the good first half of the main quest.* Dust don't know who he is and is looking for answers, which makes him sometimes angry because of mental pressure.* Ahrah is the blade which Dust is carrying. He speaks with Dust and advise him through the magical journey.* If you are on the map, you can watch upwards and see Fidget eating or sleeping on a tree bough.* You can forge your weapons; they aren't always buyable in the shop.Story.Pretty much this: Dust.The entire story is build around the main character which we as customers are playing. Dust wanders through the world and helps people. He seems to remember them all, but no one remembers him. You will interact in the world and you have up to three or four dialogue options.You will find many quests through your way in the world.A note here: It's a deep philosophical game; it handles about life and death and about his understanding in the world.Positives and Dislike.The only thing I dislike are the fact that self-made weapons aren't more gold worth, while selling, than the actual cost of forging it. It seems there are some troubles with my graphic card driver too (AMD Radeon HD 7650M).Q: What is your opinion on the Story ?A: 10/10Q: How do you liked the overall content (smithing etc) ?A: 10/10Q: Opinion about Quests and Dialogues ?A: 10/10Q: Is the combat system entertaining enough ?A: 10/10Q: Did you share tears at the end of the game ?A: 10/10Q: Would you buy a Fidget-puppet on amazon ?A: 10/10Q: Would you buy a wallpaper/drawing of Fidget gifting you a Fidget-Drawing ?A: 10/10Q: Do you recommend this game ?A: 10/10Q: Overall experience and commenting ?A: I love this game.

												This game encompasses everything I love about video games. The graphics are beautiful, the story is engaging, and the music draws you right in. This is, however, an action RPG/Metroidvania, so none of that would matter if the gameplay and level design wasn't up to snuff. Luckily, that's not the case. The controls are tight and snappy. Dust does exactly what you want him to do, when you want him to do it. Although more simplistic, I almost felt a Devil May Cry influence in the combat. It's action packed and relentless. The level design is varied and entertaining. I eagerly looked forward to what I was going to find on the next screen. The enemy designs were also quite good. The headless zombie things in the third section made me smile every time I saw them. The one complaint I have with this game is the same one everyone else has. The boss fights. While not bad, they just don't measure up to the rest of the game and they're definitely a bit on the easy side. But you should absolutely not let that one small thing stop you from experiencing this game.Dust: An Elysian Tail is just plain fun, no matter how you look at it. I can't wait to play it again on a harder difficulty once I get through some of my backlog and I'll eagerly await a sequel.9.5/10			"

I played with a controller, so I have no idea what it's like with a keyboard, but I found the controls to be tight with just the right level of finess required to get exactly the results you are looking for.Grinding for materials can be tedious, but more often than not, completionnists will find that they find better equipment than what they can craft, which makes the crafting system near useless, even though it's a nice mechanic to have.I loved this game!

												I had high expectations for this game and after starting it up at least once I could confirm and justify those terms. Now that I've played through it and completed the game to it's full extent I can honestly say that it really is an enjoyable experience.I'm seriously in love with the art style and the lush aesthetics which in my opinion add a lot to the immersion.. combat which is supposed to be one of it's best qualities is astonishingly captivating and dare I say it; visceral..? Add to that the RPG elements to give this game that addictive element of progression and the lust for exploration and you would be wondering what this game could possible miss out on - because from my POV everything else is just as great to say the least (characters, voice acting and the story which I really loved).In regards to MvG, the character Fidget may very well be the only thing that could be considered a dealbreaker to some people. I for one couldn't imagine why because I think she's a charming and very lovable character but hey: not everyone is into 'cutesy' things so I suppose her voice and dialogue may rile up certain kinds of people.Anyhoo.. Great game, I'm a sucker for it. For it's full price it's already a steal because I honestly think it's worth more. ◕◡◕			"

												Gameplaywise, it's straightforward : you have one sword and learn several moves throughout the game. I thought this would limit the gameplay, making it boring at some point, but it didn't. The game is relatively short if you decide to do the campaign only, and becomes longer if you decide to do the subquest. You can find equipment to upgrade your sword & be more competitive in fights. The game itself is really easy, if you wish for a challenge, directly jump to the hardcore difficulty, where you really die easily if you gets hit (my advice : don't try to speedrun it, use combos & dodge as much as possible).Graphically : it's a cel-shaded style plat-former, who really take inspiration into Don Bluth's An American Tail animated movie in terms of artstyle (they even made the same pun). At first I thought it would be a problem since I'm really not a fan of the furry genre (due to what the Internet did to it, mostly) but it really only took inspiration in the Don Bluth movie style and never try to sexualize the characters like you can see many games do whenever they try to add androgynous animal characters. So yeah, I really felt I was watching an old animated movie, with the same kind of message Don Bluth himself would be able to convey (about war, destruction of nature, etc...)The story is cute, it's nothing great but it's very cute, very well acted, and I appreciate the voice actors' effort in the play.One big plus for this game is the music : the music is absolutely fantastic, and one of my favourite soundtrack in videogame's history. Not even kidding.It's charming, it's fun, it's pretty. The music is beautiful.It is a wonderful tail... I mean tale.			"

												Dust is not a masterpiece. I'd say it's nowhere close to a masterpiece. The story is nothing special, the character art and designs are honestly fairly poor, and there were more than a few sequences I felt were just badly-designed. It's got its share of flaws, and its strengths don't completely make up for them. But for a game produced independently by a single man, it's still very impressive.The scenery is beautiful, the combat is fun (albeit not nearly as great as it sounds; the combat is, in fact, not difficult to master and does not increase in complexity from the beginning of the game), and it's an enjoyable experience. As a whole, the story failed to enrapture me, the characters didn't appeal to me (with the sole exception of Fidget, and even then, it's nothing overly memorable), but I still think I had fun playing it.This isn't a game I'd go out of my way to recommend. But if you're interested, you might as well give it a go.6/10. Above average, but not exceptional.			"

												Years back, I played a game called Odin's Sphere on Playstation 2. It was unique and I'm engaged by it, but I haven't got the chance to finish it as I already gave away my Playstation 2 . On the other hand, Dust: An Elysian Tail kinda makes that compensation.a.GameplayThe gameplay itself is not really complicated, but I feel it is a difficult to master kinda game. Timing is essentia for a counter-attack. Long story short, it has satisfying combat and rewarding quests.b.StoryThere was a war between a powerful race, who run a campaign to dominate the world, by crushing other weaker races to their ground. But then, there was someone, who mysteriously reborn to this world with an amnesia. War and a reincarnate? Is it a sign for something great is gonna happen?c.GraphicsDust has a cartoonish graphic, but that doesn't it's a bad thing. In fact, the graphic is beautiful and it's HD. For those who don't like cartoon graphic, you might wanna reconsider before buying.d.ReplayabilityMost of the time I enjoy the fighting, crafting better equipment, and do the side quests. There is no new game plus feature, but we can always start over with different stats build.Verdict:A mysterious man, who had recently born, fought to find his identity in a war situation, the struggle between the weak against a powerful nation.8.5			"

												This game... this game is easily the greatest game ever created in my opinion.  To be made by one man, with such beautiful art, solid game mechanics, and an absolutely amazing story with incredible charcters; it just is a work of art.  Never before has a game immersed me so much, made me love and cherish the characters like none before it.  This is a game that can be a challenge if desired, or it could simply be an immersive story.  You will learn the truth about Dust's past through an adventure with so many characters that grab your heart.  With Fidget by his side, and with her comic relief, you will slowly slip into an entirely new world.  Nothing can compare to it.  When you finally beat the game, you will feel as though your entire life has been changed forever, and can never feel like this again.  Ashes to ashes, Dust to dust...			"

(besides the soundtrack and voice acting, and I think some of the story too.)I'm not trying to say just because ""oh only one person made this game, that means it sucks!"" no sir that is not the case with this game! This guy truly did an excellent job!Once you get about 15% or so through the game, you will start to get more comfy with the controls and the gameplay itself, at least it was like that for me :PIf you like a hack-n-slash metroid/castlevania type of game with a little bit of RPG, some platforming, and excellent special effects, along with a good story, then this is the game for you!

												This game is a 2D sidescrolling brawler, where you play Dust. Dust wakes up with amnesia and a talking sword next to him, and a strange animal that is like a squirel mixed with a bat. They go on adventure to discover what happened to Dust. A single playthrough is about 10 hours worth of gameplay, more if you want to go for the full 100% playthrough. It incorporates a castlevania style of gameplay as well, where you learn new tricks to overcome particular obstacles. There is only backtracking involved if you want to find all the secrets and hidden bonuses. The handdrawn visual style of the game is fresh and I personally liked it. The dev-team did some special effects too, but they sometimes obscured the screen a bit too much. Combat feels responsive with gamepad, but I cannot say if this also applies to keyboard. Towards the end I found the combat getting repettitive and I was getting a bit bored with the end stretch of the game. Still, I've very enjoyed playing it and as such I can recommend it.			"

												I highly recommend this game.  What first got my attention for this game was the artwork.  And it is beautiful.  But then I found it's a 2D 'platformer' game, which I'm not that big on.  However I did enjoy Castlevania and some other reviews here likened it to that game too.  Then I learned that it was almost entirely done by a single person - animation, programming, everything, other than voices and music.  So then I was very impressed.  Especially with all the other very positive reviews.  So with it being on sale I went ahead and picked it up.And 70-some hours later I'm extreamly glad I did.  I still love the artwork, but have also fallen in love with the characters and the story.  Very enjoyable voicing.  I totally love Fidget (the Nimbat that looks to be a cross of a bat and fox).  There is a very serious and interesting story told, but also lots of fun and humor mixed in.  The fighting which you do a lot of was just fine for me.  Enough challenge to be fun and worthwhile, but not to the point of frustraition.  And the platforming is more exploration and puzzling than having to make pixel-perfect jumps, for which I'm glad.All in all, if this game even looks a little interesting to you, by all means pick it up and have fun.  Even at full price it's not all that much, but on sale it's a no-brainer. "

The story is very engaging and the anthropomorphic characters are enchanting.

												So this was a case of needing something to occupy myself with while my wife worked on her second and third playthroughs of Dragon Age: Inquisition, so I went through my Steam library looking for something I hadn't tried yet. After seeing that Dust was an RPG metroidvania I decided to give it a try.After playing this I'm realizing I have a fondness for metroidvanias; while Guacamelee is the golden standard against which I will judge them all (that and Symphony of the Night, of course) it turns out Dust was pretty decent. The art style was pretty, though why all of the characters were anthropomorphized animals (aka furries) is beyond me. It didn't really help or hurt the game, but it did take me out of it a little. Why do some of them wear clothes, but your sidekick doesn't?Speaking of your sidekick, Fidget, ohmygoodness is her voice annoying. The game is well acted, but getting past Fidget's voice is a challenge. That said the dialog is surprisingly funny. Fidget does work as decent comic relief, ""Why does it have knives for hands?! KNIVES FOR HANDS!"" The overall plot is meh (evil general with ambiguous motives is trying to kill off the natives - I mean Moonbloods) though I liked the section where you are helping people in Mudpot. I found those characters way more interesting.Gameplay is solid. Standard unlock-powers-to-access-new-areas stuff (though, again, nowhere near as awesome as Guacamelee). There's also RPG stuff such as leveling up and managing gear. You can find recipes and make your own gear out of stuff you pick up from bad guys. There's a nice mechanic where if you sell an ingredient to the shopkeeper then the shop will periodically restock that ingredient, so later when you find a recipe that needs it you don't have to go grind a mob.The game's difficulty was all over the board. Sometimes I would feel like I was burning through all of my healing items and revival crystals (generally when I pushed forward in the main questline without doing side missions/looking for all the hidden treasure chests) yet by the end I had zero trouble with the final boss. Seriously, he was a chump. Also not interesting. If you're going to have me empty a boss' health meter 4 times at least have him change forms or vary his attack pattern. Not that it mattered because, as I said, he was a chump. I didn't need to bother studying the attack pattern.This game was a pleasant distraction for roughly 10 hours (didn't collect EVERY item, but did get most) and was well worth my time (especially considering I don't even remember buying it). That said, if you're looking for a metroidvania and you HAVEN'T played Guacamelee then, obviously, play that instead. If you're a fan of the genre then this is probably worth your time.			"

												Dust is a 2-D hack & slash action platformer with RPG elements and branching paths, similar to the Castlevania series.  Unlike those games, however, Dust eschews heavy exploration and technical battles in favor of lightning-fast mobility and hordes of enemies that will often have the player racking up combos of several hundred hits as they leap from target to target seamlessly without ever touching the ground.APPROXIMATE LENGTH10 hours for the main story, plus another 10 for all the sidequests & secretsPROS(+) The combat system is magnificent both mechanically and visually: easy to learn, fun to use, and amazing to watch(+) Beautiful visual style in both backgrounds and sprites(+) Music is fully orchestrated and blends well with the settings(+) Complete voice acting for all dialog, with high quality performances all around(+) Fidget is adorable and hilariousCONS(-) Plot & dialog can get pretty melodramatic(-) Items & crafting system is little more than a forced burden(-) Animated cutscenes are of mediocre quality and feel out of place(-) Difficulty curve starts very steep, then overabundant healing items make the game too easyYOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY(?) All characters are anthropomorphic “furries”.  Some people like that.  Others don’t.OVERALLDust is a game that is just plain fun to play and experience, and feels very professionally made.  Has some issues, but overall delivers on what it sets out to do.			"

												A 2d metroidvania game. It looks wonderful and has great combat. The game will take you about 10 hours to play through. More if you want to collect all the  treasures.The combat is a bit easy though so I recommend playing on tough instead of normal.			"

												Enjoyable game. Great visuals, super sound and addictive gameplay. My only recommendation is that certain aspects of the game are a bit unfair, e.g. the plants that spit poison randomly, and sometimes the sheer confusion on screen that makes it difficult to avoid enemy attacks. On hardcore setting I found I was dying very frequently because I was losing so much health so as to die with a single blow and there didn't seem to be any way to avoid it. I also wished I could skip straight to a boss battle rather than having to manually skip the cut scene and dialogue when the first few attempts proved unsuccessful. These are minor flaws though. As an overall experience this is a treat. You can tell the game was made with a lot of love,  care and attention. Worth giving a shot.			"

												Best 2D game that i have ever played. Amazing story and interesting charecters that are seasoned with a bit of humor.Gameplay is mixed with fast and slow phase, while combat is extremely fun and fast, then roaming is a bit slow but they balance each other out and game feels very smooth. For the story i'l just like do say... experience it yourself, its something you dont want do miss.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a beautiful game. The art style is so entrancing that it's worth noting how easy it is to get drawn into this world before discussing anything else. Yes, it has anthropomorphic protagonists, but that really shouldn't keep you from giving this game a chance. The combat is tight and fast paced, providing some challenge without ever feeling overwhelming. I was able to get through most of the game without too much trouble fighting enemies, all of which match each location well and build a world you want to explore. I came much closer to 100%-ing the game than I ever planned to, because I had so much fun using the game's many platforming mechanics to explore every inch of each level. There are plenty of collectibles for people who enjoy that kind of thing, but if you'd rather plow through each level and just complete the story, you'll still have a great time. I do want to give the writing some credit here. While I can't say I was particularly surprised by where it led, the game does a great job fleshing out the characters and getting the player invested in uncovering the secrets that hide what really happened in our hero's past (yes, it's an amnesia story. Yes, it goes exactly where you think it will. No, that doesn't hurt your enjoyment of this game). The variety of movement options to explore the map are all fun and rewarding when you pull off each combo just right. I'm still amazed all of this was created by a solo developer. It truly raises the bar for a personal project like this.If I had to give a criticism, I'd say the ending is a pretty harsh difficulty spike. The final boss has multiple steps to it, and the final level is WAY more difficult that anything you've played to that point. It's not brutal, per se, but it does feel like a more gradual curve could have helped brace the player for enemies who know how to block your combos effectively. However, this is the most minor of nitpicks.I loved this game, and if you enjoy story-based adventure/platformers, you'll likely love this too. I couldn't recommend it more highly.			"

												Dust is a medium sized, hack'n'slash/platformer/RPG with big bucks behind (similar to what got the famous 2012 game, journey).The game graphics are rich and beautiful.  The animation is great. Dust animation is ""anime-like"" in contrast with the non-playable characters who get a smooth animation. The story is good enough for me. The sound (including voices) and the music (final fantasy-ish) are on the same high level. But I still wonder how they managed to draw such an ugly world map.The gameplay is relatively easy assuming you are patient enough to be grinding XP for levels. The gameplay will be boring/repetitive, because some stages are a bit too long, and many times, suffer from a lack of ""density of action"". That knowing you will have to re-run many stages several times with different abilities in order to acheive 100% completion... also there, you will be grinding XP for levels in order to make the game clearable.There is a common default in RPGs: either you miss levels and the game is super hard, either you did a lot of boring XP grinding and the game is super easy because you are way over-leveled. So the stages are calibrated to be reasonably clearable at a specific level: if you are below, it's unreasonable, if you are above, it's too easy. This balance issue should be addressed in all RPGs, here it's not the case then you are free to torture yourself like a masochist or get bored at over-leveling your Dust and then slice throught the game like a hot knife in butter.Technically, I got a few bugs (exceptions), and the controls felt slooooow/unresponsive in fight. It does run on linux based OSes with a recent mesa3D.On the overall, I do recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game on a sale, I can't rememeber how much I paid for it specifically, but whatever it was, it was worth it. Many games I am unsure whether to give it a posotive or a negative rating, but this game is without a doubt an amazing game. The graphics look beautifull, and although the voice acting sounds rather peculiar fo r the first few minutes, youi get used to it quickly and come to enjoy them.The gameplay works amazing ly with the smooth look of the game, and Dust is a lot of fun to control. The characters are really interesting, even Fidgett! I was not expecting much from this cheap buy, but it was worth every penny. The story was actually really driving, and the end made me feel incredibly happy. The build-up for it was great,The combat as previously stated was really fun, and it was always great to gain new abilities throughout the adventure. The areas can get a little boring and rather annoying, so I don't feel too happy about replaying the areas, however, this can simply be because I'm rather lazy. The fights can get a little repetative, but there is something specail about running about wrecking all your enemies around you.Overall, I'd give this game a 9.7/10, and say that it is a must buy. I just finished the main story, so I can not say muich about any content after that, but I will paly and see. I suggest you do the same.			"

												Okay, here's the short version of this review.This game is absolutely AMAZING!!!Now for the long version of this review.Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the most well-crafted video games I have ever played, and it's easily in my top 5 favourite games of all time.  The gameplay is insanely satisfying; any fans of hack-and-slashes or Metroidvanias will most likely enjoy this game big-time.  The story is well-written and surprisingly dark for such a colourful world, and the game puts a lot of emphasis on pretty much every character in the game, even the minor characters!The visuals of this game, in my opinion, might be the best I've ever seen in any video game.  This game's visuals are absolutely BREATHTAKING, especially when the weather effects kick in.  You will not believe how many times I was at a loss of words for how beautiful the game looked at times (you should've seen me when I got to Blackmoor Mountain XD).  As for the soundtrack, it's straight-up majestic.  The OST is beautifully composed, and help capture the mood for pretty much every scene they're assigned.The only complaints that I really have with this game are that the boss fights are pretty meh (with the exception of the game's final boss), but even then, there's so few bosses in the game that it's not a major issue; plus, the characterization given to the bosses is actually really impressive.  The only other issue I have with the game is that Chapter 3 is pretty pointless and, admittedly, kinda boring, but the rest of the game makes up for it in spades.So, long story short, if you have the money for this game and you're just staring at the store page wondering if you should click on that Add to Cart button, I'd say that you should.  Chances are, you will not be disappointed by this game.  I sure wasn't.9.5/10			"

												Gameplaywise, it's straightforward : you have one sword and learn several moves throughout the game. I thought this would limit the gameplay, making it boring at some point, but it didn't. The game is relatively short if you decide to do the campaign only, and becomes longer if you decide to do the subquest. You can find equipment to upgrade your sword & be more competitive in fights. The game itself is really easy, if you wish for a challenge, directly jump to the hardcore difficulty, where you really die easily if you gets hit (my advice : don't try to speedrun it, use combos & dodge as much as possible).Graphically : it's a cel-shaded style plat-former, who really take inspiration into Don Bluth's An American Tail animated movie in terms of artstyle (they even made the same pun). At first I thought it would be a problem since I'm really not a fan of the furry genre (due to what the Internet did to it, mostly) but it really only took inspiration in the Don Bluth movie style and never try to sexualize the characters like you can see many games do whenever they try to add androgynous animal characters. So yeah, I really felt I was watching an old animated movie, with the same kind of message Don Bluth himself would be able to convey (about war, destruction of nature, etc...)The story is cute, it's nothing great but it's very cute, very well acted, and I appreciate the voice actors' effort in the play.One big plus for this game is the music : the music is absolutely fantastic, and one of my favourite soundtrack in videogame's history. Not even kidding.It's charming, it's fun, it's pretty. The music is beautiful.It is a wonderful tail... I mean tale.			"

												6/10Overall I enjoyed this game. It's fun, the artwork is beautiful, and the story really comes together in surprising ways at the end.But there are a few complaints.The big one is the health system. When you level up, you can choose to upgrade your choice of four things, one of them being max health. There is virtually no point in upgrading your maximum health. There is no natural health regeneration, and there are no inns or any other sort of place that you can go to restore your health. Completing a level does not heal you. The ONLY way is by buying health items from a shop. 20 health costs 80 gold. Sure, you can buy an item that restores 40 health for 160 gold, or 120 health for 480 gold, but there is no discount as you go up. No incentive to buy better healing items. No reason to increase your max health until enemies literally one shot you.Moreover, the amount of damage the enemies do doesn't seem fair. They either do virtually no damage, or they do a TON of damage, but not much in between. So you are either just flying through an area virturally ignoring all the enemies, or you are using up all your health items in a five minute period.The voice acting isn't of the best quality either, which the exception of the main characters. When I talk to someone, I don't hear the character's voice. I hear a person trying to do a silly voice. As I talk to more characters, I can hear what is clearly just a small handfull of voice actors trying to do a bunch of different silly voices.Because of flaws like these and more, I wouldn't give the game a perfect score. But there is enough about it that IS done well that I will give it a positive score.			"

												Dust was by far one of the most engrossing games I've ever played. It fell a bit short sometimes then it threw me back in everytime. This was the first game to ever give me carpal tunnel, and make me call my PS3 Controller the 'n' word.The story was pretty good, and the characters were all rememberable and fun. I was told Fidget was annoying and I would get annoyed with her, but she eventually was a cute, caring partner character. Her skills helped me alot near the end of the game, and as for the game's end boss...Prepare your steroids and testosterone shots, babies because you're gonna have to become a ♥♥♥♥ing man, yo!I'd rate this game a 9/10. It's almost perfect but could of been a slight bit longer. I hope we get a sequel! That would make my life complete.			"

Its one of the few games with almost exclusively drawn content instead of CGI and gets the job memorably well done.At the same time, its also one of the few games where you can feel that the game has a soul and is not just a mass of coding for the purpose of making money off of the player. It is a story and it is art.The characters, their voices and personalities were chosen very carefully and even tho the whole of the game feels a little bit rushed and short from an old gamer's perspective, its a very memorable experience.If for nothing else, then i recommend Dust because i didnt think that games like these were still being made.

												Dust is a serious adventure RPG that can be turned way simple for easy fun / exploration, or way hard into true hardcore 2D bash-em combat with an impressive combo system that can do various types of attacks, from ground to slide to jump and much fancier aerial moves. The plot is relatively simple. You are Dust. You woke up in a field, not knowing yourself, when a sword... yes, a flying and TALKING sword floated up to you and addressed you as Master. Then Fidget, a Nimbat, showed up and wil accompany you on whatever quest you are supposed to go on since she comes with the sword. As you head toward the village in the distance hoping for answers, you hear fighting... Some sort of monsters are attacking the town, and you leapt into action... The graphics are quite good, sort of Disney-esque type animal humanoid that looks far cuter than it should for all its seriousness, about finding one's true self and all the war and attack and civilian casualties, and good vs. evil and all that. Sound is also quite good. There's some debate whether the protagonist voice sounds a bit too young, but sounds okay to me. (And you have to play the game to see why.)There are basically three attacks (later there's a fourth, the ground slide/kick) blade, dust storm, and Fidget burst. It is the combination that makes things deadly. Blade plus jump is an aerial attack. Blade plus jump plus dust storm yields an aerial super attack. Dust storm and Fidget burst creates attack swarm. As you level up each ability through EXP (via quests and kills) you'll gain additional attacks and combos. (On casual difficulty this is done automatically)You will also encounter various types of equipment: armor, amulet, left ring, right ring, and ""augment"" (weapon enhancement). You will often encounter blueprints to build more advanced equipment... provided you find the blacksmith and have enough materials. Some stuff are available at merchant. There are many sidequests in the story as you encounter more NPCs. Some will ask you to find X ingredients, while others want you to retrieve something or someone, or reach a particualr area and search for something. Doing them yields extra EXP to level you up. Other activities that yields EXP are just talking to every NPC you come across (but you only get that once). There are special ""treasure chests"" in the world for you to find, and most involve some sort of a puzzle. Usually it is to pull a ""bombfruit"" toward an alloy gate to blast it open, but the bombfruit can be at a challenging place so it can be difficult to pull it properly esp. when the bomb fruit may come with a timer (after X seconds, kaboom!) There are also special ""friend chests"" (12 of them in the world) for you to find as you unlock your ""friends"" captured in the cages. It's another type of collectible, but a fun one. As you learn new skills, such as floor slide (to get through narrow low tunnels), double jump ( to reach extra high places), iron grip (to climb the vines) , you will discover new areas you haven't been able to reach before, and often that is how you find these extra treasure chests and cages. So exploration is a must. You will be told percentage of areas you missed and/or treasure you missed, so don't fret. The game autosaves when you pass through a ""save point"" (temple) which also heals you. You can also trigger a manual save on a savepoint. The savepoint also serves as a teleport point that allows you to leave the map region, if you bought some teleport gems (not that expensive, and you did get a few for free). The game never felt too frustrating, except the problem of opening up a certain area before you are ready. For example, there's a mission where you need to find a girl in the ""Hidden Cove"", except you can't explore that area unless you have Iron Grip skill, which is only available at the end of Sorrow Meadows. The game doesn't always make this clear. There are also some quests that are a bit too whimsical, or even on casual, way too difficult without advanced skills like double jump. However, if you are the type that goes for every bit of completion, you will no doubt feel frustrated now and then, even on casual. There are also six ""trials"", sort of a ""speed-run"" through a certain level where you try to take as little damage as possible, while fighting your way past monsters and environmental hazards. And they award high level equipment, depending on how well you do, with rating of up to 4 stars (depending on score). All in all, Dust is a very good game that, IMHO, looks way too cute for its own good that people will have problems taking ti seriously. If you can get past it, you will find a rewarding action-adventure with good puzzles and challenging bash-em on higher difficulty levels.  "

												This game is uniq and charming. I've found some flaws buit a game made by a single person this is to be expected. Well for one is the blocking move is not explained right, which will give you a hard time first. Hold to block not Click to block. The other thing is that it is damn easy to control. I personally recomend rebinding the keys to a more DOS style, also deactivating the combination alt+shift under windows.Well another thing I didn't loved to much was the story, it was so cheesy but the characters are pretty well. I expecially love the Blacksmith Haley. I just love girls with big tools and doing some 'Manswork' they should put that more often into videogames.But I tell you , you will still enjoy the story because it has allot of charming moments. And it is not as cheesy as a a Disney Movie and those are awesome.Also the game just makes so much fun to play, even if it's so easy it just makes fun when everything starts to explode and you feal so skilled when you just punch the keyboard like a maniac and punch all this buttons to fly trough the sky slashing hords of enemies down.Oh and for everyone who doesn't like furries, there are no references made to this fandom as far as I am aware. It is clean tradition cartoony fun just with Antrophormotic Animals.			"

Managed to get it for £2.99 in  a recent sale but would have been happy with the full price knowing how good this game is.I really loved the story, the combat does start to get a little repetitive later but the story is so good you just want to carry on to see it play out. I would certainly recommend getting this in a sale, but full price is perfectly reasonable too.			"

												My apology for not writing a review for this amazing game in the past, for some reason it escaped me.I just noticed the game is on sale 5/24/2014 and I STRONGLY recommend it even at full price. JUMP on this now, if you already haven't been blessed by getting to own and play this spectacular experience.  It pulls off amazing combat with cool abilities to string attacks together, you'll feel like you are flying through the air a.k.a. ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" combat style...and while this happens you will enjoy beautiful music and graphics that are top notch...imagine Disney/Pixar quality in the best way.  Some people will tell you that this is an Xbox port but I believe that the author has stated that this game was originally written  on the PC.  I personally prefer to use a controller to play but it works with mouse and keyboard.  There is a lot to this game and you can go back and discover things that your character wasn't previously powerful enough to handle.  Combat is so fun repeating some areas does NOT feel grindy or boring at all.  Its hard to say that this is ""the best platformer on the pc"" because its so much more than just a platformer.  You really need to experience the amazing and fluid brawler/combat...Although button mashing will get you a little ways, you really need to have finesse when you play.  Adorable characters, amazing story...I hate to give things a numerical rating but in this case I'll give it 99 out of 100.  There is a LOT to this game and plenty of gameplay...the only reason I didn't give it 100 is I don't know if there will ever be that absolutely perfect game but this one is a razor's edge close to it. Once again--do yourself the favor of buying this game.  Encourage the developer to bring us more fantastic games.Not sure on this:  This game was somehow written by ONE person (and I believe he hired people to do voiceovers and music) but not certain.<3 Dust An Elysian Tail <3 "

												One word to describe it? Mindblown.The moment I saw the screenshots and trailer for this game, I knew this game could be something special and I was ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! To put it simply:1. Story? Great story that both young and old audiences can enjoy.2. Characters? Very lovable characters (expect for the obvious ""bad"" guys lol) and I really like that most of them had ""side quests"" when talking to them and not just have them standing there, talking to you once and never hear from them again. I found myself revisiting a lot of them frequently, solving their issues as well as being rewarded for completing those side quests. Definitely love this approach!3. Graphics? Simply BEAUTIFUL/GORGIOUS WORLD with stunning views in almost all areas. While admittedly it took me some time to adapt to it (especially while running and fighting enemies), I got adapted to it rather quickly and have thoroughly enjoyed every level I played not just for the story/fights but also for observing the surrounding beautiful landscapes as well.4. Music? Absolutely brilliant! The music was calming at times, intense at other times, but it was always fitting to the scene and really helped get me totally ""immersed"" in the atmosphere of this great game!5. Fighting? Very fluid and you get more abilities (as well as power-ups for your companion ""Fidget"") as you progress so that you can revisit old areas and unlock hidden chests in areas that you weren't able to reach previously. Though, my ONLY ""criticism"" of this entire game is that, while you get new abilities/power-ups, you do NOT get any ""new combos"" as you progress, meaning you are stuck doing the SAME combos over and over again from start to the end of this game. So as a note to developers, for future similar games, please add more new combos to decrease the ""repetitiveness"" of killing the enemies with the same old combos over and over again.Nonetheless, the one criticism above does NOT have any major impact on my enjoyment of this game. Definitely a ""must-buy"" for those who enjoy stories that are told in an old style ""cartoony"" fashion with FULL VOICE ACTING for all dialogues as well as those who just enjoy side-scrolling fighting games in general.Final Rating: 10/10. (And hoping for a FUTURE SEQUEL to this game as well! :D)			"

												Oh my god this game is a masterpiece beyond belief. This kind of metroidvania gameplay is phenomenal and so loose-flowing with the controls. Fighting is at it's smoothest with the amounts of combos and other dangerous attacks Dust has at his disposal. The story's solid, and it goes through a lot of different forms of losses that most games capture most of the time, but not at a scale like this. I only have a few problems currently. Dialogue does tend to drag on a bit, though it's a very minor nitpick and skipping it is an option. The difficulty in all four modes aren't really present unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, but even then all the handed items (like wall chicken) makes that mode easy. Lastly, the leveling gap in the final area is very obvious to note. Even without grinding to cap and getting good items, it felt like something was missing.Hopefully the development team makes a sequel to this game. It was by far my most favorite in 2013!			"

It has a unique setting, a lot of secrets to find (with a lot of freedom: you can always go back to find the ones you have overseen or you couldn't get to) and two amazing main characters (Dust and Fidget). Yet there were some apsects in the game that I didn't like; for example the very simple leveling system,  some parts of the story or those mushrooms shooting spores with a random timing.

												First and Foremost, while there are a large amount of support staff, this game is largely the result one man's work.  Dean Dodrill did a phenominal job bringing this to life and while I'm usually not willing to give leniance to games simply because of they have a smaller dev team, I feel this game is worthy of an exception.The game is quite pretty and you can tell that Dean's first love is animation.  There is beautiful detail in a lot of the work and the environments ooze character and personality.  It's the kind of art direction that a larger studio would never really get 'right' because Dust's art is the result of a singular vision, not designed by a committee.  While the artistic front is not as polished and as jaw-dropping as say, Ori and the Blind Forest, it's definitely a strong point and again, for a single person who kinda just wanted to do animation, it's nothing short of fantastic.The combat is fluid, fair, and manages to feel pretty good.  The mechanics follow a lot of the standards that are expected in a action-combat game.  While the game feels pretty good to play, it lacks depth and has a lot of contextual actions that trade fine control for ease of combat.I bought this game because I wanted to find a 2D Devil May Cry and I learned a something playing through Dust:  DMC is hard to make.A game like DMC4 has systems are ultra tight and provide a platform for the player to do amazing things if you invest the time to learn them.  It has a skill ceiling that might as well be infinite due to the shear number of options you have as a player, and as difficulty ramps up, the game will expect you to use those options with a kind of fluency that takes hours and hours to master.  Dust does not have that kind of depth.  A lot of the combat systems aren't perfect.  Attacks in the air kind of auto-target anything close by, sacrificing player control at times when you'd rather not.  You can lock almost every enemy into an infinite loop of uninterruptable damage in a couple different ways, none of which are terribly difficult to perform.  Bosses have pretty predictable patterns that are easy to abuse and instead of fighting a dynamic fight that requires action and reaction, you are kinda stuck just doing 'the thing that works'.There are a few other problems with the systems in place.  Attacks that would kill you will leave you at 1 HP as long as you have at least 50% of the HP the attack would do.  This means, that healing past that threshold is a mistake, and that max HP is effectively worthless.  You get bonus XP based on your combo, but you can farm combo with your secondary attack from your friendly NPC and since combo isn't damage, but rather hit count, it is in your best interest to keep her damage as low as possible while you just spam a screenwide AoE, allowing you to easily push your combo to several hundred with just a handful of monsters on the screen, which translates to easy levels.  There are a lot of counterintuitive systems that are ripe for abuse.I was kinda hoping for a game with as tight of design as a modern DMC and I didn't really get that, but regardless, the game is a fine entry in it's own right.  Despite their flaws, the mechanics aren't frustrating and as long as you go into the game with the right expectations, You'll find an enjoyable experience.			"

												Since I see a lot of in depth reviews i will keep this one short and simple. For an Indie platformer this game is amazing.  I highly recommend this game. I even got this on sale during black friday so if you see it on sale for christmas (coming up very soon) buy this. Great story, awesome combat, 10/10. This is a must have.			"

												Bought the game on sale for $3.74. Was addicted from the start. I hacked and slashed my way the past few days, and when I checked I already put 18 hours into the game (I made sure to go back and get all the little treasures).The game is a little repetitive, very easy even when put on tough, but overall it is a fun hack-n-slash game with a storyline that I found fairly exciting. Definitely not a bad way to spend $3~.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tale is a beautiful game that has interesting characters,  a well developed storyline, and an incredibly responsive and fun combat system. I have yet to be able to blame the game for any of my deaths. Everytime you die it's more likely your fault than the game cheating you out of progress, Whether or not it's because you didn't allocate your energy for that moment or you just overall mess up, it's rarely the game's fault. The game has a combo system and encourages you to get combos for bonuses. The game is well developed, fairly well written, looks amazing, and is a fantastic port from console. I like it.			"

												I've played this game only for about 1.5 hours, and i can already say this game is worth your time. It is a brawler 2-d fantasy RPG with shops,skills,levels etc. The combat is smooth and feels great, especially when you chain long combos and use different moves. The story is captivating and the art style is candy for the eyes. And on top of all that, to know that the game has been made by a single man is just mindblowing.			"

												Dust is a very well balanced mix of metroid and castlevania with a brawler-like combat system and rpg elements. The story is well implemented, and supported by a great soundtrack, beautiful art and fun gameplay. The game mechanics are solid with a great leveling system, that rewards high combos in a intreresting way and fine-tuned controls. Usually when a game delivers a solid story it lacks good gameplay, but here I was intrigued the whole way through. But Dust delivers on both ends. It also encouraged exploring the levels using the abilities you learn throughout the game in very clever ways. It's difficult to find anything to complain about. Dust does everything it needs to do right and more. One of the best games I've played in recent history and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys gameplay from brawlers or metrodvania games, or even someone who just enjoys aesthetics and story. 9/10			"

												Beautiful and insanely fun. Brought a sense of trippy but childlike euphoria of smashing creatures to pieces with an over-sized sword. I was disappointed to reach the end — this really sucked me in, I really wanted to play more. I wanted to live more of the Dust fantasy.Some emotional rides throughout, and fluid action all the way to end, leading up to one huge and unforgettable finale. And a narrative from an amazing animator/voice actor/artist - Mick lauer, AKA: RicePirate — thought that was a worthy mention. Much love to the guy.Like colours and beautiful world design, who doesn't? This world is far from flat.Like fun? Need I say more?Hope this just about wraps it up for a first review.			"

												The short version: I would consider this the side-scrolling equivalent of Okami. It's beautiful to look at; elegant controls; robust skill progression; an original, well-told story; and a fitting soundtrack.Having experienced the evolution of gaming from the Commodore 64/Odyssey days through today, playing a game that is inspired by previous generations, be it in terms of graphics (the glut of 'pixel' art games) or gameplay (sidescrolling/platforming) is a hard sell for me.Dust: An Elysian Tale blew me away. The story was engaging, with plenty of memorable characters, and surprisingly voice acted. The art style, whether you are talking about the beautifully hand painted backgrounds, the smooth combat animations, or the anime style cutscenes, all fit together perfectly, with each location a treat to look at.I would buy this again in a heartbeat, and hope, one day, to return to the world of Elysia.

												A wonderful game with a beautiful style, loveable characters, and addictive gameplay. I honestly can't think of a single negative thing to say about it; except maybe that it ended in a semi-cliffhanger and I wish they'd release a sequel already! If you enjoy action-platformers with some RPG elements added in, this is one you can't afford to miss, especially considering the low cost. It's a lot of fun, the story is wonderful, the character interactions are charming, the graphics are beautiful and colorful, and the game itself is thoroughly glitch-free in my experience, unlike many other games I've played these days.

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is an action side-scrolling platformer game with a very fluid combo system and well animated attacks, giving the player a sense of simply being awesome in combat. I've played a lot of games, but nothing is quite as unique as Dust. The game gives the player the ability to move freely throughout the world, going to whichever areas they so desire to rack-up XP, explore or find hidden secrets in past levels. The story in Dust is one surrounded by mystery, the protagonist, Dust, starts off with amnesia and cannot recollect a damn thing about his past, which I know is very cliche but it suits Dust's story just fine. The protagonist is alway accompanied by a cat-ferret-bat creature by the name of Fidget (who is also the cutest damn thing I've seen since Tali in Mass Effect), who offers humorous dialogue and grants the player a ranged attack. To clarify: I f*cking love Fidget.Dust's combat system flows beautifully, utilizing a mere three buttons for attacks, the combat is simple but at the same time awe inspiring, easy to pick up on and very well made, when the player whipes out his/her first batch of enemies you immediately feel like an incredible badass and leaves you itching for more. As the game proceeds you acquire new abilities that complement your already formidible attack options and keep the game from getting stale, all the while maintaining a steady difficulty curve alongside an easy to understand XP and level-up system.Graphics-wise: It's an indy game, you don't come into it expecting mind-blowing graphics. Dust uses a simple but lovable anthropomorphic cartoon art-style that is both charming and outright adorable, but also dark and serious when it needs to be. All perfected with an amazing musical score and top quality voice acting. As well, Dust makes numerous quips at the expense of the fourth wall and makes references to other games, like Resident Evil 4 and Castlevania. The one flaw I've seen thus far is a somewhat finicky platform system. Sometimes if you don't land on a platform at exactly the right angle you're going through, which in a platformer game is a real kick to the groin.In conclusion: Dust: An Elysian Tail is fun, fluid, and highly addictive. I definitely recommend anyone reading this to pick it up immediately.			"

												with simplistic graphics and combat, this game has become one of my absolute favorite Story-based games.  Although this game is hugely combat based (it could be argued that it is a brawler) the story is very well synced with that fact.  I absolutely LOVED the story, from start to finish.that aside, what really makes a game is what makes it fun, right?  so, yea..the combat.ohhhh the combat.MY GOD!  IS IT GOOD!This has got to be one of the best 2D combat engines ive ever had the pleasure to play with.  ESPECIALLY for an xbox to pc port game (its never this smooth).  although i find it hard to get into single weapon games, this one did it right by giving you a versatile arsenal of combos and manuevers that make even the cannon fodder fights really fun.  whats more important, though, is that the combat engine is SOOOOO responsive!  i can scarcely believe how much this indie title outclasses so many larger developer titles with its combat engine.IT IS PERFECT.there is plently of room for petty personal complaint, but as far as pure, solid fact goes, the combat in this game does EXACTLY what it's supposed to.  there are zero bugs with it.What I truly love about this game, though; aside from the entrancing story line and exciting combat, is the art.  and take that word loosely, because im talking the whole spectrum.  The animation for character and level design is beautifully done!  The music is absolutely breathtaking!  this game itself, is a work of art as far as videogames go.  It was created and brought to life by one man over 4 years, and you can easily see the passion and talent in his work.this game is much like the older castlevania and metroid games (metrovania?), and in my personal oppinion, if it had been released in that generation (give some modesty to the graphics and sound qualitly, of course) it would have been an instant classic.  There is no circumstance in which i can justify not telling you to buy this game at its current price of $15.  i would easily pay twice that price for a game of this quality.One of the best, most fun games ive played in recent years.

												Moderately fun side scrolling hack and slash plat forming RPG game. Played on the second hardest difficulty with a usb playstation controller and it took about 10 hours to beat it just doing the main quest line. About 2 hours of that was just grinding because I didn’t bother with the crafting system so my gear wasn’t that good. The enemies are not that difficult until you get to the last area. The greatest challenge came from the platforming as jumps were often very difficult to make. Your regular jump often does not reach high enough so you have to attack in mid air to get that extra height boost, but this makes sticking your landing in the right spot more difficult. You also often just randomly fall through platforms when you land on them which can be frustrating. I also had to restart the game on several occasions because I would just randomly fall through and get stuck inside of walls. The good thing is there are a lot of save points so even if you get stuck you don't have to restart that far back. The story line/dialog is kind of cringey, but I just skipped most of it. The environment looks pretty nice, but sometimes it is hard to tell what you can jump on or what hurts you as the background and foreground kind of blend in with the main area at times. I wouldn’t recommend buying this game at full price, but since it was included in the humble bundle 11 you can probably get it for cheap.			"

												A bit Castlevania, a bit Devil May Cry, a bit Secret of Mana. This game takes cues from good games old and new and combines them with modern sensibilities and original design to create something great. Beautiful visuals and memorable characters punctuate a touching story of a character with a conflicted origin, crossing both tragedy and epic heroism as the protagonist of the story, Dust, crafts his true destiny. Dust starts with little more than a vague recollection of times long past and quickly finds himself in a position to help those in need, and through his travels learns of dark deeds that have sunk the land into an oppressive sorrow, as well as his role in this situation, both past and present. Many would turn a blind eye or side with those who hold power, but there's something different about this one...It's well worth the paltry price being asked, if you enjoy broad gamplay and exploration. A combo system that allows you to juggle entire spawns of enemies and fly around like a madman, as well as tag team attacks allowing you to amp up your signature attack and become a human lightning rod, are combined with an action RPG leveling system and metroidvania exploration. Beatiful hand painted levels beg you to explore them and find every little hidden secret, with a surprising level of detail hidden around every corner.			"

												I bought this game at a severely reduced price during a sale. If I had any idea what playing it would be like, I wouldn't have minded paying full price. $15 USD is a STEAL for a game this fantastic.I wasn't 100% sold on some of the voice acting at first, but then I took a step back and realized just how amazing it is to have a fully voiced 2D game to begin with. Dust has voice acting throughout, for the main character, and every other character you meet, which really aids the immersion in the world.The combat is fun and exciting, and even though it teaches you most of what to do, there are little quirks that you need to discover on your own as well.The story (what I've played through so far) is interesting, and makes me want to find out what happens next.PLAY THIS GAME!

												11/10 Bashed a rock column with a talking sword and a prestine, fully cooked, ready to eat, roasted chicken fell out when it finally crumbled. Review is edited because this one wouldn't actually post:But in all seriousness...I bought this game for the Xbox360 when it first released, when I had heard it was released for the PC, I didn't hesitate to buy it again, at the full price. Yep, this game was valuable enough to me to BUY IT TWICE.How this game, made by ONE person specifically for the Xbox360, gets a better PC port than most Triple A titles just goes to show the lack-luster effort devs with literally hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal throw at trying to satisfy their customers. One guy was able to do it better than an entire team of hundreds of people.This calls back to a time when games were made by gamers, for gamers - for enjoyment. Not by Publishers, for money - because f**k you. The game basically sells itself.People look at cliches with a stigma of ""It's bad"" when really most stories are just variations of the ""Seven Basic Plot Points"". Without revealing too much you've got: Generally quiet, withdrawn protagonist with memory loss, with the comedic relief side-kick and a literal facist antagonist. If you haven't stopped reading this review by now, buy the game dammit.As for the Genre, it's a heavy mix of Side-Scroller, Beat'Em Up, with some RPG leveling aspects in the background. This is a game you play for the gameplay and the story, not the genre itself, of which Dust: An Elysian Tale can't really figure out which category it's in.Speaking of gameplay, it's more akin to well, Halo's difficulty curve - veteran Halo players will know that Legendary isn't that difficult once you figure out the technique. Enemies hit hard, and have more health the further you push it up. So people looking to be an unstoppable force should start the game on Normal, it's easy enough. The biggest jump between difficulties is that Checkpoints regenerate less and less health the harder the difficulty. 100, 50, 25, and 10 percent respectively from Easiest to Hardest. Once you find an item that regenerates your health, you just go AFK and wait for Dust to heal while you grab a snack or something. I mean you could use all that food you've collected/bought - but why would you? Gotta save that resource, of which you have no limit to the number of items you can hold, all the way to the end of the, by which time you've beaten it and went through like all 14 hours of the game without eating a damn thing while, considering the moves you can pull off, Dust has to be burning like 10000 calories an hour here.Infact, that's probably my one critique, having to handicap yourself to make the game more difficult, even on the hardest difficulty. ""BUT REACH IT SAYS YOU HAVEN'T BEAT THE GAME ON TOUGH OR HARDCORE."" You got me skippy, I haven't... it's one of the few games for the Xbox360 I have to be completely finished for all achievements, back when it was released.Other things I should probably address:-""REACH, I SEE ANTHROS IN THE TRAILER AND THUMBNAILS UP ABOVE."" It's the art style, honestly, I think anthropomorphic characters suit the design and direction better anyway. Pay no attention to it, the characters, save the talking sword, talk mostly normal save a few monologues. This isn't some spat-up Tumblr/Deviantart Anthro R34 garbage. Just by playing the game you can see the time and effort the creator dumped into making this game.-""Reach, why are you posting this review so late in the day if you bought it all the way back when?"" I rarely post steam reviews, and only for game I consider to be extraordinary. This was on the front page because of the Steam Summer Sale, 2016 and I went ""Huh, I should post a review on that, it's a good game.""Ending notes:-Buy it-It's awesome-Lots of fun-Good story-Great gameplay-Feel the effort put into the game-Find all the goodies and extrasFinal thoughts: Didn't get poisioned at all on my first run through of the game. Second play through got over confident and finally got poisoned. Found out there was dialogue for being poisoned the first time. Purposely get poisoned first chance I get for the dialogue. 9/10 missed opportunity first time around.Talking sword said I shouldn't cause an avalanche. Flying nimbat said it was the only way to climb further up the mountain. Protagonist agrees with flying nimbat, not the sword he uses. 8/10 would tell Arrah to f**k off agian.Mouse guy named Avgustin is totally Canadian no matter what anyone says. 10/10 best game ever, most accurate portrayal of a Canadian.Game has hologram projectors to talk to a black smith that can somehow transport materials I'm carrying with me, along with money to the Blacksmith at the top of a huge hill and send them back to me whereever I am. Still only have a sword as a weapon. 7/10 want my Shotgun for fighting zombies.I bashed a metal flying aircraft with a sword, hooked it by the tip and slammed it into the ground. 10/10 MGS Revengence ain't got♥♥♥♥♥♥on Dust: An Elysian Tale.Wet suit has better defense stat than a Chain Mail vest. 3/10 no realism.

												Alright-y. I have just finished the game with roughly 14 hours worth of playtime, and oh boy what a game. I loved it. The world was deep and rich with lore, all the characters were well rounded with ample story to give them plenty of life. The main character is well thought out in terms of his purpose and what makes him special. The game can be rather changing and isn't afraid to bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥♥if you aren't ready for it. And the in game secret challenges were well thought out and hard. For a long time I struggled with healing items making it a real challenge fighting all the enemies (specially the bigger ones).  Sometimes I struggled with the direction I had to go and I think that might just be because I was thick. The backdrops and scenery are GORGEOUS they are made so well and there is one in particular that was very eye catching (Giant♥♥♥♥♥statues).The bosses were amazing, and really challenging, especially the last boss he was a real challenge and I found it very fun to verse him even though I had to burn through all my healing items (even on normal holy♥♥♥♥♥♥. However it would have been nice if as I was fighting him the health bar didn't completely refill after every little story moment, it would have been far better to make one health bar and have it drain far slower then in the X number of times you have to fight him after a story moment (I wont tell you how many), both was though do tell you roughly how long the fight is going to go, my way leaves it less a mystery however. I thoroughly enjoyed the music and ambient noises (save for the mansions after you had to do a little running) and the voice acting was top quality though 2 or 3 voices had gotten a little grating at times.Overall it is a great game and I highly recommend it if you love side scrolling fighting games. The mechanics are just right for the game and the way it introduces it to you is just right, just watch out all that clicking may warrant a new mouse (Or J, K and L Keys). The music is perfect and the lore is able to pull you in and keep you interested in the world you are fighting for.9.6/10P.S. I have more hours then this. I just don't have a constant internet connection.			"

												This game. Is ♥♥♥♥ing FANTASTIC. Oh my god.So it's an excellent, well-designed side-scrolling action RPG with a well-designed, well-polished combat system and awesome graphics, and it runs smoothly on even my garbage 4-year-old laptop. But the real selling point is the storyline. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the storyline. Riveting, well-written, YEARS ahead of what you'd expect from an indie action RPG.Also, quests, a cool, new level-up system, and Fidget.Fidget, the little orange creature seen on the cover of this game, is a selling point on her own. She's cute, funny, she's not just there for fanservice, she actually helps you learn the game mechanics and helps you through the storyline. And she's shaped like an ancient sex goddess. She ♥♥♥♥ing radiates sex appeal in everything she does.Buy this game. Seriously.			"

OMG is it responsive, i mean, it's a nightmare to play a action/hacknslash game that's not responsive to what you want to do, but i was more than surprised to find out this game has amazing gameplay. The story is a bit cliche but still pretty good, and the graphics are just gorgeous. 100% recommended.			"

												Dust is a great action RPG game. It has decent story and good amount of secrets to uncover. It has  a lot of influences from the old Metroid games from the map system to the ""come back when you have the ability to climb here"" kind of stuff.I really liked the crafting system, and the side quests give that good extra to the game.The one thing that bugged me a lot was how easy it is, the battle resumes itself as a compulsive button smash craziness. Even the bosses doesn`t require any level of extra ability. Many are even easier than a few regular monsters. If you want some challenge start off at least in hard mode.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a truly special game.Done in the style of hand-drawn animation, while playing it I couldn't help feeling like I was back in my living room watching the Saturday morning caroons of my youth.  I did experience some display issues (flickering on the screen) but if you're like me, a child of the 80's,  and you experience it, I recommend pretending that you're just watching a well-worn VHS tape.  For me, that just added to the experience and even made it all the more endearing.The story is compelling and you'll likely get sucked in and want to play this exclusively until you get through it.  There are some fun Easter Eggs that you can unlock as you go along as well.  Additionally, the progression is nicely paced between leveling up and the gear that becomes available throughout - I never felt like Neo until the very end despite rarely feeling like I was in danger of dying.I chose not to 100% this game becuase I wanted to save myself some aggravation.  The collectables can be quite challenging to get (or even to find) but there is a wealth of information out there online should you choose to go that route.Between the nostalgic feel and comfortable gameplay, I would recommend this game to anyone.

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a very cool sidescrolling Action-Adventure/RPG. It has a unique setting, a lot of secrets to find (with a lot of freedom: you can always go back to find the ones you have overseen or you couldn't get to) and two amazing main characters (Dust and Fidget). Yet there were some apsects in the game that I didn't like; for example the very simple leveling system,  some parts of the story or those mushrooms shooting spores with a random timing. But in the end the game as a whole was a very pleasent experience for me.			"

Don't let its XBLA origins fool you, the PC port is flawless, and playing with mouse/keyboard is just as smooth and responsive as a controller.  This game gets so many things right, and honestly, my only gripe is that there is no sequel yet.			"

												Simple, joyous, fun in a wonderfully crafted package. This game has a great deal of heart and though put into it, both of which have been sadly lacking in most independent studios rush to market these days. Every part of this game sings, from it's simple practical platforming to it's top-notch voice acting, to it's combat. The combat will start simple and eventually have you flying through the sky hurling lightning bolts, throwing airships, and striking 800 hit combos. Yes!A note: I held off on playing this game because of the setting. I do not generally enjoy this style of animation, or anthropomorphic animal protaganists. But this game's superior writing and acting absolutely won me over. I played it non-stop for three days, and now I'm sad it's over. Give it a try.			"

												A very nice game is every aspect.The story is well written in my option. Some cases you can see what is coming a mile away and some you don’t notice until it hits. It flows and should you want to stop the main story and explore some of the side quest it doesn’t stop you. There is only I do believe 21 side quest in the game. But some take a while and others not that long. There is a Yen and Yan ordeal all around the main character, which makes it interesting.Graphics have a neat art/graphical design to it. It is in a way kind of like an anime color to some areas bright and other dark. It is in I do believe a 2d side scroller is what it is called.Character design was also very well done. You will find yourself most likely liking the main character dust and his side kick figet. As well as many of the side characters. They all have their own personality set to them, despite there not being that many other npcs in the game. It makes it worthwhile to just hear what each on has to say. When leveling up your character you get to choice from 4 major areas to level up. My only complaint in this area is the fact that you couldn’t raise a skill more than 4 times without leveling all the other skills. You had to keep all your skills within 4 levels of each other. So you can’t just max out attack or defense if you choice. You will also find yourself looking for better equipment most likely if playing on hard or high difficulty. It has the rpg element to grind mobs for money or items to upgrade or buy better and stronger items.Combat is fun but takes a little getting use to if playing on hard difficulty. It can get a bit addicting in some cases. Especially if lining up combos of over 200. Take note no you are not killing 200 enemies. You are chaining attacks together on 1-6 enemies and possible moving onto the next group while keeping that chain. Depending on you attack damage you can chain bosses very high. Some areas you can run into up to maybe 20+ enemies but that is if you just run past everything and let it follow you.Voice acting is done really well also. Some will say it’s nothing special, but I’ve heard plenty of voice acting in full games that just don't compete with this game. It has a neat art workReplay ability is a little bit of a different story. There is not a lot that will change if you play and start a new game. Only one quest in the game can be changed, depending what choice you choose. Other than that, everything else will play out the same. Not that hard to get all the achievements if you’re looking to get 100% in the game. You could power run though the game in a few hours if you desired, but I took me time and explored and hunted down everything in the game. It took me around 18 hours to complete cause of that. The game is also easy to pick up and stop within minutes of starting the game with save points never being too far away.Difficulty can range from very easy to very hard. Should you wish to play it for just the story but still enjoy the combat, you can set it to easy. This will allow you to die as many time as you wish without hurting your characters progress, story, are the combat you are in. Only drawback is you lose your current chain. Personally you need to set it to hard to even get a challenge out of it. This will make death permanent and you will be sent back to your last save unless you have a revivable stone. Which should you need to you can buy them from shops which have unlimited amounts. You can see all the time the developer took into making this game with the amount of settings and design that went into the game. This game was mostly done by one person over the course of 4 years.  He needs a pat on the back for making such a good game. Really this is how good games should be. Over all this is a great game. And well worth the time and small investment depending if you buy it at full or on sale on steam. In the end you will definitely be tipping your hat to the author.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a side scrolling beat em' up with beautiful 'hand painted' backgrounds, and an exciting story about an amnesia-stricken warrior fighting his way through many unique environments to try and remember who he is.Though the game starts off with a Shadow the Hedgehog vibe, and the dialogue can be sorta cheesy (At least Fidget's, who fits in as the over-excited side kick who doesn't stop talking), it branches away from the ""edgy furry confused with the world"" as the prologue progresses, and Fidget sorta grows on me.Update:After finishing the game, I can safely say that it was amazing. I didn't finish all the sidequests/get all the treasure yet, but I have about 14 hours on the game. Pretty good amount of gameplay for the money I spent on it. (On sale for $3), but even if I bought it at normal price, it would be worth every penny. The combat in the game is pressing either the right and left mouse buttons, or J and K. All of your attacks will be done with these keys, and you can with dodge/dash forward with Q and E. I've seen people complain how the combat gets stale, but that's not true. Each enemy is designed to be fought a certain way, and you're forced to think strategically when fighting many of them at once. One enemy can be killed with simple melee attacks while the another enemy will parry all of your attacks, and you must strike him right as he's about to attack in order to land a blow on him. This can prove difficult in the later rounds, but it also keeps the game interesting.My only real complaint about the game is the boss difficulty. In Normal Mode, the bosses are not that hard. The first boss is one of the easiest intimidating bosses I've ever fought, so I was a bit disappointed, especially because he's a key part of the story. You'd think he'd prove more difficult to fight. Each boss, obviously gets harder to fight, and the final boss fight is very satisfying in terms of difficulty. But the difficulty in general seemed too easy, but perhaps I'll just need to replay the game on Hard mode.To conclude;The story is great, the designs are great, and while many people will ignore the game solely because of the animal characters, I'm glad I gave this game a shot. The combat is exciting, the enemies are unique, the environments are beautiful and the story is compelling. While some bosses are too easy ( or I'm too good :^) ), the Final Boss stands as quite a challenge, and defeating him rewards you with an ending that truly settles the dust.I'd give it a 9/10, I highly reccomend it.

												Forget ""for the price tag"" or ""for an indie game"", Dust: An Elysian Tail is an amazing experience which really reignited a passion for gaming that I wasn't sure if I had any more.This is not an 'artsy' game, although it does sport some of the best artistic direction that I've ever seen in a videogame, accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack. The story and characters, whilst kept behind gameplay in priority, are likeable and easy to follow. A few inconsistancies here and there, but an enjoyable experience with enough sidequests and secrets to keep you playing for 20 hours, easily.The mechanics are tight -- if you die, most of the time you're going to feel like it was your fault rather than the game cheesing you out of a death. I only played on hardcore mode, because I found the difficulty on this level was at the perfect point between challenging and tedious. One of my few gripes about the game is that the save spots could have been more considerately placed. I often found that after dying, I was re-doing tedious but simple parts of the game. The save spots should be after the tedious but simple parts, not before them. I want to re-do the part I died on, not the three screens before it (here's to you, Sorrowing Meadows).I did run into two possibly Linux-only issues, one was some sound distortion in certain areas of the game which required me to reduce the volume, and another was an issue with one of the secret rooms not displaying correctly. I e-mailed the developer about the latter issue and within an hour, had a response saying it is being looked into this week.The game's difficulty curve is brilliant, introducing new concepts and abilities as the game goes on so as not to overload the player with one of those half-hour tutorials which most of us skip. The first area is easy, and the final boss will challenge all of your mechanical abilities. I suggest starting on the highest difficulty level and working your way down if it's not enjoyable, it feels like Dust was designed to be played on hardcore.There is plenty of endgame content, as I'm finding with over 20 hours played that I still find things to do and treasures I haven't found yet. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game, and struggle to recall the last time I had this much fun playing a videogame.Thank you, Humble Hearts. I look forward to the next one.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tale is one of the best side scrolling action platformer out there! It features a great story, some rpg elements and some metroidvania style upgrades! You control Dust on his quest to find who he is and you are accompanied by 2 quite colorful characters, the blade of Ahrah, a sentient artifact sword that has a serious and mentor-like character and that you use for combat, and Fidget, the guardian of the sword and a comical character overall, she will make you giggle quite many times!Firsts things first! The visuals are marvelously pleasing, an eye candy of sorts! The animations for both Dust and the enemies feel fluid and clean making combat a good feature instead of a filler through the story parts. The sounds and music as well as voice acting are right on point making the game an even greater gaming experience. To add to that the story is really compelling as you will find yourself, quite many times, in a spot where you will want to play just a bit more to uncover the next part. To add to that it’s the type of the game where I didn’t want to finish, as the gameplay, along with the story left me with a void when I finished it.The main features of the game is its combat and exploration. The combat can be as easy or as demanding as you like, as the games difficulty affects this aspect only. Easy difficulty will result in enemies dying easily and doing less damage as well as you healing at check points, while higher difficulties can result in certain enemies being able to kill you if you don’t counter at the right time. Generally you have your base attacks and combos that you can do with Ahrah, and with Fidgets help you can unleash a powerful duststorm that will serve as your aoe attack. Small and normal sized enemies, besides bosses, do not require any special approach. However bigger enemies, like rock giants and trolls, can be a threat! Shield wielding enemies are immune to frontal attacks and since they will always face you, you need to counter their attack in order to stun them. While stunned all enemies take a lot more damage, so countering does feel rewarding no matter the enemy!  If you want that extra satisfaction from this game, I recommend higher difficulties for your first playthrough.As you progress the game you will earn experience and upgrades for your skills. Experience is gained from completing quests, main or side, talking to characters and by killing enemies. Additionally while you kill enemies you can chain hit them, resulting in a combo meter, after the combat ends you will get additional experience depending your combo meter! Each level up will give you a stat point that you can use to increase 1 out of 4 base stats. Attack, Defense, Health and Fidged (yes she is actually a stat too!). The first 3 are obvious to what they offer, Fidget on the other hand increases the potency of your aoe, the duststorm. Personally this was my favored stat as I used duststorm a lot and because you will find gear that sadly overshadows the increase one skill point adds to that stat.  Also as you venture the lands of Elysium you will encounter certain shrines that will either augment a skill or give you a new one, skills like sliding or climbing are in this category. Finally after each major boss you will get an upgrade for duststorm, giving Fidged a new element for it! The cool part of this system is that you get to visit older areas, that were previously had an exit out of reach, to find secrets or easter eggs and the challenges! The challenges are hidden rooms with speedrun courses. You do not have to ace them to get the reward but if you like the challenge you can try get those 4 stars! All these are marked to your map, so you can see each areas completion and where is something hidden, the twist is, that besides that info, you do not have detailed map of each area, so you need to explore it yourself!The controls are easy to grasp and fully customizable, keyboard or controller. Having tried both I did not find a more favorable, it depends on your playstyle!The only negative of the game is its crafting feature. Throughout the game you will find blueprints for gear that once you gather the materials required you cab craft. However quite many times the vendor offered the best version for a slot or even after making a good gear for a slot, inferior gear and blueprints dropped. Generally I did not get to use the crafting system that much since I rarely got an actual upgrade.Overall, Dust: An Elysian Tale is a great game, and a game that definitely is worthy of its price! I recommend it with my eyes closed!-------------------------------------------I reviewed this game for the steamified group.For similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com "

												Probably the most cliched, hackneyed story ever. The gameplay is pretty repetitive and degenerate, and there are numerous extremely exploitative mechanics that make the game's challenges ridiculously trival.It's cute, I guess, but extremely overrated. The hand-drawn art is actually pretty bad, with the exception of Fidget. I feel like much more effort was spent drawing her than every other character in the game. The other characters have really awkward proportions and look really terrible. Dust looks OK until he takes his hat off or you look at him from any perspective except the ones shown in the normal dialogue windows.Criticism aside, onto the good points. The gameplay looks really good. For all the mediocre drawing, the ingame character art works really well and the particle effects look nice. Visually the game can get very cluttered and noisy, but the individual elements look really good.The voice talent is really good. Fidget's voice actress (who is also Miss Fortune from Skullgirls) really executes the character well. Dust's voice actor is, for the most part, really well-executed too. The other characters aren't quite as well-done, but this is probably due to fewer takes than it is a lack of talent on the part of the actors and actresses. The main issue with the voices is really that the writing is so terrible that it's impossible to take the characters seriously.The best parts of the game are in the middle, when the characters aren't talking about anything serious. The lightharted banters are really the strength of the game. Unfortunately, this is hampered by the repetitive and exploitable gameplay.Dust's moveset is very limited, with only three ground combos and one air combo. In total he has a whopping 5 different options total, including both in the air and on the ground. Most of his moveset is obsoleted by Fidget, whose spells can be comboed with Dust's 'dust attack' to unleash completely absurd magical hell all over the screen. Her magical power can be amplified so much that the final boss can be defeated in only a few spells without ever requiring any risk even on the hardest difficulty setting.It's hard not to recommend this game though, if only because of what this game represents. I'd like to see more games like this, with a bit more polish. It really shows that the game was created by one person, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. I do hope that the people behind the game observe the failings of this title and go on to create newer and better things.			"

												I am a fan of side scrollers since I have been introduced to gaming itself. I grew up on them. Dust: An Elysian Tail takes me back to those glory days and more. Beautiful graphics, great story line, the fighting system is pretty nifty as well, play this game on anything above normal difficulty and it feels pretty darn challenging, leveling up and items equipable feels solid, Only bad comment I have to make about this game is that it's not the type of game one can play over and over again, atleast not for me, but that's not what defines this game after all. Get this game. You will not be disappointed			"

												This game is a jam-packed adventure game with a great artstyle and story. I'm a personal fan of the character called ""Fidget"" and their very interesting personality. This game is full of side quests, too. There are many different rewards you can also get form the quests. Many of the NPC's in the gane are interactive and may give you many tasks too complete. I love this game and it's many counter-parts.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail starts off with a very simple concept, yet it stands up to what it promises.Speaking of the gameplay, it's platforming mixed with action fighting.The fighting system is rather simple, you have a few skills need to learn to use in the right combination and situation considering the hazards around you and the enemies you're facing. Especially on higher difficulties, you really want to know what enemies can stagger after how many hits, or when you need the energy to dodge instead of using Fidget attacks. Knowing your surroundings is mandatory as you need to manage your movements while fighting. The attacks and combos are limited, but that means you have less to work on, and you need to make the best with what you have.The platforming parts are fun, but they can get really annoying, especially on higher difficulties: Playing Hardcore from the start, I found myself loading and repeating the same sections lots of times, since the damage the obstacles deal are increased with difficulty. I guess it's my fault for making a mistake if I land on a spike, but when I find myself in front of unpredictable hostacles, I can't really be blamed, since the lack of regular pattern just made me jump towards my own death, or sometimes you'll find yourself stopping a jump in midair to avoid that obstacle falling on other ones (Like Mudpot mushrooms and Mountain icicles). Another annoying thing was the trials: fun challenge, but a restart option would have been nice since you need an almost perfect run to get 4-star ratings, instead of having to clear the whole course just to get another shot at it.The classic RPG-styled system for EXP, gold and items is nicely managed. Except for the huge boost you get from almost-end game items, the character build up speed is just right to keep a good challenge if one doesn't stop grinding at the first obstacle. The only problem I could find is that you'll need to buy usable health items even if you're in a town, where there could be a classic inn to fill up your health bar (I found myself buying from the town store after clearing a dungeon where the only damage I got was from the last rooms, usually containing bosses).The game experience in general is quite astonishing. There are some clichés here and there, but the storyline and ambience are what really got me.  Trying to understand who the protagonist is during the main quest, how he behaves, Fidget, the rising climax towards the end of the storyline really got me glued to the screen. The variety of landscape, ambients, enemies, and weather are simple yet effective addictions to an original art style. Some sloppy animation during cinematics, but consindering what I just said, it's not a big deal.Intriguing storyline after the amnesia cliché starts developing, Fidget, exciting gameplay, original art style, Fidget, variety of characters and landscape, Fidget... If you have the chance, give it a go, you won't regret it. I'd say a solid 9/10			"

												Initially I got it because I liked the Castlevania-like mechanics, but it rapidly escalated to something else. The game has high production values, not only in the amazing graphs, but in the beautiful cut-scenes it presents. The mechanics are nice and simple with a very well managed learning curve. Even more, the game allow you to beat it pretty much following the story and without having to farm (grind) much, which also talk about how good the balance is.As I am more of a story-driven player, I must say that the Story is what captivated me the most. It is fragmented and it starts binding as the game progress, making, full of plot twists and beautiful and sad moments. Nevertheless it is also full of funny moments and puns.			"

												Dust is an action platformer in the ""metroidvania"" style.  I really enjoyed this game.  The story has melodrama, and lightheartedness.  The combat is awesome, but repetitive at times.  There's a bunch of pieces I could nitpick at, but when it's all said and done I not only enjoyed myself, but also embarked on more difficult playthroughs. Overall, Dust is worthy of attention and I'm proud to back it.  When you play it, say hi to Haley for me.			"

To be made by one man, with such beautiful art, solid game mechanics, and an absolutely amazing story with incredible charcters; it just is a work of art.  Never before has a game immersed me so much, made me love and cherish the characters like none before it.  This is a game that can be a challenge if desired, or it could simply be an immersive story.  You will learn the truth about Dust's past through an adventure with so many characters that grab your heart.  With Fidget by his side, and with her comic relief, you will slowly slip into an entirely new world.  Nothing can compare to it.  When you finally beat the game, you will feel as though your entire life has been changed forever, and can never feel like this again.  Ashes to ashes, Dust to dust...			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said a bunch of times:  Just get the damn game!!!!!  Dust is what a fun 2D platformer is all about.1)  It has a story.  It doesn't break new grounds, but most games don't.  With that said, it is told not only well, but at the right pace.  It doesn't drag, nor does it race along.  It has a well though out plot, and an ending that will stay with you.2)  It makes you explore.  It isn't the most complicated map, but it has enough visit and revisit spots to keep those of us that like to find everything happy.   There are several spots on map and moving to and fro is quick and painless.  The places themselves get progressively more difficult to initially spot where hidden treasures are, but not mean spiritied or impossible like some games I could name.3)  Voice acting.  It doesn't stand out at all and from me that is the greatest compliment.  I can't stand VA that is so over the top, or the opposite that is just so god awful that you want to turn the sound  off and read subtitles.  The VA meshes perfectly with the story.4)  Artwork.  It is a nice blend of cartoonish hand painted with effects mesh.  It is also a perfect fit for the feel of the game.5)  Combat.  Combat is easy to as hard as you wat to make it with the different combos, but definitely forgiving.  It's not meant to be a brutal test, but it offers enough of a challenge to be satisfying.6)  Fun Factor.  So many platformers have zero replayability, especially story driven ones.  You finish and move on.  I played, replayed because I missed a couple of achievements, and then played again just to enjoy.  This is a game that will stay in your library as an old friend that you will just have to re-visit every once in a while.Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hard game to challenge you this is not the one.  If you are looking for an absolute joy of an experience do not pass up this game.  I can't wait to see what's next from the dev's!!!!!  Cheers!			"

												Dust is a 2-D hack & slash action platformer with RPG elements and branching paths, similar to the Castlevania series.  Unlike those games, however, Dust eschews heavy exploration and technical battles in favor of lightning-fast mobility and hordes of enemies that will often have the player racking up combos of several hundred hits as they leap from target to target seamlessly without ever touching the ground.APPROXIMATE LENGTH10 hours for the main story, plus another 10 for all the sidequests & secretsPROS(+) The combat system is magnificent both mechanically and visually: easy to learn, fun to use, and amazing to watch(+) Beautiful visual style in both backgrounds and sprites(+) Music is fully orchestrated and blends well with the settings(+) Complete voice acting for all dialog, with high quality performances all around(+) Fidget is adorable and hilariousCONS(-) Plot & dialog can get pretty melodramatic(-) Items & crafting system is little more than a forced burden(-) Animated cutscenes are of mediocre quality and feel out of place(-) Difficulty curve starts very steep, then overabundant healing items make the game too easyYOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY(?) All characters are anthropomorphic “furries”.  Some people like that.  Others don’t.OVERALLDust is a game that is just plain fun to play and experience, and feels very professionally made.  Has some issues, but overall delivers on what it sets out to do.			"

												Quite the charming game, the amount of love and care that has gone into its production is evident from the off. Behind the very impressive graphical schmaltz is where the true beauty of the game lies, though. The controls are fluid and very responsive, the storyline is surprisingly engaging and many of the characters, even the bit-part players, are extraordinarily likable. Others you'd quite like to kick through a wall but the game sadly doesn't give you that option.In short, a side-scrolling adventure platformer perfect for fans of such titles (think Metroid, Castlevania etc.) younger players and, er, furries.

												This game is superb. If you are looking for a great indie 2D action platformer, this is a game to get. The game mixes level-by-level gameplay of older side scrolling games with secret hunting and exploration of a metroidvania.  Fuse that with a combo system that actively rewards the player with bonus XP for playing skillfully and you have one amazingly fun action-platform-metroidvania-brawler-whatever-it-is-but-who-cares-it's-great. The first thing that will hit you is the amazing hand-drawn art and animations. This is an absolutely beautiful game to behold. The voice acting is a bit spotty at times but overall, well executed. The bomb sprout puzzles are a bit tedious but so satisfying when you solve them, bosses were way too easy but still fun none the less, some of the diolague can be excized as it outright tells you a puzzle solution, but it doesn't handhold so often that it becomes patronizing, and the ester eggs are just adorable. I haven't found half of the secrets this game holds, so there's still a lot of stuff left for me to do. But, I did complete the story; I will not spoil the ending but I will say it is an ending that leaves lots of mixed emotions, but in a good way. TL;DR the game isn't perfect, but no game is. This is the most fun I had in a 2D game since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Some nitpicks here and there but those could be attributed to the fact that the development team was one person, and a multi-man team could have made more mistakes than fixed them. Overall, this game is a 9/10, one of my favorites, and it definately deserves the overwhelmingly positive reception it gets.			"

												Excellent platformer. The visuals are outstanding. Each location is gorgeous. The crafting system, while limited, is simple and wields worthwhile results. The story is entertaining with moments are sadness. The revelation of who Dust is was unexpected and creative, an outcome that worked extremely well with the story being told.The combat is simple and enjoyable, though it does grow repetitive and tiresome after a while. It's basically hack and slash your way through everything with a few special moves thrown in.The voice acting is solid, though a little over-acted at times. Fidget added a lot of humor to the story, though some people might find her high-pitched voice annoying.It's a very linear game but as you progress and gain new abilities, you are able to go back through levels and acquire treasures. The treasures aren't particularly mind-blowing, though I did get an excellent ring at the end. Most of my best items were acquired through crafting. I finished the game without 100% completing all the treasures, but never felt a need to go after them. By 7-8 hours into the game, I just wanted to finish, due to the repetitive combat. The last area or two did mix things up a bit with increasingly difficult platformer aspects. My game froze repeatedly with one glitch in the Abadis Forest. It wasn't game-breaking though would have prevented 100% completion. Other than that, the game ran excellently on my PC. XBOX wired controller for Windows worked great. Seemless switching between controller and keyboard/mouse, but I did play exclusively on controller.  "

												I'm not a fan of sidescrollers. I'm also not a fan of furries. This game has both of those things, though I can say without a doubt that it's the best purchase I've made so far on Steam. The art is beautiful, the voice acting is acceptable, the controls are solid(yes, even with a mouse and keyboard), and the gameplay is spectacular.If you missed out on this whilt it was ~$4, get it anyway. I would definitely pay full price. This game is a masterpiece, and everyone should give it a chance :)			"

												Just.... WOOOOOW!Dust: An Elysian Tail is a side-scrolling hack'n'slash game, and for me, an awesome one.First of all, the graphics: they are just purely beautiful and colorful, the quality of design (maps/player/enemies) is perfectly looking like a drawn picture or anime/cartoon and nothing is ♥♥♥♥ed. Each detail is cured very nicely (foreground same as background and everywhere else on screen) and levels are all nice, even thou' they are all different (rain, snow, villages,...)Now, the controls: they are easy to understand and handling is really fast (keyboard+mouse same as controller). Action time is not boring after some hours passed on it.Lets talk about the music now: and it is great point of the game. its music and ambiant sounds are clean and perfect. You play with a quiet and magnificent music, zen and close to lyrical register. Ambiant sounds (rain, thunder,...) are very realistic. And the last point, the story: Story looks great, characters are attractive and beautiful and Dust (the main one)more than anyone else, 'cause he does not know his past... What will happen?Of course, there is a good humor in it (and also some litlle bad words :P) but you will appreciate close to all characters (except that Gianni, I still got problems to like him after the first met).Conclusion:[/b][/i]In other words. This is one of my new favorite games! A real love at first sight (and play if I can say like that ^^').Really, I recommand that game if you like scrolling games with anime/cartoon animations. It is a very delighting game, a true pearl for eyes and you can just stay on levels just for hearing the music.Then, if you play at it, just ENJOY IT! ;) "

												Nothing much to addThe game is a marvelous piece of art. Although the storyline is relatively straightforward and perhaps predictable, its gameplay makes it up for it. As a Metroidvania, you are continuously being challenged of revisting areas once you have unlocked new skills. However, this doesn't mean you can't try it without acquiring the skills. The majority of hidden secrets and/or treasures in each level is designed that it can be visited when not having the right skill. Having the right skill does make it easier on the other hand, but less of a challenge. Had enough of visiting areas? You can always try to think of practicing your skills by chaining your combos. Besides its gameplay, the soundtrack is extremely well done. Each piece of music fits the moment making it a great enjoyment for the ears when walking through the same area again due to backtracking.However, the game does suffer from a couple of small glitches. Interaction windows popping up while being far away from the shops or savepoints and in battle does hamper the game a bit. While not necessarily gamebreaking, it might be experienced as a nuisance when trying to chain a combo hit.Conclusion:For a game that has been written, programmed and drawn by one single person is an amazing feature. Even more amazing is that all elements in the game fit perfectly together: the gameplay and the OST are very well thought and executed. However, it doesn't mean the game doesn't suffer from some minor glitches. Interaction windows that unexpectedly pop up might be a bit annoying, but are not necessarily gamebreaking.Pro:+ Great OST+ Amazing art work+ Challenging gameplay: difficulty can be adjusted when necesary+ Good level design: majority of the secrets can be reached early in game for a bigger challenge. Having the adequate skill later in game facilitates reaching these secretsCons:- Game suffers from minor glitches at times- Storyline is a bit predictable			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of ""Metroidvania"" style exploration-based action adventure games. This game is most reminiscent to me of Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia in how the game is split up into multiple explorable areas linked together by a world map (as opposed to it being just one huge map like many of this style of game have). Also, as with this style of game, backtracking is a must as there will always be some section of the map or hidden chest that you just can't reach without one of the additional abilities you'll learn throughout the game. But they do make it easy to figure out where you need to return to thanks to a helpful map system.Fluid animation, great art style and voice acting, and an engaging narrative also give this game a high recommendation from me.

												You will often find, among gamers and critics alike, diverse opinions that state the positives and negatives of various games, with things such as ""the game is good"" or ""the game was too short"" or ""the controls suck.""This is not the case with Dust: An Elysian Tail.  I have been a gamer my entire life, ostracized as a child in school by the very people now addicted to Call of Duties and Madden NFLs.  I have watched the evolution of gaming from the 8-and-16-bit era of Mario and Sonic, the evolution of PC gaming from text based RPGs to DragonAge and Skyrim.Of all the games I have played, from casual Runescape to the intensely cerebral Europa Universalis, from the flashy twitch gaming of Smash Brothers to the thought-out fights of Guild Wars.  ""Dust: An Elysian Tail"" is by far one of the most defining creations in the Gaming Industry.  What makes it more spectacular and amazing is the story of a single man hand-drawing and developing the game from scratch over years, of an indie developer given a chance on Xbox Arcade.Dead Dodrill has brought to us a game that, in collaboration with secondary writer Alex Kain, and composers Alexander Brandon and HypderDuck Soundworks, defines everything we love about gaming.  He brings us back to the core elements of a video game.I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that Dust: An Elysian Tail is, by far, the greatest representation of Video Games as an Artform.  If there ever any confusion or concern if games could be consider Art, Dead Dodrill has proved us otherwise.No amount of praise I could give would satisfy my love for this game.  For 17 years, Blizzard Entertainment's Starcraft franchise has held a special place in my heart as my favorite game of all time.  Upon completion of this artistic masterwork, I can say that this has changed.Dean Dodrill, Alexander Brandon, and everyone else that not only made this game possible, but brought it to the attention of the general public.  I thank you, and I heartily reccommend this game for anyone.			"

												I was pretty surprised by how good this game was. The combat is fluid and dust is easy to move around, making finding secrets and defeating bosses more a matter of skill than trial and error. The food and crafting systems seemed a bit superfluous but also added a little Korean charm to the game. The percentage and mapping system also make it easier for completionists to keep track of what areas have been thoroughly explored. My only real beef with the game is that the character design is sort of deviantart-esque and the dialogue can get a bit cringey with certain VA's. Worth picking up if you like metroidvanias!			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said a bunch of times:  Just get the damn game!!!!!  Dust is what a fun 2D platformer is all about.1)  It has a story.  It doesn't break new grounds, but most games don't.  With that said, it is told not only well, but at the right pace.  It doesn't drag, nor does it race along.  It has a well though out plot, and an ending that will stay with you.2)  It makes you explore.  It isn't the most complicated map, but it has enough visit and revisit spots to keep those of us that like to find everything happy.   There are several spots on map and moving to and fro is quick and painless.  The places themselves get progressively more difficult to initially spot where hidden treasures are, but not mean spiritied or impossible like some games I could name.3)  Voice acting.  It doesn't stand out at all and from me that is the greatest compliment.  I can't stand VA that is so over the top, or the opposite that is just so god awful that you want to turn the sound  off and read subtitles.  The VA meshes perfectly with the story.4)  Artwork.  It is a nice blend of cartoonish hand painted with effects mesh.  It is also a perfect fit for the feel of the game.5)  Combat.  Combat is easy to as hard as you wat to make it with the different combos, but definitely forgiving.  It's not meant to be a brutal test, but it offers enough of a challenge to be satisfying.6)  Fun Factor.  So many platformers have zero replayability, especially story driven ones.  You finish and move on.  I played, replayed because I missed a couple of achievements, and then played again just to enjoy.  This is a game that will stay in your library as an old friend that you will just have to re-visit every once in a while.Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hard game to challenge you this is not the one.  If you are looking for an absolute joy of an experience do not pass up this game.  I can't wait to see what's next from the dev's!!!!!  Cheers!			"

												Initially I got it because I liked the Castlevania-like mechanics, but it rapidly escalated to something else. The game has high production values, not only in the amazing graphs, but in the beautiful cut-scenes it presents. The mechanics are nice and simple with a very well managed learning curve. Even more, the game allow you to beat it pretty much following the story and without having to farm (grind) much, which also talk about how good the balance is.As I am more of a story-driven player, I must say that the Story is what captivated me the most. It is fragmented and it starts binding as the game progress, making, full of plot twists and beautiful and sad moments. Nevertheless it is also full of funny moments and puns.			"

The art style is beautiful (the backgrounds and the chracters are extremely pretty), and the story itself is great.

												I really enjoyed the game ""despite"" the gameplay issues I mention below. To be honest the atmosphere simply sucks you in and the mix of platforming, combat and RPG works out quite well. Positives- A game with a signature mechanic which looks and feels very, very cool. - A good amount of combat and platforming. The latter becomes increasingly trickier.- Stunning graphics. Basically all of them are hand-made. - Great music and voice acting is well-done.- Cliché story (homage to retro games) with a good twist.- A good mix of serious and cheesy/funny dialogues.- RPG Elements such as customizing your different pieces of armor. Upgrades are available throughout the entire game. - Very gamer-friendly mechanics. No material grinding or unnecessary backtracking! - Talking to NPCs is literally rewarding as each dialogue grants exp - and often a side-quest. - Opening treasure chests is fun as each of them requires you to beat a mini-game. - Completing the game grants you a rather unique reward!- Many Easter eggs and references to older games.Negatives- Gameplay... is the biggest issue as the combat becomes very repetitive. 1) Spamming two moves is not only the strongest, but also the most-exp-earning move in the game. 2) The main character doesn't learn any new combat moves. 3) Later on in the game, most of your regular moves will be blocked, so we're back at 1).  4) Intermediate and chapter bosses don't feel that much different from regular mobs. - ""Normal"" gamemode is not challenging at all, even for average players like myself. There is no difficulty spike. I'd recommend playing it on a harder setting from the very beginning. - 1 mandatory BS Indie game secret (which the game openly admits with a cutscene). - Only one coin of the story is shown. Unfortunately the other half was cut due to time pressure (more information available in the post-mortem which you can find on the discussion boards). "

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a beautiful game. The art style is so entrancing that it's worth noting how easy it is to get drawn into this world before discussing anything else. Yes, it has anthropomorphic protagonists, but that really shouldn't keep you from giving this game a chance. The combat is tight and fast paced, providing some challenge without ever feeling overwhelming. I was able to get through most of the game without too much trouble fighting enemies, all of which match each location well and build a world you want to explore. I came much closer to 100%-ing the game than I ever planned to, because I had so much fun using the game's many platforming mechanics to explore every inch of each level. There are plenty of collectibles for people who enjoy that kind of thing, but if you'd rather plow through each level and just complete the story, you'll still have a great time. I do want to give the writing some credit here. While I can't say I was particularly surprised by where it led, the game does a great job fleshing out the characters and getting the player invested in uncovering the secrets that hide what really happened in our hero's past (yes, it's an amnesia story. Yes, it goes exactly where you think it will. No, that doesn't hurt your enjoyment of this game). The variety of movement options to explore the map are all fun and rewarding when you pull off each combo just right. I'm still amazed all of this was created by a solo developer. It truly raises the bar for a personal project like this.If I had to give a criticism, I'd say the ending is a pretty harsh difficulty spike. The final boss has multiple steps to it, and the final level is WAY more difficult that anything you've played to that point. It's not brutal, per se, but it does feel like a more gradual curve could have helped brace the player for enemies who know how to block your combos effectively. However, this is the most minor of nitpicks.I loved this game, and if you enjoy story-based adventure/platformers, you'll likely love this too. I couldn't recommend it more highly.			"

												Dust is a medium sized, hack'n'slash/platformer/RPG with big bucks behind (similar to what got the famous 2012 game, journey).The game graphics are rich and beautiful.  The animation is great. Dust animation is ""anime-like"" in contrast with the non-playable characters who get a smooth animation. The story is good enough for me. The sound (including voices) and the music (final fantasy-ish) are on the same high level. But I still wonder how they managed to draw such an ugly world map.The gameplay is relatively easy assuming you are patient enough to be grinding XP for levels. The gameplay will be boring/repetitive, because some stages are a bit too long, and many times, suffer from a lack of ""density of action"". That knowing you will have to re-run many stages several times with different abilities in order to acheive 100% completion... also there, you will be grinding XP for levels in order to make the game clearable.There is a common default in RPGs: either you miss levels and the game is super hard, either you did a lot of boring XP grinding and the game is super easy because you are way over-leveled. So the stages are calibrated to be reasonably clearable at a specific level: if you are below, it's unreasonable, if you are above, it's too easy. This balance issue should be addressed in all RPGs, here it's not the case then you are free to torture yourself like a masochist or get bored at over-leveling your Dust and then slice throught the game like a hot knife in butter.Technically, I got a few bugs (exceptions), and the controls felt slooooow/unresponsive in fight. It does run on linux based OSes with a recent mesa3D.On the overall, I do recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game on a sale, I can't rememeber how much I paid for it specifically, but whatever it was, it was worth it. Many games I am unsure whether to give it a posotive or a negative rating, but this game is without a doubt an amazing game. The graphics look beautifull, and although the voice acting sounds rather peculiar fo r the first few minutes, youi get used to it quickly and come to enjoy them.The gameplay works amazing ly with the smooth look of the game, and Dust is a lot of fun to control. The characters are really interesting, even Fidgett! I was not expecting much from this cheap buy, but it was worth every penny. The story was actually really driving, and the end made me feel incredibly happy. The build-up for it was great,The combat as previously stated was really fun, and it was always great to gain new abilities throughout the adventure. The areas can get a little boring and rather annoying, so I don't feel too happy about replaying the areas, however, this can simply be because I'm rather lazy. The fights can get a little repetative, but there is something specail about running about wrecking all your enemies around you.Overall, I'd give this game a 9.7/10, and say that it is a must buy. I just finished the main story, so I can not say muich about any content after that, but I will paly and see. I suggest you do the same.			"

												An absolute treasure of a game. Incredibly fun and immersive and tons of quests and replay value. The combat is fun, fluid and comprehensive.  The worlds are beautiful and diverse with interesting enemies and creatures. And one of the best things is honestly the charactes. It's got a diverse cast of cute characters with great voice acting. And the story is very memorable. Very few flaws whatsoever. All in all I'd say this is a near perfect game. Definitely recommended. 9.8/10			"

												So, first of all, this is my first review.Difficulty: Normal; 17h played; lvl 46 - 47Something to the game and the chars.* The game is a 2D World in the art of the Trine game-series.* Each time you left a map-square, it will respawn (endless farm & lvl potential until maximum ?).* The combat system is simple but is entertaining; you have some combos you can easily do like jump hit 3 times and right click to throw your enemy to the ground, especially good in the late stage in my opinion.* There are 12 (?) friends you can ""unlock""; each gives you a +5% HP bonus.* Fidget seems extremely childish and annoying during the good first half of the main quest.* Dust don't know who he is and is looking for answers, which makes him sometimes angry because of mental pressure.* Ahrah is the blade which Dust is carrying. He speaks with Dust and advise him through the magical journey.* If you are on the map, you can watch upwards and see Fidget eating or sleeping on a tree bough.* You can forge your weapons; they aren't always buyable in the shop.Story.Pretty much this: Dust.The entire story is build around the main character which we as customers are playing. Dust wanders through the world and helps people. He seems to remember them all, but no one remembers him. You will interact in the world and you have up to three or four dialogue options.You will find many quests through your way in the world.A note here: It's a deep philosophical game; it handles about life and death and about his understanding in the world.Positives and Dislike.The only thing I dislike are the fact that self-made weapons aren't more gold worth, while selling, than the actual cost of forging it. It seems there are some troubles with my graphic card driver too (AMD Radeon HD 7650M).Q: What is your opinion on the Story ?A: 10/10Q: How do you liked the overall content (smithing etc) ?A: 10/10Q: Opinion about Quests and Dialogues ?A: 10/10Q: Is the combat system entertaining enough ?A: 10/10Q: Did you share tears at the end of the game ?A: 10/10Q: Would you buy a Fidget-puppet on amazon ?A: 10/10Q: Would you buy a wallpaper/drawing of Fidget gifting you a Fidget-Drawing ?A: 10/10Q: Do you recommend this game ?A: 10/10Q: Overall experience and commenting ?A: I love this game. I'll play it for sure again. It's an awesome job. Can we have Fidget-puppets on sale online ?			"

												What a treat for us non-360-owning gamers for this gem to finally hit Steam! If you even remotely enjoy the ""Metroidvania"" formula, Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the absolute best of this style of game to be created since Symphony of the Night. With beautiful art design, some of the tightest combat to ever appear in a 2D side scrolling game, and an RPG upgrade system that you can feel as you play, this game is pure gaming awesomeness all across the board. To think that it was programed by one man is astounding. This is a special game. Don't miss out!			"

I hate the main antagonists design.Furries. Love them or hate them.The last boss can go f*** himself.  You have to beat him 4 times with no checkpoints.			"

												Wow - just when I thought this type of game went extinct... Imagine a guy - working alone on a game for 4 years - outsourcing only things he can't do by himself (voice acting, music etc.) and you get something better than big publisher franchise. Yes you read right - a one man army doing a better job than ""certain people with strong symptoms of suckiness"". This game was usually made for Xbox Arcade and it is NOT a crappy pc port - everything works and you even get to customize your hud. It doesn't stop there - the story is beautiful and the game never got boring. Went on till I explored everything so... This game is a very rare gem - I felt happy while playing and it's been a long time since a title was able to pull that off. From my side - grab it!			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a piece of art. I'm not a big fan of side-scrollers, not because I don't like the concept of sidescrolling games itself, but because they usually don't offer what this game has. Story, good characters, good RPG elements (not just leveling up - side quests too, with their own stories!).The story is fine, it's not really solid as a rock, but it is still pretty interesting and makes you want to keep playing. But the big deal here are the characters. Every character in the game has a perfectly defined personality, and in certain situations you may even emotionally engage with them. The voice acting is amazingly good for a video game, which helps.The music is pretty well done, and there are several memorable tracks (especially at the beginning of the game... and at the end).The art style is very appealing, almost everything is made on 2D, every scenery is colorful and full of details and the animations are smooth and feel damn fine. And the characters are furries. I think it has a resemblance to Captain Claw.Now about the gameplay: it's awesome. There's a limited amount of moves to use, but they're enough, and combined with all that the character can do (dodge/sprint, parry, ""gliding"" and more) it just make you feel amazingly empowered.There are a lot of challenges you can do and RPG elements, and they truly make the game more fun. Treasure hunting, item crafting, side quests, and even some kind of... parkour-dungeons or whatever, if you feel like testing your skills.			"

												I can't say enough good about this game. When I first saw the trailer, I had high hopes. I knew it was going to be good. And when I did finally buy it, my expectations were more than exceeded - and that's an understatement. It is incredibly fun to play, and offers a decent amount of challenge even on the easiest difficulty setting; at least, it did for me. I'll do my best to keep this review spoiler-free.I'll start with the obvious protagonist, Dust. A living mystery, he's a little bit of a rogue; even though he's on the side of good and has a strong sense of valor and justice, he's not afraid to cut down any who oppose him or threaten the innocent. He's a bit generic at first glance, but some people (me) find a really cool character under that equally cool hat.The hack-and-slash combat can be either really fun or really boring, depending on the person. A rather small variety of techniques are available to use from the beginning. You can uppercut your target to the skies to perform aerial strikes, parry and counterattack from the ground, or just button-mash to cleave your way through the crowd. You can also launch projectiles that are weak at first, but then amplify their power to wreak mass destruction upon the battleground. Projectiles can range from magic missiles to fireballs, which can be powered up to missile storms or flame pillars.The music is probably the best part about this game. I can't get enough of it. Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it's tense. But it's always encouraging, thrilling, and outright epic. There's nothing like dashing through a rainstorm and slashing down monsters with that loud, exhilarating violin and piano in the background.The story is linear and straightfoward, but is really quite touching at some points. Dust travels through the land of Falana after waking up without memory. A magic sword arrives as his generic sage-guide, and leads him to specific areas because reasons. Throughout the story, Dust helps out whoever he can and takes down villains, all the while trying to find clues as to who he really is. Though not much is explained, a big reveal near the end clears up a lot of potential confusion and can be traced back to the beginning of the game. While the story is linear, it's still pretty well thought out.The characters are a little flat. While most people in the game have distinct personalities, they usually just have one character trait and can be described in about two sentences. However, that does not mean that they can't be charming. You'll meet a lot of people throughout the game, and while each one has his or her own unique role, whether you love or hate them is entirely up to you.One of the biggest elements of this game is the treasure hunting. There is a limited number of keys hidden throughout the world, and each one is expended after opening a treasure chest. Some treasure is very easy to find, especially in the early levels, but some is really cleverly hidden. Sometimes you might actually have to read a note that you picked up to be able to find a secret! The horror!There are, of course, a few cons to this game. However, they are rather minor.There's not much replayability. More or less, it feels like the same game over and over again. Although it's great to experience the story again, and the higher difficulties add much more challenge, it's not a game that will last forever.Combat is precise but strange. Sometimes, if you fall from a large height, one or two enemies will be waiting for you on a lower platform and will attack as soon as you land. It takes either great reflexes or a bit of luck to avoid damage from these ""ambushes.""The boss fights are basic and potentially unmemorable. They have little to no strategy and can be beaten by simply spamming The Undoing, which strikes your target helpless and throws them to the ground for massive damage.I still love them, though.It is definitely not the longest game in the world, and once you've done everything story-related, completed all of the sidequests, and collected all of the treasure, there's not much else. In fact, it's the exploration and treasure hunting that stretches the game out. The story itself is rather short and linear, and the game has quite a closed end.I love this game and usually like to defend it. However, it does have its minor problems. All in all, though, the game is a masterpiece, especially when you consider that most of it was done by one guy alone. I'd like present to Dust: An Elysian Tail a score of 9/10.			"

												A beautifull, fun, awesome, emotional game. A gem of a game. A must play.Dust is a 2D side scrolling hack n slash game. You take the role of Dust, a warrior who has lost his memories in a world ravaged by war, and his only hope is to follow the advice of a talking sword and his companion FIdget and set out into the world to figure out what is going on and who he is.First of all, the story is great.The twist is not really what you expected which is a great, and overall the story is very good and keeps you hooked.The writing and voice acting is AWESOME.This game has the best voice acting ever put in a game. Period. Every line is delivered perfectly and...I just don't know how to describe how perfect it is.The graphics are pretty good, everything is colorful and beautiful, and the environments are diverse, from snowy mountains to lava caves, and it all looks great.The gameplay...great. The action is great and responsive,you don't have that many combos, but it's still very fun and has room for variety.And it's alwaysnice to see your combo meter rise, especially once it goes over 1000 :D With a wide variety of enemies to beat up, you will never get bored. Your character can also equip various mods and improve his stats, so there is room for customization of how your character will play as well.Overall, this is a beautiful experience, one I will never forget.The story,characters,music, everything fits together perfectly.10/10			"

												There's not much for me to say about this game that hasn't already been said; it's a masterpiece. Dust is one of those games you have to play and if you don't at least enjoy it not fall in love with it then you must not like videogames. At first glance the story seems pretty lack luster and for some it still might even as you play more, but for most it is a masterfully executed narrative backed up by impresive voice acting. There so much more I could say; like how the combat is the most simple yet massively rewarding fight ing I've ever played, or how I couldn't stop playing.12/10 GET IT!			"

												I really don't know how to explain it correctly... The game in general it's very well done: The gameplay is easy and allows the player to perform nice combos and Extreme difficult could be a challenge to most of people. The landscapes are beautiful and detailed, the particles flying around while the character performs the Dust Storm makes it quite inmersive and the enemies are very well placed depending on the area. The NPCs had their own personality. There is not a single NPC with the same voice than other one. And for sure, the main characters discussions are just amazingly well done. The originality of making furry characters makes the game had its adorableness touch.The storyline is very well developed and easy to understand but pretty hard to predict which will be the result of Dust's decisions. There is no dubt;'' Dust: An elysian tail '' it's a game that must be played at least once in life. Just too many emotions able to bring tears to my eyes. This is for far one of the best games i've ever played. Thank you Sr. Dean Dodrill, and thanks to all the people who make this story earn a place in my heart.			"

												This game was just all around good time for me.The art style is good, the voice acting is so-so and is really hit or miss on if you like it or not (though personally I liked it). However where this game shines is the combat once you learn to properly use your skills and combo strings, you will have the satisfaction of wiping out enemies in the dozens and feeling like you are the powerful warrior the game suggests you are,and there are a number of varied enemies so that you have to switch tactics and have challenges occasionally, the boss fights while not super difficult are fun. Of course the main draw to this gem of a game is it's well fleshout and crafted story and world.All in all I'd say this game is worth full price and if it's on sale there is no reason not to get it.I literally liked it so much that I bought it for a number of my friends just so they could share the joy of playing this game.

												I highly reccomend  Dust: An Elysian Tail  based on the following: Pros: - Platformer Nostalgia- Atmosphere/world- Precise game-play & mechanics- OK Story- Length/Duration- Content-rich- Hidden Secrets- Mystic- Price (I really think the price for this game is fair even though it might seem a bit overpriced) (Minor) Cons: - Lack of replayability when you have fully completed the game. - The order in which you obtain certain objects. (For instance annoying to find the blacksmith walkie-talkie 99% in-game).- Duration of final level. I am missing a bigger build-up for the final boss here.- A more thorough calibration between skill and difficulty progression. Btw: This review is based on me playing the game one month ago.			"

												Nearly 16 hours to beat it on regular. I didn't 100% it, but I did hunt for extras. This game looks amazing, utterly beautiful! The controls were pretty spot on too, I rarely found myself dying aside from getting stuck the the long winded blade swinging animations and taking a hit. I had so much fun with this game, and if the story is ever continued I will not hesitate to buy and play future games in this series.The characters are a lot of fun and the story actually had a neat twist I didn't see coming, well done!

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is possibly the best platforming beat 'em up on the market. The game's tutorial is quick-paced yet informative. Combat is fun and captivating from the very start till the very end of the game. The level-up, item, and ability progression is done very well, and the soundtrack is one of the best that I've ever heard. The very, very few downsides to this game are that it's not very long (I beat it 100% in ~16 hours on tough), the boss fights are easy, and the voice acting could be a little better. This game is a solid 9/10 and a must play for any gamer.			"

												Great metroidvania.Dust: An elysian Tail is a a 2d hack and slash platformer.PlotYou play as a swordsman called 'Dust' who has amnesia and finds himself in a forest. Along with a couple of entertaining companions, Dust will explore the land of Falana through mountains, forests, volcanos and tunnels solving quests, stopping genocidal monsters and finding the truth about his dark past...GameplayDust plays similar to metroid and castlevania games. The game is seperated into areas  which can be reached by moving from one end of the screen to the other (left to right and vice versa). There are platforming elements incorporporated, with you needing to use a few moves to reach certain places, though it's not as difficult unlike guacamalee. Combat is a great. You start of with limited moves with your one and only weapon, the Blade of Ahrah. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points which you can use to upgrade health, stamina and unlock new moves. You also find money which is used to buy items (like health recovery etc) at stores in the few towns you visit. Along your travels you will encounter a variety of foes including mines, melee guys, zombies, gjosts and gunships. There are also some boss battles in the game as well. Besides followuing the main quest, there are a few side quests you can partake in which offer a variety of rewards in return.  I played this game with a controller and I highly recommend you do the same as it feels more fluid and natural than keyboard and mouse.GraphicsMost of the graphics are great. The 2D animations are colourful and attractive to look at. However, the 3D models aren't well detailed and doesn't fit well with the 2D sprites. Overall howeevr, the game looks vibrant to look at.AudioExcellent. The character voice acting for the main charcters are great and humorous (in a good way).   Other voice acting is decent. The music is great to listen to and fits well with the game. An excellent and entertaining game that will surprise and satisfy fans of metrodvania and new comers alike.			"

												Dust is by far one of the most wonderful games I have played this year. The graphics are spectacular for what the game is, and I think that Dust would be fun for absolutely everyone and anyone. At first, I wasn't so sure on the game. I was wondering if I was diving myself into the depths of furry-land. However, the game soon developed a wonderful storyline and indulged me into various different lands and side plots. My boyfriend was quick to compare the fighting-style to that of Metroid, and I feel that the various abilities you receive really add to the excitement of hunting around for more treasure and equipment. I've been checking around for the next in the Elysian Tail series, which I don't think has been made yet. I am dying to play it, and I really do recommend this game to anyone who has stumbled across it and is wondering whether purchase it or not. I feel like this would definitely be a game for me to replay on a higher difficulty (which is something I rarely ever do due to the repeat in storyline). 11/10, I truly adore it!			"

												I'm pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥at writing reviews, so I will try to be brief about this to limit my chances of screwing it up.Pros: + Cute side-quests+ Hidden Treasures+ Crafting is simple+ Leveling is simple+ Main story wasn't convoluted or hard to follow, but had a touch of grey to it. + I enjoyed the humour+ Full keypad support, so I could play with an old 360 controller+ Adorable side-kickCons:- Game is a bit short. Felt like the story could have had an extra chapter and still not have overstayed its welcome.Neutral:= You do play as a Furry in a land filled with furries, fighting other furries. I liked it, but some may not. Game was good enough that those who do mind, may be able to look past it and still enjoy the game.			"

												I can't say enough good about this game. When I first saw the trailer, I had high hopes. I knew it was going to be good. And when I did finally buy it, my expectations were more than exceeded - and that's an understatement. It is incredibly fun to play, and offers a decent amount of challenge even on the easiest difficulty setting; at least, it did for me. I'll do my best to keep this review spoiler-free.I'll start with the obvious protagonist, Dust. A living mystery, he's a little bit of a rogue; even though he's on the side of good and has a strong sense of valor and justice, he's not afraid to cut down any who oppose him or threaten the innocent. He's a bit generic at first glance, but some people (me) find a really cool character under that equally cool hat.The hack-and-slash combat can be either really fun or really boring, depending on the person. A rather small variety of techniques are available to use from the beginning. You can uppercut your target to the skies to perform aerial strikes, parry and counterattack from the ground, or just button-mash to cleave your way through the crowd. You can also launch projectiles that are weak at first, but then amplify their power to wreak mass destruction upon the battleground. Projectiles can range from magic missiles to fireballs, which can be powered up to missile storms or flame pillars.The music is probably the best part about this game. I can't get enough of it. Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it's tense. But it's always encouraging, thrilling, and outright epic. There's nothing like dashing through a rainstorm and slashing down monsters with that loud, exhilarating violin and piano in the background.The story is linear and straightfoward, but is really quite touching at some points. Dust travels through the land of Falana after waking up without memory. A magic sword arrives as his generic sage-guide, and leads him to specific areas because reasons. Throughout the story, Dust helps out whoever he can and takes down villains, all the while trying to find clues as to who he really is. Though not much is explained, a big reveal near the end clears up a lot of potential confusion and can be traced back to the beginning of the game. While the story is linear, it's still pretty well thought out.The characters are a little flat. While most people in the game have distinct personalities, they usually just have one character trait and can be described in about two sentences. However, that does not mean that they can't be charming. You'll meet a lot of people throughout the game, and while each one has his or her own unique role, whether you love or hate them is entirely up to you.One of the biggest elements of this game is the treasure hunting. There is a limited number of keys hidden throughout the world, and each one is expended after opening a treasure chest. Some treasure is very easy to find, especially in the early levels, but some is really cleverly hidden. Sometimes you might actually have to read a note that you picked up to be able to find a secret! The horror!There are, of course, a few cons to this game. However, they are rather minor.There's not much replayability. More or less, it feels like the same game over and over again. Although it's great to experience the story again, and the higher difficulties add much more challenge, it's not a game that will last forever.Combat is precise but strange. Sometimes, if you fall from a large height, one or two enemies will be waiting for you on a lower platform and will attack as soon as you land. It takes either great reflexes or a bit of luck to avoid damage from these ""ambushes.""The boss fights are basic and potentially unmemorable. They have little to no strategy and can be beaten by simply spamming The Undoing, which strikes your target helpless and throws them to the ground for massive damage.I still love them, though.It is definitely not the longest game in the world, and once you've done everything story-related, completed all of the sidequests, and collected all of the treasure, there's not much else. In fact, it's the exploration and treasure hunting that stretches the game out. The story itself is rather short and linear, and the game has quite a closed end.I love this game and usually like to defend it. However, it does have its minor problems. All in all, though, the game is a masterpiece, especially when you consider that most of it was done by one guy alone. I'd like present to Dust: An Elysian Tail a score of 9/10.			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a piece of art. I'm not a big fan of side-scrollers, not because I don't like the concept of sidescrolling games itself, but because they usually don't offer what this game has. Story, good characters, good RPG elements (not just leveling up - side quests too, with their own stories!).The story is fine, it's not really solid as a rock, but it is still pretty interesting and makes you want to keep playing. But the big deal here are the characters. Every character in the game has a perfectly defined personality, and in certain situations you may even emotionally engage with them. The voice acting is amazingly good for a video game, which helps.The music is pretty well done, and there are several memorable tracks (especially at the beginning of the game... and at the end).The art style is very appealing, almost everything is made on 2D, every scenery is colorful and full of details and the animations are smooth and feel damn fine. And the characters are furries. I think it has a resemblance to Captain Claw.Now about the gameplay: it's awesome. There's a limited amount of moves to use, but they're enough, and combined with all that the character can do (dodge/sprint, parry, ""gliding"" and more) it just make you feel amazingly empowered.There are a lot of challenges you can do and RPG elements, and they truly make the game more fun. Treasure hunting, item crafting, side quests, and even some kind of... parkour-dungeons or whatever, if you feel like testing your skills.			"

												I really cant recommend this game strongly enough. An indie beat m up with a metroid-vania world you should pick up post haste. Any sceenshots you see of this game won't do it justice. While Dust has vibrant and colorful visuals, all hand drawn, you need to see this game in motion to get the full sense of its superb animations and fluid action. Following  the story of an amnesiac swordsman, a magic sword and its guardian sprite you travel through the world of Elysian to discover Dust's past. While the story may not sound like a block buster the game is filled with top notch voice acting that surpasses most triple-A titles and hides some very dark themes that belie its bright art direction. This is a game made by a small team of one, thats full of heart (no pun intended: Humble Hearts studio), has great game-play and art, with an interesting story to tell, and it tells it very well. Don't pass this up!			"

It blends some of my favorite things about RPGs (charming, sometimes cheesy stock characters, a moving plot and fun dialogue) with the free-range motion of solo play.  This game pulled me in and didn't let me go until I beat it to death.  I recommend using a console-controller adapter for effortless game play.			"

												One of the most impressive and best games I've played. I came into this game will minimal knowlegde of what it was and this game was quite the surprise. The gameplay was very fun with the whole hack and slash system in a 2-D plane and being able to use different moves and combos to fight. At first you could think that the combat was basically just button mashing but the enemies get stronger and learn to block and you have to adapt to their new fighting styles. Definitely a part that I can't leave out is the story, the story is so well written that even the character that most people find annoying in the beginning becomes funny and a character that you came sympathize with.  Also the villians are not only badass but sad in some cases as well which explains why they do what they are doing. The main character in general becomes very in depth with how he feels and who he is. This game is definitely worth the price it's worth.			"

												Dust is a game of preference. The biggest thing that people will notice is the whole “Furry” debate. Now if you could care less if you are in a world of animals, have watched any cartoon or game as a child that used animals, or just have common sense, Dust is for you. Gameplay wise, it’s a hack and slash/RPG/puzzler/adventure. If you enjoy hitting things with a sword, this is a good game for you. If you like combining powers for devastating results, this game is for you. If you like puzzles, but don’t want to rip your own hair out due to difficulty, this game is for you. If you like exploring, plundering, and/or simply hanging out in a hub, this game is for you. This game’s story is also a matter of preference. I don’t want to ruin anything for you, so if your iffy on story lines, know that the side quests will fill whatever void within you. What more, the many Easter eggs that you can find will really make any gamer smile.All in all, Dust isn’t a long game, but what it does have is hours of entertainment. If you are at all interested in this game, I would recommend buying it. And if you’re still on the fence, just wait for a sale, because this game is worth it. "

The voice acting is also something worth commending too...as each NPC has its own unique voice and personality.The game is a side-scroll RPG and while that may sound strange at first - it's actually well done.

												One of the best games I've ever played in my entire life. Everything about this game is well polished and made with alot of thought and planning: combat is smooth and responsive, characters are vibrant and have different personalities, enviroments are detailed and beautiful, music is amazing and appropriate for each area, story is well written with a twist you might not see coming, and exploration is well paced, even with backtracking. A definite must buy.			"

												Definetely recommend this game! Worth every cent! Combat is amazingly fun and you can pull off some wicked moves. If you follow the storyline, you'll enjoy the game 100% guaranteed! It almost makes you feel part of the game and as if you're in the shoes of the main character. And theres also a few hilarious one-liners in the dialogue :P I played on 'Normal' first time around and by the end of it, it was quite easy so I think I'll bump it up to 'Tough' or 'Hardcore' mode next time :)			"

												The art is very well done and the combat is simple but controls well. The gameplay is combat heavy with very limited platforming. The game was longer than expected given the price point (11 hours on normal difficulty). Voice acting and storyline are fairly standard and don't stand out as either great or terrible.			"

												This is more of a preview, rather then a review as I've just started playing it and am only 2 hours in. So after a couple of hours of experiencing Dust: An Elysian Tail last night, I have to say I was quite impressed. Visually it's amazing (Don't need to go into that further, as it's plan to say this was made visually incredible). Game play is spot on and fluid (and I'm surprised yet again with a 2D game. I was impressed with Trine [and it's sequel] as well for that reason), but that's not what I liked best about this. It's the audio...OMG! The music is gripping and beautiful! I loved it, and even the voice acting is really quite good. I was worried that I would find Fidget annoying with so much dialog for her, but I didn't find her that at all. I'm quite impressed and look forward to spending more time with it.			"

												I can't really say enough good things about this game, especially considering it was only on Xbox Live Arcade for a while. The port of this game is fantastic in terms of optimization and options.But everything else about the game is amazing too, the animations are very fluid and the art is beautiful. The music and voice acting is quite nice (inb4 Fidget is annoying, I think it's adorable)The game has a decent playtime, especially if you go back to collect everything in an area once you unlock any things you need.Love all the game references as well, wall chicken anyone?I guess people could complain about the furries in it/ anthropomorpic animals, but there's no sexual content, it's just cute animal peoples. Maybe being a furry, I'm biased, but humans humans humans, maybe an orc or elf, and more humans in all games out there kinda gets old anyway. Having animal people isn't a bad thing, I find myself not even noticing it at times, everything just goes so well together.Pick this game up nao, even if you end up hating it, there are a lot worse games out there for the same price or more.

												Coming from an old school 2s Caslevania and Metroid player I have to say I realy enjoyed this game. I could go on about all the pros of the the game, but that has already been done in droves, and they are all correct the game is great. There were a few things I think could have made Dust better. First off if you are a sesoned player, just start on Hard. I found the default difficulty of this game a bit easy, in fact like a derp I hadn't even equiped up other than drops that I found or were provided through story about 2/3 of the way through the game. The fact of the matter was I just didn't get hit that often partially from the difificulty and partially because of the very refined controls. The game is also a bit short, I played through getting about 90% completion in about 15 hours on normal, this is forgivable as it is an indie game and it has a low price point, but I was wanting more at the end, and franky why not, its a good game.The only other comments I would have to leave is story and characters, no spoilers here I promise. It has an anime-ish style to it, obviously seen in the screen shots, it looks great, but the choice to use a animal-human hybrid for the games characters makes it feel a little kidish, thats a style thing and I get that, it certainly doesn't detract from the game, but I don't think it really adds anything to it either.  The story is interesting and has some good deep mature themes in the since of a tomented hero coming to grips with his past for 1 example, but then you get some dialog that pops in rarely that feels it should be part of a Saterday morning cartoon. Kind of like how Avitar the Last Airbender was, again this isn't something that was bad, but for me it briefly disconnects from a great story.All in all the is a realy good game, well worth the price and I hope to see bigger and better games come from this team.

If you like 2D Platformer RPGs, I suggest you to play Dust: An Elysian Tail.The difficulty is fair, you have enough time to learn how to play the game, the gameplay is really good, there are absolutely no Glitches, all the charactes are memorable, these hand drawn graphics are just beautiful, the storyline is really good and I must say this: Fidget is a special character in this game. She is the one that will make this game funnier even in those hard situations.If you have already played this game, you probably agree with me about what I said. But if you haven't played this game yet, I suggest you to go and buy it right now.			"

												Fun/Interesting story, Great Sound track, Hand drawn art, Fun Gameplay, Voice acting, Funny sidekick. What else could you want.     STORY-  *without spoilers* The story follows the main character Dust on his to quest to find his identity. Kept me on my seat trying to unravel the mystery.    SOUNDTRACK- All 37 tracks are well done and great at capturing the feel of the game. I havent liked a soundtrack this much since to the moon. Most  of the time id rather have a good soundtrack then good graphics.    GRAPHICS- This game is truely gorgeous. Its hand-painted and it moves very well. Its very easy to forget its hand drawn.    GAMEPLAY- Just so you know i used a controller. I feel the game was made to work with one since it was origanaly a xbox live game. The fights make you feel like a Bad A**.  So many Slashes, and explosions its sometims hard to see what happened untill the Dust settles (See What I Did There) or as Fidget says ""DID YOU SEE THE SCREEN""     VOICE ACTING- Some people say the voice acting is not to good. I really liked the voices expetaly Fidgets voice and Dusts voice is good at capturing his lost feeling. Its awesome that it even has voices, i somtimes get tired of reading text after awhile.  So dont think the voice acting is bad till you hear it.    Must play, That is unless you dont care for Storylines and only like 3D games like Call of Duty. "

												I really cant recommend this game strongly enough. An indie beat m up with a metroid-vania world you should pick up post haste. Any sceenshots you see of this game won't do it justice. While Dust has vibrant and colorful visuals, all hand drawn, you need to see this game in motion to get the full sense of its superb animations and fluid action. Following  the story of an amnesiac swordsman, a magic sword and its guardian sprite you travel through the world of Elysian to discover Dust's past. While the story may not sound like a block buster the game is filled with top notch voice acting that surpasses most triple-A titles and hides some very dark themes that belie its bright art direction. This is a game made by a small team of one, thats full of heart (no pun intended: Humble Hearts studio), has great game-play and art, with an interesting story to tell, and it tells it very well. Don't pass this up!			"

												If you'd rather not read the entire review, and would like a simple awnser at the beggning, here it is: Buy this game. It can't get simpler than that. This game is well deserving of its price, and I would've payed five dollars more for it. Let me walk you through reasons why you should buy this:1. StorylineYou play as Dust, a quite and charming protagnist weilding a speaking blade of Elysium. Oh, and not to mention Fidget, whom is the most cuddly and possibly the best compainion to ever exsist. The game is littered with cute dialoge, and any moment the player has a thought the character comments on whatever just happened almost the same way the player thought, like if a character seemed dickish or just plain insane, Dust and Fidget immediatley have a small talk afterwards about just that, giving insane immersion. The characters are loveable, and there are almost no characters I wouldn't want to speak to. It has a perfect little twist of comedy in all the seriousness, with Fidget being adorable as ♥♥♥♥ and small little refrences to other games that'll just make you sit in your chair smiling at the computer going ""Ahhhhh, I see what chu did there"", and it is overall just an amazing experience.2. Gameplay.The gameplay is insanley fluent and is amazing to say the least. From the get go, there's not too much challenge, so the game isn't very frustrating allowing for a very casual expereince. With many combos using really only left-click, right-click, and W. You will hardly have a moment where you don't just go ""How the ♥♥♥♥ did I do that!?!?"" like throwing an enemy into another before throwing them into the air again or shooting off into the sky for no reason killing several enemies in the process. It's just fluent, balanced, and overall an enjoyable expereinece. As far as quests go, you unlock new abilities at a nice pace, and you'll always find yourself learning new tricks. The side quests, though few in number, are very well thought out and innovative for each and every one. Try saving Corbin or finding Reed's Box. These are both sidequests that are done astonishingly well. You have a sense of a new experience, plus you get to just straight up see characters happy. It actually immerses you as a character.3.  ♥♥♥♥ THREE. BUY THIS GAME.			"

												I really don't know how to explain it correctly... The game in general it's very well done: The gameplay is easy and allows the player to perform nice combos and Extreme difficult could be a challenge to most of people. The landscapes are beautiful and detailed, the particles flying around while the character performs the Dust Storm makes it quite inmersive and the enemies are very well placed depending on the area. The NPCs had their own personality. There is not a single NPC with the same voice than other one. And for sure, the main characters discussions are just amazingly well done. The originality of making furry characters makes the game had its adorableness touch.The storyline is very well developed and easy to understand but pretty hard to predict which will be the result of Dust's decisions. There is no dubt;'' Dust: An elysian tail '' it's a game that must be played at least once in life. Just too many emotions able to bring tears to my eyes. This is for far one of the best games i've ever played. Thank you Sr. Dean Dodrill, and thanks to all the people who make this story earn a place in my heart.			"

Simply awesome. Dust has pretty much everything I want from a fun and entertaining RPG, and more. The story might seem straightforward at the very beginning, but as you progress in the game you understand that it's not as easy to predict as you thought. The action component, which includes combos with the (sentient) sword and magic, is really well balanced and extremely fun. It fits perfectly with the RPG-like evolution of the character, with experience points to spend in improving skills and even a crafting system not to be underestimated (you can put together quite the equip if you take it seriously). Add to all of this the beautiful sceneries, artworks, and the epic, EPIC conclusion and you'll get a game experience you won't forget.			"

												There's not much for me to say about this game that hasn't already been said; it's a masterpiece. Dust is one of those games you have to play and if you don't at least enjoy it not fall in love with it then you must not like videogames. At first glance the story seems pretty lack luster and for some it still might even as you play more, but for most it is a masterfully executed narrative backed up by impresive voice acting. There so much more I could say; like how the combat is the most simple yet massively rewarding fight ing I've ever played, or how I couldn't stop playing.12/10 GET IT!			"

												This game has very few flaws, but it has something I've not seen in complex games in years, pure fun. The combat system is unbelievably exhilarating and fulfilling. You play a character named Dust who has amnesia and has forgotten his past (one of the few flaws, considering how cliche that is.), with your little flying pal who's mostly used for comedic relief. But it doesn't go overboard on comedy either, the game is a perfect blend of art, fun, rpg, brawler, and platforming. Not having too much of any except fun.			"

												By far one of the best indie games I've played.  If you enjoy games such as Shadow Complex, Castlevania: SOTN, and Super Metroid, then there should be no reason why you can't get into this game.There are multiple difficulty levels and the blueprint, item, equipment, and consumable system is rather nicely implemented.  The difficulty can be challenging at times but in a nice way.  It doesn't drive you to frustration like veteran mode in Call of Duty, where you're getting shot at from thin air.I love the art style and music in this game also, and it is worth noting that it runs and looks very good.  The aspect of running up combos and managing your chains in-between avoiding enemies and not exhausting yourself is very nice.Definitely recommend this game to basically anyone, especially if it is on sale, however, the regular price is very fair.

												I'm rarely Impressed by something. And when I say ""rarely"", I really MEAN it. And between the hundreds of games I played, those I really liked, can be counted on a single person's fingers.Yes, Dust is officially in my top ten of favourite games I ever played.So, gameplay: it's an hack and slash. Actual attacks can be done by pressing only 4 different buttons, and if you're crouched, in the air, and if you did one move or another before pressing a button, you can achieve various different moves. So, the game is a lot easier to handle than your average hack and slash (to the point it can be easily played with a keyboard). The protatonist is extremely fast in attacking, resulting in... well, a lot of slashing happening on screen. Enemies will for this reason appear in mass, resulting into extremely satisfying ""slashsplosions"". Ordinary enemies will rarely be a threat, only bossess will sometime be a bit of a nuisance. Yes, the game is quite easy, so I suggest you outright start at the max difficulty setting if you are used to hack'n'slash games.There are some platforming sections that range from easy to very hard: I played at max difficulty, and many traps had the attitude of killing my character instantly, even on full health. I had to retry some sections a few times to get them right. Yup, platforming sections (if you play on max difficulty) are a bit better balanced than fight sections. Still, most of them are quite easy anyway.As for the graphics: Well, the full scenery and mobile background, including almost all of the characters, both ally and enemy, are hand drawn. I'm not saying it's beautifoul to look at, but at times you will REALLY be noticing the passion that was put in creating the environments. This is not your ordinary sidescroller: It's really well done graphics wise. Only thing is that characters, especially npcs and the protagonist itself... ok, maybe it's me, but at times It looked to me that said characters were just animated sketches, rather than fully drawn frames. Luckily, I only noticed this when closely watching the animations, and it wasn't that much of an issue after all, the whole animations still look great.Yeah so far it's a good game, but not a great one. So, the real reason I found this game amazing? Stupidly enought, it's because characters are extremely well characterized. That's an aspect I usually don't care that much about, maybe it's really that great after all.The protagonist, the npcs, even enemies always have a weighty character on them. You know, it ain't about the plot, it's about how you tell it. And all characters in the game are excellent narrators of the story, both because of their graphical expressivity and because of their well made voice acting. Despite the story itself being kinda clichey (it's your typical ""knight with no memories"" story), I ended up attached to it, and I ended up attached to the characters themselves, to the point I felt sad when I completed the game.So, the full motor of the story is the storytelling and voice acting, and it's wheels is the hand drawn style.For the rest gameplay is fun, but way too easy, and platform sections are kinda good made, too.Because of this, follow my advice: START IMMEDIATELY AT HARDCORE DIFFICULTY. Otherwise, you may end up finishing the game in 6 hours, and you will not enjoy it as much as you would.And yes, I am advicing this game. Even if you're not much into hack'n'slash games, it's worth a try. If you like hack'n'slash, then I definetly advice you to buy it. If I were to rate this game, I would give it a 8/10.			"

												A beautifull, fun, awesome, emotional game. A gem of a game. A must play.Dust is a 2D side scrolling hack n slash game. You take the role of Dust, a warrior who has lost his memories in a world ravaged by war, and his only hope is to follow the advice of a talking sword and his companion FIdget and set out into the world to figure out what is going on and who he is.First of all, the story is great.The twist is not really what you expected which is a great, and overall the story is very good and keeps you hooked.The writing and voice acting is AWESOME.This game has the best voice acting ever put in a game. Period. Every line is delivered perfectly and...I just don't know how to describe how perfect it is.The graphics are pretty good, everything is colorful and beautiful, and the environments are diverse, from snowy mountains to lava caves, and it all looks great.The gameplay...great. The action is great and responsive,you don't have that many combos, but it's still very fun and has room for variety.And it's alwaysnice to see your combo meter rise, especially once it goes over 1000 :D With a wide variety of enemies to beat up, you will never get bored. Your character can also equip various mods and improve his stats, so there is room for customization of how your character will play as well.Overall, this is a beautiful experience, one I will never forget.The story,characters,music, everything fits together perfectly.10/10			"

												The art is very well done and the combat is simple but controls well. The gameplay is combat heavy with very limited platforming. The game was longer than expected given the price point (11 hours on normal difficulty). Voice acting and storyline are fairly standard and don't stand out as either great or terrible.			"

												By far one of the best indie games I've played.  If you enjoy games such as Shadow Complex, Castlevania: SOTN, and Super Metroid, then there should be no reason why you can't get into this game.There are multiple difficulty levels and the blueprint, item, equipment, and consumable system is rather nicely implemented.  The difficulty can be challenging at times but in a nice way.  It doesn't drive you to frustration like veteran mode in Call of Duty, where you're getting shot at from thin air.I love the art style and music in this game also, and it is worth noting that it runs and looks very good.  The aspect of running up combos and managing your chains in-between avoiding enemies and not exhausting yourself is very nice.Definitely recommend this game to basically anyone, especially if it is on sale, however, the regular price is very fair.

												Dust is a game of preference. The biggest thing that people will notice is the whole “Furry” debate. Now if you could care less if you are in a world of animals, have watched any cartoon or game as a child that used animals, or just have common sense, Dust is for you. Gameplay wise, it’s a hack and slash/RPG/puzzler/adventure. If you enjoy hitting things with a sword, this is a good game for you. If you like combining powers for devastating results, this game is for you. If you like puzzles, but don’t want to rip your own hair out due to difficulty, this game is for you. If you like exploring, plundering, and/or simply hanging out in a hub, this game is for you. This game’s story is also a matter of preference. I don’t want to ruin anything for you, so if your iffy on story lines, know that the side quests will fill whatever void within you. What more, the many Easter eggs that you can find will really make any gamer smile.All in all, Dust isn’t a long game, but what it does have is hours of entertainment. If you are at all interested in this game, I would recommend buying it. And if you’re still on the fence, just wait for a sale, because this game is worth it. "

												This is more of a preview, rather then a review as I've just started playing it and am only 2 hours in. So after a couple of hours of experiencing Dust: An Elysian Tail last night, I have to say I was quite impressed. Visually it's amazing (Don't need to go into that further, as it's plan to say this was made visually incredible). Game play is spot on and fluid (and I'm surprised yet again with a 2D game. I was impressed with Trine [and it's sequel] as well for that reason), but that's not what I liked best about this. It's the audio...OMG! The music is gripping and beautiful! I loved it, and even the voice acting is really quite good. I was worried that I would find Fidget annoying with so much dialog for her, but I didn't find her that at all. I'm quite impressed and look forward to spending more time with it.			"

												First of all, let me say that I enjoyed Dust immensly. It is a great mix of hack n slash / RPG with platforming elements. It is a 2d sidescroller similar to games like Castlevania so, if you enjoyed those series, this is right up your alley. It features quests and sidequests that you need to complete, and you can revisit previous areas through an extremely simple and functional map system. Revisiting is mandatory if you wish to get the full experience out of the game, since it is drowning in collectibles and easter eggs, which i found really creative.The RPG element consists of finding/crafting/buying armour, weapons and various trinkets that have a lot of different abilities allocated to them, so that you can have your own gameplay style, although you most probably will go with higher armor/attack, so there is not so much variety as you might originaly think. You also get experience by killing creatures and completing quests, and when you hit the mark, you gain a level and allocate one point(gem) in one of four different stats.There is a lot of exploration and cool fights in Dust, that will probably keep you invested if you like this type of game. The story is also quite interesting, since it is not what you will probably think at first. I wont go into details to avoid spoiling it.All in all, a great action/rpg that kept me going for 15 hours, until i found everything. Highly recommended to action/rpg fans, similar to Castlevania.

												Having beaten the game on Xbox, the experience was something unlike any other side-scrolling action game I've played. In its hand painted fantasy world, Elysian is brought to life in an experience of plot twists and unexpected turns that shows the beauty art can put into a game.Gameplay is flawless and the challenge to return through the game on its hardest mode is more than worthwhile to complete and collect the 12 companions.I recommend this title to any of my friends and anyone really to journey into Dust's world.

												This game is really great. Everything from characters to background images are wonderfully drawn, and the music distracts me from the game sometimes. The story was quite anime-ish (""Oh hey I don't know who I am but I have some crazy skillz at swinging this sword!"") but it's really catchy, since I, for one, I coudn't stop playing until I finished the whole game in 2 afternoons. The voice acting is nice and fitting for all characters. The fighting system does what I want it to do, and that's good. At some points, I could actually hear how they nailed the echo of character speech. So much detail I can't even describe it in one review. *-*10/10 for the only one guy who made this game in 4 years. That's quite fast I must say.P.S: The last part in the game just screams ""Sequel! Sequel!"", doesen't it?			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a rare gem of a game. It might seem very childish or bland at a first glance, but beneath the surface is a true labor of love. The aesthetics are fantastic and the world is colorful and vibrant, which is a wonder considering it was made by a single man. The voice acting, while somewhat spotty at worst, was delivered by believeable and capable people, even if they may be amateurs, they never felt grating or cheesy.The sound design, namely music, is top notch and fits the pace and the feel of the game very well. The rest of the sounds feel at home, and I can't recall anything that ever really popped out.The enemy design is varied and interesting, although understandably each area only has a few enemy types each. The characters are interesting to talk to, whenever they have something to say, and listening to the vast amount of dialog the game offers is pleasant and interesting to listen to. The game tells you just enough about the world to keep you immersed, while leaving the less important bits aside.What I might complain about would be the bartering system. There is no easy way to sell a large quantity of items, which forces you to hammer either the mouse button, A or D or the arrow keys repeatedly for literally hundreds of times, whether you're buying or selling.The weapon augments and armors don't have interesting effects to speak of, and are very linear upgrades. Thankfully pendants and rings offer some more interesting choices.And while the platforming is generally enjoyable, I at times felt that the character was somewhat floaty, or did not control as tightly as I'd hope, but it was a fairly small annoyance compared to the twenty hours of enjoyment I managed to rake in from this wonderful, beautiful game.If you were to blitz through the game, you might expect around ten hours of gameplay, if even that. However, if you wish to go beyond 100% like me, you may easily get 15-20 hours or joy out of the game. Of course, if you hadn't seen any pictures or videos of the game, the game features anthromorphic animal characters aplenty, and if you are not a fan of them, you might want to ponder whether you can stomach it or not. The game nor the characters ever bring this up, however, so it's not exactly shoved in your face and down your throat. For people who love said style of characters, you are in for even more of a treat.<3 Fidget			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is a piece of art. I'm not a big fan of side-scrollers, not because I don't like the concept of sidescrolling games itself, but because they usually don't offer what this game has. Story, good characters, good RPG elements (not just leveling up - side quests too, with their own stories!).The story is fine, it's not really solid as a rock, but it is still pretty interesting and makes you want to keep playing. But the big deal here are the characters. Every character in the game has a perfectly defined personality, and in certain situations you may even emotionally engage with them. The voice acting is amazingly good for a video game, which helps.The music is pretty well done, and there are several memorable tracks (especially at the beginning of the game... and at the end).The art style is very appealing, almost everything is made on 2D, every scenery is colorful and full of details and the animations are smooth and feel damn fine. And the characters are furries. I think it has a resemblance to Captain Claw.Now about the gameplay: it's awesome. There's a limited amount of moves to use, but they're enough, and combined with all that the character can do (dodge/sprint, parry, ""gliding"" and more) it just make you feel amazingly empowered.There are a lot of challenges you can do and RPG elements, and they truly make the game more fun. Treasure hunting, item crafting, side quests, and even some kind of... parkour-dungeons or whatever, if you feel like testing your skills.			"

												I can't say enough good about this game. When I first saw the trailer, I had high hopes. I knew it was going to be good. And when I did finally buy it, my expectations were more than exceeded - and that's an understatement. It is incredibly fun to play, and offers a decent amount of challenge even on the easiest difficulty setting; at least, it did for me. I'll do my best to keep this review spoiler-free.I'll start with the obvious protagonist, Dust. A living mystery, he's a little bit of a rogue; even though he's on the side of good and has a strong sense of valor and justice, he's not afraid to cut down any who oppose him or threaten the innocent. He's a bit generic at first glance, but some people (me) find a really cool character under that equally cool hat.The hack-and-slash combat can be either really fun or really boring, depending on the person. A rather small variety of techniques are available to use from the beginning. You can uppercut your target to the skies to perform aerial strikes, parry and counterattack from the ground, or just button-mash to cleave your way through the crowd. You can also launch projectiles that are weak at first, but then amplify their power to wreak mass destruction upon the battleground. Projectiles can range from magic missiles to fireballs, which can be powered up to missile storms or flame pillars.The music is probably the best part about this game. I can't get enough of it. Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it's tense. But it's always encouraging, thrilling, and outright epic. There's nothing like dashing through a rainstorm and slashing down monsters with that loud, exhilarating violin and piano in the background.The story is linear and straightfoward, but is really quite touching at some points. Dust travels through the land of Falana after waking up without memory. A magic sword arrives as his generic sage-guide, and leads him to specific areas because reasons. Throughout the story, Dust helps out whoever he can and takes down villains, all the while trying to find clues as to who he really is. Though not much is explained, a big reveal near the end clears up a lot of potential confusion and can be traced back to the beginning of the game. While the story is linear, it's still pretty well thought out.The characters are a little flat. While most people in the game have distinct personalities, they usually just have one character trait and can be described in about two sentences. However, that does not mean that they can't be charming. You'll meet a lot of people throughout the game, and while each one has his or her own unique role, whether you love or hate them is entirely up to you.One of the biggest elements of this game is the treasure hunting. There is a limited number of keys hidden throughout the world, and each one is expended after opening a treasure chest. Some treasure is very easy to find, especially in the early levels, but some is really cleverly hidden. Sometimes you might actually have to read a note that you picked up to be able to find a secret! The horror!There are, of course, a few cons to this game. However, they are rather minor.There's not much replayability. More or less, it feels like the same game over and over again. Although it's great to experience the story again, and the higher difficulties add much more challenge, it's not a game that will last forever.Combat is precise but strange. Sometimes, if you fall from a large height, one or two enemies will be waiting for you on a lower platform and will attack as soon as you land. It takes either great reflexes or a bit of luck to avoid damage from these ""ambushes.""The boss fights are basic and potentially unmemorable. They have little to no strategy and can be beaten by simply spamming The Undoing, which strikes your target helpless and throws them to the ground for massive damage.I still love them, though.It is definitely not the longest game in the world, and once you've done everything story-related, completed all of the sidequests, and collected all of the treasure, there's not much else. In fact, it's the exploration and treasure hunting that stretches the game out. The story itself is rather short and linear, and the game has quite a closed end.I love this game and usually like to defend it. However, it does have its minor problems. All in all, though, the game is a masterpiece, especially when you consider that most of it was done by one guy alone. I'd like present to Dust: An Elysian Tail a score of 9/10.			"

												Great game, lots of fun.  Has all the best things about Metroidvania games plus a great soundtrack, amusing dialogue, and fun (actually fun) combo-ing.  Just finished in about 25 hours.  By far, the best 2D Metroidvania game I've ever played, and I've played a lot of them.  Clever map design keeps everything interesting, even when backtracking with a new tool to get treasure.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												I'm pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥at writing reviews, so I will try to be brief about this to limit my chances of screwing it up.Pros: + Cute side-quests+ Hidden Treasures+ Crafting is simple+ Leveling is simple+ Main story wasn't convoluted or hard to follow, but had a touch of grey to it. + I enjoyed the humour+ Full keypad support, so I could play with an old 360 controller+ Adorable side-kickCons:- Game is a bit short. Felt like the story could have had an extra chapter and still not have overstayed its welcome.Neutral:= You do play as a Furry in a land filled with furries, fighting other furries. I liked it, but some may not. Game was good enough that those who do mind, may be able to look past it and still enjoy the game.			"

												A beautiful story elegantly written through cute characters and stunning environments to a soundtrack you'll want to hear again and again.  This charming tale follows the main character on a beat-em-up adventure that blends the wild fun of a fighter with the wanderlust excitement of a platformer.  Once you've finished the game, there are plenty of secrets to hunt down (and a slew of Castlevania references; see how many you notice) and more challenging difficulties to test your skill.Despite a little bit of difficulty handling USB controllers, which can be fixed with an XBox controller emulator, this is a masterfully executed title that will certainly not disappoint.  It's worth every penny and then some and I'm eager for the sequel.			"

												Oh man, what a surprise this game is. Mixing the best elements of a Metroidvania game and a Beat'em all with huge combos, this little indie game is a demonstration of what makes a game good and fun. Quests, sidequests, loot, freedom and cool animation and colors are the strong points of Dust : An Elysian Tail, and the execution is flawless.One only complain I might have would be the art style and character design which I hate and is kinda less impressive than anything else. If you hate furry, you're not going to have a great time looking at the characters in the conversation cutscenes. But the game is really good and once you pass that weird look, you're going to have a blast making 500 hits combos and searching for the secrets and friendly cameos hidden in all levels.Definitely a game to try if you like 2D action platforming adventure with Metroid like elements and a good ten hour of gameplay, you're going to love this fantastic one man made game. I have spend about 18 hours and I'm almost in the end, having done everything I could so far, still having a few secrets left in some levels, and a couple of sidequests. Definitely worth a try at any price.			"

It's creative, it's funny, well looking, controls like a breeze has a nice learning curve, engaging dialog and characters, is the best platformer I have played in a long time and doesn't bore me the least. It has emotional notes as well as over the top action and all in a nice package.Good stuff:+ Very good graphics (2D platformer full HD at it's best)+ Artistic hand painted backdrops+ Nice sound effects+ Supurb voice acting+ Excelent music score that compliments the ambiance+ Engaging characters and storyline+ Devil May Cry like combat (fast-paced eretic, over the top moves and combos, while fun & easy to execute)+ Leveling and weapon/gear crafting compliments game mechanics+ Many secrets, multiple difficulty settings and fun rewarding side quests make for a good replayability levelBad stuff:- Characters could have been animated 'a tad more' and have more poses to make them feel more alive (sometimes I feels the transit from one pose to another feels incomplete or cheap)			"

												Gorgeous! That's what this game is. Beauty in motion, in form, and in execution.Gameplay is satisfying and feels unique thanks to the dust storm mechanics, animations are fluid and voicework abounds, even in interaction with NPCs.Controls are responsive and flow together well. The emphasis on the combo system in combat is welcome, and it is both easy to learn and yet takes time to master.There are a myriad of gameplay options that will change the way certain things work in the game, such as how and when healing items are used. Add to that multiple difficulty levels to choose from, and you can truly customize your playing experience.The story and characters both become more realized and interesting as you progress through the game.The soundtrack from Hyperduck is just as stunning as the amazing artwork and visuals.Very highly recommended.

												An absolutely must-have for any PC gamer. One of the best Indie titles i've seen in years! You can really tell that Humble Hearts put so much effort into making this Indie title. This adventure has an amazing story, with tons of frenetic battles, exploration and fun. You're Dust, a mysterious being without remembering anything from the past. While you fight your way through monsters, you'll eventually discover what you are and who you are, where you came from and where your path will lead you. Awesome game. Great art design, music, story, and characters. Just fun to play. Perfect and recommended for Indie and ARPG fans. Not so good things: Only problem that some of you might have, is that the game has a lot of ""Furries"". If you don't like Furries much, then this game probably isn't for you.			"

												Dust is by far one of the most wonderful games I have played this year. The graphics are spectacular for what the game is, and I think that Dust would be fun for absolutely everyone and anyone. At first, I wasn't so sure on the game. I was wondering if I was diving myself into the depths of furry-land. However, the game soon developed a wonderful storyline and indulged me into various different lands and side plots. My boyfriend was quick to compare the fighting-style to that of Metroid, and I feel that the various abilities you receive really add to the excitement of hunting around for more treasure and equipment. I've been checking around for the next in the Elysian Tail series, which I don't think has been made yet. I am dying to play it, and I really do recommend this game to anyone who has stumbled across it and is wondering whether purchase it or not. I feel like this would definitely be a game for me to replay on a higher difficulty (which is something I rarely ever do due to the repeat in storyline). 11/10, I truly adore it!			"

												This is probably one of the best games I have ever impulsed buyed from a Steam Market.Characters are engaging and have wonderful designs. The voice Actors truly feel like they loved working on this game. Level design can be a little difficult to work with, but you will never feel like the game is being unfair. With plenty of side paths to explore, you will eventually find that this game doesn't expect you to 100% this game. In fact, it goes past 122% with all of the secrets you are capable of finding. From hidden ""characters"", keys, map exploration and Time Trial areas to complete, you will always have something to do.On top of this, the combat is very fluid. It is clearly designed to be super flashy and strange, but I truly love this aspect. The combat itself is incredibly easy to learn and moderately difficult to master. As a result, you will never feel like you got hurt due to gameplay issues, but you will quickly lose track of your position if you just spam the keys.So I highly recommend this game, especially if it is on sale. I truly believe the game is worth the full amount, however this is a one-time playthrough type of game. You will enjoy the experience to no end, but it lacks in replayability.

Posted: September 20, 2015
// Introduction //Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of my very favorite games of all time.  I thought it was only fair to begin with that, and now I'll explain why I feel that way!  First, this game is a story-driven 2-D action platformer.  This means there is a fair amount of jumping and timing involved, and a lot of fighting.  A great deal of care and art went into the crafting of this extraordinary title, and I will now proceed to list what sets it apart from the norm.// Art - Music - Visual Concept //As the title says, this section will discuss the creative concepts of the game, the art.  The art is breathtaking!  The characters sprites are well-animated, the portraits they use to talk are well-rendered and offer a variety of expressions ranging through their various emotional states.  The backgrounds in the stages are beautiful and often surreal with their fluffy and warm imagery, while others are morbid and quite spooky.  The enemies are surprisingly well done, and evoke an emotional response of mild disgust (e.g. They look barbed and rocky and slimy and the like).  The music is a sublime score that never fails to meet the occasion by offering immersion and creating the mood for a particular fight, or a jaunt through a spooky haunted house, or warm soothing tones for having reached a safe place and met new people!  The visual concept disturbs some people and takes a little while to get used to, if one hasn't seen many anthropomorphized animals before.  Every character in the game, as far as I am aware, is an animal in human form.  Dust himself is some type of white fox, I believe.  His companion, Fidget, is a flying red fox.  This adds a certain fantasy flare and otherworldliness to the entire game's setting.  Others may criticize the motif, but I find it refreshingly child-like and innocent.// Voice Acting and Story //Every line of dialogue in this game is fully voice acted, and it is all superb!  Some may express a deep resentment and critique for the voice of Fidget, which is quite childlike with a heavy lean towards sillyness, but I find it entirely appropriate and amusing for the character!  Dust is a compassionate hero with a dark past, and his voice matches accordingly.   Ahrah, your talking sword, is a deep and wise sagely type, who tells you all of what he knows while being ever prescient about future events.  The villagers are appropriately frightened, grateful, and emotional when the situation calls for it.  Scenes are quite emotionally touching.  Add to this the well-designed portraits, which have basic animations, nothing fancy, and you get the qualitative effect of a good book or radio program.   Very moving, if you let your imagination run even a little free.As to the story at large, I don't want to give anything detailed away.  At the very beginning, Dust awakens with amnesia.  This sets the tone for the rest of game.  Who is he? What was he like? Where can he find the answers he seeks? Who are his friends, and who are his enemies? Will he ever know the truth about his past? This allows the player a greater deal of immersion into feeling as though they are the hero, Dust.  Dust has no strong past at first to define him, so the character can place their own persona in his.  As his story develops, one finds that his past is quite complicated.  It leads to emotional revelations and has a deep and meaningful affect on the player, in my opinion.  A good game knows not only how to provide a story, but how to immerse the player within that story.  That you feel you are there, that is important.// Graphics //2-D isn't exactly new, I know.  But Dust: An Elysian Tail does it with style!  The sprites are animated, the edges are smooth, the effects of spells are spectacularly specular, with good lighting effects!  The weather and lightning add immersion, there appears to be a very low PC requirement overall, and this game runs smooth as sherbert on my very antiquated computer.// Gameplay //This one is the most important to many.  How does it play?  Like you wield an arcane blade of martial knowledge that imbues you with the power of a hundred champions before you!  The combos are rather simple and easy to pick up.  There are two main attacks for Dust, and one for Fidget.  The primary attack has a simple combo, and the secondary attack can be added to mix it up.  X, X, X, X is simple and effective, with a knock-back at the end that clears the enemies in front of you, giving you breathing room.  X, X, Y, Y is a straight-forward smash and grab, you beat them a bit, then run forward, and suplex an enemy, effectively attacking and knocking back any that are behind you.  X, Y launches the attacked enemy into that air, where follow up combos are endless.  Holding Y causes your blade to spin, which is an infinite combo in itself, save that it will cause you to heat up and eventually hurt yourself if you use it for very long periods.  One can also jump and use the blade spin, causing them to essentially fly in an arc, or towards the nearest enemy.  This allows them to stay in the air indefinitely, and literally shoot upwards into the sky if there are enemies nearby.  Aerial combat in this game is probably the best I've seen in any action platformer.  It's easy to mess up and fall, but with the right training, it's much easier to stay in the air and endlessly attack all of your enemies.  Ground targets jumped into your path? Press X, Y and you'll attack, then grab, and body slam them into the ground, knocking back, and shooting upwards, other enemies.  Allowing you to essentially always be in the air attacking, avoiding the ground completely if you wish.This brings us to Fidget.  Fidget's attacks are magical, she learns several spells as the game unfolds.  When she casts a spell, it is a joke, a lackluster affair, and it has no range at all.  However, if you use your blade spin while she casts an attack, it multiples the number of projectiles, and their strength, and becomes an AoE slugfest of doom for all of your enemies.  I play this game on Hardcore, and Fidget is the path to victory.  Her attacks deplete your 'Energy' meter, but this refills quite easily in a matter of mere seconds by slashing a few enemies inbetween spells. What this effectively works out to is this, you can fly through the air spitting pillars of fire, and endlessly launching enemies and decimating them to refill your meter.  The game's enemies are smart enough that they will attempt to jump behind your current facing direction, and will attempt to time attacks for when you land and when you are most vulnerable, at the cooldown on your combos.Add to this that there is a right and left dash that completely evade attacks, while using a modest amount of energy, and a parry system that allows you to daze and counterattack almost any opponent (this is actually almost essential for the stronger opponents) and you arrive at a game that puts many others to shame with the sheer fun of its combat!  The game also incorporates an inventory and equipment system.  You find items that aid in your base attributes, and offer some limited special abilities, like light radius around Dust for those dank, dark caverns!// Mood - Immersion //One of the most important elements in any game, to me; this game succeeds in all categories.   From the art, to the music, to the voice acting, to the combat, to the scenery.   You will travel from high-reaching statues of a bygone age of greatness standing like monoliths over grassy knolls and mountainsides, to dark and forboding swamps that seem quite full of danger, to haunted houses in sorrowful, barren, spooky and dark environs.   From snow to rain and back again.  Also, my personal favorite, caverns!  You will spend a considerable amount of the game in the underworld!  These caverns, in my humble opinion, are simply beautiful! In conclusion. Buy this!			"

If i would say what the major problem of this game would probly be the depth of the story, the whole plot twist didn't affect me too much and alot of the characters backstories are not very well explained and bland. Was cassius just evil with no real reason ?.... Questions like this in the story ruins what could have been a very emotional trip when a backstory of a character is revaled.Over all this was a very good game, for an inde game..... and it only lacks in some aspects when looked at thougly.

												This game. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. It's fantastic. The story is an A+, the artwork is an A+, and it physically ""feels"" good to play. This game has brought a huge range of emotions out of me due to the awsome writing, and the gameplay itself, even though the concept stays the same, it never gets boring. The characters are loveable (especially fidget).All in all, this game gets a solid 9/10. Only main flaw is that it lacks replayability once the story is over.			"

												An absolutely must-have for any PC gamer. One of the best Indie titles i've seen in years! You can really tell that Humble Hearts put so much effort into making this Indie title. This adventure has an amazing story, with tons of frenetic battles, exploration and fun. You're Dust, a mysterious being without remembering anything from the past. While you fight your way through monsters, you'll eventually discover what you are and who you are, where you came from and where your path will lead you. Awesome game. Great art design, music, story, and characters. Just fun to play. Perfect and recommended for Indie and ARPG fans. Not so good things: Only problem that some of you might have, is that the game has a lot of ""Furries"". If you don't like Furries much, then this game probably isn't for you.			"

												Almost every aspect of this game is just perfect; the music, the art style, the gameplay/combat, and the voice acting.I know that most people would just point out that the game in general was short... however there is more to it than that. If i would say what the major problem of this game would probly be the depth of the story, the whole plot twist didn't affect me too much and alot of the characters backstories are not very well explained and bland. Was cassius just evil with no real reason ?.... Questions like this in the story ruins what could have been a very emotional trip when a backstory of a character is revaled.Over all this was a very good game, for an inde game..... and it only lacks in some aspects when looked at thougly.

In its hand painted fantasy world, Elysian is brought to life in an experience of plot twists and unexpected turns that shows the beauty art can put into a game.Gameplay is flawless and the challenge to return through the game on its hardest mode is more than worthwhile to complete and collect the 12 companions.I recommend this title to any of my friends and anyone really to journey into Dust's world.

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is without a doubt a fantastic game. Gameplay wise its commonly seen as a Brawler Action-RPG where you stick with one weapon but continue to learn new combos and upgrade its power (along with other stats). The animations as well as the world design are top notch and surprisingly all done by one man. The story is pretty good, the music is very well composed, and there is plenty to do in the game.As a PC port its perfect, plenty of options that aren't present in most PC ports. I without a doubt recommend this game to anyone that has interest in the games. At full price this game is more then worth it but if you can get it at a 50-75% off sale then please do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you likely won't regret it if you're interested in its gameplay style.

												By far one of the best indie games I've played.  If you enjoy games such as Shadow Complex, Castlevania: SOTN, and Super Metroid, then there should be no reason why you can't get into this game.There are multiple difficulty levels and the blueprint, item, equipment, and consumable system is rather nicely implemented.  The difficulty can be challenging at times but in a nice way.  It doesn't drive you to frustration like veteran mode in Call of Duty, where you're getting shot at from thin air.I love the art style and music in this game also, and it is worth noting that it runs and looks very good.  The aspect of running up combos and managing your chains in-between avoiding enemies and not exhausting yourself is very nice.Definitely recommend this game to basically anyone, especially if it is on sale, however, the regular price is very fair.

												First of all, let me say that I enjoyed Dust immensly. It is a great mix of hack n slash / RPG with platforming elements. It is a 2d sidescroller similar to games like Castlevania so, if you enjoyed those series, this is right up your alley. It features quests and sidequests that you need to complete, and you can revisit previous areas through an extremely simple and functional map system. Revisiting is mandatory if you wish to get the full experience out of the game, since it is drowning in collectibles and easter eggs, which i found really creative.The RPG element consists of finding/crafting/buying armour, weapons and various trinkets that have a lot of different abilities allocated to them, so that you can have your own gameplay style, although you most probably will go with higher armor/attack, so there is not so much variety as you might originaly think. You also get experience by killing creatures and completing quests, and when you hit the mark, you gain a level and allocate one point(gem) in one of four different stats.There is a lot of exploration and cool fights in Dust, that will probably keep you invested if you like this type of game. The story is also quite interesting, since it is not what you will probably think at first. I wont go into details to avoid spoiling it.All in all, a great action/rpg that kept me going for 15 hours, until i found everything. Highly recommended to action/rpg fans, similar to Castlevania.

												This game has very few flaws, but it has something I've not seen in complex games in years, pure fun. The combat system is unbelievably exhilarating and fulfilling. You play a character named Dust who has amnesia and has forgotten his past (one of the few flaws, considering how cliche that is.), with your little flying pal who's mostly used for comedic relief. But it doesn't go overboard on comedy either, the game is a perfect blend of art, fun, rpg, brawler, and platforming. Not having too much of any except fun.			"

Combat is fun and captivating from the very start till the very end of the game. The level-up, item, and ability progression is done very well, and the soundtrack is one of the best that I've ever heard. The very, very few downsides to this game are that it's not very long (I beat it 100% in ~16 hours on tough), the boss fights are easy, and the voice acting could be a little better.

												Easily one of my favorite Indie games out there. Dust: An Elysian Tail fancies a story about a protagonist's lost memories as he moves forward to uncover them. The game features a well written story, brilliant music, and some pretty decent graphics to boot. The voice acting is also something worth commending too...as each NPC has its own unique voice and personality.The game is a side-scroll RPG and while that may sound strange at first - it's actually well done. My only ""complaint"" is that a sequel hasn't been officially announced yet. XDIf you're on the fence about purchasing this game - go for it.			"

												I really liked this game for many reason, how the story goes, how interaction works and how you can grind and get better vs your enemies out in the game later on. So, not to spoil anything, I would just recommend this because it's awesome ;D			"

												Dust: An Elysian Tail is possibly the best platforming beat 'em up on the market. The game's tutorial is quick-paced yet informative. Combat is fun and captivating from the very start till the very end of the game. The level-up, item, and ability progression is done very well, and the soundtrack is one of the best that I've ever heard. The very, very few downsides to this game are that it's not very long (I beat it 100% in ~16 hours on tough), the boss fights are easy, and the voice acting could be a little better. This game is a solid 9/10 and a must play for any gamer.			"

												A wonderfully crafted Metroidvania style collect-a-thon with plenty of challanging combat on higher difficulties. The story being one of self discovery and the journey of a saviour for a war torn land with plenty of twists and turns to leave you with questions that are slowly answered over the course of the game. Having played this game a lot on the xbox 360 I had to buy the steam version to support the developer of this little gem in the Metroidvania game genre.			"

												This game is uniq and charming. I've found some flaws buit a game made by a single person this is to be expected. Well for one is the blocking move is not explained right, which will give you a hard time first. Hold to block not Click to block. The other thing is that it is damn easy to control. I personally recomend rebinding the keys to a more DOS style, also deactivating the combination alt+shift under windows.Well another thing I didn't loved to much was the story, it was so cheesy but the characters are pretty well. I expecially love the Blacksmith Haley. I just love girls with big tools and doing some 'Manswork' they should put that more often into videogames.But I tell you , you will still enjoy the story because it has allot of charming moments. And it is not as cheesy as a a Disney Movie and those are awesome.Also the game just makes so much fun to play, even if it's so easy it just makes fun when everything starts to explode and you feal so skilled when you just punch the keyboard like a maniac and punch all this buttons to fly trough the sky slashing hords of enemies down.Oh and for everyone who doesn't like furries, there are no references made to this fandom as far as I am aware. It is clean tradition cartoony fun just with Antrophormotic Animals.			"

												Very good game a true GEM! Defenetly the best game i played so far in 2017. It beats triple A games easly.Pros:+ Cute characters+ Very good and intresting story from start to the end+ Unique art style+ Awsome voice acting+ Very relaxating music+ Mix of comedy and drama+ Epic boss battles+ Long gameplay ( took 11.5 hours to beat the main story and didn't completed all side quests yet )+ FidgetCons:- My gamepad only work with XE360 external program but this is not a big deal since i solved it really quick.- I hate spikes, my viewers on stream laughted on me i keep falling into them. >_<""To be honest this game has no cons..it's perfect.. maybe another con is that there is no Dust 2 yet.. :PI waiting for it with many others. It will be a instagrab for sure.Go get this game, don't wait for discounts it's well worth the full price.			"

												A gentle relaxed and game where there is no combat or even enemies. Just you and a dusty house that you have to clean. Beautifully created by one person. There is also a flying thing that helps you on this epic task.In all seriousness, Dust An Elysian Tail is an amzing game. It was developed by one person. It's an metroidvania game that has anstrong focus on combat. The combat sytem wotks wonderfully and getting a 1000 hit combo is not only doable, but a small side quest. The graphics are amazing. This is one of the most beutifull games I have ever player. The story was great, with good voice acting and a great soundtrack. A game that I would reccomend to anyone that likes 2D games.			"

												An absolutely beautiful game.  The smooth animation and hand-painted backgrounds are just amazing, especially when you remember it was all done by just one guy.  The storyline itself is a bit corny, but in an enjoyable way.  The voice acting is pretty good, especially Kimlinh Tran as Fidget (goes from adorable to sassy to heartbreaking, and all the while avoids going into full-blown Navi-like annoyance).  Also, most importantly, the game is fun to play.  The combat flows from graceful (basic sword attacks and combos) to epic (fire pillars) and back again.  All in all, definitely worth picking up and playing.			"

												While the younger generation may cry about furries, older gamers should know this for the Disney cartoon-inspired metroidvania it is.  I like it a lot.Hard locks and story prevent extensive sequence breaking.  The combat can devolve into a winning strategy of flying airstrikes.  There were some rare crashes.  Microsoft even donated their own problem with an improper update which cuts off the top half of videos.However, none of those things ruined my experience.  I was always exploring, crafting and completing sidequests with a dash of humor.  I made an effort to complete everything except the optional time challenges and enjoyed it all the way.Thanks again for the gift, The Visible Man! =)			"

It didn't take me long to fall in love with this game, practically as soon as I saw the main menu and listened to the song playing in the background, I was mesmerized, I quite literally stared at the menu as I listened to the song for a solid hour, practically having to force myself to start the game up.It's a good thing I did too, the game's art is absolutely eye poppingly beautiful, the vivid colors, all the tiny little effects on the screen, coupled with the music in the background just immersed me into the game's universe, I practically became obsessed with playing this game until the time I beat it, working to find every item in the game that I could as well.  The story is definately captivating, and the emotion and skill put into the voice acting even further immerses you into the game; there are scenes that you will laugh, scenes that will make you outright cry, and scenes that will fill you with determination, just how a good game should.  This is hands down a game that needs a sequel, or even more, the very thought of a sequel ever going into development sends chills down my spine.The Mithrarin shall return another day, and on that day, I will be waiting.

Just everything that happens makes you wonder what will become of Dust. As the story progresses, your interest rises and you get a real experience of what a game should really do emotionally. If you don't own this game already, I STRONGLY recommend you get it, it is worth every penny.			"

												In a world filled with anthropomorphic animals, that also contains normal animals, you are Dust, a guy who is either supposed to be a cat, a fox, or a wolf (I really cant tell) who wakes up without any memory and ends up being the chosen one to save the world, using a sword enchanted with the soul of a wise sounding man called Ahrah, whos being guarded by Fidget, a flying fox/cat thing who might contain part of the soul of Navi from Ocarina of Time. Stuff happens and I can't really be bothered going over the plot here.Gameplay-wise I think its the kind of game you would call 'God of War' like. You have a single button for your main attack but you can also include a second in combos. Whilst the combo attacks arent very numerous, the combat itself flows quite nicely and it's certainly feels satisfying; I especially liked Fidgets fire attack when using the 'Dust Storm'. Enemies do have some variation and different ones do respond differently to certain attacks; some need to be parried to be weakened, others might only get hit by Fidget's ranged attacks ect; I have no complaints with this part of the game. There is a level system where you can level up attack, HP, Defence, and Fidgets attack, although for me I just maxed out my attack first and that usually did it for me. The total level you can go up to in 1 stat is limited depending on how many levels you have gone up in total, and because of the level caps, you'll still get 3 stats maxed out before the cap is lifted even if you neglect one stat, like how I maxed out Attack, Defense and HP whilst leaving out Fidgets attack before the cap went. This means you're character will still end up pretty balanced for most of the game.Now for the plot and story elements... I havent finished the game so I can't speak fully for this. I was surprised at the amount of side quests there are; it makes the game feel more like an open world, which always is a surprise for me when playing 2D games. The main plot feels a little predictable so far, for example, there is one part in a cutscene that practically tells you what Dust really is (I will say though that it ended up not being exactly that straight forward). Its... interesting, but nothing special for me.I tell you what is special though, the voice acting. Fidget has a voice that's akin to having sandpaper shoved in my ear. Her dialogue is kind of witty at times though so I don't mind her character particuarlly much. However the voice acting for the whole game was kind of summed up when I met this guy for a side quest who had what was quite possibly the worst Irish accent I have ever heard. The voicing and dialogue are probably my biggest complaints in the game, having me skip each dialogue screen as soon as I've read the caption.However I think the game still gets a recommendation for me. The combat definitely feels good and there is plenty of depth with the variety of stat boosting items, crafting and side quests available. The art style is also fantastic, both for the characters and the environment. The story, while not really for me, I can see other people enjoying. My complaints about dialogue and voice aren't enough to completely taint the game for me. And also, anyone looking at this and thinking 'Omg what a furfag game' should probably think about whether their priorities are set straight.In summary, not fantastic, but certainly enjoyable, especially when muted!

												I bought it cause trailer showed some pretty interesting fighting scenes, i had no idea what i was getting myself into :)This game kept me interested form the very first frame and not once did i find it boring or repetative. Its one of those games that are easy to like and get into but hard to let go.First thing i noticed about it was the incredible and trully beautiful art style which really stands out. Every area of this game is very well done and is enriched with an AMAZING soundtrack that contributes so much to the atmosphere and overall feeling of the game world leaving you no choice but to love it.Second thing is combat which i soon realized is not exactly what i expected since i was looking for something with many, many, many moves to fight with but then again, it turned out that in this game its much more important to avoid being hit(could be due to my difficulty setting, cause i mostly go for the hardest one straight away if available) than to hit yourself. Even with few combos, this game managed to do what many games with much bigger move lists failed to and thats to make it fun, cause thats what games are all about, right? :) In addition to being fun, its also super fast and it makes you want to combo as much as possible and rewards the ones who do it with bonus XPGame also has many secrets. Some areas will be inaccessable or, more like, unreachable at first, but as you progress with the story and as Dust gains new skill, reaching those will no longer be a problem for you, while some secrets are just well hidden and require certain clues to find, so, as a completionist, i enjoyed this gameplay aspect very much.And last but not least, the story. I dont wanna spoil anything for anyone so i will just say that its pretty damn good, but it takes a while to get from intriguing to very interesting so, be patient :)If you are having second thoughts, i say go for it, theres really no reason not to like this trully amazing game that is bound to stay with you for a long time. Hope this review helpsOnly complainment i have about this Steam release is that it does not let me purchase OST! I really want this in my Steam library, Valve, plz fix			"

												Great beat 'em up + jRPG combination with tons of puzzles, action, fun, and emotional moments. Maneuverability is good, and story is mildly heart-warming.Could have used some more strategy factor, and item variability so you have to actually build Dust and Fidget, but nonetheless still great.

												Would you like a game that is a more light-hearted version of the Metroidvania series of games with more of an emphasis on  fighting and combos? Well that's pretty much exactly what this game is and it is done very well. It also has a relatively interesting anime-esque storyline which starts off a bit slow, but gradually gets better as you progress and the game even goes out of its way and voicing every single sidequest in the game to actually make you feel that what your doing is somewhat important rather than just feeling entirely like a fetch quest mission and the like. Definitely recommended unless you detest anime in which I could see you quitting from the opening cutscene and voice acting alone.			"

												★★★★☆      This is actually a really good game. So far into it of nearly 2 hours, and the gameplay is flawless. The graphics are superb with a pastel type background that is an absolute eye-candy fest. While the storyline seems cartoonish with the voice acting pretty good, you're soothingly lulled with a very good atmospheric background of music. The controls using an XBox 360 gamepad are very responsive while your character moves with good fluidity. If you're a fan of action RPG's, then I would highly suggest picking this one up. It works great on my rig running Win 7 64bit.			"

Posted: December 28, 2013
												I've put four hours into the game at the time of writing this. However, it is massively discounted during the Holiday sale and figured I should put my two cents in, as I believe the game is superb.Firstly, the graphics. They look fantastic. Characters look wonderful both on screen and during cutscenes (where larger portraits of themselves appear). Effects look good all around and the level of detail is crisp. I'm playing with all settings on high, for reference.Secondly, sound. All of the music is done by Hyperduck Soundworks and Funky Rustic, and it is all fitting and grand. Usually I mute the music in games and just run through my music library, but not this one. Lots of nice classical instrumentals so far. Voices are good too. Most every character has a voice and it doesn't suck. I think people may find Fidget a touch irritating, but I like the character and her personality's voice is suited well. Most of the sound assets in game (such as explosions and enemy grunts) are good, although standard. Having them is good but they won't stand out.Next is gameplay. Dust:AET plays much like a side-scrolling action game should with the added bonus of minor platfoming elements included. Most of the game so far has been beating the living daylights out of enemies with the occasional puzzle/trial. The combat is simple but satisfying; left click for attacking, right click for the Dust Storm special ability (and for combo continuations), middle click for Fidget's projectile ability. Q and E for dodge, although you don't have the ability immediately. Dust:AET also incorporates a little bit of an RPG style into it with the use of leveling up and equipment/crafting. They're light enough to stay relatively out of the way but defined enough so that you can't ignore or forget about them. Many of the screens are large and will vary between long corridor-style rooms and vertical platforming. The variation is fresh and doesn't make you feel like every room you enter is exactly the same as the one you've just exited from.As for the story, I'm halfway through it according to the save menu. It's enjoyable so far. It's not going to drag you in much as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Bastion, or Journey might, but it's good enough. I do care for the story and am looking forward somewhat to where things end up, unlike Dragon's Dogma where I just wanted to get to the locations the game pointed me to and beat all of the enemies to pulp.Overall I do recommend this game. With quick, simple, fluid combat and above-average...everything else, I think it would definitely be a worthy addition to any library. I paid full price for it and have found a good value in it, but during the sale the like, $4 purchase point should absolutely not hold you back from giving this game a try.Edit: I beat the game after another four hours or so of play and I stand by pretty much everything I've already stated, but wanted to make a few more points.I was playing on normal difficulty and the game is balanced nicely. It feels challenging where and when it should be and never seems to be scaled improperly. That being said, the game will punish you for stupid mistakes and I'm glad it does. The soundtrack gets better and better the more I listen to it. I do wish that a soundtrack edition gets released at some point. The voices still sound good and the writing gets better in the later chapters. And finally, the length of the game and its chapters are proper. I beat the game in eight hours and feel satisfied with the time I've spent playing the game.			"

												Dust does a wonderful job of telling a story. The story, at times sad, at times hilarious, is a great one. It is well put together and very pretty to look at. The soundtrack, while not super amazeballs on its own, fits perfectly when it needs to. Invoking adventure, anxiety, excitement, and sorrow in the player. The combat is fluid and fairly intuitive, using directions and three different forms of attacks. It is short, taking around 15 hours to 100%, with next to no replayability but those 15 hours were well spent. Any decent sale makes this game well worth the buy.You will finish this game with a smile on your face. "

												I've sat on this game for a long time thinking to myself: ""Well, it's so well known for being pretty. That's probably all it is! A pretty looking toy.""I'm happy to say (and sad that it took so long to discover) that it is NOT merely a pretty looking toy. The mechanics on display here are just as engaging as the visuals (to say nothing of the soundtrack that also scores top marks)!This is a game that grabs you in the first minutes of play and (so far at least, in my experience) only EVER leaves you wanting more. I may be jumping the gun with this review, but I'm already so impressed that I couldn't wait to share about this game. I look forward to getting sucked along further into this beatiful, melodious, and utterly engaging world. ^_^Duly recommended!			"

The Short and SweetFor those who are wondering if whether or not this is worth the money, especially during its weekend sale as of the time of this review, it is. You can't beat $3 for a funny, charming and animated story that attracts those young and old.The Meaty BitsThe game is a perfect introduction for those who are new to the RPG genre and want to test the waters as opposed to play say...a JRPG (Japanese Roleplaying Game). It also attracts those of us who remember such adventure games from the game systems of old. It has that charm of keeping your interest and wondering what the other screen will show as you move along.If you're younger and always wondered what it was like to play an adventure game in the days of Super Nintendo? Buy this game as an interactive history lesson.			"

												Grabbed it while it was on sale over the Thanksgiving discount fest. Even if you disagree with the art style there's a pretty enjoyable hack and slash combo game under it all. It's given me a few laughs too with the dialogue which is a nice bonus. Certainly recommend it whenever a sale's on.			"
