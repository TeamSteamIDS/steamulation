												The game is great, the gameplay is great, the story is so fun, there is many hidden stuff to find, you have the oportunity to make your own character almost as you want and to edit it when you want.Also the support team is very nice.If you are unsure I guess there is a demo version in their website.

												There are games created to simply make money, there are games created simply to go viral on Youtube. There are also games that are created, with the most innocent of intentions, to just be a game. Draw a Stickman EPIC is certainly the latter, and for that I give them credit as it’s becoming harder and harder to find a game you can just buy once and play all the way through. Unfortunately, this is where the positive points about the game end.The game will start you off drawing a rudimentary stickman which you will then guide around a series of levels in a top-down view, looking for the exit to unlock the next one. The levels can branch in different directions, meaning that you could end up unlocking a different level depending on which exit you took during your time playing the last one. Each level has various environmental puzzles that can be solved by drawing a specific object to use such as drawing an axe will let you chop down trees.The premise seems solid, but the final product will put you to sleep. Now that you’re vaguely familiar with the gameplay, let’s discuss what’s wrong with it. For starters, the drawing mechanic is kiddy-pool shallow. There are roughly 5 different things you can draw, in addition to the axe you can also draw fires, rain clouds, thunder clouds and keys. If you thought it would be a game like Okami where you draw bridges to progress, or Scribblenauts huge selection of drawings, you’re out of luck. Drawing keys is completely redundant, it’s not a puzzle to put a key in a lock, it just wastes time to keep having to draw them and they simply aren’t necessary. Additionally, each thing you can draw has its own pencil. The game isn’t smart enough to know what you’re actually drawing, so it determines what object you’ve drawn based on the pencil you’ve chosen which brings up the question, why do you have to draw the object at all? You can draw anything from a straight line, to a Salvador Dali replica but if you did it with the “axe” pencil, it will only ever see it as an axe.The next thing wrong with the gameplay is how monotonous it gets. One stage in particular stood out with this, where you had to use a key operated robot to plough through a wall. No clues were given on this, but there were a huge number of chests, barrels and boxes around, and yes you had to just keep breaking them all open one at a time until you found the right one (by drawing an axe, which breaks after 3 swings and needs to be drawn again). Once found, along with finding the control box in a similar way, you needed to use keys to turn the robot in 90 degree increments until it was facing the right direction (keys, again, get 3 uses before you need to draw a new one). Additionally, you needed keys to operate the control box to make the robot move forward, then turn it yet again after it moves to re-align it with the target. Dull as a butter knife, because it’s obvious what you have to do, it just takes so long to do it because of having to redraw all your tools, but then why couldn’t you have just made it so the robot can be turned around without keys at all?This is the main issue the game has, in fact. Everything is so straightforward, but it’s made difficult and more time-consuming from having to stop every couple of steps to “draw” something. You can’t move while drawing, so it’s essentially little more than padding so that the game will last longer than 30 minutes.Poor level design ensures that tedium is never far away, with most puzzles boiling down to destroying everything you can, looking for clues in the environment (such as using a lightning cloud over a gravestone with a lightning symbol on it) then clicking on any interactive objects until you find the exit. The best way to describe the gameplay is like a point-and-click adventure with no plot… or colour.The graphics are abysmal and I don’t buy the “it’s the style” argument. If you set out to design a game that looks like this from the start, then you probably should have changed the concept before you began working on it. Justifying bad art does not make it any less bad.Each level is a static, flat image completely devoid of colour or artistic talent. Everything that moves does so with animation tweening of a single frame in the same way bad Flash animations do.  This would be excusable if any of these actually looked like some effort had been put into drawing them, but no. The style dictates that everything has to look like it was drawn by a 5-year old, but it’s not even doing that right, it looks like a game drawn by a grown man to LOOK like the drawings of a 5-year old.Draw a Stickman EPIC barely qualifies as a game, being the digital equivalent of those baby toys with shapes that fit into specific holes. And just like those toys, I cannot possibly recommend this to anyone over the age of 3 due to choking hazards.Pros:~Doesn’t crash very oftenCons:~Grotesque graphics and animation~Painfully repetitive gameplay~No replay value~More time spent in the pencil UI than solving puzzles~Drawing mechanics have the depth of a pancake			"

												Draw a Stickman attempts to occupy an area between Scribblenauts and Drawn to Life, but by subsidizing its biggest selling point with a plethora of terrible design decisions it completely misses the mark. This is not a game for those looking to flex their creativity as there is little needed or allowed, and it is not a game for fans of point-and-click adventures as the puzzles are anything but and the story non existent. So who exactly is this intended for? Well, I would have to say nobody as it is just not fun and far more trouble than it is worth.For a game seemingly based around drawing there is a shockingly low amount of it here. You begin the game by creating your own stickfigure, a task which somehow evolved from a mundane diversion on restaurant napkins into a frustratingly imprecise procedure, as the pencil takes on a mind of its own and places itself at random several points from where you intended. Considering MS Paint did it better more than a decade ago, I have no idea how the developers managed to screw up such a basic and integral part of the game.Once you have your character you are placed into a sketched out world and given a handful of different markers with which to get past obstacles and enemies. The problem is that while you are encouraged to draw something resembling the item that will come out of your chosen marker (for example a raincloud or key) the game makes no qualms about what shape you actually end up with. This was disappointing as I was hoping for something a little more involving, but when you have to draw the same four items dozens of times it becomes trivial to actually flesh them out when a simple straight line acts much the same way. Worsening this is the speed at which you must draw to stay alive, as you can withstand but two hits from the numerous enemies, and a death means restarting the level from the very beginning.This in itself would be annoying and the terrible controls only escalate the problem. I frequently got stuck on the environment and has animations break, as well as often getting hit by my own creations. Despite the backgrounds being drawn with an illusion of depth the markers don't adhere to it, acting more like stickers placed on a glass pane than something being drawn into the picture. It makes drawing even more of a chore than it already was, forcing you to frame the screen at awkward angles, and adding an unfair challenge to the challenges which are never explained in the first place. A repeated task involves making yourself bait to lure enemies toward certain areas, which is neither fun nor often works correctly and usually ends up with you getting killed and repeating the process several dozen more times. Whatever I expected out of Draw a Stickman it didn't deliver on any front. The controls and gameplay butchered any potential it could have had and left me with a sour taste in my mouth when I beat it in about two hours. Not because of the short length, but for how quickly I grew tired of it and wanted out. There are hidden levels and collectibles to find which may extend your playtime, but I can in no way recommend it in the first place. As yet another example of what happens when a good idea doesn't get off the ground, Draw a Stickman in no way lives up to its exaggerated subtitle which given the quality of the game, almost writes the joke itself.

												Cute little game. You don't really have to draw anything. A mere line can be a key or fire or even your guy. But it is fun to draw your stuff. The puzzles are not too challenging for somebody used to gaming, but it is a little too punishing and difficult for a kid or ultra casual audience, which I would assume to be the main market for this. Its the kind of game I'd have my girlfriend or parents play (who never play games) but I think they'd get too frustrated with it. There should be an easy mode for that. It should also autosave more than just at the start of each level. I found that if I nearly completed a level, but died at the end of it, I didn't want to bother replaying the whole level.			"

												It's weird to see many reviews with less than 2 hours recommending this game being featured on the front page, since you need more than 2 hours to beat this game. I've played this game for more than 8 hours to get 100% achievements. I wanted to recommend this game, but I really can't.This game is based on the novel idea of drawing your own character and your own tools to progress the game. The idea is good, the artwork is decent, there is a plot, and even there are additional puzzles and Easter eggs.But, there are quite a couple flaws in either the design or implementation of this game, that makes playing this game very frustrating quite oftenly: What you draw is irrelevant in most cases -- you actually click to choose a pencil from a couple to indicate what you are trying to draw, and for most of those you can just draw a straight line for axe, key, cloud, and fire. This makes the entire ""drawing"" concept meaningless. Plus, most of the things can only be used for once or three times, so if you are trying to draw perfectly every time, it may take you a few extra hours to beat game. It's actually 3D-in-2D game, but this game deals with collision quite bad -- sometimes it looks like there is no obstacle but you just can't move. There is no pathing implemented, if you want to go to point B from point A, even if they are connected by some path, but as long as there is some obstacle lying in the connecting straight line, clicking on point B will just lead you to the obstacle -- you need to bypass it yourself. There is no saving inside a level, and if you take damage twice within a short time period, you will die and have to start over again. And it's really easy to die without even knowing why due to the two issues above, and some levels take ~10 mins to complete. There is the Paul Bunyan achievement which requires you to chop down 500 trees, but at the time I got all the other achievements , I have only chopped down 40 trees. Seeing that woodcutting isn't an important part to win this game, I think this achievement is quite obnoxious. I basically did nothing but to chop 460 trees for 40 minutes. "

												The good: This is a fun little logic puzzle game, and you can experiment and have some creativity with your character and your tools. The art style is cute. It's not a long game (there is one achievement in particular that requires a lot of grinding, and I think this accounts for the number of hours a lot of people have in this). Some of the puzzles are challenging, and all have extra collectibles to find or things to do. The bad: Poor damage & combat mechanics make the game somewhat more difficult than it needs to be. You can kill yourself quite easily with lightning or fire, and if any monster gets ahold of you it is generally lights out quite quickly, and with no checkpoints or saves in levels, this can mean some frustrating restarts.General info: You play a little stick person trying to rescue your friend (coincidentally, another stick person) and questing through a sketched world. The actual artistic skill required to play this game is zero (all your ""tools"" can be straight lines if you wish), but it's definitely more fun if you take the time to sketch and enjoy. Replay value is low, once you've figured out the puzzles. Overall: I don't know that I'd purchase it at full price, but if you pick it up during the Steam sales, I would recommend it!System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

												All things considered, Draw a Stickman: Epic is quite an original puzzle game in its own right. The game’s narrative follows its protagonist (which you draw) to find and rescue your best friend (also drawn by you) from the clutches of a selfish miser who wants your magic pencil for his own diversion.The Good:+ Original puzzles + Sensible achievements+ Casual puzzler+ Personalized Story – your friend is even listed in the end creditsThe Bad- Drawing items is tiring after a while – especially with a mouseMost of the puzzles revolve around the elements (rain, lightning, fire) while others involve keys and tree chopping. To successfully complete levels you will need to utilize all the pencils provided you at the start of that level in combinations to progress through the levels. The manner in which drawn elements are utilized by you is (to me) a very refreshing and major attraction to the game. There is just so much which doesn’t meet the eye at first but after a few hour of playtime you get those ‘ah-ha’ moments which make puzzles rewarding and worth it. Draw a Stickman: Epic is a somewhat short game but well worth the time investment, Even if you don’t cheat you can net all the achievements within a day providing you are willing to do a small amount of grinding.

												Draw a Stickman: EPIC is one of these games, you see a screenshot and you know how it will be. You get some magical pencils which you can use to paint with your mousecursor functional things. It doesn't really matter how they look like, important is that they do their job well. An axe that chops trees, fire that burn things or enlight fuses, and weather clouds which generate on the one side rain, one the other they throw lightnings. The graphics in this game are unique also the look and feel of nature and names for example the ""Armakillo"". You will love this game, because there are details you even cannot imagine in a computer game. Or have you ever seen rabbits, that grow up by eating fresh toast out of a toaster that was energized by a lightning before? Alltogether nice visuals, nice soundtrack, amazing gameplay. but one unneccessary achievement: to chop 500 trees with a really bad axe. My hands are still aching.			"

Product received for free
												Draw a Stickman: EPIC is an adventure game where you need the main objective of the game is: that you need to find your friend who has been abducted by someone who has a magic pencil like you. In the game you need to draw tools, weapons and elements to clarify puzzles and to affect obstacles. At the beginning of the game, you need to draw a character which you play and your friend. But your friend gets abducted when you’ve finished drawing your friend. At the beginning you can use the element: fire. With this element you need to burn an wooden fence and to set fire on bombs which are somehow on the ground waiting for you to explode. My impressions of the game.The game isn’t really  exciting as you think it would be, because the game gets boring when you play like four minutes. The Pros and Cons of the game.Pros:- The game has creativity (not much, but I can live with it)- The game has trading cards- The game has an interesting beginning Cons:- The game gets most of the times boringI don’t recommend this game, except if it is in a sale for a great price.Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												The game advertises that you’ll be able to draw things in order to help your little stickman along the adventure. The truth is, the game can’t tell what you’re drawing so it gives you magical pencils, each one catered to drawing a certain item. Some of the levels are quite simple while others will require a bit more thought. There are also pages and puzzle pieces scattered around for you to collect that are generally more difficult than getting to the end of the level.Game: 6.5/10Graphic: 6.5/10100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard			"

												Crayon physics meets...an...adventure game? I guess? Draw a stickman is really far less creative than it sells itself as. The objects you draw aren't actually related to their shapes, but rather the function you choose to draw them with. The game offers you a pathetic attempt at a story, tosses you some hand-drawn 5-year old levels and then asks you to ""puzzle solve"" your way through them by combining the functions of different colors with the few objects that those functions are actually capable of interacting with in the level.So, realistically, this game isn't actually about solving puzzles or even progressing through anything so much as it is an interactive hide and seek between your functions and the objects those functions affect. ...I'll pass.

												""Draw a Stickman: EPIC"" isn't quite the EPIC experience it might have been, but it does have enough epic moments to satisfy a seven-year old girl playing with her daddy.  Off on a quest to rescue her best friend (a potato with hair), there was ample satisfaction gained by wielding mustachioed keys and smiley-faced axes.Although the early levels are easily played by children, the latter half of the game is not (and we resorted to a FAQ for the final level).  Fortunately, the death screens are greatly amusing.  In the end enough amusement was had by all to make the experience well worth it.---------------------------------Potato: A FableOnce upon a time there was a girl whose Daddy nicknamed her ""Potato"".  This was quite annoying, for her father was quite absent-minded and would occasionally pluck at her cheek thinking he was grabbing a chunk of potato to eat.  ""Daddy!"" she would squeal.  ""I'm not a potato!  Potatoes can't talk!""  Upon this reminder his face would sink in shame and he would promise, promise, to remember that his daughter was not, in fact, a potato, and then five minutes later he would pluck at her cheek once again.Daddy was a very nice Daddy, the girl decided, but not blessed with an over-abundance of brains.One day they were at the local park, walking along a quiet trail that wended its way through a dense forest.  The girl was eyeing her father's hand suspiciously as it crept ever-closer to her cheek when suddenly a loud Boom! shook the treetops and knocked them to the ground.  Confused and unsure, the girl and her Daddy slowly got back to their feet, coughing and waving the clouds of dust away.  And as the dust began to settle, they saw what had appeared in front of them.It was tall, twice the height of the girl.  It was heavy.  It was pocked with weird-little marks like eyes.  It was dull brown.  It was a potato.The potato grabbed the girl's father with spindly black arms.  ""No!"" the girl shrieked.  The potato turned as if daring her to do something.  It still held her Daddy, who had fainted and gone quite limp.The girl took an involuntary step back.  For an instant she considered fleeing - after all, what could she do against a potato twice her size?  But then she saw the potato use its free hand to poke at Daddy's cheek, as if wondering how much it could pluck away. . .""No!"" she shouted, and leapt forward.  The potato reared back in surprise, but the girl already had it in her pincer-like grip. . .When her father came to, they were once again alone in the forest.  ""What happened?"" her Daddy asked.  His eyes remained unfocused, and the girl tensed as he brought his hand close to her face - only to pat the top of her head.  She sighed in relief.""Oh, nothing,"" she said breezily.  Then she belched, long and deep and full of flavor.  Her Daddy turned green.  ""But,"" she added as he struggled not to throw up, ""can I skip dinner tonight?""------------------------I think I need more sleep.			"

												Draw a Stickman: EPIC was a wonderful experience from start to finish. I could see the game being not only great with children, but also adults looking for a simple and creative outlet. I enjoyed EPIC with five close friends gathered around to make jokes and generally enjoy how bad at drawing we each were. Fun for 5 minutes or 3 hours. It never even got old for a group of people playing at the same time.			"

												This game is absolutely fun and hilarious! I've played both the Android and PC versions; each offers their own bit of fun while keeping with the story. My favourite thing to do is draw myself and then draw one of my friends as the person I'm going to save. Play this game; it will make your day infinitely better.			"

												Let me cut this short. I have this game on my Kindle Fire HD, and I know i haven't played this much yet on the pc but I just could not resist the deal ( Which was 50% Off By The Way ) and the story of this funny game is that you need to go and save your friend who is being kidnapped by a stickman with a magical pencil that can draw anything. You also have a magical pencil too, but, you have a couple of different one's for different levels and also you get to draw anything like you can draw a cat as fire of a burger for a sword. That's not the best part of it. You get to create your own stickman your own way and also your friend and it is entertaining ( in my opinion ) for all ages. if I have to rate it out of 10, I would give it 8/10. So why dont you have a try of it, it's very cheap for a good game!!! "

												Overall-4/10Value for Price-Buying it on sale is a must. Considering there are free versions of the game on other platforms I am not sure why its normally valued at $5. I know five bucks is cheap, but the game really isnt worth more than a couple dollars in my opinion.Gameplay-Stickman felt like it was designed for either a younger or less experienced gamer. The Idea of drawing your own tools and items was the primary selling point for me. Unfortunatley, its actually just about 5 options the entire game- axe, key, cloud, fire, and armor. You cannot be creative and draw anything outside of that criteria.Sound-The music was fantastic and catchy. No complaints there. The main menu's music sounded oddly similar to the menu-tune from ""The Wolf Among Us"" by Telltale games.Graphics-The game delivers exactly what you would expect from a stick-figure title. however, the customization of your character was slightly dissapointing due to the bulky lines you had to doodle with. A fine-point pencil/pen would have been better in my opinion.Replay Value-The game was too short and the only challenging level was the final boss fight. I cant see myself replaying a game this quick and easy.I cant recommend this game to most customers. If you are purchasing for a younger person or new gamer it might be worth your time.			"

I must say I didn't enjoy this game at all. I've seen this before and I must say the iPhone version was 10x better. I didn't really find anything in this game to keep me from leaving and doing something else. Most of the steam users are older and don't find this too interesting, in fact most of them would just draw private parts and profanity. It's not a game I would recommend for anyone.			"

Draw your protagonist, draw some minor tools along the way to help you. It works - it can be funny. You will have to put in a token amount of effort to navigate through the levels. The challenges are scripted however and it does not matter what you draw just what you draw it on or use it on. "

												A realy nice small adventure game that actually has some small twists and hidden features in it.The setup is a classic ""save the princess"" szenario (although here: a friend) Pro: The stickman style and the possibility to draw your own hero AND friend gives you a fun atmosphere (my hero was an anoying  orange and my friend a flying banana) The puzzles in the game can be quite trickyMany Hidden features (for example a new pencil that grants an armor buff)Some variety to get to the last stage and finishing a stageCons: Realy ANNOYING grinding achievements... I mean cutting down 500 trees when you actually need to cut down about 10 trees in the whole game for completing the game. And 1000 flames where you draw about 100 in a playthrough.About 3 hours of my playtime is only grinding for these achievements. 2 other hours about for all the other missing ones, this is an okay time for such a short game)Not the hardest difficulty, but every person has another taste so this might be a + for others.The game has no drawing detection, this might be to not insult players for sucking at drawing and not being able to draw a proper cloud. However.. you can just draw a line if you are lacy and the same effect as a proper drawn cloud comes out.. this destroys the fun and the difficulty in some parts where you need to draw fast.All in all i would give this game 7/10  It was fun but it could be way better with a proper drawing detection, a bit harder stages (more aggressive / faster dragons for example) and without silly grind achievements but more secrets.. ( i mean you dont get an achievement for getting the armor pencil but for choping down 50 trees)You need about 3-4 hours for completing all stages. Fast players will do it in about 2 hours. Playthroughers in 1.5 hours.			"

												I thought this was a fun game.  You have to make your way through a series of levels by using a limited number of tools that you draw using magic pencils.  The game isn't too difficult, but the first time solving a new puzzle can be tricky, but once you get it, that solution method will often work in other levels.  The tools do change between levels though, so sometimes new solutions are required.  Finding at least one path through to the end also isn't too hard, but if you want to find every path, puzzle piece, and color buddy, it can take a while.  Still, this is probably a 5-6 hour game rather than say twice that.  And there are achievements, should you want some additional challeneges after completing the main story.  Overall, a nice game -- I like games like this that give some challenge, but aren't too difficult or too long.			"

												I bought this game for 1€ from a Humble Bundle, got 100% in all the levels on the phone in about three days and then did the same on the PC. Loved it all the way through. The fact that you actually draw your charachter and the ``damsel in distress`` is really great, and drawing your own tools just makes it even better! The art style looks great, the story is nothing special but the gameplay is really fun. If you wanna draw genitalia everywhere, you can! If you want to play this seriously and actually draw the tools properly, you can do that too!The only things I felt missing were a better port for the PC, (the controls are pretty much the same as in the mobile version, except that you can move with WASD) and also the ability to save your drawings and use them multiple times instead of drawing in again every time wold be great. Overall, this game is amazing and I totally recommend it! Especially if its on sale.			"

												If you've always wanted to see your drawings animate and be brought to life, then Draw A Stickman: Epic is definitely a game you should try. While the concept of drawing the tools to solve puzzles sounds Scribblenauts-ish, that is where the similarity ends. Even though drawing the same doodles repeatedly grows tiresome after a while, Draw A Stickman's strength lies in some of the more challenging puzzles, and its surreal, illustrative graphics. There are also a number of hidden levels, a nice touch for the cheap price!It's perfect for you if you enjoy casual puzzles, but not if you are a puzzle enthusiast.

												It's sorta like Scribblenauts, except you can't summon Thor, drive a convertible into Armageddon while wielding a cursed bullwhip, or clone an army of floating evil dachshunds.It's almost like Zelda, except without the overarching storyline, complex and innovative graphics, or levels that last longer than five minutes.It's kinda Okamish, except minus the unique art style, deep cultural background and abundant cartoon breasts.But it's five bucks, and that's just perfect. It's a silly, amusing little distraction where you make a guy and waggle him around doing stuff, setting everything on fire, accidentally blowing yourself up, and never actually killing anything. If you've got a little kid who unwisely chooses to hang around you, it's probably one of those rare games that you can both enjoy together. The devs are neat, and keep throwing stuff out there just because it's apparently fun to make.I mean, yeah, it's not Skyrim, but if you're expecting a deep, creative and complex action-RPG with a concept like this, you should probably look into that gushing head wound.

												This game isn't fun to me.Fun for me is shooting a flamethrower at a unicorn while paragliding out of an Apachii helicopter headed towards a black hole, all while listening to loud Dubstep music. I would have to be innebriated of course.Anyways-To the review-The point of this game is to draw a hero (whom you control), then a lover. The lover then somehow gets seperated from the hero and you must reunite with them, solving simple puzzles by drawing pictures along the way. For instance, a tree blocks your path, you can then draw an axe and proceed by cutting it down (Burning it is also an option). Its cute. Mainly the type of game that is  preferred to be played while in solitary confinement in a top security prison, with a life sentence, as with most games of this nature. Dont get me wrong, the developer did a swell job on making the game, it just wasnt for me.			"

												I absolutely love the puzzles in this game! Not only is it simply adorable, but its also a challenge. It will test your patience and your mind in these wacky and cute levels to get back your best friend!I, personally, drew a bunny instead of a stickfigure and a carrot as the best friend instead of the common damsel in distress. The game is unfortunately, very short. The best part of the game for me was that you were able to use creativity in a game without it being over baring and overly time consuming. Also, you had to figure out for yourself just how to beat ""bosses"", or try to pick up on the clues in the game. Within the first 10 minutes, I was beating levels and gaining achievements.Overall Rating: 7/10Why 7? 1: the game was too short. 2: Several of the achievements are ridiculous such as the ""Draw a 1,000 fires"" even though you only need about 100 fires to beat the entire game. 3: When you clicked to move some where, sometimes your character will be stuck, but only because movement is blocked from the bulkiness of a drawn character. Just makes it frustrating, especially if you're trying to run away.			"

												This game is damn creative.   You get to draw your own character who becomes slightly animated as you move through levels.  You gain ""pencils"" and other stuff which you can draw fire, which has its own effects, clouds, lighting, rain, and keys.  I""m sure quite abit more to as the game progresses.  Not sure the actually price of the game on steam but its well worth a couple a bucks without hesitation.  For some reason screenshots aren't working though which is a bummer.

I actually was playing this using Monoprice 10707 19 inch pen display, and it works great!Even if you can't draw pretty well on paper, it's still a fun and challenging game, and you can easily get around by drawing simple shapes using a mouse. After all, you don't need a lot of artistic talent to draw a stick man, clouds, keys, axes, and fire. Even the game recognizes simple red scribbles as fire.Definitely recommend it!			"

												If you are bad in drawing you would have to stare at your awful creation for hours. And some parts of this game are diffucult - there are no directions or specific places you're supposed to go, they give you a sentence and expect you to know what to do. Let's say for example you are given a present (without further instructions) to deliver to the child that wants it most, in a room of 100 children, how do you know which one he/she is?This game can be recommended, but needs some more developement.

												Hard to put a yes/no on this one, but for the price of 2.99 I would say it's alright. This game is like a piece of candy: cheap, enjoyable, but don't expect it to last. Some levels were challenging, others not so much. The greatest pleasure in this game comes from the creative characters. Funny watching yourself get saved by your own dog, or a wierd creature trying to save a dalek. I also enjoy making very ""creative"" keys, axes, and other things. you can watch your character chop down about three targets with a stapler if you want, or make it look like an accessory while your character holds it. However, ""challenging"" puzzles weren't quite as fun since you are basically wandering around aimlessly if you can't figure out the next step. It can be painfully annoying, rather than tricky in the fun way. I think with a lot more options, both in crayon types and in world build, it might be more fun. Some (even the later levels and the Christmas one) are simple, and go by very fast. I have already beat a vast majority of the game in 8.5 hours, albeit I peaked at a few solutions after the ""challenge"" was no longer enjoyable. I would like to see a game with more strategy options, where if you are confused you are still trying things, rather than wandering around aimlessly.			"

												It's weird to see many reviews with less than 2 hours recommending this game being featured on the front page, since you need more than 2 hours to beat this game. I've played this game for more than 8 hours to get 100% achievements. I wanted to recommend this game, but I really can't.This game is based on the novel idea of drawing your own character and your own tools to progress the game. The idea is good, the artwork is decent, there is a plot, and even there are additional puzzles and Easter eggs.But, there are quite a couple flaws in either the design or implementation of this game, that makes playing this game very frustrating quite oftenly:What you draw is irrelevant in most cases -- you actually click to choose a pencil from a couple to indicate what you are trying to draw, and for most of those you can just draw a straight line for axe, key, cloud, and fire. This makes the entire ""drawing"" concept meaningless. Plus, most of the things can only be used for once or three times, so if you are trying to draw perfectly every time, it may take you a few extra hours to beat game.It's actually 3D-in-2D game, but this game deals with collision quite bad -- sometimes it looks like there is no obstacle but you just can't move.There is no pathing implemented, if you want to go to point B from point A, even if they are connected by some path, but as long as there is some obstacle lying in the connecting straight line, clicking on point B will just lead you to the obstacle -- you need to bypass it yourself.There is no saving inside a level, and if you take damage twice within a short time period, you will die and have to start over again. And it's really easy to die without even knowing why due to the two issues above, and some levels take ~10 mins to complete.There is the Paul Bunyan achievement which requires you to chop down 500 trees, but at the time I got all the other achievements , I have only chopped down 40 trees. Seeing that woodcutting isn't an important part to win this game, I think this achievement is quite obnoxious. I basically did nothing but to chop 460 trees for 40 minutes.			"

												Всем привет.Довольно простая и интересная игра.Которая как не странно на свою простоту именно в исполнении, способна завлечь вас не на один час(Это конечно с учетом того что вы будете проходить все сами, а не по подсказкам на ютубе).Вы играете за персонажа которого сами и рисуете, в любой момент игры сможете его перерисовать. Человечек вышедший из графического редактора Pain, бегает по таком же рисованному миру и спасает своего товарищу(Имя так же вы ему даете).Физика не сказать что деревянная но в некоторых местах все же подводить.Музыкальное сопровождение отличное, ненавязчивое и старается поддерживать вас в расслабляющем состоянии и честно говоря это там очень нужно! Дело в том что ваш подопечный дохнет от 2 ударов, и приходиться проходить уровень заново. Причем опасность подстерегает вас не только от мобов которые стараются вас убить но и от вас самого. Вы ко всему прочему имеете некий волшебный карандаш который рисует ключ, огонь, топор, грозовые облака(Все зависит от типа уровня и задач которые нужно выполнить на нем) и тд. И стоит где то неверно нарисовать опасные вышеперечисленные предметы и вы в начале уровня. Возможно конечно, что это только моя проблема из за кривоты мои рук.Всем советую.P.S. Так же хочется отметить добавление новогоднего уровня, приятно удивил.			"

												Draw a Stickman (un)EPIC is a very casual game. Actually so casual that it hurts your brain. You start out by drawing your character and proceed to draw your mate that get's captured by evil book as soon as you're finished with his sketch. Next thing you know you enter an area that is roughly drawn like a childrens book that no children wants to look at. You are tasked to set stuff on fire by drawing with a red pen. You can lit a TNT bar by just making a red mess next to it or right on it. This is where the pain hits you. Is this ""game"" really this hollow? You blow rocks away with that TNT to move forward and possibly light every sigle tree on fire. It's not fun but you do it because you can. Then you find a secret puzzle piece that is not hidden well enough to qualify as a secret and move on to next level. As soon as you notice that the next level is pretty much as deep as the first one you quit the game, delete it and sell the cards way too cheap just to get rid of the bad memories. Do yourself a favor and ruin your life some other way. This is too horrible to recommend for anyone aged 6+.			"

												Are you over the age of 5?You won't enjoy this. It's too shallow to even call a puzzle game. It's too entirely pointless to call an adventure game.You draw axes and keys - or in most cases, lines, scribbles, and phallic objects - and click things. And you run away from bees.That's it.			"

												What a cute game! The childish art and music are delightful. The premise of the plot is that you and your friend, both of which you get to draw (MS Paint style), are hanging out until a book falls out of nowhere. As soon as your friend takes a look at it, he or she is sucked in and kidnapped! You jump in after them, and thus your journey begins. Each level is a map which you explore in order to uncover collectibles and more levels. Puzzles must be solved in order to get to the end of each level.So far, the puzzles I have completed are not too hard. There is a decent amount of collectibles per level, such as new colors for your palette, so exploration is recommended. Different ""effect"" colored pencils are available per level, such as fire, rain, lightning, and keys. Sometimes you use them directly to complete a goal or damage an enemy, but other times you use them to manipulate the environment.The sound effects are funny (such as when you accidentally burn yourself), and the background music fits the game well.I haven't encountered many bugs, but sometimes my character gets stuck on a rock or tree. It's easily solvable by clicking away from the obstacle.Overall, it's a charming and enjoyable game.			"

												Let me just give a breif description on why this game is NOT worth it. First of all, the drawing mechanics are hard to use unless you have a drawing tablet. Next, the gameplay is quite boring. The game goes from laughably easy to hard as nails really fast, and the controls in the game are just awful. There is almost no story at all, and the music in the game is very forgettable. Overall, this game was a brave attempt to turn a mobile game into a pc game, but it fell short on it's transition. 5.5/10			"

												I originally played Draw a Stickman on my Android a while back, it was one of Amazons “Free App of the Day” offers. I played a fair bit considering it was on mobile and enjoyed it to a reasonable degree (again considering it was on mobile). I don’t know exactly what I expected when I first booted it up on Steam, but what I got was just a blown-up, keyboard and mouse version of the exact same game I had already gotten my enjoyment out of.Needless to say, there is nothing here that is not in the mobile version. I only got about an hour of enjoyment out of it and I don’t think it would be worth investing any money in. Stickman is a much more appealing buy on a tablet if you have younger kids/cousins who you could guide on an adventure together, but as a standalone game it’s very bland.			"

												As the name suggests, you draw things to explore a 3D environment with a 'stick man'. Like drawing a fire to light a fuse, gates, etc to clear obstacles. Simple, intuitive, endearing game play. Nice backing track, makes this game a relaxing escape for a few minutes to a few hours. Very enjoyable, with achievements and cards. Easily worth the store price of $4.99, or 3x group buy of $3.33, go buy it, NOW !			"

												This game is pretty short, last me around 4 hours to get 100% in the game, collecting all the colors and puzzles. You draw your own character, a stickman or not, and draw your friend. Then, your friend is kidnapped by Zarp or Zarb (forgot the name), and your stickman must use creative ideas to pass all the puzzles and levels to rescue your friend. The puzzles are mostly easy, but sometimes require a bit of thinking. For a game that is 5 bucks, it is not bad to pick this up and try it out. P.S.

												This is an amazing game, It's really strategic and yet has a cartoon interface with sketchy drawings. it is really funny how you can draw your character and you can change it anytime you want and you can also collect colour buddies for new colours on your character. You can also draw your friend who you are saving which includes choosing their name. I REALLY recommend this game!!!			"

Grade: 85/100Difficulty: Moderate. Some parts are very easy, others require quickness or planning.Pros: Your character is unique because you draw it! You are sent to rescue a friend -- whom you also draw in the beginning -- and your success relies on how well you wield your drawing pencil. Lovers of Okami will catch on to the skills quickly. Limitations of those skills will disappoint a bit.Cons: Stiff movement and movement limitations (yeah, you're a stickman, but STILL...). Some places are more difficult than they need to be. The progressiveness of difficulty seems a little off. Music/sounds get irritating after a while.Replayable: The challenge games definitely -- but not the main storyline unless you're seeking puzzle pieces and other collectibles scattered throughout the levels.

PresentationDraw a Stickman: Epic has an interesting concept behind it, allowing you to draw your own hero and send him on an adventure to rescue your best friend kidnapped by Zarp, the game's villain. The story has no continuous plot as it only presents you with the situation at the beginning and gives you the finale once you've reached the end of the last level, making the entire adventure seem like a struggle without purpose as you will travel through all sorts of terrains without ever finding anything new. As long as the adventure may seem from a narrative perspective due to the lack of information or plot, it really isn't as you can reach the final level in less than an hour, without rushing the adventure at all. There are some additional levels which you can unlock by finding alternative exits in a level, which is great since those are some of the most unique and challenging ones, but even so they do follow the same pattern with the same pencils and tools at your disposal, which might get boring after a while. Even though there aren't that many levels total, the game encourages you to replay them as there are secrets, alternative exits and collectibles in each one of them, which proved to be way more entertaining than the main adventure itself.Rating: 6GameplayEpic looks like it will give you quite an adventure with endless possibilities that end only with your imagination, which is something that's far from the truth, and even though the concept is unique and fun at first, the possibilities end once you realize that you can only draw one thing using a specific pencil, as there is a blue one for clouds, a yellow one for keys, a red one for fire and a brown one for axes, and that's pretty much everything that you can draw. Using only those elements, Epic creates a unique adventure, but one that falls short as there is a limit to what you can do using those things alone, and even though you will be surprised every once in a while when something like a key can be used to power up robots and change their movement direction in order to solve more challenging puzzles, you can only imagine how much more it could've been done with a larger inventory of items to draw. However, more important than anything else, Epic works great as you don't have to be Leonardo da Vinci in order to draw, as the game recognizes any drawing as the correct item since it is mapped to specific pencil, but at the same time that allows you to draw a simple line for everything, something that you will probably do since it is less time consuming, but not as authentic as it looked in the first place.Rating: 6.5GraphicsDraw a Stickman: Epic has the right feel to it, as everything feels where it belongs next to something that you can draw on your own, and even though the colors used are monotone and the backgrounds look the same from one level to another, they feel like something anyone with spare time can draw on a piece of paper. A little more variety would've been welcome when it comes to the objects and backgrounds encountered in your adventure, but for what Epic is, it definitely has the right design to fit its gameplay.Rating: 7AudioThe background tunes are not the greatest you'll hear, and even though they do become repetitive after a while, they are catchy and in mood with the action and the theme of that certain level. The overall quality and design of the audio elements matches the drawn animation theme, and even though there was place for improvement when it comes to effects, they do stay in line with the theme as well.Rating: 6.5ExtrasIt takes around three hours to finish Epic with all its levels and secrets, add another three if you're willing to find every puzzle piece, color buddy and alternative exit in order to unlock all the achievements and rewards, but afterwards there isn't much to return to.Rating: 8VerdictDraw a Stickman: Epic is definitely a game worth trying, even without its limited gameplay concept and short adventure as it really is something different, but unfortunately that concept never reaches its full potential, making the game feel repetitive after a while.Rating Overall: 6.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Draw a Stickman: Epic at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=353 "

												Ooh. Tough one. This game's biggest issue is lack of content. The only reason I have any substantial playtime is because I'm a completion freak, but otherwise... there's not much there. 13 levels, all of them can be cleared pretty quickly and none of the puzzles are terriby mind-boggling. There are only 4 different pencil types too, pencils being the main puzzle-solvers in the game, and their uses are fairly limited, so it becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Worst of all is that you don't really need to draw anything at all. The main character can be squiggles. Fire is squiggles. A /key/ is squiggles. It doesn't matter in the slightest, though with how imprecise the drawing element is anyways maybe that's for the better. Oh by the way if you die in a level (and you die quick) have fun redoing the entire thing! With how tedious some of the levels are, dying for dumb reasons (the majority of all deaths) take it from boring to frustrating. And it's not even a hard game...The graphics look alright, the music is okay though there aren't too many tracks and it's not much above MIDI quality most of the time. The game isn't terribly interesting though and certainly doesn't warrant EPIC in the title.			"

The achievement requires you to chop down 500 of them and unless you go out of your way to chop them down as you play through the story you will end up with less then 100 trees when everything else is done.Time to 100%: ~7 hours			"

												I played this on Xbox live when it was free (windows 8), I had loved it so I bought it on steam but honestly I'm not a huge fan. Draw a Stickman: EPIC, its nice, creative, lots of Easter Eggs, some more additional gameplay, I'll give it that but there isnt that much levels, somewhat expensive for its price (buy it in summer sales etc.) and just doesnt fit with a 3D game. You draw a 2D character but you are in a 3D world IT JUST DOESNT WORK! I don't like the audio that much, due to me not playing the game for such a long time so i dont remember a lot of the game, I'm pretty sure the sound affects is just the same with just ""ooo ahh"" for when you get hit. If you like stickman games buy it, its completely your choice but my decision is not to buy it for its original price, I bought in the 2014 Christmas Sale. I'm not recommending the game because of al those reasons. IM NOT SAYING I HATE STICKMAN GAMES! I just dont think it fits with a 3D game mechanic.			"

The ""puzzles"" were more like ""Scribble red here"" or ""Draw a bubble there"".Such a great idea... such a pathetic excuse for a game. Does NOT belong on Steam.			"

												Thanks for not including keyboard shortcuts for most actions in the PC version, even canceling out of using tools, and especially thanks for not having checkpoints in the levels so if you do something stupid like stand three pixels two close to a piece of dynamite you have to start the entire level over. It makes the whole thing feel way more tedious than it should be for such a simple and lighthearted game. It seems like it would be more fun on a tablet or with a touchscreen or something, but I didn't find it super inspiring regardless.			"

												This game is just awkward. It seems I have run into a lot of games recently that just lack depth of any kind and end up being really boring because of it. You dont have to actually draw anything here (Other than lines). You dont have to draw something that looks like fire for it to work, a cloud can just be a line or even a dot, a axe can be a line, a key can be a line, Its easier to just make everything a damn line. Why not just call the game draw a line? The animations for your stickman are just jarring. I found it hard to move around because of this. I would have much preferd a selection of pre rendered stickmen if the animation would be improved.Was this a mobile game before coming to steam? It seems like it would work alright there. It fails here though.			"

												Draw a stickman, then guide him through a fantastic world of adventure! Using an assortment of pencils, draw elements, tools, and weapons to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. Draw a Stickman Epic could be compared to an adventure game, RPG, or puzzle game, but the unique drawing mechanic is unlike any game you've ever played before! From drawing a rain cloud for growing plants to drawing an axe for chopping down a gate, you control all aspects of your environment. Explore diverse environments and encounter unusual creatures as you draw your way through 14 levels (plus a hidden bonus level)! With the non-linear gameplay, how you overcome one environment will determine which level you unlock next. Each level is filled with hidden secrets and achievements, offering hours and hours of replay value. Grab a pencil and dive into the world of Epic!			"

												I have played this for a while and I have  some issues with the gameplay. The game looks nice and friendly however its a lot on the tough side. I have seen some walkthrus for this game and they differ a lot for the PC.  I can only think the developers made this tougher for the PC side for some reason. I wish it was more kid friendly as it is right now its mostly a tough road to go thru.  I suppose if you liked to be stumped by the challenging puzzles aspect you may like this. I wish it was more creative and less on the one way to do things. THe way its billed it looks like you could draw anything you wanted to however thats  not the case.You can only draw what the game allows you to draw. Example you  can only draw a key on a certain level. I really want to like this game but it does everything it can to make me mad at it.   Graphics are fine for what they are, You draw most of them, sound  is fine. However a little to hard for my liking. Also this game is billed as Casual when its really not, more like for the hardcore crowd.			"

I really thought this was going to be like this.  It isn't and I feel bad about wasteing my money.  Only 9 levels, too, that are far to simple.

												Dare I talk about this game? For fear of getting a terminal disease from the sheer mentioning of 2d art. However, I will brave the sea of fear to warn you of this game. If I may even call it that.I purchased this game with high hopes of it releasing some form of inner artistic skill. It, in turn has released the side of me that endulges in resentment of life.When I play this game, I fear for the future of mankind.... Have we come this far to fail this badly? No, I believe we are part of something larger. We are not defined by the laws of a bi-dimensional world. We have movement in all planes, not just 2.Together, my brothers, we can rise, we can FIGHT for the freedom of mankind, from these horrifically coded games, let us not be persuaded by the mass, but by what WE believe, no matter what steam may throw at you with its ""deals"", you do not have to buy them, and nor should you.TODAY IS THE DAY WE SAY NO.

												Alright, I got this game because the idea of creating my own game by drawing it out was really interesting to me. However after a short period of time I need to say that I'm very disappointed in this game.First and foremost the drawing aspect isn't really important. You can draw whatever and however you want, without any consideration for the game. Creativity is one thing, but when I can make my stickman nothing more than a giant blob or a key look like a handgun it ruins it for me. You can just draw whatever and as long as it's the right crayon the game accept it. Need fire? Draw a random red line. You get the idea.The story is weak and so overused. The evil dude captured one of the good dudes friends? Really? Whatever.Wanted to like it, but not even close.			"

I could see very young children or someone with artistic talent enjoying this game but the fact that it lacks tablet support throws the potentialy great qualities of this game out the window.Because this was in the Humble Bundle the question of value not an issue, but honestly 5 dollars seems a little too steep for this game. That sounds cheap of me but honestly I do not believe there is 5 dollars worth of content in this game.At 75% off sale you might get some entertainment from Draw a Stickman: EPIC with 20 minutes of screwing around, but on the whole it's a fails to perform.

Armed with fire, axe, key, and cloud abilities, one must navigate through each level to reach the end and the next level. AMost of the levels have hidden suprises such as puzzle peices, hidden comic pages, and different colors to customize the color of your stickman. An addicting and extremely fun and unique title.

												BOOOOOOOORIIIIIING!The general idea is quite nice but for someone with no drawing skills it is just embarrassing to play. The game seems so slow and music just wants me to fall asleep. Puzzles are not challenging. The just make the game even slower and more dull than before.For some people it might be a good game. Maybe I'm just terrible at puzzles or can't accept my creations... Anyway if you have similar issues, avoid this game. If not, maybe try it, but I am not recommending it.			"

												Alright alright alriiiight! Draw a Stickman: EPIC 2 is coming out at 9th July (spoilers). And i have this game 100%. All the achievements and stuff. I gotta say that the soundtrack is amazing. Really fun and catchy music. The game seems a bit dark tho... Not many colors. Kinda makes me feel sad. But the second game screenshots were colorful so that will be improved. Gameplay was short tho but fun. Really got me into the game.      In this game you draw a stickman or your own character and then later you will draw yourself a friend. Then your friend gets kidnapped and you must save him. Fun little game. Overall ratings:Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Soundtrack : 10/10Happiness in the game : 8.5/10Overall a good game and definetly suggest it. (sry for my bed english lel)			"

												Certainly drawing your own character and items is a novel idea. However, the game does nothing interesting with it all. It doesn't matter what you draw. It ends up being a simple action game with questionable hit detection. The actual gameplay here is lacking. You can easily be killed by clipping through dangerous areas or enemies. But it's never clear how close you can get. Although the artwork is 3D, it has you bouncing through 3D levels. And, yeah, you bounce. Actually having your custom stickman somehow come to life with real animations would be a pretty amazing feat that this game doesn't come close to handling.			"

												This game is very unique the story has A feel to where you know that your going on an adventure full of wonders , challenges , and most of all , exploration. You get to draw your story, and for an artist like me this just puts it one of my favorite games and you should too. Although the game has some flaws here and there like you cant make your own animations  ( if you decide to cause that would be cool! ) and the fighting sytem is just...weird?  There is absolutly no description on the fighting system exept sorta wierd? ( I guess ) but its to the point where it just works, it still confuses me though... but besides the few flaws and opinions here and there I'd still recomed this game to newbie and advanced gamers      the artwork , Oh man the artwork is fabulous for this game and this game only. What im saying is that the artwork makes me feel like im in the story myself ( sorta ) its all in a storbook style the damp to the bright colors just made the game worthwhile for me and I truly recomend this game! ( and hopefuly the creators look at this and see if they could fix anything in the future :D )			"

Draw a Stickman: Epic feels like an unrefined carbon-copy of Drawn to Life (which is an okay game anyway), and doesn't seem to try and distance itself from that game. It's not exciting at all and the presentation of the world is monotonous at best. The world itself is very flat (not a pun) and repeated, as there are no defining or memorable features to it.It simply doesn't feel like you're creating much of anything. Rather, you'll feel like you're moving your mouse around in random patterns in order to scribble something that vaguely resembles what your intent was.Draw a Stickman overall is really uninspired and not fun.

												For $4.99, you can do better than this.  It would be cute for a web browser game, but the gameplay here is not worthy of being on Steam in my eyes.  The drawing mechanics aren't even polished.  Granted, I find it hilariously fun to draw crayon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥heroes and make them waddle around in this game world.There aren't many pros to this game, but the ability to create crayon character drawings which waddle around is kind of a novelty.  By novelty, I mean it gets old fast.  It's hard to draw anything accurately in this game, because it doesn't let the crayon stroke go where you click.  The crayon stroke is randomized as you move the mouse cursor.  I don't appreciate this randomized stroke feature!Also, the cons include frustrating collision, which causes you to die from explosions when you're far away from them and also makes your character get stuck around corners sometimes, and a poorly implemented menu/GUI design that can be a little unintuitive at times.  Granted, the game isn't difficult, but there at times when you kill yourself because you are unable to draw far enough away from a piece of dynamite to stay clear of its explosion.  This could be remedied with some kind of zoom-in-and-out or pan camera functionality.			"

												A few days ago I picked up Draw a Stickman:EPIC on Steam sales. How did it turn out? Definitely it is a cute game. The locations look like they were drawn on recycled paper, which adds to the charm. The monsters and objects in the game are drawn very cute – the dragons almost seem huggable – but trust me, they’re not, same as the bees. Only the bunnies are innocent, but the for some devilish people it’s possible to hack them away with an ax or incinerate them. Many ways to kill a poor bunny!The drawing system in the game are somewhat hectic. I didn’t like it when I was drawing my stickman, the mouse cursor was pointing at one pixel and the dot was being created elsewhere… Quite hard to draw a decent-looking stickman this way, and I think even using my drawing tablet would not improve the precision as it was the pen tool itself having problems. Other complaint is that it could have been less square-ish when drawing the stickmen, some people actually wanted to make them nice, hey! In game I didn’t notice the wonkiness so much, but it also mattered far less. You don’t even have to draw a proper cloud with all the half-circles on the edge, it can be a plain oval and still will be a rain cloud. Fire could be a few strokes of pencil instead of a flame and still would work out as one. Other complaint would be the walking. When I would point the way with my mouse, mr Stickman would often end up getting stuck in something in the way, even if originally the path was clear. Towards the end of the game I found out (accidentally by laying an elbow on the keyboard) that he can be moved with WASD/the arrow keys. That one actually seems to works much nicer, as long as you can predict how mr Stickman would move – so I guess having the legs drawn properly is essential.The adventures themselves… in the intro you draw your friend and I would advise that you draw him or her properly, unless you want to spend the entire rest of your journey in the search of a gooeyling or something alike. The first few maps are very relaxing and fun. Then suddenly… This map can kill me? Ouch. Dragons like stickman lunch? Not flame retardant? Bees in my face? Ouch ouch ouch. Such a sudden transition from easy to hard is not too good, the devs should have made the difficulty climb rather than it becoming a huge jump. There is also that element of tedium when you end up being eaten right at the end of a map and have to do it all over again from the beginning. One would like to see some sort of checkpoints there instead of it being just on the beginning of the level. The puzzles themselves are mostly entertaining. Some solutions actually make you smile. Some others may make you want to pull your hair out. Controlling robots is tricky for example. Sometimes there is more than one way to solve a problem, which I found nice. The game has lots of hidden content as well – sometimes hidden too well, that you either find it by accident or some ingenious enlightenment.One thing that I discovered when I decided to listen to the game sound. Somehow I only liked the Stickopolis theme, rest sounded a bit annoying to me. Also the clicking sound of the pencils is not something that I consider nice, but that can be turned off, so not considering it as a major flaw.I would recommend picking this game up while it is on the sale, for the price it’s listed it’s worth. It’s a light game for killing the time, for people with some gaming experience it’s quite relaxing. For casuals it might come hard at some points, but if they don’t give up too easily, they could enjoy it as well.Pros: cute art, riddles, hidden content, fun storyCons: wonky drawing controls, movement issues, lack of balanced difficulty raising "

												A marvelous experience. Part puzzle and part platformer, this game allows you to create your own stickman and stick partner and adventure through 12 differnt levels of fun. Armed with fire, axe, key, and cloud abilities, one must navigate through each level to reach the end and the next level. AMost of the levels have hidden suprises such as puzzle peices, hidden comic pages, and different colors to customize the color of your stickman. An addicting and extremely fun and unique title. With even more levels coming soon, I strongly recommend getting this game now.			"

												I won't waste words since others have said it better than me. This game is tedious and boring and once the humor of chopping down a tree with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥wears off, you'll quickly realize that there's very little to keep you playing.			"

												This game had a fun theme and some good problem-solving elements, but did get a little boring after a while. It was probably the perfect length to keep the gamer's attention, though. For what it is, it was a good game; it's just a casual time killer game that you could beat very quickly. In addition. the achievements and hidden things add a little bit of replayability for people who wanted more of a challenge.			"

												3/10Going to downvote every terrible touchscreen game to be released on the pc. Obviously meant for an iphone or something. If you are going to do a port at least do it propertly - couldn't even figured out how to quit the game and had to suicide.			"

												Alright alright alriiiight! Draw a Stickman: EPIC 2 is coming out at 9th July (spoilers). And i have this game 100%. All the achievements and stuff. I gotta say that the soundtrack is amazing. Really fun and catchy music. The game seems a bit dark tho... Not many colors. Kinda makes me feel sad. But the second game screenshots were colorful so that will be improved. Gameplay was short tho but fun. Really got me into the game.      In this game you draw a stickman or your own character and then later you will draw yourself a friend. Then your friend gets kidnapped and you must save him. Fun little game. Overall ratings:Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Soundtrack : 10/10Happiness in the game : 8.5/10Overall a good game and definetly suggest it. (sry for my bed english lel)			"

												This game is very unique the story has A feel to where you know that your going on an adventure full of wonders , challenges , and most of all , exploration. You get to draw your story, and for an artist like me this just puts it one of my favorite games and you should too. Although the game has some flaws here and there like you cant make your own animations  ( if you decide to cause that would be cool! ) and the fighting sytem is just...weird?  There is absolutly no description on the fighting system exept sorta wierd? ( I guess ) but its to the point where it just works, it still confuses me though... but besides the few flaws and opinions here and there I'd still recomed this game to newbie and advanced gamers      the artwork , Oh man the artwork is fabulous for this game and this game only. What im saying is that the artwork makes me feel like im in the story myself ( sorta ) its all in a storbook style the damp to the bright colors just made the game worthwhile for me and I truly recomend this game! ( and hopefuly the creators look at this and see if they could fix anything in the future :D )			"

												 Very creative game.  Awesome game for kids or just the kiddish mind. There is more to this game than meets the eye. You truly  can't understand the game without playing it yourself. No image or trailer or lets play gives you the feeling of playing it. The creation of  a game that is  yours and only yours  is a great feeling. Gives me a feeling of growing up drawing my own video game characters in a notebook. 8/10			"

												The general idea is nice: draw you own game character and objects to solve different puzzles.However, the controls are clunky, the puzzles often way too simple and repetitive. This could have been something big but turned out to be boring.I thought it would be interesting for younger children, however, the game's controls make it less suitable and frustrating. Too bad :(			"

												Incredibly good game. I am surprised how fun it was. Quite short to finish all levels but getting secrets and achievements   takes more time and gives even more fun. Game is relatively easy, finding puzzle pieces can be a challenge though.Cute and creative idea for a game.10/10			"

												This game really should have been for mobile. It's fun creative nature is at odds with poor controls, particularly movement. The story is fine for what it is, and some of the puzzles are really good. I enjoyed it overall, and would have 100%'d it if they didn't have such asinine achievements. Chop down 500 trees? No thanks. 2.5/5 pick up for something different and short.			"

												Interesting concept for a game, decent music score and graphics, fun to play with your own drawn protagonist and rescuing your own drawn friend. A little bit spoiled though that you don't actually have to draw anything resembling that which you are supposed to draw, you can draw a balloon for an axe or a dot for a cloud. Even so, good game.

												I'm suing them for false advertising, the title should've been ""Draw a Stickman: MEDIOCRE""But seriously, Draw a Stickman: EPIC is a game where you are a stickman (duh) and you embark on an adventure where your only weapons are a few pencils with which you can draw tools, fire, clouds and other stuff. You have to solve puzzles, run from enemies, burn bridges and regret it 2 seconds later, and probably some other things.I mean, it's not BAD which is why I'm giving it the positive review but it really isn't EPIC. The gameplay was mostly drawing circles and pretending those are axes, and the puzzles were really simple. I've heard some people say that the graphics are horrible, but I kind of liked that. It reminded me of times when pencil and paper really were the only things that could keep me entertained. The game offered you to replay all those drawn adventures you had as a child, so if it wasn't for nostalgy, I wouldn't be recommending this.To fellow completionists, getting 100% is semi-pain. As you can see, it only took 13 hours to me but I had to buy DLC and spend over 2 hours chopping trees. Since I REALLY don't like the ""bake 10000000 pies"" achievements, I wouldn't recommend this for completionism purposes.If you are a rotten, empty shell of a human being like me, you might enjoy revisiting your childhood, but as a game, it doesn't have much to offer. I am somewhat looking forward to buying the sequel, but I don't think this game deserves much more than a mostly positive score.			"
