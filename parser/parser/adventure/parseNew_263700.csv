Teal DeerDevelopers: Angry Mob Games Publishers: Angry Mob Games Initial release: May 2014Genre: Action, Platformer, Score based #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationGreat palate cleanser, super addictive qualities throughout. Sure, its your standard 2D platformer affair. Not dissimilar to a Mario Bros. Single screen kill/collect top score based fun. But this game has a lot of heart. You collect muffins. That's endearing in itself. Every time you collect one, your character switches which may seem jarring at first until you become familiar with all the attacks. Then it becomes rather strategic.One of the more surprising aspects is every second spent in game feels like you're earning something. XP is earned for collecting muffins and killing enemies that goes into a player level which awards you with skill points which can be spent on each individual creature. New levels can be unlocked either through collecting a specific number of muffins in one run or overall player level. Perks and extra lives are also available for purchase. Respawns are super fast, controls are tight. The characters are adorable and silly (see Sumo Panda) All these features lend themselves to something familiar, easy to enter and super hard to put down. Just one more run. Then I'll stop.Follow my curation for more "

												Muffin Knight is a game that looks catered towards toddlers, but is a perfect example of the idiom 'don't judge a book by its cover'. Despite looking very innocent and easy, 'Muffin Knight' is a surprisingly challenging game - especially if you're attempting to 5-star it. With a fantastic single-player and multiplayer co-op, Muffin Knight is a fast-paced game full of enjoyment, challenge and charm. Whilst the plot is simple and the graphics are subpar, Muffin Knight excels in its gameplay and can become dangerously addicting. The music is catchy, the controls are fantastically responsive and the added perks and upgrades really add to the game and genuinely make a difference, saving a very repetitive formula from going stale.My only complaints would be its lack of more settings, there isn't a lot of availability on how to customise the settings to best suit your PC, plus the menus are pretty awful if you plan to use a controller. Whilst I would highly recommend a controller for its movement flow and simplicity, I would suggest opting for a computer mouse when roaming through the menus.The randomisation for the characters can be frustrating, especially as some of the starters are incredibly weak until you upgrade them. Whilst upgrading doesn't take too long, to go from a strong character such as Cyclops or Grizzly, to a ridiculously weak character such as Monkey or Dragon, can really be annoying. Whilst mentioning characters, it is worthy ot note that the order of the unlockables seems very odd as well - whilst only a minor nitpick, I did feel very disappointed that the final unlockable was one of the worst.Overall, Muffin Knight is an incredibly fun and simplistic game to play. The added perks really help the game to feel different every time, and the challenge bar is at the perfect level for this type of genre. Whilst the plot is weak and some of the power-ups are far worse than others, due to the upgrades and points, you can quickly improve the weaker characters and make them some of the strongest. Muffin Knight is great fun with friends, but is also very enjoyable as a solo game - so go forth and find those muffins!Rating: 4/4 "

												PARTIAL CONTROLLER SUPPORT. Don't be fooled by the store page, menu navigation with controller is poor, in some cases not working at all. I've played this game on an Android tablet previously.  It's a cute little arcade game where you gather muffins. Each time you gather a muffin your character changes to a different one. Each have different abilities which you can upgrade.  You unlock new levels by managing to reach a certain amount of muffins without failing on the previous level. You unlock new characters by total amount of muffins gathered.  Depending on how many muffins you gather and enemies you kill in a level you get experience points at the end of the level. These go towards upgrading your characters or your amount of extra lives etc.  Decent game, fun for a few hours.  The art style is really lovely! SFX could be better.			"

												Yeah, it looks like a Super Crate Box clone but in my opinion I think it perfects or tries to perfect the 'formula'.You can upgrade characters and there are a variety of levels including a boss level and a Christmas themed level. There is also plenty of content to keep you grinding for max completion, especially if you are going with the achievements.I also like the visual style of the game and the developers seem keen on updating and fixing parts of the game as it has already received 2 or 3 updates since its release on Steam.

												I first heard of Muffin Knight in a greenlight bundle. I ignored it. It looked too much like a children's game, with nothing to interest an older player.Boy was I wrong. Not only is it incredibly simple, but it's addictive as hell, it's tougher than leather too, because while the controls are exceptionally tight, they're also fast. You'll run into enemies a lot (instant death) and every time you'll know that it's your own fault you died. As a casual platformer it's great fun.Highly recommended.			"

												Bought this game under the impression that it supports two players locally. I have played the android and ios versions of this game extensively, so I know there must be local multiplayer. Although technically two players can't play in one mobile device (two players should have separate mobile devices connected to the same wifi network) in their mobile app. But since this is a PC version, I was hoping it had local multiplayer the moment I voted for Greenlight way back. Fast forward to the present and I've accidentally come upon the Steam Greenlight page and decided to check out what I voted for. With one of them being Muffin Knight i thought, ""I totally forgot about getting this!"" I bought it in a heartbeat and installed this puppy on my htpc connected to the living room tv, few minutes later I played it. Ahh, the memories of me and my friends playing coop on the school wifi, me and my brother or my nephew on a muffin grind during weekend nights. Good times. I played the first two levels then I remembered why I bothered to play this game right now- i need to check how to start a game in local two-player mode, or even see if it actually has one. I was looking forward for the former. Sadly, I was utterly disappointed. There was no local multiplayer (two-players in one pc) or even the local network (wifi) multiplayer the mobile app depends for two-player games. My heart is broken. I hope the developers add the functionality of local multiplayer because this is actually a fun casual game to play with another person. I am just disappointed that basically, it's a port of their mobile app. I hope they offered something more and different. However I fear my review is too late for warranting an update regarding local multiplayer as this game is a few years old for the devs to bother updating. I hope not.I hate to say this but I would not recommend this to my friends if it doesn't have local multiplayer. I'd rather stick to the mobile apps if this would be the case (the pc version being a port of the mobile version.) Oh, and navigating with a controller in this game is AWFUL.			"

I can spot 2 dollar games that are over 5 times more fun than this.Nearly everything this game has the free version outdo it, in art style, level design, and enemy design. Sure, some people might like this, but i'll scrap this off as an okay port of a free mobile game that doesn't deserve money.			"

Looks amazing and the music goes well with the action, really fun to play and addictive: as if gathering muffins weren't enough motivation, reaching milestones to add characters to our cast and unlocking new scenarios give you more reasons to keep jumping, firing, blasting, slashing and smashing.Controls work great, stylish graphics and good sound effects, plus a funny idea, and great execution make this game a very good option if you’re looking to just have fun. Well done Angry Mob Games!			"

												Super Crate Box clone with much more expensive-looking production values. If only they'd had enough money to hire a game designer to come up with original enemies and weapons instead of copying the Super Crate Box ones...The biggest distinction is that instead of getting a totally cool weapon when you unlock it, it starts out 1/3rd as cool and you have to buy upgrades to make it as good as the Super Crate Box version, but no better. Also, the explosions are less satisfying.			"

												In defense of this game, it works.  Which is really a big thing for a lot of low effort 2D platformers/shooters/whatever the indie studios churn out in shovelware by the tonne every year.The sound and graphics really function.The art style for a lot of the levels is thematically ripped from a strange combination of Mario and World of Warcraft.   Look, we're in Undercity! Look, we're in Zangarmarsh!  Gameplay is nothing new, the basic mechanic is present in literally over 1,000 Steam titles, you jump, you shoot, there's multiplayer jump and shoot.   Goombas totally inventive new enemies like sheep fall out of the sky and you have to kill them.It's hard to give this the thumbs down, because the developers achieved what they set out to do.   So, why the thumbs down?   Firstly - there's not enough technical customisability.  We can't even force the resolution.  The game handles okay today, but next year, the year after, it's going to fail to remain playable on newer systems.   This is a handicap enforced by the multiplatform system (because you know, console gamers and tablet gamers and PC gamers have so much in common). Secondly, well, what is this game contributing to anything?  I said earlier the developers achieved what they set out to do.   They succeeded in creating a game that fills no special niches, is derivative, and will certainly fail to be remembered alongside hundreds of other 2D indy platformers released every year hoping to be Super Meat Boy.  Was it a good idea to set out to do this? No, even if they succeeded.   This isn't worth the current price of $7 USD on Steam they're asking for.   Go play Super Mario Brothers on an emulator or something if you really have to do 2D platforming.			"

												First of all: I'm not going to show mercy on this game. So if that's something you wish to avoid, then here's your warning.TL;DR: It can be a fun experience, but that's most of it. That aside, it still remains a clone and lacks any love put into it from the developers. If you can get it for really cheap, check it out. Otherwise, stick with Super Crate Box, which is free.-----full review-----How to describe Muffin Knight... Well, I think saying it's Super Crate Box mixed with the graphics of Ducktales Remastered might just be the most accurate thing. But for the people who have never played Super Crate Box, allow me to ellaborate. The gameplay consists of you being put into some kind of arena, in which you have to gather enough Muffins to unlock the next stage, while being cautious of enemies who are trying to ruin your progress. Muffins also unlock new weapons when you obtained a select amount of them. And that is really all there is to it. I would say it's an innovative combat system, if they didn't straight out rip it off Super Crate Box. Some of the weapons do the EXACT same effect, but just having a dual pistol being replaced with an archer. This game is more on the child-friendly tour, so it replaced all weapons and enemies with weapons or mythological creatures.The story is very... vague. Protagonist finds a basket of Muffins and boom, he gets turned into a guy who can switch between weapons. Don't know what his goal is, but apparently he just needs to get his muffins back from some... dragonguy. NOTHING is explained in the game, except for the first part.At first it creates the illusion of difficult. You can't touch an enemy, or you're dead. Fortunately there are upgrades for that. You really have to make decisions about what to upgrade though. At first it might look easy to level up, but it becomes more of a grindfest at later levels. That is, if we exclude the extra modes this game has.Oh wait, did I say extra modes? Hahaha, aaah, how funny. Where do I begin...You start of the game in Knight Mode. Once you have beaten all the stages and defeated the final boss, you unlock a mode. And after you have finished that one, you unlock another. And another. And another. Would this be a problem? Not really, if it wasn't the EXACT same, just with increased difficulty. Why, in the name of Last Order, do this? Let us choose our dificulty, don't force it on us.And those reasons above form my biggest complaint with the game: It lacks love from the developpers. Like I said, I won't show mercy and I definitely won't here. They literally ripped off Super Crate Box, gave it a more child-friendly and HD design, and to avoid having a short game, let us repeat the game over and over again a total of 5 times. It's not even funny.If you can get this game for really cheap, go ahead. I definitely won't stop you. When I started this game, I did have a fun time. But over time, it just decreased. If you want to try out a game like this, get Super Crate Box.Note that I'm not trying to advertise Super Crate Box, but it's not only the same original game, but it's free too.			"

												This is a really pleasant multiplayer game where you need to collect muffins. Every muffin you collect changes your character and there are total of 18 characters in game, each with different attack mode.You can also buy perks and upgrade HP and each character (two times each).Pros:- beautiful graphics - for such kind of multiplayer game the candy graphics are really great- characters are different and most are useful- levelling system is okCons:- multiplayer is not working (or maybe it's just in my case)- gaining levels take forever- Santa Claus level is just totally random, I got stuck there and deleted the gameOverall this would be a really good multiplayer game provided the multiplayer would be working. As is for now you can play for about 2 hours in singleplayer and still have fun but you must decide if it's worth 7 euros.I had fun playing this game but I don't think that I'll get back to it therefore I give it thumbs down.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												I know I know.  ""WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  SUPER CRATE BOX CAME FIRST!  I LOVE SCB AND MUFFIN KNIGHT RIPS IT OFF!!!!""   Now, I do agree that MK may need to show documentation about copyright, but this review is about the result of MK rather than everyone's little ""Controversy"".Quite a number of maps, upgradable powers, cosmetic changes that have their own powers, and Multi-Player.   The art for it is well-done and is very easy on the eyes.  However, the music does get a tad annoying...A $6 game that has achievements to track your progress.  You get about 3-4 times the amount of maps than you would get in Super Crate Box as well.SO, For the Muffin Knight vs. Super Crate Box ""war"", I guess you could say that I've been spoiled by playing Muffin Knight first, but I will say I like Muffin Knight better.  Muffin Knight is more ""Premium"" as you get more maps, upgradable powers, and Multi-player.If you want a better game, Muffin Knight.  If you want a game for $0.00, Super Crate Box.			"

												Creating something unique is becoming a more and more difficult task in the world of smartphone gaming. There are so many games out there, and so many other people making new ones, that your brilliant idea has probably already been built and released.Equally, the huge swathe of clones and copycats that bloat the App Store make it even more refreshing when something does come along that's that little bit different. Muffin Knight, from Angry Mob Games, is one such breath of fresh air.As original as it is in the context of the App Store, however, it's important to note that Muffin Knight borrows heavily from Vlambeer's excellent Super Crate Box, which is also coming to iOS this month.Knights currantYou play a young boy who accidentally scatters a basket of magic muffins to the four corners of a cartoon-style fairytale world. Incensed by your actions, the fairy whose muffins they were turns you into a knight and sends you off on a quest to retrieve the arcane cakes.This takes the form of jumping around enclosed levels, killing scuttling pigs and other beasts and grabbing the deliciously enhanced buns. The twist is that every time you pick up a muffin you change class. You'll start as the eponymous Knight, but for the first few play throughs you'll swap between a mage, an archer, and a goblin as well.The characters all have different strengths and weaknesses, and as you play through the game you'll unlock new classes as well.While the original four are all quite similar ranged fighters, later in the game you'll have rainbow mine-pooping unicorns, fire-breathing dragons, and claw swiping bears at your disposal too.Confectionery crisisYou unlock new classes when you've picked up enough muffins, but you also gain XP for slaying enemies and gathering the small cakes. You can spend this XP on levelling up your characters, making them quicker and their attacks more potent.Of course, you're never sure which characters you're going to be in the game, so it's entirely possible to swap straight from a super-powered Knight to a one-starred kitten ninja in one muffin-fuelled swoop.All in all there are six levels to play through, all of which can be attacked multiple times, and 15 characters to unlock and upgrade. There's a multiplayer mode as well, which lets you connect with other iPhones over a local wi-fi network, to duke it out over who's the muffin-collecting monarch.Buns of zealMuffin Knight looks good, sounds good, and has a great, original idea at its core, but it's not all sweetness and light. The control system isn't perfect, with taps of the on-screen buttons sometimes not registering.It's pretty difficult as well, though even failure is rewarded with XP, meaning you'll be stronger the next time around. The lack of levels might put some off, but every play through is going to be different because your character changes are allocated entirely at random.These problems are mere niggles, though, and shouldn't dissuade you from playing this hugely enjoyable action-platformer. This is a leaping, blasting, clawing slice of fun that deserves to find a home on as many iOS devices as possible.			"

												TL;DR: Cheap mobile port. Expect nothing.- No resolution option.- No resizable window in windowed mode.- No local co-op.- Clone of Super Crate Box.- Can't see the entire level at once, making it a bit harder to see the enemies.- Sometimes the enemies drop from the spot without the cloud (unfairly killing you).- Grinding for unlocking characters and for getting points to upgrade characters.- No Steam cloud, no easy way to backup the save.- Navigating the menus with the joystick can be frustrating.~ Partial joystick support.+ Mouse works in the menus.+ Rebindable keys.+ Anti-aliased graphics if the ""high"" quality is selected.-- Full review below --This is mobile port. This game is also available on Android, iOS, and even Windows Phone.There is a Chrome App version (available for free, playable inside Chrome). If you are curious about this game, play that version before spending any money on this.When compared to the Chrome app version, this Steam version has online multiplayer support (good luck finding anyone else with this game). And anti-aliased graphics. That's all. Otherwise, it is the same game.Talking about ""same game"", this is a clone of Super Crate Box. The exact same mechanics from that game are in this game. What else do we have? Grinding for unlocking new characters! Grinding for leveling up and getting points to upgrade characters! And what do you get after you beat the first ""boss""? More grinding!For a game consisting mainly of grinding, being difficult to backup the progress is a sin. People claim that the save is stored in the Windows registry, but at least one person complained it couldn't restore the save.The options menu is a joke. At least it has rebindable keys, but there is no option to change the resolution. Alt+Enter changes to windowed mode, but the dimensions are fixed.In a mobile game, it makes sense to keep zoomed in and scrolling the level, because the screen is small. In the PC version, the behavior is exactly the same, unfortunately. I'd prefer to have a zoomed out view, i.e. I'd prefer to see more of the level at once.The xmas level has two spots where the enemies can spawn. Before enemies spawn, a cloud shows up. However, in that level, many times the cloud shows at one spot but the enemies spawn at the other spot (at that moment, the cloud teleports to the other spot). Unpredictable, nullifies any strategies from the player, and ends up unfairly killing the player.Finally, I couldn't find a way to exit from the character upgrade screen, while using the joystick. I had to use the mouse or the keyboard (Esc key) to get out of it. And the digital D-Pad can't be used in the menus.			"

												Recommended! This game is so goood. Plays well with both keyboard and gamepad. Great sense of humor. Nice visuals and sounds. Smooth gameplay. Plus...you have a chance to be Muffin Knight!PORS:- you're Muffin Knight: you collect muffins and slay mean monsters- 10 maps to play on, each of them is different ;)- good graphics- good sounds- good music tune- great voice acting :)- works well with both keybard and gamepad (gameplad found and working well, which is unfortunatelly not so obvious for many Steam ""full gamepad support"" games)- quite many characters to play- you level up quite fast- light RPG features: you get XPs and make your character(s) stronger- has both singleplayer and multi (online)- good for short sessions- fun factor :D- reminds me ""POOF vs the Cursed Kitty"" a lot, which is great, great, great game!CONS:- none, IMO- maybe that not all maps are equally good, but on the other hand there is plenty to choose from...- ""POOF"" is better ;)			"

												While the gameplay for Muffin Knight is actually kind of fun for a little while, it quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The different levels that you unlock as you go along are pretty much all the same and don't really do much different with the gameplay. The only thing that changes between the levels is the enemies and the layout. The Layouts rarely make the game more interesting to play or change things up, and while the enemies change, the basic enemy types do not. There are the flying enemies, and the small and large enemies, both speedy and regular. I'd have liked to see them add different enemies types as the game progressed. Another big problem that I had was the character types that you can play as. As far as I can tell, when you collect a muffin, you randomly change to a different character type, and the problem with that is that the game becomes less fun as it goes on as a result of this. The vast majority of the character types that you play as are terrible, so as the game goes on and you unlock more of the character types, you spend less time playing as the few good character types, and more on the terrible character types. The only character types that I enjoyed playing as are the Knight, the Archer, the Gnome, and the Mage, and the rest were mediocre to outright horrible.It's can be a fun game to play for about 20-30 minutes, but it definetly is not something that I would pay money for again.

												Controller support is terrible which ruined this game for me. Menu navigation isn't supported and most infuriating of all if you are walking forward while spamming attack, and then stop walking your character keeps walking. Only happens with the controller. Keep walking into creeps because of it. I want to like this game because I really enjoyed Super Crate Box and this adds a little more to the formula. Without the controller issues Ironed out I'm sticking to the former, which isn't so bad because I find the art style much more charming. If you are looking at this in a bundle (How I got my copy) it's okay. If you are looking at purchasing this on its own I wouldn't. Just get Super Crate Box.			"

												Get the game on a mobile device. Not on PC. This is one of the laziest ports I think I've ever seen, seeming to have had no changes to make it more fit for a PC. There are no options for whether you could run the game in a window, you're stuck in fullscreen. Even if you used the Alt+Enter trick to put in in windowed mode, you better have a huge monitor because the game runs in like 123481596x123458712349 pixels. I have dual monitors, and it took both monitors to display the whole game in windowed mode. Don't get this on Steam. Get it on your phone. Actually, don't get it at all, get Super Crate Box. That game is free.I do realize that I put absolutely no time into actually playing the game, but the limited options regarding window size killed the whole experience for me, because windowed mode is my preference.

This game is good on an ""i"" device like iPad or iPhone.It may also play well with a touchscreen laptop.Anything else though and it is just garbage.Look, if you are thinking of buying this game, just look up Super Crate Box and you can play a better game and that one is free so you actually honestly have no reason to ever buy this game unless you feel a strong desire to unlock the achievements for it.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

Bad graphics, annoying voice acting, pop-ups in the middle of the action and when you do finally get to play, enemies are too random and controls are too bad to apply any strategy or skill. One redeeming feature is that the online multiplayer and co-op have worked well over cross-platform which is more than can be said for games with a bigger budget.			"

												Muffin Knight is a super simple platforming game where you run around a level trying to collect muffins and fight monsters. It's a fun concept, and it works great on mobile devices, but this port just doesn't work on a computer. It's just way too simple for a computer, and gravity feels way stronger than in most platformers, which doesn't matter much on a tiny screen but on a computer screen it just feels wrong, especially if you play other platformers with better physics. The layout of the game is exactly like the mobile version, with a level select screen that feels a lot like Angry Birds, or really any other smartphone game. Also, your character changes every time you collect a muffin, which makes it a very fast paced game and it's very hard to have any kind of technique because you never know which character you'll be playing with next. Overall, it's a decent port of a mobile game that just doesn't work on a computer.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

My girlfriend and I had a lot of fun with Muffin Knight. That said, it's a sloppy cash-grab game. It seems hard-locked at something like 20 fps (making it very difficult to exhibit fine control of your character) and the menus are terribly organized. This is a sloppy port of a cell-phone game, and no effort was made to make it work well on PCs. It really can be fun, but it's hard to say it's worth more than a dollar.			"

												I love this game on android. However on PC I'm shocked with the number of bugs. The panda's invincibility during an attack can fail, the head jumping perk can fail, the knight will use his charge attack randomly if you're just attacking quickly, the damage applied to enemies can be random as hell (for example a close range lvl 3 shotgun blast at point blank range will sometimes not kill a small enemy). Without the bugs, this game has a few annoyances that can be overlooked. Some of the unlocks are just plain terrible, but you at least grab another muffin as quickly as possible and avoid that character. But with the extremely frequent glitches, this game is painful on PC. I bought this as I thought it would be way better to play with a controller....but now it's just a painful grind fest to get a decent number of achievements. Speaking of which....I had 97/100 kills with the monkey for that achievement, and I got about 40 kills with the monkey and it's still not unlocked. Ugh.			"

												10:11 PM 3/3/2015Muffin Knight ReviewI like this game, a lot. But that's only because I love Super Crate Box. And this is literally Super Crate Box, just a rip off version of the game. Oh and this is the $6.99 version, SCB is free! And better!Honestly, it's easier to name the differences than the similarities.Okay where to begin. Differences:In SCB, you start with a random weapon each round. In Muffin Knight, I always start with the knight.In SCB, there are no popups mid game telling you you leveled up. In Muffin Knight, you have to put down your controller and click to continue.In SCB, the controller works perfectly except for a small glitch when going to the menu from your controller. In Muffin Knight, for some reason even though I rebinded my controller, the up on the d pad goes down in game. And there is no button to click to continue when there is a popup on the screen, which is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a lot. You have to literally set your controller down and click. What if you are sitting on a couch? In SCB, when you shoot the grenade launcher into the fire, it falls from the top of the screen. In Muffin Knight, the fire is a stopping point. At least when I tried it. In SCB, there is recoil. No recoil in Muffin Knight. You just shoot.And the most obvious, the artwork is different. I like it though! That is a strong part about the game.Similarities:You literally get a random weapon when you pick up a muffin. The Archer is clearly the dual pistols from SCB. Since when does an Archer ever have 2 bows? I've never seen a dual bow archer ever. Then this game introduces it like it's new, clearly a copy of the dual pistol from SCB. Honestly, most of the weapons are the same from SCB.There are 3 kinds of monsters, small, big, and ghosts. They even come out in the same pattern as Super Crate Box! 3 small ones will come out all at once! Or a single monster of any type. This is the exact same pattern from SCB!Kills aren'r score, Muffins/Crates are.The Forest map is literally Construction from Super Crate Box. Literally the exact same thing. Not one difference. They literally just reskinned it.Gameplay is exactly the same. Everything about it. Random weapons from each pickup, monsters spawn at the top and follow a path to the bottom hitting walls and turning, when they hit fire they spawn faster.This is literally a weaker version of Super Crate Box. I like the art work of this game, it's beautiful. But sometimes it's hard to tell where the edge of a platform is. I found an area where it looks like I'm jumping through the floor. It's in the Forest level, there is the second platform from the top, on the left side. I tried it on the right side but it wasn't as bad. But on the left side of Forest, it looks like you're jumping/falling through the floor. I literally don't know where the edge is, and I don't know why it's worse on the left side, it might be the artwork or something, but the right side feels more solid. That might be a visual thing, they might be the same exactly. I didn't try as much on the right side.Things I like: Killing monsters actually helps you because they give XP. In SCB, killing monsters does nothing other than stop them from going into the fire and going faster.Problems:The controller problems really need to be fixed. The controller only navigates in the settings, not the start menu. And the vertical navigation is inverted even though I rebinded. Pushing up does down, and pushing down goes up. But in game, the controls are perfect. You can hear the spot where the music loops and wow that is annoying. The music is awesome, but hearing the spot where it loops is annoying for some reason. The Forest level specifically. Or it might have been the first level. But one of the first 2 levels, you can hear where the music loops.No recoil. Is there a mode where there is recoil? In SCB, the machine gun has some recoil. In Muffin Knight, the mage (fully automatic shots) has no recoil.Anyways, I like the game, but it is just a bad version of Super Crate Box. And it costs $6.99 while Super Crate Box is free. If some of the problems I listed are fixed, then I will change my review because I love Super Crate Box and I want to love this game.			"

												Muffin knight a game that emulates real life where the goal is to get the muff before the other person in order to score. Honestly it is a game worth buying if you have a friend and some time to kill. Jumping around trying to get the other person killed by the monsters before they do the same to you is fun, especially when the muffins change you everytime you grab one. There is a basic level up progression and character unlock and you will unlock everything with just playing the game.Fun in increments of 30 minutes or so on random occasions with a buddy.			"

												Muffin Knight is a cute and simple throwback to older arcade-style games, where the goal is to dodge enemies and rack up points by collecting muffins.  Each time a muffin is collected, your character will lose his current attack ability and randomly select another from a decently long list of possibilities.  Scoring high earns points which can be used to upgrade the effectiveness of each job class.I found Muffin Knight pretty fun for a little while, but ultimately I cannot recommend the game.  At first, new classes and upgrades and levels come very quickly, but after a short while, it becomes a slog - each upgrade might cost three points, and you have to play the same level a dozen times just to earn one.  It seems as though the game was designed to be more addictive than fun or balanced - something that is not helped by the game's appearance, which looks and feels very much like it was a hastily done mobile port.The nail in the coffin for my enjoyment of the game, though, are the cheap deaths incurred from a broken enemy indication system.  Enemies drop onto the board from the sky.  Usually, there's a few frames of smoke as in indicator that enemies will soon be appearing.  However, that indicator seems really buggy - sometimes it appears in the wrong place, and sometimes it doesn't appear at all.  You'll grow used to enemies popping out of thin air directly on to you quite a bit.You might enjoy this title a bit, but unfortunately its an experience that wears thin after a while.			"

												So generic. It is pretty much a game for toddlers. The gamepad controls suck♥♥♥♥♥ They are very loose so you fly all over the place without restraint. The game sucks too. You have an attack which doesn't mean much since the enemies are neverending and all you really do is run around and collect muffins. Just kill an enemy if he is near your muffin and repeat until the God awful loose controls cause you to hit a enemy and die or the toddler music causes your ♥♥♥♥ing ears to explode. And what is the point of having a bunch of different character classes when the point is to collect muffins in a level which is about every 1-2 seconds and each time you touch a muffin you change classes randomly? So basically you get to play a class for about 1-2 seconds at a time. The sound is for a 6yr old kid and the music is gnomes whistling and sounds like something you would hear on a early morning cartoon for a toddler.And the controls suck did I mention that? ♥♥♥♥ing muffins, lol.

												This is the stupidest ""game"" I have ever played. You run back and forth and get muffins for some stupid reason and some old lady yells at you repeatedly while you grab the muffins. For some reason you shapeshift when you grab a muffin and you get yelled at for letting pigs die and get yelled at for fighting the pigs too. So you're supposed to dodge them? But the controls are as fluid as a jar of Crisco. The graphics are nice though... oh wait, no unless you play in a window they are massively stretched out and ultra eye-burning bright. 3/10			"

												I actually liked this game a lot. Young people will think of Super Crate Box, older ones will see the inspiration of the original Mario Bros game. This is a pretty cool game with a lot of nice options. The developers throw in some pretty unbalanced options on both side of the spectrum, whether it be the useless yeti, or the overpowered Mr. Rainbow. My only gripe right now with this game is the lack of steam achievement goals being counted. I'll kill hundreds of monsters in a match, but only have 10 kills total spread out through my achievements. Not sure what the deal with that is.			"

												What do you get when you mix Super Crate Box, Castle Crashers, and a little 6 year old girl's dreamland? You get Muffin Night! Muffin Night is by far, one of the most fun and adictive games Ive ever played! Its hilarious, silly, cute, and at the same time a really nice real-time-strategy game. Wether its the fantasticly comical graphics, the storybook plot, or the hilarious characters to play as, I always have a great time playing! But there are some downsides. This game has the exact premise of Super Crate Box, which is free (And I recommend it) and the price is a little iffy for what you get. But, since there's more to come, you can always count on Muffin Night to make your day!			"

												A cartoonier version of Super Crate Box (SCB) sort-of.More characters than SCB...sort-of.Rather than playing 1 character who picks up random weapons from cratesyou get random characters when you get muffins. Since they all feel the sameit's more of a costume change per weapon. And they are all prettymuch humorous knockoffs of the ones in SCB.They did not just close SCB. They creatively reimagined it.Out of curiousity I unlocked all the characters to see which SCB weapon they mimic.After that I had no interest in continuing to play it. But...If you are a SCB fan and desire something similar I do recommend this title, but get it on sale.On sale because I still think SCB is much more fun...and it's free.			"

												This is a poorly executed clone of Super Crate Box. The graphics are polished, but the platforming is clunky garbarge.The enemies seem too easy, but when you die it feels cheap and undeserved.  Soo meh.			"

												It's basically Super Crate Box with more levels, ""weapons/characters"" and more stuff to do. Very fun! "

												Game should not show controller support. Loaded with bugs. Can't leave this god forsaken game, no ""back"" button that is mapped to the controller.			"

												So it's similar to Super Crate Box? That doesn't mean that it's a rip-off. I haven't played much of SCB so I won't comment more on the issue, just about Muffin Knight itself. Suffice to say; if you loved SCB you'll probably (at least) like MK.It's colorful and fun, with a joyus soundtrack. It's the kind of game that'll put you in a good mood ... until you get frustrated from dying all the time, but hey, that's a part of the game. The goal is to collect muffins, but every time you collect a muffin you change character randomly. All characters do different things; you have the knight who shoots arrow in one direction, you have the archer who shoots arrows in both directions, you have the pumpkinhead (miserable little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) who bowls enemies with his head.The game is fun. It's one of those ""just one more round""-games that gets you hooked for hours upon hours. The co-op is the best part IMHO, but then again I haven't tried the Versus-mode yet. Playing it single player is super fun too.The menues... are horrible. Utterly horrible. But don't let that keep you away. Also; for some reason I find the keyboard controls (cursors + Z) to be more responsive than playing with a Xbox controller (left analog + A & X). That might be a personal preference, but then again I usually enjoy a controller more when it comes to games with platforming-elements.			"

												Every now and then you unlock a new character and when you pick up a muffin you randomly and instantly turn into it, changing your playstyle. Very faced paced.Looks a lot like super crate box, don't know which was first but this definitely has some new features, like exp. You can improve your characters' range and damge with that.Has multiplayer versus and coop. No couch coop, just online.			"

												Overall not a bad game if you don't mind paying money for a game that is the same quality as a free game.  Game is not worth more than $1-2... if you pay more than that you're a f*cking retart			"

												It's Super Muffin Box then?If you like jumpy/shooty platformers, it's frenetic and a bit bonkers - but it has that ""ohoh - migraine coming"" thing going on for me.Of course I can't ""NOT recommend"" it for that - but I can for a sloppy 360 controller setup which lacks precision (dodgy deadzone) and leaves you skating-off into enemies and unable to reliably jump 'up'Keyboard warriors need not worry but it's 2015, 360 controllers should be tested properly...

												Almost exactly the same as mobile...which is bad..since this is on PC. No window size adjustment, no resolution slider, no volume slider aside from desktop volume mixer. Gameplay is the same. When in full screen, there is framerate issues that make your character lag. This problem is removed in windowed mode that can only be activated via ALT + ENTER. This is NOT okay.			"

												Muffin Knight is a puzzle platformer based on the now infamous unity engine. There has been many assetflips based around this poor engine, however from time to time you get something that might be worth playing. This was my main objective as I embarked on a quest to see weather this would be a gem or another black mark upon the engines already unfavorable reputation.The short description of this game would be its like Suer Crate Box however instead of being free it cost you 7 of your hard earned euros. The fundamental game play is very basic and easy to get into. You are put in a very vertical 2d map and your objective is to collect as many muffins as you can while stopping the creatures from exiting the map at the bottom just like in Super Creat Box a free game. Unlike Super Crate Box Muffin Knight offers you a variety of differently themed levels that you progress trough be earing stars in each level.While you progress you earn points that you can spend in a skill tree kind of deal where you can also upgrade your health. By default you can only collide with one enemy unless you invest in health upgrades. The skills tree is not at all very interesting and could very easily been left out of the game completely as it doesn’t make the games any more enjoyable.Just like in Super Create Box a free game you unlock new and interesting characters as you progress all with different and sometimes interesting weapons. Such as deadly rainbow pop a black mark on Muffin Knight if you ask me. The dead memes are plentiful. All characters can be upgraded in the skill tree. Sadly the upgrades are not that interesting as it is the standard shoot faster deal more damage upgrades we see in most games.Now you might have noticed that I have been comparing this game to another game called Super Creat Box. To me it is obvious that this game was only made to grab a bit of money off of the success of the last mentioned game. The game is competent in what it tries to do however there is not enough innovation in Muffin Knight for me to recommend this game to you more than I would recommend you to take a look at Super Crate Box as it is a better game with less fluff and no dead memes. Oh yeah btw Super Creat Box Is also free.In conclusion. Go get Super Crate Box.If you want a score for Muffin Knight here it is. 0.5/Super Crate Box "
