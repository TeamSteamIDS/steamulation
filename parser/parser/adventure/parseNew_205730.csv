												I got this game as part of a bundle and installed it on a whim.There's something about the graphics, music, little videos, I dunno what, but I was so enthralled and immersed in this game that I completely forgot to go on a date with a girl.An actual girl.I could, tentatively, recommend this game over the prospect of meeting a member of the opposite sex.Tentatively.

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a 2D side-scrolling action/adventure Metroidvania game with puzzle elements. Basically you fly around in a small flying saucer and solve small puzzles while fighting off enemies and gigantic bosses. As you travel through the shadow planet you will get new abilities that allow you to backtrack to previous areas to open new areas like any Metroidvania type game, though most of the collectibles you find by backtracking are concept art pieces and short movie clips.The art style and music create a very nice atmosphere, and the controls are fairly smooth. Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.All-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles. I recommend picking it up sometime.			"

												The game is just incredible. It has a poor story, but it doesnt matter, since the game focuses on visuals, which are incredible. You can hardly find any creature plant or anything twice. The Artist who made it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius God bless this man :D. Also the gameplay is challenging but not frustrating. Some puzzles are easier or harder what makes sure that you wont get stuck somewhere. Its a where calm game perfekt for chilling out, but it also contains some shooting stuff, so it fits every mood. Only thing that lacks is that nobody wants to play this online, and the COOP mode is awsome, too bad i have to play it alone :c			"

												Excellent little Medtroidy style game about an alien and his saucer trying to save his world.The game looks and plays amazingly. From the great environments to the many tools you gain in your quest.The Multiplayer (although dead, it's super easy to start a game with friends) modes can also be played solo, and has a surprising amount of RNG and challenge that I feel is overlooked in this game.The overall campaign is around 8-10 hours, but it's very enjoyable, and never feels tedius.It used to be GFWL, but the Dev switched it all over to Steamworks so it doesn't die with the GFWL platform. (Thanks Devs!)Definite, absolute buy!			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is notorious for two reasons. First and most obvious is absolutely glorious visual style by Michel Gagné; it’s dark, macabre, slightly frightening, but at the same time truly beautiful and not repulsing even by a tiny fraction despite all of the picturing of those tentacles and insect-like creatures. Second prominent feature is the protagonist. You see, despite all the variety of settings and worlds and stories a hero in metroidvania usually is a human, or at least some humanoid. But here you play as small flying saucer; so technically there’s still some humanoid inside. Obviously it impacts gameplay turning it into twin-stick shooter and omitting platforming with all it’s precision jumping and running. What it has instead is all different kinds of guns and devices that our UFO can use. Among them there are not only assorted lasers and blasters, but also a buzz-saw, a grappling claw, protective shield and so much more. So you fly around, shoot stuff and sometimes solve some puzzles. They’re neither challenging nor time consuming, but their presence is enough to transform what could be a blazing gun carnage into an exploration of beautiful yet twisted and insane world.Speaking of which, there may be not a lot of variety on the first sight, but there surely is distinct difference on what kind of thrill you can expect from different game zones. There’s soothing calm of ice zone disturbed only by pesky and ubiquitous enemies; there’s tension of mandatory underwater level; and then there’s those enigmatic factory and all those different yet very familiar regions of the Shadow Planet. It’s not just bland similarity, but rather a true sense of interconnectivity that is the result of this distinct visual style of minimalistic mix of black shadows and pure-color backgrounds. This world doesn’t look or feel artificial, it’s as natural as a background for digital entertainment can get. It’s complete and interconnected; it feels solid, ready to be explored by a curious traveler, who’s on a mission to restore it, rather than just tear it apart.And because of its small size and simple story the game forms an intimate bond with the player.  It’s not a feeling of attachment but rather a sense of lasting mutual sympathy. If anything,  Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet in a short few hours that you need to finish it accomplishes the task of teaching you a handful of interesting tricks while giving just enough time and space to toy with them to your amusement. Facing new challenge most of the time you either will know the solution right out or will figure it out faster than frustration kicks in. And that is not something easy to do, when an average gamer has an attention span shorter than one of a goldfish. Not that the game is a cakewalk from start to finish; there are bosses, you see. And they have all their bossy stuff: attack patterns, heavy attacks and weak points, that you’ll have to figure out to exploit them. So you’ll maybe even fail a few times while dealing with them.Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet makes you feel invested without caring to present itself believable or even needing that for that matter. It’s a fiction that works on sheer kinetics and aesthetics; it doesn’t tell a story, it makes you perform it. The game simply unfolds with elegance and simplicity of a pop-up book and gives you the keys to the entrance.			"

												We've been waiting for this game since it came out exclusively XBLA to arrive on PC and now we've been waiting even longter for it to finally remove GFWL. Now we got that, too!ITSP is a Metroidvania-type game where you control a flying saucer through an... well, an insanely twisted shadow planet! You gain new abilities and have to backtrack to other locations where your new ability will come in handy. The visual aesthetics are comical yet not ridiculous, the sound design is quite intense. The game's cutscenes feature music by Dimmu Borgir, whereas the background music is more atmospheric yet not less fitting.All in all a very engaging experience, some may consider it short, yet intense none the less. Recommended![CONCERNING FRAMERATE ISSUES]Edit: I feel like I have to edit this review. The game is great in design and visual style! Yet, unfortunately, for some users there seems to be a problem, that the game just won't go above 30fps. Which is pretty cross, as the game is intended to run in 60fps and gets slower with the framerate. Thus, people who have the same problem as me will play through the game in HALF OF THE INTENDED GAMESPEED. For nVidia users, turning on maximum performance in power management mode works, for amd users, like me, however... nope? I'll remove this text, as soon as a fix has been found.Edit 2: After having this issue for two years and almost forgetting about it, out of curiosity I checked how well ITSP would perform on the very same machine after I did the upgrade to Windows 10. I didn't change any of the hardware. I just looked into the game and WOW it's RUNNING LIKE HELL! Verified with Fraps - yupp. Solid 60fps now. :) I will let the first edit stay here for reference for others.Verdict: Runs great - even better - on Windows 10. Still recommended!			"

												This game... makes me so happy.It's a beautiful game, and just... everything about it is awesome.It's hard for me to describe, but it's sort of a discovery game, with puzzles in the enviorment.There are deadly obstacles in the way as you go through the game, but it's nothing that a little patience and experimenting cannot solve.I would recommend this game absolutely, to anyone. Take a look at the screenshots, and if it catches your eye at all, please give this game a chance.			"

												This is a neutral recommendation. The gameplay is solid, metroidvania-style spaceship shoot'em up. The puzzles and fighting can get rather difficult at times, but never unfair. If you fail a few times you will recognise patterns and you'll eventually get it.  You end up getting about 10 different weapons to play with, but the ones you get near th end of the game end up being just utility/physics in a very few niche situations. It just seems to work that way with these type of shooters, and it doesn't really change gameplay dramatically enough for any refreshing changes. One thing I like to see in metroidvania games are mobility abilities and this game lacks them. The game tries convey a story through very short cutscenes and gameplay and while it works at getting the story through, it didn't work well at making a compelling narrative. I would have preferred some dialog but I can see why they choose this style. It just didn't jive with me. Same goes for the art style. It works well for the game and is unique without being 16-bit pixel indie game graphics, but I would have preferred more colors than black in every scene, even though you are on a ""shadow planet"". Just personal preference, I guess.			"

												I've notice a lot of devs use ""Metroidvania"" or ""Metroid"" inspired game in their discription. When you manage to buy these games and play em, they feel nothing like what they advertise. This game uses that term and actually live up to its claim. I grew up on the Metroid series, long time fan since.... Metroid 2: Return of Samus, way before the term ""Metroidvania"", was coined. This game is heavily inspired by Metroid, yet you have the feel of exploring the environment by way of flying a spaceship. rather than running around in a spacesuit. you explore, find power ups, kill bosses and gain important power ups, the formula is there. if you are a Metroid fan, its heavily worth the play-through. If you aren't familiar with the Metroid series, don't give up. the game starts out very slow, your ship is very basic and bland, but when you start getting these crucial power ups, you're experience will become more intense and enjoyable. This game is a recommended add to anyone's steam library.			"

												Well-designed metroidvania game with a striking aesthetic and a some unique puzzles. Each area has a distinct feel, and all of the items obtained throughout the game are powerful and have a few different uses. Sound design is very well done, and adds to the feel of the game world immensely. The world is easy to navigate, although I feel there could have been a few more shortcuts to connect the various areas together. Backtracking is mostly optional, and is not tedious since there are doors to open with newfound abilities. Boss design is solid, and the last two bosses especially were a lot of fun. Enemy design is a bit less inspired, but is diverse enough to avoid getting stale.			"

												A really fun game to pick up for a few bucks. At first it looks like it's going to be a mediocre shmup since you start with a pea shooter. However, it's actually more of a puzzle game than an action game. The early enemies are worth just breezing past. The game gets better as you add more and more tools. Some of the areas are quite clever in how they use their mechanics: shooting, bouncing laser beams, changing the screen orientation, picking up things, using a gravity beam, and cutting through rocks.There are a few misses here though. The main one for me is the useless Metroidvania setup. The game will nicely mark the map in places where you need a specific tool to pass, but there's no way to fast travel there. So, if you actually follow up on the locked gates, you'll spend a lot of time backtracking only to get some pretty useless rewards: art/story unlocks and wimpy unneeded ship upgrades. Unless you're a completionist, don't worry too much about backtracking.The story here is as simple as can be: Alien type B has invaded your Alien type A world. You need to destroy Alien type B to save Alien type A. There's no need for a more complex story in this kind of game, so I think that part of it was fine. The graphics are nothing spectacular, but it does have a nice enough art style. It's generally pretty clear what everything is doing and the background and foreground don't mix together. I've been playing a lot of indie titles for the last month, and seeing another shmup/puzzler didn't give me much faith, but I did enjoy the game in the four hours it took me to finish it.			"

												I bought this game expecting to dive into a dark abyss of cool monsters and  ""visual madness"" (if that makes any sense to you), as the title ""Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet"" suggests. I watched the trailers  and knew there would be puzzles and it wasn't a hardcore game, but all the time the whole ""insanely twisted shadow planet"" feeling seemed to be solid and interesting. Well, it wasn't quite like what I wanted. Here's a list of pros and cons: Pros:- Great visuals overall.- Really good and original enemy design. (even though some of them are re-used with little differences they still are great to look at)- Nice soundtracks that fit in with the shadowy atmosphere.- Fluid control.Cons:- The plot is extremely simple, being almost meaningless.- The puzzles aren't challenging, some will require a little bit of thought, but overall they are pretty simple.- Bosses are quite easy.- Too short for its price. (finished it in a little more than 5 hours and it could be much faster)There are many indies games that are very simple and yet you find yourself wondering about what's happening or wanting to help the characters to reach their objective. As already mentioned, you don't get attached to the character's objective or anything, you simply have one mission and complete it. The game is very forgiving and will give you several checkpoints along the way so you don't lose almost any progress when you die, I didn't put that on the lists because it can be pleasant or not to you. The most challenging things are to get optional upgrades, so you should have in mind it's pretty casual.In the end I recommend only getting this game if it is on sale and you want something casual to pass time.

												Rating 8/10What is it?2D inter-connected world controlling a space ship The Good:+ The artstyle and design is unique and beautiful. The use of colors and the the design of the enemies,plant life, and the enviroments all live up to the name of the game. The levels really feel alive because of this.+ 4 different enviroments that are very unique from one another each with their own set of enemies and puzzles. +The puzzles are very well done, providing the right mix of challenge and fun. +The game gives you a vareity of different weapons/tools to use, each one is useful for disposing enemies in addition to traversing the enivornment and progressing further into the game+ The bosses in the game are beautiful and deadly. Each one is unique and requires a different weapon to defeat. +Lots of collectables to upgrade your ship which rewards exploration. +Sound and Music add to the atomosphere The Bad:-I experienced one glitch but it was frustrating enough that I had to note it here. I wasn't the only one to experience this bug as well, luckily restarting the game fixed the issue.-Fairly short, you can beat the game in around 3 hours...4 if you want to collect everything- Achievements are easier to get online or with friends, but seeing as how the community is dead you have to get the co-op ones solo, On the plus side, at least the game gives you the option of doing so. Conclusion:I really enjoyed my time with the game, the artwork is fantastic and it was fun while it lasted. If you like metroidvania type games, then you will enjoy this game.  "

												ITSP is a very concise game. It might not be long, but it's always moving; you're always getting new equipment and doing new things. You're always solving puzzles that are mechanically different from the last. It is nearly devoid of filler unless you actually want to get all of the concept art unlocks, and this is a path that I prefer developers take. I want short games that don't endlessly repeat over long ones that feel like a chore.The puzzles aren't the most difficult out there, but they're imaginative and are very appealing in visuals/effects. The entire game, in fact, is one of the most visually appealing games I've ever played. The world itself is alive and squirming around you. The animation and kinematics are extremely smooth. The camera fluidly zooms in and out to frame the environment around you; for boss battles this means you are a very tiny ship in front of a monster taking up half of your screen. Areas have distinct color palettes with parallax backgrounds (also with animated squirmy things moving around in the distance), but the palettes are always limited in nature and most feature the distinct black silhouetted foreground that probably caught your eye to begin with.I have a few dislikes about the game. The first is that it feels like it straddles the border between explicitly telling a story and leaving the story to the gameplay. It has these confusing cutscenes that don't really assemble into much of anything I care about. Honestly, I am fine if you just show me the planet/sun being corrupted by a dark force, allow me to infer that I need to stop it, and leave me be for the rest of the game; let the gameplay tell the story. This plot is not on the scale of Mass Effect or The Witcher where you'd need anything else explained in any other way.Secondly, despite the quasi-storytelling, it doesn't properly build up to an ending; there is nearly nothing to suggest that you're nearing your ultimate goal of cleansing the planet and no real signifier that the last boss is... well, the last boss. Yes, it's really big, but so are the other bosses, it doesn't strike you as particularly end-guy'ish, so you beat it, pat yourself on the back, and then realize the game is over. For how fascinating the game was and how often it ""ups itself"" with something even more neat, I was hoping for an ending a bit more dramatic/climactic, something like an end-guy with a mind-exploding size that you have to beat in pieces at a time, or the throbbing core of the planet itself.Despite a somewhat deflating end, ITSP is fascinating and entertaining. It's a game that makes you laugh because of how awesome its bits are, be those items you collected, the visuals of an environment you just entered, the very clever effects and how they integrate with the puzzles you are solving, or just how big everything around you is. It packs a lot into the several hours it takes to beat and makes them very worthwhile. If the main flaws above were fixed I feel like it could be one of my top favorite games - the potential is there but it got a bit muddled up - but the game as it turned out must settle for ""just"" being really good.

												I haven't enjoyed a dual stick game as much as this in a long time. Get it.This is an exploration game, where you use a combination of skill and puzzle solving to get new tools and unlock new areas. Think Metroid Prime, but you're in a UFO, and it's 2D. You can scan objects to find out what can affect them and what they do, and use different tools in the same situations to get different effects.It's a fun laid back casual game, but offers enough of a challenge for even the most seasoned of gamers.

												ITSP is one of those games that makes me wish that I could provide a star rating in addition to the YES/NO recommend.  Do I recommend it? Sure.  Is it a great game? No.  You play as a UFO that travels the innards of a planet that has been poisoned by an outside plague force.  Along the way you pick up enhancements to your ship that allow you new and interesting ways to manipulate your environment.  I enjoyed the fact that the game was rather relaxing rather than requiring intense button mashing.  The difficulty throughout was weird.  In most games you see a gradual ramping of difficulty as you need to master the use of multiple tools in combination.  ITSP never moves beyond requiring more than 2 or 3 of your tools at once.  The game actually feels easier at the end than at the beginning.   Overall, a fun game to chill out to in the evening, but you'll be done with it within the week.			"

												A poor man's Aquaria on a prince's budget.It's jarring to play such a beautifully made game, in my absolute favorite genre, and everything around me tells tells me it's wonderful... but for some reason it sucks.The game is too forgiving from moment to moment, so much so that this scary planet actually tries to feed you health right within sight of your weird magical filling stations. Then you get locked into a boss fight with a single trial-and-error solution. If this is an homage to Metroid, it's an homage to the wrong part of Metroid.The game is full of what seem like puzzles but aren't, and what seems like exploration but isn't. Nice touches squandered on room-by-room level design, and a scanner device that always tells you exactly what to do. A nice music system which is used for only one thing, and good sound marred by the constant whirr of your saucer engine.None of these problems are absolutely damning, but together they sink what should have been a phenomenal game.

												Finally, another Metroidvania game for the PC. There just aren't enough of these games around for PC. For those who don't know what Metroidvania means; it means that you're exploring a maze-like world with multiple paths, but instead of it being totally open, you have to start at one place, gather a weapon/ability and move to the other path, and so forth.The graphics are 2D, clean and sharp and have, for a shadow planet, lots of personality. The sounds don't stand out and they certainly didn't wow me, but they got the job done.Lengthwise it's about 4 hours long. There are some upgrades available for your ship, and they don't have to be collected to finish the game so there's a bit of extra exploration, but it isn't much. There is co-op to be found in this game, but I haven't tried it. It might add to the replayability. ITWS is a fun game, and it should be played, especially if you're a fan of the genre or if you've never played it at all.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												This is a fun little 2D exploration puzzle shooter. It has a lot of simple elements that mix things up often enough to keep things interesting.  Some times you'll be shooting bad guys, other times you'll be doing tricky tunnel navigation, other times you'll be mixing and matching tools to solve not-too-complex puzzles, and sometimes you'll even have boss fights.  The game can be mildly frustrating on occasion, but it never feels unfair.  Normally it means you're approaching a challenge in the wrong way, or lack a tool that will make it solvable or much easier.

I enjoyed the enemies and puzzles thrown at me as they were well thought out and felt intelligent. The gameplay felt diverse amongst the different abilities you could choose from and all controls were intuitive with the controller (as I believe this game was originally designed for xbox). The story was minimalistic and the short cutscenes were effective in keeping you hooked.One issue I had with the game was that there was absolutely no help text in the game. At times, I just couldn't figure out what to do. For this I will give this game a 8.9/10. It is a fantastic game as long as you consult external help when stuck.			"

												I first played this game on the XBOX 360, and I loved it. The PC port is pretty good as well (although I prefer the controller). The art style is dark and strange in the best way, and the gameplay is a combination of exploration, action, and difficult but rewarding boss fights. The game is a Metroidvania style game, meaning as you go on you unlock abilities that open up previously unaccessable areas. This aspect allows for great replayability, making sure that even after you complete the main game, there is much more to do. There is also a multiplayer game mode, which is great by itself. I recommend this to any fans of this genre, or anyone who finds the visuals appealing.			"

												This is a fun little 2D exploration puzzle shooter. It has a lot of simple elements that mix things up often enough to keep things interesting.  Some times you'll be shooting bad guys, other times you'll be doing tricky tunnel navigation, other times you'll be mixing and matching tools to solve not-too-complex puzzles, and sometimes you'll even have boss fights.  The game can be mildly frustrating on occasion, but it never feels unfair.  Normally it means you're approaching a challenge in the wrong way, or lack a tool that will make it solvable or much easier.  I wouldn't say it's worth it at full price, but it is worth checking out.			"

												I had never heard of this game before but I picked it anyway up as it was cheap and I am glad I did! This game is not only graphically beautiful, it's gameplay is pretty good too! There is quite a bit to explore and things to find with regular puzzles and enimies blocking your way. At some points you'll even find places you can't explore as it requires new tools/weapons to complete so you will find your self back tracking a fair bit. This is okay though as the whole atmosphere of the game makes any trip interesting with epic music and great visuals.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 2D puzzle games, exploring and a bit of action.

												Here's the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet in a nutshell: You pilot a space vessel, exploring an unknown world and its labyrinthine structures--zapping evil tentacle monsters that stand between you and victory. Along the way, occasional boss battles spruce up the grind.While the game isn't going leaps and bounds in terms of gameplay or mechanics, it makes up for it in quirkiness. The art /  animation style of the game, mixed in with the alien biology the player faces really go hand in hand. The enemies are creative and fun. The puzzles aren't much of a challenge, but the game is meant to be relaxed anyway.Lacks replay value, but has multiplayer modes if you have a few friends. Definitely get it for the art.			"

Didnt get far in the solo campain, but LOVE the coop mode. This is where this game really shines! Coop is local or net, but I strongly recommend a local game on your couch. Together with a friend its great fun, with 4 players its fantastic!The game mode Latern run this is one of the best coop party games along with some beer. :-)You and your friends are little flying saucers who try to escape a giant tentacle monster chasing you.Totally worth just for the fun in the local coop mode. 8/10			"

												Beautiful and imaginative art direction, fun metroidvania-style gameplay, a couple of neat puzzles (some of which were also boss fights) and a very Danny Elfman-esque soundtrack. But it's marred by short length, a number of puzzles being either too easy or frustrating due to bugs (the ice crystals come to mind) and a lack of depth in the story department (summed up as ""shadow aliens are bad mmmkay""). But overall, it's worth buying on sale. I had it like 99% complete too, just missing a few elusive collectibles. Sigh.Adorable Squids/10			"

												Truly a hidden gem among the plethora of titles listed on steam. What hides behind the deceptively simple artstyle and gameplay lies an intricately designed masterpiece that has the power to evoke strong feelings of wonder and curiosity but at the same time, helplessness and terror.I've still yet to finish the game but with the time I've played so far and what the trailer has shown, it is apparent that what I've experienced thus far is just a small slice of this exquisitely delicious pie that will only get tastier, the more I consume of it.

												I never put much thought into this game when first seeing it and having it gifted and sitting there in the Steam Library before for some time befor I ever thought to try it out.  And I'm rather happy that I did.  The game offers a neat space exploration idea with you avdenturing through the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet and picking up weapons, upgrades and fighting massive bosses along the way.  It has alot of creativity for the way each part of the planet feels different and artsy style of the game has some real charm to keep you attracted to not only your doing in the main game, but really feeling your tiny scale ship in such a massively scaled planet.  It might not win game of year, but it delivers some great fun, creative puzzles and even a bit of multiplayer if you can get lucky to find more people online.  Check it out if your ever curious. ^-^Later,			"

												Let me get the negative out of the way first: this game requires Games for Windows Live. However, if that hasn't scared you off, read on. ITSP is a fairly unique puzzle/shooter hybrid in the classic ""Metroidvania"" style (explore a sprawling 2D map using progressively earned abilities, backtracking to progress further, etc). So what sets this apart from similar games? Firstly, it has a very unique 'shadowy' art style that is pretty cool. And second, instead of being a character-based platformer, it's a spaceship-based twin-stick shooter with heavy puzzle elements. If that sounds interesting or up your alley, I would say don't hesitate to check this out. The only downsides to the experience are that the game is pretty short (~7 hours for the single-player, but it also has a multiplayer mode) and it is not particularly difficult (you will certainly die on occasion, but checkpoints are plentiful). It's not an all-time classic, but it's definitely a cool low-key experience. Check it out!			"

												Yes, this game has it's unique visual style. But honestyly, I can't recommend it. There's lots of boring backtracking and game is very easy. Even final boss doesn't pose any challenge. If you expect that exploring all corners of the map will be properly rewarded, you'll be disappointed. You'll get few very short cinematics and handful of artworks (and of course upgrades for armour and basic weapon).It's not total waste of time, though. You'll have lots of fun before novelty effect wears off. I'd give it 5/10.			"

Music by dimmu borgir is a nice touch. I only wish that the controls allowed for a Dpad assignment so you could set all 8 weapons to a quick key. This game is very simple. most worlds can be completed while in them with a few needing to go back. The game is actually fairly short but alright for a casual pick up. I liked it. 7/10			"

												This is a fun metroidvania-stype game with a persistent singular world that encourages backtracking and such to get upgrades and items that you couldnt get before a certain point, which keeps things not feeling too linear.

I love the artistic style of this game as well, it's a very simple aesthetic that conveys the alien-ness of the world you're exploring very well.

Or, at least in a corrupted stellar body full of twists, turns, enemies, puzzles, items, collectibles and a detailed map! I had this first for 360, and when I saw it pop up here three years, why, I just had to have it! And let me tell you; its playability has not diminished in the least. Its dual-stick support works wonderfully with my Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, and production values are incredibly high for a game of this type. The challenges herein are just the right mix of challenging, puzzling and rewarding.Now, I have not tried the local co-op modes, as I have had no one to play them with locally; but if I do have the opportunity in the future, I'll take it. Other than that, enjoy ripping your way through the Shadow Planet in your very own, increasingly impressive little UFO! :)			"

												This was a very fun little twin-stick-shooter/2D adventure game. The puzzles were very fun, and the exploration of the really creative environments was wonderful. However, the comat was mediocre, some segments were unecessarily frustrating, and the bosses are just boring. Overall, though, the fantastic design, exploration and puzzles of the game are far more commonplace than any combat which is actually necessary, making this game a lot of fun.			"

A Paladin's Steam Review: Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. An Enjoyable Metroidvania That Made Me Feel Clever.Genre: 2D Metroidvania Exploration/Puzzle Game. Developed & Published by: Shadow Planet Productions & Microsoft StudiosPlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game only. Copy Purchased by Myself PreambleFly around in your own “little” flying saucer picking up weapons or tools, figuring out puzzles and enjoying artistic backgrounds. The lack of gravity means you get a wide degree of movement though the levels themselves with limit where you can go. Gliding around in this flying saucer was definitely a different experience from the norm. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThat being said, exploration and puzzle solving is the main focus of this game. Combat is straightforward with your weapons being easy to aim and land on enemies. That being said, you'll need to keep in mind that neither of you can handle more than a few shots, exempting bosses. So, it’s in your best interest to dodge the shots coming your way. The saucer can only heal from save checkpoints and rare health pickups, so avoid taking damage whenever possible. While enemies do re-spawn when they’re off-screen, they can be bypassed if you're simply passing through the area. Most of your time will be spent focusing on exploring this crazy planet you've landed on. Thanks to the pacing of the game and upgrades you can find, said exploration remains enjoyable the entire time.  What I really liked about this title is that I felt clever when I made progress. Boss fights aren't big slug fests where you outlast your enemies but outthink them. You just need to use the tools and weapons you find along the way. If you’re having a frustrating time with a certain situation you find yourself in, you probably need to think your way out of it differently. Use the scanning tool. It will help you out a lot if you get stuck. The only part of this game that can get overly frustrating is the ice level, where you have to place ice crystals in the right places to get a beam of light to where you need it. The pick-up tool is...quirky and sometimes won't place the crystals correctly. StoryYou follow the adventure of an alien who has gone to...well...an insanely twisted up shadowy planet to stop an invading force from destroying their planet. At least, that’s what I got out of the story. Most of the story is shown via pictures and cutscenes with no text or voice over to really clue you in to what’s going on. As the cutscenes are short, they only give you a basic idea of what’s going on. So, there’s not much to say about the story.PC Settings and Port ReportITSP makes it way from Xbox to the PC platform in good form. Custom resolutions, fullscreen, texture and shader quality sliders (on/off choices) as well as depth of field and anti-aliasing up to 8x are here. It’s more than I’d expect from a 2D game but I’m definitely not complaining. The game runs exceptionally well and I never ran into bugs or crashes during my time with it. Keyboard bindings are present but you’ll have a better time with a controller as the movement simply feels more natural with an analogue stick. I didn't try out any of the multiplayer, I just wasn't all that interested in it. Final ThoughtsIt felt like this title mostly got ignored, which is a shame because there’s a really solid game here. Sure, the laser puzzles are finicky and the combat depth is shallow. But the presentation is solid, the pacing is great and the atmosphere is really nice. Add in some fun exploration and clever boss fights to make for a great title. Released nearly three years ago, I only recently picked up and played Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. I left the experience rather satisfied. Which is rare, as this genre is so often plagued with some sort of pacing or mechanical issues that get in the way of having a fun time. I recommend picking Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet up if you're in the market for this type of game.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												Beautiful.All aspects of the game seem well thought-out and polished.Manages to marry modern graphics and animation with old school 2D gameplay style, which I found refreshing as most recent 2D indie games are riding the retro pixel graphics wave.I liked how there's not a word of in-game text or speech, no tutorials, yet it manages to communicate everything it needs to.

Product received for free
												I want to like this game. Dear God I want to. I love spooky creepy tentacle beasts, I love seeing interesting visual styles, I love this exact look and feel in a game. The concept is good - a tiny alien trying to save his planet from shadowy beasts that have taken it over. The Metroidvania aspect is fun. The visuals are just gorgeous and the music is quite well done as well. I don't think I've ever seen an ice level use lasers as a gimmick before, that's unique. I got it for free as part of a gifted Humble Bundle some time ago, which included some of my now favorite games like Eldritch and the charming Mutant Blobs Attack.The problem is, the game does not work. I don't mean the visuals don't work well together, or that its themes aren't cohesive - they do, and they are. I mean it literally doesn't work. The controls, no matter how you set the mouse, are too sensitive for this type of game, making movement feel too slow and aiming feel too quick - especially with the arm and the rockets. The mouse sensitivity control settings goes from sluggish and unable to move the mouse at all, to WAY too fast and slippery to handle. The UFO feels sluggish as hell to lug around. The controls just never feel quite right even though they are standard WASD controls with a mouse. The game feels like it's trying to be too many things at once - Metroidvania homage, shooter, puzzle platformer, exploration - and not a single piece of it is done well. These are things that play well together, developers, and have for decades of gaming now, so why are you having so much trouble making them work?Puzzles are both too simple, and unneccessarily frustrating - some of them even feel like a chore, and a good puzzle should not feel that way. Some give hints that are too vague, and the solution is just one thing. No free reign with the tools you get. Some bosses do not seem to explain or give good enough tells for what you need to do - one involved clinging to a suctioning vortex creature, the hint given for defeating it? A weapon you don't even have yet, and if you're not paying attention to those anemone things, you won't realize their spikes are heat-seeking missiles. Some hidden objects are easy to find, and some hidden objects are stupidly hard to find. Others use unique ways for the tools you need to make an extra leap to discover, but you probably won't realize you can do it until you backtrack and mull it over deeply. Developers, there is a difference between ""Make the player think about how they can use their tools"" versus ""Make the player scrape the bottom of the barrel of thoughts trying to determine if they CAN do something with a tool"". Castlevania understood this. Metroid understood this. Nintendo Hard does not mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard, and trust me, I know hard versus fake hard - I grew up in the puzzle game haven of the 90's and have played my fair share of games with tough puzzles. I should not have to look up a walkthrough to figure out what you intend me to do because I thought I missed something and broke the game.The game is unpolished, and full of glitches that range from funny to game-breaking. I have a high tolerance for a certain kind of glitch if it makes me laugh. There's an amusing one with the sea cucumber things and the vents in Ocean, involving one of the flattened ones flipping about as the broken physics went awry. It was amusing for all of five seconds until I realized the game shouldn't be doing this. I got halfway through the game when I hit a snag in the Ice world - the laser beam physics were wonky enough on one puzzle that the beam was hitting a bit below where it should and not reflecting. Confused, I looked up a walkthrough, and sure enough this shouldn't be a thing that happens. Then I noticed I missed a spot that required rockets to get through, go to bomb it... and nothing. Every other object of same type nearby reacts to the rockets, except for the one I need to react. Once again, I check a walkthrough to confirm... and this shouldn't happen. So I can't go forward because of one glitch, and I can't go down because of another. Was there no quality assurance here, guys? How did something this game-breaking slip through the cracks? And this is not the only problem the Ice world has, apparently this is just the point the game decides it likes to break, which is a problem since it's the halfway mark of the game.Combat is brutal. Too brutal. Again, Developers, there is a difference between Nintendo Hard and Too Hard. This is almost too hard. Enemies respawn *way* too quickly for this sort of game. Swarms of tiny enemies are a huge chore to deal with. Fighting does not feel fun with the finicky controls for the arm weapons. The shield power is nearly useless in battle. Too many enemies with ranged attacks in close quarters when you're trying to solve a puzzle that respawn within five seconds. None of this is Nintendo Hard, it's just unfair. Even Eldritch and other roguelikes let you have a longer reprieve between enemies spawning and respawning. Even Dark Souls is not that cruel. I appeciate you're trying to make this a homage to Nintendo Hard, guys, but this is not how you do it. This is artificial difficulty for the sake of trying to be tough to psyche players out.Did I mention the physics in this game are broken? The physics are broken. Putting objects where they belong for puzzles is tougher than it should be. Physics for throwing objects are not cohesive, in that there's no momentum. Things don't feel like they have weight if they are supposed to be heavy. I feel like I am waving around a dead fish trying to control the arm, and the less said about the inability to control the rockets in the guided section, the better. This is a physics puzzle Metroidvania throwback with broken physics. Why would you make this style of game if you can't even get the physics down pat?Like I said, I want to like this game. I really do. But I cannot forgive a game that has been out since 2011 having controls this finicky, glitches this game-breaking in such quick succession to each other, and this level of artificial difficulty. There's no excuse for a game to be released this unpolished, and with so much potential too. There is a reason this is mostly overlooked despite its apparently good reputation here. The artwork just does not save this one, it's too broken. Also, Games for Windows Live? Ew, guys. Just ew.Don't buy this game. Save the money, and go buy the excellent Nihilumbra or the kitschy-fun Mutant Blobs Attack. They're not Metroidvanias, sure, but they are beautiful, polished, and fun - something this game fails 2 out of 3 at.			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet follows the Metroidvania formula well with a diverse selection of weapons, all of which suit the theme and present new options both for exploration and for combat. The world is almost entirely open and gates that can only be unlocked with new weapons pop up from the beginning. The map clearly shows what has been explored and what hasn't and can even note the weapon needed for a particular gate. It's all here, save the fun. There's just too much frustration to allow fun to flourish. Enemies respawn at surprising rates which would be fine if it was any fun to shoot them. Past the first time realizing that a new weapon would be better used on this enemy or that, fighting is a chore. The often narrow, obstacle-fulled corridors would be more at home in a puzzle-platformer which Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet very nearly is, and would be better for being. The two co-op modes - a feature that should be an absolute boon for such a short game - doesn't help with that either. They both emphasize the worst elements of the game by adding more combat and forcing the player to cart something around for the entire mode, a mechanic that only serves to point out how finicky the grabber arm is. Both modes also feature a timed element and remove all the enjoyable exploration and permanent advancement that made the main campaign so close to being something great in the first place. And there is something great hiding in Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. Sadly, it's just too buried under layers and layers of poor execution to really shine.			"

You'll enjoy the entire run through, and likely feel motivated to find every power up and fill out the map coverage 100%. The bonus modes and multiplayer didn't interest me.

												Great game. The art and atmosphere are great, and the steam adaptation's really smooth in contrast to console version. I played this on both xbox 360 and Steam, so I can safely say that it works just as great on steam as it does on any console. It's a really fun game, the price might be steep but I got it while it was on sale for 4-5 dollars. If it's on sale, this is definitely an awesome game to own. It's a little steep at 14.99 I must admit, because the content is great and all but...There isn't exactly 14.99 worth of content. It's dissapointing how dead multiplayer is these days. No people around to play shadow run/lantern run with. Shadow Run is free, and i'm pretty sure when it released on console it was DLC with a 2-5 dollar price tag, so it's more content for less bull. It's a great game, if you're interested in it, i'd say get it.			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is an adventure game set in a bizzare and interesting theme. As a small UFO you will have to battle various ennemies and solve puzzles using your ever-expanding set of tools and upgrades. You will encounter many bosses and mini-bosses along the way, which will test your understanding of the mechanics of the game. In theory, this sounds like an amazing concept, but in my opinion, the idea is poorly executed.Lets start with the positives aspects.First, as you can probably tell by the screenshots, this game is gorgeous. The open world is so incredibly detailled and pleasing for the eye to explore. The cutesy artstyle contrasts perfectly with the dark atmosphere and dangerous nature of the Shadow Planet. On top of that, each area feels unique, with its own theme and corresponding enemies (Ocean, Ice, Mechanical, Electric). The bosses are huge and impressive and are all different from the last, adding to the excitment of progression. The soundtrack is subtle but atmospheric and immersive.Now, the negatives.Where this game fails the hardest is its gameplay. Infuriatingly slow-paced, you'll have to fly around the huge areas to solve the puzzles in order to progress. Now I wouldn't mind having to go around and figure out how to progress if the puzzles weren't so painfully obvious and straightforward: ''Hey you know the thing you saw 5 rooms ago that looked useless? Go back and get it if you wanna continue!'' or ''You just got a new digging upgrade? Wow I wonder how you will EVER figure out that you need it to destroy that heavily cracked wall thats right in front of your face.'' As someone mentionned before me, most tasks felt like a chore. I forced myself to finish the game thinking that it would get harder or more enjoyable but far from it. Hell, the final area only use a single new mechanic from beggining to end. The enemies are very underwelming and predictable. You can ignore most of them without a problem. The bosses are also very simple and rarely require more than 2 of your gadgets to defeat, one of which is always your newest aquisition.There are 4 categories of items to find.First are the main items: Ranging from a missile launcher to a telekinetic antenna, these items will be obtained by following the main path and required to progress. Second are the ship upgrades for the starting gun and the armor: After getting 3 to 5 parts, your ship will gain more HP or shoot more bullets. Since you can easily dodge and escape enemies, the HP upgrades aren't worth the trouble. The main gun upgrade is also useless since you won't be using it after the third area where you unlock the missile launcher. Third are artifacts, which everytime you collect 3, you will be shown a short cutscene showing hints about the story (which isn't anything special). You can skip those too. Last are unlockable pictures that you can view from the main menu. All in all each one of them is a huge waste of your time. I cannot recommend this game, especially at the full price tag. If you really want to check it out, I strongly suggest that you get it on sale.TL;DRPros:-Amazing art and atmosphere-Unique design and theme in each level-Impressive bosses and encounters-Many different tools to acquireCons:-Painfully slow-paced-Straightforward and obvious puzzles-Progressing feels like a chore-Predictable enemies-Bosses are too easy-Upgrades are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get and are useless-Too short (thank god)-Overpriced "

Insanely Twisted Shadow PlanetRating: 8 / 10Kinda surprised by the setting, tone and visuals of the game in a very positive sense as I was expecting a standard indie kinda puzzle game. You basically guide a ufo through a very alien landscape and it just rocks. During your travels you pick up several pieces that enhances your ufo so you'll be able to scan, tow or shoot stuff. The game itself is a puzzle game mixed with some shooting and has a great atmosphere.Originally published for the XBox360 so optimal play is with an XBox controller.			"

												For an indie game, this must have taken a lot of work because it really shows. The graphics are pretty standard but the art direction and effects are what the game is all about. All of the environments are decorated with amazing pieces, from enemies to awesome looking glowing things coming out of the walls. The boss battles are well thought out and the level design is pretty good. The ship you control is very cool. The weapons and items that you get to help you through the game are all very well thought out and fun to use. The sound is fitting and the music is moody and atmospheric. You fly around above water and underwater and the transition is very smooth. Nothing feels generic, it feels like a lot of time and care went into making this exactly how they wanted it. Am having a ton of fun with it the whole time so far.8/10			"

Why you should electrify flying lamp to break some kind of reactor is never explained. I really enjoy fighting with bosses. The fights are well designed and fun to solve. The game is kinda repetitive and get boring after long period of the same. Fortunately the world around you ship change (bio world, water world, ice world, etc.).			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet Review – Raymond KTIf you've played any ""Metroidvania"" games, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet will feel very familiar to you. There is a large map for you to survey and you'll do a fair amount of backtracking as you upgrade your ship with gear that will open what were previously dead ends. A claw arm will allow you to pick up rocks that might be blocking your path, for instance. The tools are all fun to play with and are doled out at regular intervals. Combat punctuates the exploration, including some memorable boss fights.Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is unfortunately one of the shorter games I've played this year, and the pacing is a little off. I didn't realize I was fighting the final boss until I saw the credits immediately after – it's missing a big climax. When I finished the campaign I had explored the map to 88 percent completion. You are free to return and finish finding all the upgrades and concept art, but I wasn't motivated to do so. It took me four or five hours to complete the game.Although I am saying mostly positive things about this game thus far, I am not into these types personally. So, for that reason im not going to recommend it.			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a fun little 2D action-adventure game. The game's impressive artwork alone is a reason to play it. Gameplay wise it's just not very challenging nor groundbreaking in any way, yet it somehow manages to keep you interested until the very end. Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is not new, not unsurpassed, but actually quite good if you can forgive the game for its flaws. +Jaw-dropping artwork, a true visual masterpiece+Beautiful and diverse environments +Lots of weapons, tools and upgrades+Around 8-10 hours of playtime+Well designed boss battles-Lackluster puzzles -Not really difficult (but it fits the game)-Mandatory GFWL-Annoying world map-No music7/10			"

												Interesting little game. As the screenshots show, this game has a sort of cartoony dark sci-fi horror theme going, which is easily its best point. But the world design and the myriad of puzzles and enemies are great as well. Especially boss fights are well rounded out: not too easy nor too hard, making use of a mechanic you've learned previously and usually rewarding you with a new toy to play with.The controls took some getting used to (especially guiding rockets), and I found swapping the controller for a keyboard and mouse to make things MUCH easier (this is probably me, though).As for the story: take it for good or for bad, but there is no dialogue. At all. No cutscene text, no voice-overs, no tutorials (in the literal sense...level design is set to make you acquainted with new weapons), no nothing.  So you can only take a guess at things like why you're there or even what the weapons are called, but it doesn't distract much. This is a game that should be played...not watched or read.'metroidvania' is the typical term for this sort of game (only one huge♥♥♥♥♥level but most parts are locked until you have a certain item), but I'm not sure I want to classify it as such. The reason is that it felt pretty linear. I rarely backtracked or explored anything outside where I was pointed out to go, and the only time I felt lost was in the part where the map rotated (you'll know when you get there). Oh, and you're flying a spaceship. That's a rather unusual (if not unique) approach for this kind of game.But all in all, it's certainly a game worth playing. Not very long, but it shouldn't be any longer: as it is, it's packed with all the good stuff. :-)In score, I'd say 7,5 or 8 on 10. But since it's personal, it doesn't say much on what YOU may think it's worth...			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet seems fun from the outset. In short, you explore a large map finding and applying new-found tools to combat and puzzles. The game looks fantastic, and obviously had a lot of thought put into it, which is why it is so disappointing that it just barely fell short of being a good game.The controls are imprecise and the the combat is unforgiving. You'll more than once find yourself googling the solution to ""puzzles"" not because they are hard, but rather because the mechanics are so poorly explained you won't know what to do. The map looks non-linear, but it isn't. You always need the next tool to get the next tool, etc... Only the secret areas are non-linear in any sense of the word, and they just involve back-tracking through completed areas for longer than it takes for that prospect to become incredibly boring. I've seen free ""Metroidvania"" flash games less frustrating than this. Make no mistake, you're paying for the artist's work that went into making this game look amazing, not for good game mechanics, and not for innovation.There's two online/local multiplayer modes as well, but they focus entirely on one of the most frustrating mechanics in the game: dragging an objective along while you are rendered defenseless, relying on either your teammates or your multitasking to protect yourself. Seems like an opportunity was missed for some very fun cooperative puzzles, but such is the life of an X-Box port.Save your money, and don't think for a moment this game lives up to the hype. It's more frustrating than fun, and that's the real tragedy here.			"

Alot of attention was given to make the whole planet feel like a living breathing pulsating life form and yet the use of textures or even colour is minimal. The multiplayer is dead but the main campaign is enough to get your money's worth. Great level design and challenging boss battles topped off with the recent removal of GFWL make this a must have for your indie game collection.			"

												ITSP is a decent game that falls short of being good.You spend the game flying around in a ship killing easy enemies, solving simple puzzles, getting new weapons and powerups, and occasionally fighting easy bosses.  Not much more too it than that.  There's no real plot, stories, dialogue, or characters in the game, which is fine for what it is.  The game is pretty short despite it having a tutorial area and 5 main environments that you'll go through.  Dying is handled  with a quick respawn at the closest checkpoint, which are located all over the place.So on the positive side, the game does look and sound nice.  Controls are solid for the most part with a controller.  Plenty of enemy types.  On the downside, the game is very easy.  Most enemies go down quickly and you'll probably spend a lot of the time just driving by them since they pose so little of a threat.  Checkpoints are all over the place and refill your health, so getting damaged often is no problem.  You would expect the difficulty to ramp up as you go along, but surprisingly the final environment is probably both the shortest and easiest to get through. Bosses will barely put up a struggle before you kill them, even the final boss.  Almost all of them allow you to farm health during the battle.  You'll die on occasion but it'll usually be due to something unexpected insta killing you or simply because you were rushing and didn't care enough to slow down.  Puzzles are very simple and barely require any thought.  There are 8 switchable weapons throughout the game but a couple of them are used in 1 environment and then you'll never use them again.  Occasionally the camera can be annoying.  It auto-zooms in and out depending on where you're at.  There are times when it zooms in too closely when you'd prefer that it be further out.  It also has some trouble at keeping up with your ship if you're moving too fast, this is especially noticeable in the wind tunnel areas.Annoyances -  1. Some players have had game slowdown problems.  On my playthrough, there were certain spots where the game would run at about half the normal speed.  Not a huge issue since it goes away once you get away form those spots, but quite noticeable.  2.  The grabber weapon can be frustrating at times, sometimes not grabbing the things you tell it to grab.  3.  There can be an occasional glitch.  One zone has you reflecting light beams off of movable ice shards.  Sometimes they don't reflect properly and require you to fuss around with them until the game decides it wants to act properly.  4.  Whoever designed the campaign menu deserves to be punched in the face.  When you use a controller and select to play the campaign, it brings up 2 options; New Game and Resume Game.  The menu designer didn't bother putting any noticeable icon next to the one you're actually highlighting, so the only way you can tell which one you're selecting is that one is highlighted white while the other is highlighted purple.  Differentiating by color is completely useless when there are only two options and you can't tell which color is the actual highlight color.  Accidentally started a new game when I meant to resume my game.  You can only have one save file, and when you start a new game it automatically saves over your old one.  So I had the fun of beating the tutorial area and the first 2 environments over again.  Was it really too much work to put a damn arrow or something there to show which one you're selecting?ITSP isn't a bad game, but the ease of the game means it lacks any sort of challenge or excitement.  The game doesn't have anything else to fall back on since there's no plot, characters, or dialogue.  The final environment is really a letdown when you get through it and barely have to apply any effort while doing so.  Game simply needs to be more difficult, especially the majority of the boss battles.			"

												I don't know what these guys here were playing but what I got was a pretty slow game with low graphics (I saw the game before, but the Trailer let you think there is some hidden ""art"" there. Maybe there is in some bossbattles, but the normal walkthrough is absolutely unsatisfing.) The game on the other hand, was so poorly written, that I had to put down Anti-Aliasing to 4x because otherwise it would lag too much (believe me, my system should easily get this game). The controlls are slow and lag. Aiming is extremly difficult. For the first hour the only thing I did was roam around vast territorys with actually 2 riddles (or rather stones in my way I had to move, which is pretty easy). You farm your accessoirs and thats it. It bored me to a level I couldn't handle - and normally I play through every game. This is my first that I actually stopped. I can't recommend it.			"

												Thanks to the developer/support team for patching this to run on Vista. It was really frustrating at first, but now it runs just fine.Art and sound design are really great--sort of a Gashlycrumb Tinies meets Limbo in space.The problem with the game is actually playing it. It feels quite slow--the mechanics are too sluggish and frustrating for a long Metroid-style game. The little saucer guy drives like a low-performance car--every stick move and aim direction telegraphs with a slow lag from the controller to the animation, as if through a dense molasses. It seems that this is intentionally part of the game design, but it's still frustrating and impedes the fun. If I'm traversing a big level repeatedly, I'd like the things I'm doing (dodging, taking out baddies) to be fun each time through. This doesn't quite achieve that. I finished it just to see the ending. A not-recommended that might be a mixed-recommended, depending on how you like the slow pacing and sludgy movement. The game is fine for younger players, but lacks the depth of story, punchier action, and world building of a lot of other puzzle and quest games.			"

												This game had an update that removed GFWL. Instead of actually posting that to the game's activity page here on Steam (every game has one on this ""service"" you know) to give the GFWL players a heads up of the impending change, the only notice of the game's dropping of GFWL was a link to some indietalk post in the discussion pages for the game. Nothing official from the developer at all on the game's Steam activity page. Warner Brothers was bad enough switching over with no notice, but at least they had an official announcement on Steam; this game did not. The developer also had quite the arrogant Twitter post about this; and as a GFWL gamer, I got my save destroyed, lost my GFWL data, and feel stupid and insulted because I actually paid for this a while back to support them as a GFWL gamer when everyone else was b1tching and moaning about GFWL because GOD FORBID Microsoft published the game in the first place (and where was Valve then eh?). Even though I backed this game up before the update, Steam will not let you play off a backup without forcing the update. So much for the ""usefulness"" of automatic updates. I got through the first level and this one was going to part of my GFWL gaming activity over the holiday from college, but now I can not and for that I will not support a developer as uncaring as this. Neither should you. Steam has over 3000+ games in its ""service"" - do yourself a favor and play a game in which the developer uses the tools that the service he is supposedly gaga for offers instead of being kind of a jerk about the changeover on freaking Twitter.

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a decent side scrolling adventure. You play the role of a trapped flying saucer looking for a way off a dark and twisted planet. You end up having to find multiple puzzles pieces and ship upgrades to move through the different areas. There are several boss battles that require certain weapon strategies along with several cool physics based puzzles. It's short, slightly boring, but still enjoyable.			"

The bosses design is breathtaking, the controls are easy to get used to. However, not every game is perfect, you have at least 4 hours of gameplay untill you complete the entire game. There are 2 other minigames, which are entertaining, but it doesn't last forever. But if you like metrovania style game, give it a try. :)			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a 2D side-scrolling action/adventure Metroidvania game with puzzle elements. Basically you fly around in a small flying saucer and solve small puzzles while fighting off enemies and gigantic bosses. As you travel through the shadow planet you will get new abilities that allow you to backtrack to previous areas to open new areas like any Metroidvania type game, though most of the collectibles you find by backtracking are concept art pieces and short movie clips.The art style and music create a very nice atmosphere, and the controls are fairly smooth. Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.All-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles. I recommend picking it up sometime when it's on sale.			"

												This is an excellent game, if a bit on the short side. The presentation is fantastic, with a great soundtrack (by Dimmu Borgir, of all people, though you wouldn't know it) and  a strong artistic style. If you want to, you can marathon through it in a single sitting, though I took my time over a couple days so I could enjoy it longer. It's got a great balance of puzzle and exploration elements, and if you like Metroidvania style exploration, you should definitely pick it up. It doesn't have the same enemy density as a Metroidvania game, and sometimes it's a better tactical decision to run than fight. The boss fights are clever, making good use of the weapons available to you at the time, neither too easy nor frustratingly difficult, offering a balanced challenge. The only thing I found slightly frustrating was steering rockets, but after a few tries, it became easier. A definite must-have if you enjoy puzzle exploration games.			"

												A nifty little metroidvania-like with some awesome art direction and far better mouse+keyboard support than I would expect from a game that started on the 360. The controls are SMOOTH.The gameplay is mostly focused on environmental puzzles. Combat can be hectic but all save points heal you to full and they are frequent enough that you don't really have to worry that much about getting hit outside of boss battles. It's quite strictly linear- don't expect to sequence break or do levels out of order. Nevertheless you can and should backtrack to collect upgrades that were blocked off before.They really got the atmosphere right, too.  It feels like you are a tiny tresspasser on a violently hostile, starkly alien planet, completely alone and carefully blazing a trail into the heart of the beast to strike where it is most vulnerable.I only have one real complaint- it seemed a little short. I wouldn't have minded a couple more areas.			"

												Grab this ON SALE if you're a Metroidvania fan. Otherwise, it's expensive fluff.A quick, twisted dive into Metroidvania-style gaming. The art style is cool and atmospheric. In eight hours, I finished the game with a fully upgraded ship and most of the items, barring a couple artifacts and/or concept art pieces. Bosses are infrequent and not so difficult, or creative with regard to gameplay and the items you find along the way. The items themselves are pretty cool and fun to use, for the most part, but a few lack imagination. I was particularly disappointed by the main laser upgrades. I'd hoped for more content, more challenge. It's fun, but honestly 14 euro is too pricey for what it is.			"

												I love unique art direction in games. A couple that come to mind are Limbo and the recent Rayman games. I still need solid mechanics, but a unique sense of style can elevate an otherwise solid but unexceptional game to something special. Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a perfect example. It's a solid ​Metroidvania game with a decent-size map, a nice variety of tools and weapons, and some clever puzzles and boss fights. The movement of the ship and the physics of the environment are also exceptionally well implemented. None of it is groundbreaking, but not every game has to be revolutionary. It does what it does very well, and with flawless design in both UI design and art direction.			"

												Now in many Metroidvanias, the power of flight is often held away from the player until the endgame, as with the genre's two instigators. Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet says ♥♥♥♥ that, you're a flying saucer, now fly around and shoot things. What follows is an incredibly stylish adventure through the dark corridors of the namesake world, where your lone alien must battle horrible tenticled monstrosities and locate useful tools to open new paths, in typical genre fashion. The overall length is noticbly short, especially for a Metroidvania, but it it's a solid experience the whole way through. Combat is not particularly challenging, and although you can take only a few hits, checkpoints are frequent. The puzzles are also not overly challenging, when compared to, say, Guacamelee, and the game lacks the insane shinespark-style secrets that a game like Metroid: Zero Mission has- overall I might term ITSP a ""Metroidvania-lite"", perhaps unsurprising given its origins as an Xbox Live Arcade game (I had a similar experince with a game called Shadow Complex, which I managed to 100% the first time I played it, without using a guide). The game exploits its physics engine wherever possible, giving you a crane-game claw to manipulate objects and enemies, and things like strong winds and underwater currents, map-orientation-changing rotating rooms, and laser-reflection puzzles. There are even segments where you must guide a rocket through a narrow, zig-zagging tunnel to hit an otherwise out-of-reach switch. The tools are varied and fun to use, though at least one, the shield, isn't actually necessary to complete the game. It also has some excellent, screen-filling bosses, which as per standard, test your ability to use a recently-acquired powerup. There are a handful of secret areas to find, which reward the player with concept art and short cutscenes that show the origins of the shadow creatures. I haven't tried the multiplayer modes, though, so I can't speak for them, but I enjoyed the singeplayer enough that I completed the other like, 7/8ths of the game in one sitting. This game's been out a while already, so if you haven't given it a try and you love games for the sake of fun and artistic value, you've been missing out. But if you're a serious tryhard, do yourself a favor and... don't be.			"

												As a fan of exploration, discovery, and avatar empowerment in video games, ITSP has everything that I could hope for. Equal parts Metroid, Aquaria, Solar Jetman, and Limbo, the sheer atmosphere of the game begs you to play for just a little more, just to see what's next. I need to emphasize the bosses in this game, wherein half the challenge and fun is figuring out what to do. If you like puzzles, arcade shooting, Metroidvania-style exploration, and beautiful landscapes, get this game. Its one of the best I've played this year.			"

Regardless of this technical bumps that has nothing to do with the product itself, have to say that this game is a must buy for sure.Some can caterorize ITSP it as a ""Metroidvania'' game, which is not far from the truth, but have to say that there is a vibe that makes this so different from other modern counterparts such Guacamelee, Dust, ShadowComples and so on...First it is that gorgeous and fluid art style, could say it looks like a moving cartoon but such discription is not going to make the game visual justice, have to play to see.Other detail from the game that make this tittle so different from the other tiitles, it is the complete lack of narration, there is no text or voice over explaining what is going on, apart from (gorgeous) animated cut scenes.I have finished this games over a weekend ( 6 hours) the dificult is always fare and constants with always new gadgets to unlock and new ways to deal with enemies and puzzles.Really worth the price.

												This game is fun, as well as having beautiful graphics and a great soundtrack. However, I don't think it has a lot of replay value. There are things off the beaten path for you to explore, but most of it is just, like, concept art or whatnot.			"

												I LOVE this game, the animation style and effort is astounding. The music comes in at the right time, giving a nice isolation felling. The bosses design is breathtaking, the controls are easy to get used to. However, not every game is perfect, you have at least 4 hours of gameplay untill you complete the entire game. There are 2 other minigames, which are entertaining, but it doesn't last forever. But if you like metrovania style game, give it a try. :)			"

												In this exploration/puzzle hybrid you play an alien scientist on a quest to purge an equally alien shadow presence which has perverted your sun and turned it into a shadow planet. The controls are exceptional and very smooth and the gameplay is demanding in some areas (such as shooting manually controlled rockets through a maze) and forgiving in others (you can generally bump into a lot of things without taking much damage). Most of the puzzles resemble a kind of fetch quest but the game keeps it interesting by giving you an expansive array of tools by which you can manipulate the environment and destroy enemies. Also the soundtrack has a song by Dimmu Borgir (Progenies of the Great Apocalypse)/Prague Philharmonic Orchestra for some reason, so that's neat.			"

												Space version of Aquaria basically, and just as delightfully strange. I found this quite entertaining to sit through with almost zero frustration with the mechanics or gameplay.You play an alien who's sent to fight corruption by some evil space beast by diving straight into the belly of it. Your little ship gains upgrades as you maul your way through its innards, making certain puzzles and enemies possible to defeat.The little claw tool is by far the most hilarious thing in the game.

												This game is a lot of fun than it seems. The art pulls your curiosity to see new things. The puzzles are not hard at all but need fast reaction to deal with enemies. Most of the enemies respawn so it's pointless to stay and kill them.The mechanics of the games is great; you need to defect bosses or collect other items/weapons to unable you to solve puzzles or advance to new area. Each area have a specific theme to it and the monsters designs suit it to. Its a tricky game but not hard, i died few times here and their but it was fun. It takes 7 and half hours to finish 95% and 8 hours if you want to a 100%. 8/10 And if the developers developed a new game am sure to follow it and try it for sure.			"

												Could have been better, but ultimately wasn't terrible. It was fun piloting the craft, and the abilities were cool. The soundtrack was nice and some puzzles were fun. Unfortunately there were too many puzzles and not enough fights. The boss fights are probably the best parts. You get a lot of abilities, but switching to them is a pain. You can only hotkey 4, and all of them are helpful. You have to hold a button and scroll around a wheel with the analog stick, and the system is very touchy. I could constantly try to switch to something and would hover over it with my analog stick but the game would give me the thing next to it. It lacked precision. It is also annoying because you will constantly have to change in the thick of things and holding a button and scrolling around a wheel with the analog stick and trying to remember what each symbol means (some look like they would be a different one, leading to mistakes choosing), so you sometimes die because of switching problems, since you need to be maneuvering, scrolling, and holding a button, and reading the symbols. Some people deepthroat the ""metroid"" style of having you go through a level where 1/3 you can't access, and then 5 hours later you can and you are supposed to walk back through the level just to get back to that part to use the item again. I constantly thought ""why not just put me in places I can utilize what I have, instead of forcing me to remember where at I saw each thing that required something else and knowing which used which item?"". It artificially inflates game length and who loves running back through parts you already beat to get to a certain part that takes 15 min to get to. People like it I guess because they feel cool like they solved a puzzle when they remember ""OHHHHH I'm so happy I remember I can use this back on the first level, I'm so smart!"", but I'm not stupid so I don't need to artificially feel like that. Insanely twisted shadow planet uses this but thankfully its usually just to go get art and little videos (there is no story and the videos are random little 10 second clips that don't make sense but I guess when you get all they are supposed to tell a story). It is annoying though that many of the spots have upgrades to your ship, and you need to collect multiple before you actually get to upgrade. This means the game is harder because my ship isn’t strong because I chose not to waste time. Another problem is that the analog sticks to direct abilities can be annoying, as they will constantly choose the wrong thing, and be imprecise, something commonly seen when trying to place something in a specific spot. The other big problem is common to exploration games. You are given little direction and half the time you think you can’t solve a puzzle you actually can but its because you didn’t know you could interact with a certain thing in the environment. The other times the destination marker will be right in front of you, but you have to go way back and a different direction to unlock something to open it. The combo of these last 2 things leads you to wander if you are missing something you didn’t know you could use because the game never told you, or because you have to find an alternate route. For bosses it is the same thing. I constantly didn’t know if I was hurting the boss, or how to beat them, then when looking it up you need to grab something and use it on this specific part then use another ability in a different spot. More straight forward and less gimmicky boss fights would have been better. There also was the occasional bug where I would place things correctly and the puzzle wouldn’t be solved, and then watch a walkthrough I saw I did it right and then I would have to die or redo it and it would work. A lot of times because you are in a big open level with tons of branching paths you get lost and don’t know the direction to go. There is a destination marker but once again it may not help as you have to go do other things before you actually can go to the destination. The physics are pretty good in the game. Overall not bad, but could have been better with more direction (where to go, how to interact with things that you are somehow supposed to know you can/ how they work, less puzzles, less gimmicky boss fights, less backtracking). 6.5/10.

												Overview:	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet puts you in control of a lone space ship that must fight of a mysterious force that has taken over the planet.  The gameplay is a mixture of mostly puzzle solving with some combat with hostile enemies mixed in.  As you progress through the game you gain more abilities which are required to solve the new puzzles that are presented.Pros:	Art:  The scenery wild. bizarre, and original.  A very unique world has been created here and is a pleasure to play through.	Variety:  New abilities are gained as you progress through the world as are new puzzles to solve which build on the previous mechanics.  Each puzzle feels fresh and original.	Mechanics: The world is very busy and blended nicely into the core gameplay.  The environment itself is the puzzle and you'll have to chain together all of your abilities to solve the puzzles.  Cons:	Length: This game is pretty short only offering about 4 hours gameplay.	Difficulty:  Puzzles are moderately difficult and won't provide much of a challenge but their also not so easy that you'll become bored.Conclusion:	There is pretty good production quality here and a very unique environment to move around in.  This is a great game if you need to kill some but can easily be beaten in a single session.  The whole appeal of this game is the story of your lone ship trying to save his world from an unknown enemy which masterfully unfolds as you progress through the game.Score: 8.0 / 10			"

												Super cute and adorable game, but requires WASD fine motor skills beyond my comfort zone. I wish I was better at this because the puzzles are as engaging as they are graphically compelling. If they ever come up with a difficulty slider for motor control, I would never leave this game ever.

												Great game but not worth 15$ imo. It's pretty linear for a Metroidvania style game as you always have a quest marker on your map that leads to the next boss. The weapons/tools are pretty neat but some of them you will use a lot less than others.There are checkpoints scattered around the map where you can respawn so that makes the game pretty forgiving but otherwise it's a fun game i recommend buying when it's on sale(like 5 dollars or less).

												As a fan of exploration, discovery, and avatar empowerment in video games, ITSP has everything that I could hope for. Equal parts Metroid, Aquaria, Solar Jetman, and Limbo, the sheer atmosphere of the game begs you to play for just a little more, just to see what's next. I need to emphasize the bosses in this game, wherein half the challenge and fun is figuring out what to do. If you like puzzles, arcade shooting, Metroidvania-style exploration, and beautiful landscapes, get this game. Its one of the best I've played this year.			"

												Had this game sitting in my collection for over a year, and only decided to play it on a whim, from the moment I started, I couldn't put it down. The concept is solid, you're a flying saucer navigating a planet in a loose linear fashion while putting together the planets backstory. The sound is full of ambiance and the gameplay is fun with a spot on learning curve. The animation is slick and fantastic. I sat here in my chair for almost 8 hours playing this game from start to finish wondering and practically kicking myself for not playing it sooner.			"

In Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet you contol a sopisticated little spaceship in a contrased, sidescrolling planet that has been invaded and intoxicated by shadow to a point where the flora, fauna and the planet itself can potentually harm you. It is your mission to rid the planet of this invading shadow using collectable and upgradeable gadets such as a claw, pulse gun, laser, drill and many more! With engaging action, shooting, puzzling, sidescrolling and strategic gameplay as well as a hord or randomly generated co-op missions I would certainly recommend this game to every type of gamer on Steam!

												Well, this game certainly hit me out of nowhere. I had grabbed Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet as the next title to play through on my ever-expanding list of “Games I Must Play,” and was very pleasantly surprised. The controls are tight, the visuals are very striking, and the sound design is very fitting. Overall, this is a very complete package, good for a few hours of fun. I’ve found that I greatly enjoy “Metroidvania” titles, and this game fits that descriptor perfectly. You progress linearly from point A to point B, collect a new power-up and defeat a boss, then use said power-up to continue on to the next area that was previously blocked. The game map is relatively small, and the game can be powered through in roughly four or five hours, but forward progression happens at a steady rate and you never feel slowed or frustrated with any given puzzle. There really isn’t much of a storyline – there’s no voice acting, and any story is relayed through orchestrated cutscenes that give you the bare-bones minimum that you need to know: you’re an alien, and your planet has been attacked by some type of strange mechano-orgranic virus that corrupts the environment’s flora and fauna against you. Your little alien character decides to do something about this, and from that point, you’re off and running. I had only expected to play this game for one quick playthrough, but the more I completed the story the more that I saw that I would be coming back to this title again in the future. Secret areas hide in plain sight and wait patiently for you to uncover the correct ability to retrieve them. The only gripe that I may have with this game is the fact that it is somewhat hard to backtrack to previously explored areas once you have traveled through them. This became an issue once I had defeated a boss, then accidentally progressed forward without picking up the power-up that they had left behind. Thankfully, it wound up not making a difference to the storyline for future puzzles, but it felt strange completing the game and having a gap in my ability wheel. At any rate, this game is recommended to anyone – the price point during sales is very cheap, and the show you get for the price of admission is a steal. Any fan of “Metroidvania” titles deserve to pick this game up without hesitation, as it’s a title that you’ll probably find yourself going back to a few more times just for kicks.			"

You are an alien driving your alien ship trying to defeat weird creatures coming from another planet.To accomplish that, you need to learn how to leverage different tools in different situations, which involves dealing with physics, heat, water, etc.Not a single word during the whole game, you need to understand things from symbols, behaviors and responses to those behaviors.

												Probably one of the best independent games I ever played. The quality and originality is amazing.  The game strongly reminds me of Metroid Prime and is just as fun.My only complaint is the game was too short and the final boss could be beaten using solely your plasma cannon (or whatever it's called).  Some of the powerups you collect just don't get used enough, which is disappointing considering how cool they are.If you're looking for a great game to spend a weekend, I'd highly recommend this.

												Insanely Twisted has aged pretty well since its release back in 2011. Utilizing a cross between 3D models and 2D animated sprites, you're given full reign to travel through a relatively small atmospheric world, full of deadly things that can't wait to make your acquaintence. It's an absorbing experience from start to finish, but it starts becoming clear before long that Insanely Twisted has a weaker second half.One of ITSP's draws is that it has a Metroid-styled upgrade system where as you explore the world you'll get new items that'll let you explore even more of the world. You get the first three in the first level, these three becoming your staples of your arsenal for the rest of the game. The following level has two upgrades (one optional) that brings you up to half of your item circle thing filled out. After a romp in the oceanic area levels begin getting shorter and more concentrated on the upgrades that are provided to you. Secrets are also easier to find as well. My reaction ended up being that ITSP rushed a little too quickly into things when it's set up in such a way that it could fit in another whole level.However, while the levels get a bit shorter, they get considerably harder. Every boss in the game is made up of some sort of puzzle, challenging how you think about things along with your hand-eye coordination.  They're also all difficult enough to be memorable all on their own without being too unfair (I say too because the last three bosses also have difficulty in the form of ""send all sorts of things at you and make it difficult to control yourself"".) On top of all that, ITSP also has two additional arcade-styled modes that you can play through: a survival mode and a randomized adventure, both multiplayer friendly and considerably more difficult than the main game, which is welcome if you found the game to be a bit simple. Overall, despite being a short game (I say this because it feels short, likely assisted by the fact that you start with the map filled out - though partially hidden - which is funny given that I like shorter games) it is enjoyable. Whatever critiques and complaints I have beyond that are just nitpicky, but still present enough to give this a ""wait for a sale"" or ""if you have money to burn"" recommendation. For a game that explores a similar concept but came out earlier while contrasting the feel of ITSP, look to PixelJunk Shooter.			"

												ITSP is a wonderful example of game made with style.Basically a Metroidvania, this game simply explodes of personality, sucking you up into his twisted world, his creepy creatures, and his crazy but functional logic.Exploration is rewarding, not just in terms of bonus and upgrades, but also as visual exploration.I personally loved the graphic style, especially the colors, but the crown jewel of this game are animations: smooth as mercury. Everything is animated, also the background and the vegetation, making you feel the world you're into, and when you meet a boss.... well...... i died because i was too concentrated on watching the awesome movements.Gameplay is a good mix of everything, just a little bit more oriented on exploration rather than fighting (but the bosses are incredible)Perhaps a little bit short and not much challenging, but it's an audiovisual festival. The devs did an excellent work in creating a world that breathe and pulse around you, simply begging to be explored.What are you waiting for?			"

												Awesome fun and full of variety 2d action platformer. You are a little alien ship trying to defend your planet from the invading mutating terror. In this you will have 9 different weapons which you will unlock as the game unfolds. Each weapon has a unique mechanic (typically obtained after each boss) which are very useful and varied. The levels (worlds) are faily long but overall do not bore you as there is enough challenge.Graphics, music, ambience are all top notch very fitting for the game, I loved it all. So for my only gripes with the game are: it's sometimes buggy (I had to restart because one of the tentacles got stuck and I needed it to chase me) and the lasers can be bit of a PITA to control but are fun once you get used to them.You like pew pew with a bit of brain twisting thrown in?

The story is simple: you (an alien) are tasked with exploring an incredibly hostile planet; making your way steadily to the center in the hopes that you can save your home world by destroying an alien infestation at it’s source. Like I said, simple. But, it was well done all the same.II – UI [8/10]The user interface in ITSP is intuitive and easy to master. HUD is almost non-existent, forcing you to really on visuals to assess your level of health. There is no reticle for aiming (which I wasn’t the biggest fan of, but whatever). The map was very user friendly, but can become cumbersome as there is no mini-map on screen. When you receive a new objective, a directional bubble points you in the right direction and off you go.III – Gameplay [10/10]There are three modes of play in ITSP. Firstly, there was the campaign. As I explained above, the story line is simple and there are no real side quests to speak of. You make your journey deeper and deeper into the hostile planet until you have accomplished your ultimate goal.One of my favorite aspects of the game was the research tool that your space craft is equipped with. You will use this tool the entire game to figure out how things work and to assist you in solving various puzzles. You point it at what needs scanning, scan it, and then pick the right tool for the job. I personally thought that this was a novel way of learning as you go and getting through the game.Combat is simple; just point and shoot (or saw, in a lot of cases). Each enemy has a certain weapon that is best against it, though you don’t strictly have to use that one weapon if you don’t want to. Why blow something up with a rocket when you can melt it with a laser beam or cut it in half with a gigantic saw blade? My thoughts exactly.The second game mode is called “Lantern Run”. While all the game modes are co-op, this one was definitely designed to be played co-op rather than alone. In this mode of play the player(s) have to drag a lantern (or multiple lanterns) as far into a cavern as they can go. All the while they are being chased by a huge alien monster. Every so far into the cavern, the player(s) must stop in an arena and fight respawning enemies until the big one catches up and breaks through the next wall for you. If all of the lanterns break, it’s game over.The third game mode is called “Shadow Hunters”. Again, this is another one that was designed for co-op. The player(s) must drag a bomb through a cavern that is teeming with enemies. The bomb has a timer that is always counting down, though it can be recharged at bomb recharge stations. If the bomb takes damage, the timer goes down faster. Every so far down the cavern, the player(s) will again be stopping in caverns to fight both regular enemies and boss enemies (hence the bomb you’re carrying).While all the modes of play were pretty fun, I particularly enjoyed the campaign best. Though, I didn’t have the chance to get much co-op time in.IV – Content [6/10]For as big of an in-game map as ITSP has, I was a bit disappointed by the amount of content. There are several tools that you’ll zoom around the planet collecting, but only one is upgradeable. In addition to this, while your hull armor is also upgradeable, there is no way to change what your craft looks like (even though other space crafts are selectable in the Shadow Hunters game mode).There were a lot of different enemy types though, although a seemed to be the same enemy with a new theme for each biome of the planet. The boss battles were all pretty fun, blending combat and puzzle solving into a chaotic good time.V – Visuals [10/10]The visuals of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet were splendid. It had a creepy, Tim Burton-esque feel and was almost endearing in a way. While the enemies were fascinating enough, it was the environments of the planet that were truly breathtaking and made exploring the hostile underground a real treat.VI – Audio [10/10]The music of ITSP was fantastic and always seem to kick in right when it would boost the immersion the most. The ambiance throughout the game was great and all the sound effects fit in to the game world perfectly.VII – Overall [8.3/10]Overall, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a genuinely fun game and is easily worth the full price tag. If you can get it on sale, great, if not, you won’t be disappointed anyway.			"

												ITSP is a wonderful example of game made with style.Basically a Metroidvania, this game simply explodes of personality, sucking you up into his twisted world, his creepy creatures, and his crazy but functional logic.Exploration is rewarding, not just in terms of bonus and upgrades, but also as visual exploration.I personally loved the graphic style, especially the colors, but the crown jewel of this game are animations: smooth as mercury. Everything is animated, also the background and the vegetation, making you feel the world you're into, and when you meet a boss.... well...... i died because i was too concentrated on watching the awesome movements.Gameplay is a good mix of everything, just a little bit more oriented on exploration rather than fighting (but the bosses are incredible)Perhaps a little bit short and not much challenging, but it's an audiovisual festival. The devs did an excellent work in creating a world that breathe and pulse around you, simply begging to be explored.What are you waiting for?			"

												ITSP feels sort of like a Metroid-lite twin-stick space shooter that features a blend of combat, puzzles, and exploration. While the game does combat quite nicely for the most part, it struggles in the other two areas. Puzzles are usually interesting yet don't provide much of a challenge. And despite the map being so massive, there's a lot of backtracking and perhaps too much linearity over the course of the campaign.In spite of these issues, ITSP is still a fun experience. Its best accomplishment is creating a wonderful world that oozes atmosphere through its eerie ambient sounds and a colorful animation style that's used to create some beautiful, creepy and varied environments. There's a good variety of ship upgrades, although switching between them on a gamepad can be clunky. The main campaign is pretty short but I felt that was much more preferable to dragging on for too long. And while the puzzle-solving isn't a strong point, the combat portions of the game are fun thanks to the simplified controls and bizarre enemies/bosses.While far from perfect, ITSP is a solid enough game to warrant a discounted purchase. A flawed yet atmospheric and beautiful space shooter that features huge and diverse locations and some solid twin-stick combat.			"

												Space version of Aquaria basically, and just as delightfully strange. I found this quite entertaining to sit through with almost zero frustration with the mechanics or gameplay.You play an alien who's sent to fight corruption by some evil space beast by diving straight into the belly of it. Your little ship gains upgrades as you maul your way through its innards, making certain puzzles and enemies possible to defeat.The little claw tool is by far the most hilarious thing in the game.

												I love unique art direction in games. A couple that come to mind are Limbo and the recent Rayman games. I still need solid mechanics, but a unique sense of style can elevate an otherwise solid but unexceptional game to something special. Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a perfect example. It's a solid ​Metroidvania game with a decent-size map, a nice variety of tools and weapons, and some clever puzzles and boss fights. The movement of the ship and the physics of the environment are also exceptionally well implemented. None of it is groundbreaking, but not every game has to be revolutionary. It does what it does very well, and with flawless design in both UI design and art direction.			"

												In this exploration/puzzle hybrid you play an alien scientist on a quest to purge an equally alien shadow presence which has perverted your sun and turned it into a shadow planet. The controls are exceptional and very smooth and the gameplay is demanding in some areas (such as shooting manually controlled rockets through a maze) and forgiving in others (you can generally bump into a lot of things without taking much damage). Most of the puzzles resemble a kind of fetch quest but the game keeps it interesting by giving you an expansive array of tools by which you can manipulate the environment and destroy enemies. Also the soundtrack has a song by Dimmu Borgir (Progenies of the Great Apocalypse)/Prague Philharmonic Orchestra for some reason, so that's neat.			"

In Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet you contol a sopisticated little spaceship in a contrased, sidescrolling planet that has been invaded and intoxicated by shadow to a point where the flora, fauna and the planet itself can potentually harm you. It is your mission to rid the planet of this invading shadow using collectable and upgradeable gadets such as a claw, pulse gun, laser, drill and many more! With engaging action, shooting, puzzling, sidescrolling and strategic gameplay as well as a hord or randomly generated co-op missions I would certainly recommend this game to every type of gamer on Steam!

												ITSP (Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, for brevity's sake) is what essentially amounts to a metroidvania-esque game, but with a more... ""free"" approach in terms of the movement. There's still the whole deal of finding upgrades to your gear (mainly your standard gun and defense), but you can also find some lore and extra stuff that adds to concept art. While those aren't always worthwhile, it's still a nice little addition that can make getting 100% completion either fun or annoying.What's really nice about the game, is that the overall aesthestic has a very simplistic look, and it honestly feels 2D... up until you get to certain later parts and then you realize that there's actually a surprisingly large amount of 3D elements to the game; the artstyle manages to hide this fact rather well. It makes for a nice touch that quite a bit to the overall presentation, and actually works really well here.You basically go through each major section of the game, finding new abilities, gaining access to new areas, and taking down 4 major bosses throughout the game, alongside a few mini-bosses for good measure. Each one generally requires using an ability that was either recently acquired, or a combination of mechanics you've started getting used to. They all work really well, and generally allow for a pretty well thought out battle. There's also a surprisingly generous amount of checkpoints, but given the surprsing difficulty of the game at times, it's a nice touch.A rather short game, but if you want to try and get everything, some puzzles take a little bit to figure out, but overall you could probably finish this in about 5-6 hours if you felt like it.

												Got the game from Humble Bundle. Decided to play it because of its nice, twisted looking atmosphere. I don't regret it one bit.It is basicly about this individual alien, witnessing the corruption brought upon to his homeworld and star system, affecting all local life by an offworld organic source and decides to travel to system's sun and save his little planet.Throughout the game you travel  in your alien being's signature hovering craft, chapter to chapter each with its distinct atmosphere, find some weapons to fight off all kinds of enemies and try to reach the core of the sun. It includes vast maps with a lot of space to explore filled enemy minions as well as some boss monsters/mechas and really nice puzzles.By far the best thing about this game has, to me, is each chapter's highly distinctive atmosphere and playstyle. The mechanical level includes a industrial, steampunk, clockwork theme as electrical level creates a feeling of traveling inside a huge dark derelict alien computer machine.If you like indie games with creative, dark, captivating theme you will never forget this game once you play it. Good job Shadow Planet!			"

												Awesome fun and full of variety 2d action platformer. You are a little alien ship trying to defend your planet from the invading mutating terror. In this you will have 9 different weapons which you will unlock as the game unfolds. Each weapon has a unique mechanic (typically obtained after each boss) which are very useful and varied. The levels (worlds) are faily long but overall do not bore you as there is enough challenge.Graphics, music, ambience are all top notch very fitting for the game, I loved it all. So for my only gripes with the game are: it's sometimes buggy (I had to restart because one of the tentacles got stuck and I needed it to chase me) and the lasers can be bit of a PITA to control but are fun once you get used to them.You like pew pew with a bit of brain twisting thrown in?

												Probably one of the best independent games I ever played. The quality and originality is amazing.  The game strongly reminds me of Metroid Prime and is just as fun.My only complaint is the game was too short and the final boss could be beaten using solely your plasma cannon (or whatever it's called).  Some of the powerups you collect just don't get used enough, which is disappointing considering how cool they are.If you're looking for a great game to spend a weekend, I'd highly recommend this.

												Insanely Twisted has aged pretty well since its release back in 2011. Utilizing a cross between 3D models and 2D animated sprites, you're given full reign to travel through a relatively small atmospheric world, full of deadly things that can't wait to make your acquaintence. It's an absorbing experience from start to finish, but it starts becoming clear before long that Insanely Twisted has a weaker second half.One of ITSP's draws is that it has a Metroid-styled upgrade system where as you explore the world you'll get new items that'll let you explore even more of the world. You get the first three in the first level, these three becoming your staples of your arsenal for the rest of the game. The following level has two upgrades (one optional) that brings you up to half of your item circle thing filled out. After a romp in the oceanic area levels begin getting shorter and more concentrated on the upgrades that are provided to you. Secrets are also easier to find as well. My reaction ended up being that ITSP rushed a little too quickly into things when it's set up in such a way that it could fit in another whole level.However, while the levels get a bit shorter, they get considerably harder. Every boss in the game is made up of some sort of puzzle, challenging how you think about things along with your hand-eye coordination.  They're also all difficult enough to be memorable all on their own without being too unfair (I say too because the last three bosses also have difficulty in the form of ""send all sorts of things at you and make it difficult to control yourself"".) On top of all that, ITSP also has two additional arcade-styled modes that you can play through: a survival mode and a randomized adventure, both multiplayer friendly and considerably more difficult than the main game, which is welcome if you found the game to be a bit simple. Overall, despite being a short game (I say this because it feels short, likely assisted by the fact that you start with the map filled out - though partially hidden - which is funny given that I like shorter games) it is enjoyable. Whatever critiques and complaints I have beyond that are just nitpicky, but still present enough to give this a ""wait for a sale"" or ""if you have money to burn"" recommendation. For a game that explores a similar concept but came out earlier while contrasting the feel of ITSP, look to PixelJunk Shooter.			"

												As a fan of exploration, discovery, and avatar empowerment in video games, ITSP has everything that I could hope for. Equal parts Metroid, Aquaria, Solar Jetman, and Limbo, the sheer atmosphere of the game begs you to play for just a little more, just to see what's next. I need to emphasize the bosses in this game, wherein half the challenge and fun is figuring out what to do.

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a ""metroidvania"" twin-stick shooter with an emphasis on environmental puzzles.  The game looks great and has a ambient, foreboding soundtrack that sets the mood well.  Simply getting around the environment is fun and the level design is quite good; there's enough variation in the tunnels you're going through that it's easy to develop a map in your head, but never so difficult you get lost or hung up frequently.  The several zones all have a very distinct look and feel and offer unique challenges.The game is fun; it's a little short – I beat the game 100% in a little under 6 hours – but for the right price is a good deal for the money.  I do wish the bosses were a little bit harder...the only reason I died on them was simply because I didn't know what to do; as soon as I did they almost became pushovers.For the size and scope it's aiming for, ITSP executes very well. Other than one zone that has you fumbling around in the dark (for all of about 5 minutes), I never got frustrated and enjoyed pushing forward, exploring and seeing what's around the next corner.Word of advice, though: if you're aiming to get all the collectables, scour as you go.  There's no way of seeing their location on the map, so it can be quite difficult to find things later on when the whole map is uncovered and you don't remember where you did or didn't pick them up.  I don't think it would work well to put the locations of them on the map, but it would have been nice if the developer added icons for the ones you had picked up so you would know where not to look.Anyways, all around a good, quick and fun game.

												I've never really cared about the music in games, but the music in this game sens shivers up my spine. I've played less than an hour, but the intro was incredible. This usually wouldn't be my kind of game. I'm not a huge fan of artsy, indie style games.			"

												Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a ""metroidvania"" twin-stick shooter with an emphasis on environmental puzzles.  The game looks great and has a ambient, foreboding soundtrack that sets the mood well.  Simply getting around the environment is fun and the level design is quite good; there's enough variation in the tunnels you're going through that it's easy to develop a map in your head, but never so difficult you get lost or hung up frequently.  The several zones all have a very distinct look and feel and offer unique challenges.The game is fun; it's a little short – I beat the game 100% in a little under 6 hours – but for the right price is a good deal for the money.  I do wish the bosses were a little bit harder...the only reason I died on them was simply because I didn't know what to do; as soon as I did they almost became pushovers.For the size and scope it's aiming for, ITSP executes very well. Other than one zone that has you fumbling around in the dark (for all of about 5 minutes), I never got frustrated and enjoyed pushing forward, exploring and seeing what's around the next corner.Word of advice, though: if you're aiming to get all the collectables, scour as you go.  There's no way of seeing their location on the map, so it can be quite difficult to find things later on when the whole map is uncovered and you don't remember where you did or didn't pick them up.  I don't think it would work well to put the locations of them on the map, but it would have been nice if the developer added icons for the ones you had picked up so you would know where not to look.Anyways, all around a good, quick and fun game.

												While this game is quite easy, it was very fun to  play. I took real pleasure to explore the world and find all upgrades and secrets. The various tools are well thought and the boss are just enough tougth to give a small challenge in an otherwise easy game.I loved this casual arcade game where you incarn a little alien in its flying saucer fighting against a evil planet.

												You control a space craft in this Metroidvania with amazing art direction. The world has been overtaken by an evil essence which you must purge from inside your homeworld. The areas are unique and you gain powerups regularly which unlock other areas. There are lot of collectibles to attempt to find, some which give you bonuses to damage or health, some unlock back story. It is a quick game, you can 100% the map in 8 hours, I did not find all of the collectibles however. There is two cooperative modes included. One is an arcade mode and the other is a cooperative mini campaign set after the main campaign. I could not play either, they are very difficult without additional players. PROS:-Beautiful world-Hidden powers to discover in Metroidvania style gameplayCONS:-Short-Coop/Multiplayer not active, several year old game.  "

												This game is essentially a twin-stick puzzle-shooter metroidvania type game, more puzzle than shooter.  It does this pretty well, with a good array of 8 powers and not-too-many collectibles to find.  The game uses GFWL and has two co-op modes, sadly neither of which are campaigns.  The single-player campaign is about 5 hours long.I enjoyed this game.  It had a good aesthetic, good mechanics as well.  Controls were functional and I have no real critique of the game except that one power (shield) is essentially useless, and the last boss is in fact quite underwhelming.  Music was enjoyable as well.  Also, I wouldn't go so far as to call the shadow planet 'insaely' twisted, just plain twisted is good enough (lol).			"

												A delightful, but short metroidvania with good use of tools and abilities. Bosses are fun and the highlight of the experience. My biggest complaint is that exploration and discovery is often rewarded with concept art unlocks; moreso than attack/defense upgrades.Note: The developers have removed GFWL :)			"

												Short and fun Metroidvania with an awesome art style. Had a bit of trouble with the Steam Controller on this one, but it was a blast to play. The different weapons are fun to play around with, the onboard scanner tool makes sure you're never totally lost but the puzzles still manage to be challenging, and again, the game looks just plain awesome. Definitely recommend it to anyone with a love for trippy sci-fi visuals or Metroidvanias.			"

												This game oozes with style, and the gameplay evokes classic Metroid.The campaign is really short, though (around 9 hours) and doesn't offer much in the way of replayability. Rarely anyone online for the online cooperative modes, and even if you find someone, Games for Windows Live guarantees that it will be an unpleasant experience.Still, the single player campaign is worth your time, but wait for this game to be on a -75% sale before you get it.

												Summary: I've only played the Co-Op Specific Content in this game yet, but it was something unique, fun, and challenging enough to come back to again. We dragged a bomb around a very dark, alien world, defending it from traps, enemies, and a deadly environment full of very lovecraftian monstrosities. We liked it. Pros:+ Very appealing visuals: dark, creepy, but always keeping the screen ""clean"" for visual clarity+ Unique mechanics+ Fun co-operative mode that actually feels co-operative+ Quick to learn+ Excellent controller support+ Good for couch play, works with Steam LinkCons:- The main campaign isn't co-operative- Might get repetitive after awhile, I haven't played long enough to note it yet though			"

												Went into this game just wanting it off my backlog. Went out of it feeling like I found a gem. I'm not a huge fan of Metroidvania games but this was very accessible. The puzzles made me stop and think but I never got bogged down. The challenges felt challenging without being frustrating. I'd even go so far as to say that the bosses were the best fights I've had in a game so far as they forced you to be creative and use your tools rather than just tapping the fire button while dodging attacks. The worlds were distinct and memorable, the upgrades/new tools never stopped being useful and I enjoyed that one of the tools (first one you get iirc) acts as a hint system for getting past puzzles or showing the best weapon to use on an enemy. The only problem I had with this game was the camera wouldn't always move where I wanted to go or as fast as I wanted to move but I only cursed at it a couple of times throughout the whole game. It was paced well (although a little slow at the beginning) and the game lasted only as long as it needed to. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Just watch out for the squid that tries to take away your electonic whatsit on the last world. Bad squid! MY electronic thingy!			"

Video review:


YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet 

			Views: 13		

			We check out a bit older of a game that I've had for a while. Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a good game that is marred by a short experience coupled with somewhat undeveloped gameplay.		

Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet at first appears to be a standard twin stick shooter, but sets itself apart by experimenting with perspective alteration and its focus on environmental puzzles. The game falls short in its narrative (which is a bit more complicated, I go more in depth in my video) and its overall length. The shortness of the game, 5 hours for a completed campaign) doesn't give enough time for the different puzzle elements to build upon themselves.For a more in-depth review, see the video above.			"
