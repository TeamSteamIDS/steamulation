												Buy the original rather than this version! Simply put I compared this version with the original version which is available to watch on a YouTube walkthrough, and it seems that more than half of the dialogue is cut out in the ""director’s cut"". Not only that but many of the interactive options throughout the game are also cut, unless they are directly involved in progressing the games story.  I guess the aim was to streamline the game or move the story along more quickly, but by cutting out much of the dialogue and gameplay they have inadvertently cut out most of the charm and humour that I experienced when playing the original game. Would definitely recommend finding the original rather than this version, I brought this as part of a trilogy so just hoping the other two games haven't been butchered as well!			"

YouTube™ Video: Broken Sword 1: Shadow of Templars Review 

			Views: 305		

			This is Review out of Broken Sword 1 or also known as Broken Sword Shadow of Templars Directors Cut. It's most part spoiler free review since i felt there is no point touching the story too much...		

Old School Point & Click ActionGreat old-school point & click adventure game. While graphics and resolution settings migh be outdated, good stories never get old. The Directors Cut gives you bit more content than the original version of the game also the layout is rather good. There were some issues with the game still like Hintbook being glitched and saving system not saving the actual points but rather close to that. The game offers around ~12h of gameplay, awesome corky dialogue, great story and fun times			"

												Back in 1997 I had just a handful of games installed on my first PC. Broken Sword was one of them and therefor it brings a lot of good childhood memories. For a kid this game is very hard to beat and I remember how when I got stuck and didn't know what to do, I would ride on my bike to the nearest store and open a games magazine to read real quick a walkthrough for the part where I was stuck (no internet back then for me haha). Fun fact: At the time I lived in Germany and the Germans translated the title of this game as ""Baphomets Fluch"" (Baphomets Curse), which makes sense because of the game's story, but when ""Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror"" came out, the Germans called it ""Baphomets Fluch 2: Die Spiegel der Finsternis"", which doesn't make sense since ""Baphomets Curse"" is not part of the story anymore. It's like imagine the title of the second Indiana Jones movie would be ""Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Temple of Doom"".

""Paris in the Fall. The last months of the year and the end of the millennium. The city holds many memories for me; of cafés, or music, of love and of death."" - George StobbartHere is the beginning of Revolution Software's iconic adventure game series, starting its journey in 1996: Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars. Has it really been 20 years? Wow, now I feel really old. Yet, this is not the original game. This is the director's cut version of the '96 original developed as an adaptation to handhold series, later ported into iOS and Android, eventually getting ported to PC again. Even though, it might be considered a lesser version of the original for many reasons that I will later share in the review, it is a marvelous and memorable adventure game title and a must for everyone who enjoys the genre.As a major change to the original version, the game begins with Nicole Collard, satirical, ambitious and crafty photo-journalist of La Liberté, making a research about a costume killer whose been targeting various VIPs around the world, instead of our actual protagonist, George Stobbart, an American tourist and lawyer visiting Paris for the sole reason of having a vacation. Whatever the pace of the start would be, they are soon to cross roads as the café George's been visiting at the time blows up, killing Nico's informant and ruining George's vacation. From that point onwards, their interests get intertwined and together, they start a long journey over the globe tracking the killer, following obscure leads from medieval ages signifying a grand conspiracy about Templar Knights and Hashashins.See, Broken Sword series was dabbling with Templars and Assassins before it was cool! Well, if we are to go back to the story, one heart-breaking change for me was the introduction. The original game starts with George's iconic narrative and café blowing, Nico later showing up as part of the narrative pace. Here in Director's Cut version, Nico is introduced as a playable character with a side story and the game starts with her investigation. I have to say that Nico's side story, even though enjoyable, feels like a sore thumb in the original narrative. You see, that part was never intended to be there to begin with. It slows the pace of the original story by introducing completely unrelated information to the main story. Plus, those parts are presented in a drastically different graphics quality compared to the original game. It just doesn't fit.The narrative of the game, characters and anecdotal encounters are all marvelously funny and witty with a history buff on the foreground. The game is one of the early examples of humor dominated settings in adventure games. All characters are lovable eccentrics with situational comedy elements. Sadly, I have to note that Director's Cut version actually ""cuts"" dialogue and animation content from the original game, somewhat downgrading the flow and the atmosphere of the whole story. It is not incredibly noticeable if you haven't played the original first, but it is there.As for the display quality, I have already stated that there is a clash between the original parts and the newly added story part. Graphics look like hand-drawn, animated cartoons with lovely exaggerations. One other down side of the Director's Cut is that there are truckload of missing character animations. They seem weirdly idle this way. During dialogues, close-ups of characters are added to the top of the screen. The animation style for those are a bit questionable too, if you ask me. Music is just as lovely as always though. The original soundtrack is heavily recommended for your enjoyment.For the gameplay, it is your quite basic point and click adventure. You collect items, talk to people about on-goings, solve puzzles etc. Here again, I have to note some more distasteful changes that Director's Cut version introduces. Firstly, your pointer shines with a blue circle whenever it is near a point of interest, completely killing investigative expectation of the game. It's like following a series of arrows or a giant plate that says ""this way"" from the start 'till the end. It is demeaningly simplified. Animations of puzzles - and their total count actually - are changed also. They are downright simple with no downsides to lookout for. One other change that has broken my heart was the newly introduced inability to die. Whatever you do or say, George will prevail now. In the original version, there would be certain choices that could get you killed. Now, George refuses to do said actions to begin with. So long for cause-consequence there.By the end, can I actually recommend this game? Sure, without skipping a heartbeat. I can only strongly advise for you to play the original version - which can be reached via GOG, rather than this watered down version called as Director's Cut. It is a marvelous little story with memorable characters, an adventurous build and anecdotal history with conspiracy theories. Also a part of computer adventure genre history at this point. It is still as fresh and lovely as the first time around. What else do you need from an adventure game anyhow?UPDATE: Original version of the game is added to the Steam now, as a downloadable DLC for this Director's Cut version. Enjoy!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Broken Sword: Director’s Cut does a lot of the little things wrong. Back in 1996, the player was thrown out into a graphic noir world very much like our own, one brimming over with unique personalities who don’t think of themselves as cogs in a giant machine, but people getting suitably annoyed at the pushy American who won’t stop showing people the soiled tissue he found in the sewers and asking them if it means anything to them. Now updated, a lot of the dialogue options are cut in an attempt to streamline the adventure, making the Templar mysteries a significantly greater focus point, but in doing so, it robs the title of so much of its former wealth. Interactive hotspots are not only slashed in half, but are made instantly visible, taking away the nagging frustration of room-sweeping with your mouse to find them yourself, but also highlighting just how much the new version wants to hold your hand. Including an in-game hint system is understandable: a stuck player only needs visit numerous online walkthroughs should they decide coping with their frustration early is better than the cerebral rewards of working through a puzzle, but gone also are the numerous instances where George could make a fatal mistake. Leave an exclusive French hotel with an important and newly-discovered clue, and fail to remember the pair of Italian gangsters hanging around the entrance, and the last thing you’ll remember before being gifted a pair of concrete shoes and invited for a swim is an aggressive frisking and an insincere goodbye. Now, try and leave through the same door, and George will warn you that it’s not a good idea. Then tells you exactly why!Full review -- http://www.honestgamers.com/9033/pc/broken-sword-directors-cut/review.html "

												Do NOT buy this. This is not what Broken Sword should be like. This director's cut came out in 2009 and has LESS animation than the old 90s version.Less dialogues.Less items.Less riddles.Less cutscenes.Less characters to speak to.More bugs.The added storyline is USELESS and ends suddenly in the middle of the game.If you want to play Broken Sword, the good one, play the original version not this Broken Sword: Ubisoft Edition.

												I love Broken Sword. It's one of my favorite adventure games of all time, I grew up with it. Hearing about an update to one of my favorite games made me weary but I remained optimistic. Naturally, I tried to like it. But I just can't.This revision completely butchered the original on so many levels; it's a disgrace. I am majorly disappointed with how this was handled. The new arc doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the table (especially if you never played the original before, newcomers get nothing out of this new story) and seems unnecessarily tacked on. It explores a side story that is negligible in the greater context and waters down the impact of the original story's writing and pacing immensely. The new environments, icons and character models look really out of place when displayed right next to their by now 17 year old assets which in my opinion negatively impacts the immersion and cohesiveness: the clashing art styles and different asset qualities make the game feel terribly stitched together. The shoddy new UI (which is optimized for touchscreen devices; use of a cursor feels awkward which is a disaster considering the original is a Point & Click classic), automatically displayed points of interaction as well as the help system make the game unbearable when you are familiar with the original. Revolution went to the extremes with the handholding which is terribly annoying: everything is pointed out to you and instantly made visible. You never feel taken seriously as a player and it's almost as if the game doesn't want or need your skills to be solved. It rather points at everything with a flashy sign as if you were near-blind.Sadly, Revolution took the phrase Directors 'Cut' a bit too literally. Removed were details like waving flags, idle animations and ambient sounds but also integral parts of the game like dialogue and entire scenes. The cut narrative aspects break the game's story and writing, which was already impaired by the new sidestory. The missing details destroy the charm the original used to have, the charm that made players fall in love this game. This content was removed for absolutely no logical reason and is a decision of the developer I can't understand or get behind. Who thought this was a good idea? Cutting parts of your story doesn't do the game's pacing any favors whatsoever.The most jarring of all the omissions however is that you can't die. This is absolute nonsense. The original version of Broken Sword had a ton of situations where wrong decisions could get you killed (Video Contains Spoilers). Presumably, this was done in order to save the player from losing too much or all of their progress. Removing this aspect however, eliminates incredibly much suspense and is a case of game design decisions meant to appeal to a contemporary audience causing the loss of a lot of suspense, gameplay, atmosphere and ultimately enjoyment for the player.If you are curious about the extent of the changes, you can find some of them here: http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=254238Regardless whether you experienced the original or not, use ScummVM to play the original release if you can obtain it (Or purchase it via GOG where you will receive both versions with one purchase) and let this abomination rot in the store. You will get a more polished, detailed and cohesive gameplay experience out of it.Who knows what Charles Cecil and Revolution were thinking. But it certainly wasn't anything good.--EDIT: Fixed a few typos and revised wording.--Please note that I previously purchased this version of the game outside of Steam (iOS) and completed it, the playtime recorded by Steam is not indicative of my total experience with the Director's Cut version.

												Before we get into this let me just say that I love Broken Sword. The original Broken Sword. I have probably completed it more times than I have other games in my library. I especially go back to it now and again to experience its world, its characters and its humour.So you can imagine my excitement when finding this ""Directors Cut"" edition on Steam.Unfortunately I simply could never recommend this version to anyone who wishes to experience Broken Sword and see what all the fuss was about back in the day.If you really want to play Broken Sword nowadays, there is a ""Broken Sword Trilogy"" DVD-based package that you can buy on Amazon or EBay (ie. a non-Steam release) and it includes a perfect working version of the actual original Broken Sword and it will work with modern hardware and OS. So go for that.As for the problems with this version? There are so many to talk about...- Missing dialogue which affects the humour and even misses vital plot points.- MIssing animations (NPC characters no longer have a talking animation, the flags no longer flutter in the breeze at the Hotel Ubu).- Missing interactions with certain objects throughout the game (such as just about everything in the museum, you can't read the patients medical records in the hospital, you can't read the historical information on the boards at Montfaucon).- Missing cut scenes such as when you first enter the castle in Ireland.- Missing interactions with entire characters in some locations (such as the guy in the middle bed in the hospital).- Sound glitches whereby I heard Lady Piermonts piano playing in other random locations (amongst other problems).- A clear difference in recording quality between the new dialogue and the old dialogue (especially noticeable with a headset).- The additional scenario as Nico offers nothing to the game as a whole and then just abruptly ends and is gone.- Some puzzles have been simplified to a ridiculously simple level (such as the goat puzzle).- The game is now 100% linear - you can't go to Montfaucon before completing the hospital section, for example.- The diary is a pointless addition and the text within it is far too basic - almost childishly written. It also somehow knows vital plot-related information before these elements have been revealed through dialogue.All in all if you want to rediscover Broken Sword for even play it for the very first time - I simply could never recommend this version of the game. Find a working copy of the original and play that. It's a far superior experience and you won't be missing out on so much material either.			"

PROS:+ great story telling+ atmosphere of an adventure+ fun puzzles+ no clumsy & ugly 3D graphics (like in BS3 & BS4)+ good voice acting+ most compatibility issues fixed in Remastered version+ added background story and new missions for NicoleCONS:- some puzzles make less sense- the damn goat- hints added by the Remastered version take a bit from the challengeComment:I first played this game over a decade ago. I got it along with BS2. The game felt relaxing and I really enjoyed that time. But I never finished it up until now. Why? Because I got stuck at the infamous goat sequence. The Remastered version apart from fixing the compatibility issues the game had also makes the goat sequence better. So yes, this Remastered edition is great. The original is sort of a classic among point&click adventure games. And you can see why. The writing is great, the story interesting and the characters likable. I can see that the game is a bit easier now with the reworked UI and better hints. I played the original version and I see how it takes a bit of the challenge out. But that in my opinion is not a bad thing here. Overall an excellent game which I highly recommend to all fans of the point&click genre.			"

												What can i say. I first played Broken Sword when i was around 12 on the PSone. From the moment i started, i couldnt stop playing. The story, characters, whole atmosphere kept me playing and coming back for me. The puzzles within the game are great and range from all difficulties. Sometimes of course you get frustrated because you trying to figure out this puzzle and in no damn way you can make it work. BUT, when you finally do get through, a sense of achievement and satisfaction comes through that gets your back into the groove again.The story itself is one big buildup from the start to finish with interacting with interesting characters all over.The art style is great aswell, even though its quite dated now, it still brings a classic feel towards it and really dosnt dampen the gameplay itself like other titles might.Having the game to play through again brings back the great feeling i had when i was young. Recommend this classic to everyone who is looking for a point and click. "

												Years before Dan Brown's Da Vinci's Code made headlines for its religious subject, there was another story that had a similar setting even starting in Paris and ending in Scotland.This gem was Broken Sword: The shadow of the templars a point and click adventure game released 1996 and re-released in 2010 for the PC with more content as Director's Cut.First I'll talk about the main game and after I will talk about the director's cut.The game begins in Paris where our main character George Stobbart is enjoying his vacations.Just as he drinks his coffee and enjoying the Parisian autumn two people enter the Caffe: a man with a briefcase who stops to order a coffee and after a short time a clown with a musical instrument.The clown takes the mans briefcase and leaves his instrument which is revealed to be a bomb which goes off and that's how the game begins.The whole story is about George's quest to find the costume killer, and as the plot advances we find out the whole story arc is about the conflict between Templars and Assassins and the templars called here Neo-Templars are the bad guys(sounds familiar? :) ).Besides Paris, other places you get to visit are Scotland(twice), Spain and Siria, each with its own feel and colorful characters which make this a game a joy to play even after you finished it once.The game has hand-drawn animations which look gorgeous, the voice acting is solid and the music works very well with the whole game.The original game has from me a 10/10 rating, I find no issue with it, its a great adventure game with great characters and a good story.Now about the director's cut, after the success of the first game the game got 4 more sequels: Broken Sword The Smoking Mirror, Broken Sword The Sleeping Dragon, Broken Sword The Angel of Death and recently Broken Sword The Serpents Curse.Between Broken Sword 4 and 5, the first 2 games The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror where re-released with more content and improvements.The director's cut of Broken Sword starts with Nicole Collard, not with George a day before the bombing of the caffe and is essentially a prologue setting up the main story.The new content is some levels with Nico where we find more about her past.As the main game starts the first problem appears:the sound quality,the new recordings really stand out against the old ones from the main game,and also some of the character designs look worse than the main game which is weird one good example is when the character visits a hotel in Paris and there is one character reading a newspaper in a armchair, for some reason his outline was removed he looks like a black mass of animation.Also, they changed the interface and added dialogue pics at the top corner of the screen with the faces of the characters with which you hold a conversation.rating for the director's cut: 8/10 the new content is good, but the technical problems really drag down the score, they could have remastered it better, luckily they remastered the second game perfectly and the problems here are not present.

												A valiant attempt at updating a classic, but sadly problematic. I loved this game back in the mid-90s, and couldn't wait to play the new, updated version. But, while they flesh out the character of Nico and expand on her background and personal stake in the investigation (an unnecessary change, but fun), they also seem to have...er...forgotten scenes from the original game. Important scenes. Scenes that move the plot along, explain details of the narrative, etc. Were they omitted? Cut for time? Bugged? EG: In the original, George steps into a hidden alcove in Ireland, and discovers an important clue -- a portrait with an image and a name. But in the Director's Cut George steps into the alcove and then it suddenly cuts back to Nico in Paris; she engages in her own new bit of investigation for a while (completely tangential to the main narrative), and George reappears in Paris not 5 minutes later with only a note in his journal about what he found in the alcove. Why was this changed? What is the purpose of it? They removed a scene CRUCIAL to the main narrative just so they could shoehorn in a mildly interesting superfluous side-story. That could have made a certain narrative sense, it's true, but they didn't alter anything George says or thinks after the scene was cut; he then refers to what he apparently saw as though the player/audience should already have seen it for themselves. Problems like this abound, as do audio hiccoughs -- like when one character is supposed to be speaking, but for no reason the voice-actor of the person they're speaking to is reading their dialogue, complete with the wrong accent and gender! It's bizarre! Did I get some sort of April Fool's Day edition of the game?!?In fact, the more I look at the art and advertising for this updated version, you'd think George was the shoehorned in side-character! All the focus is on Nico, she begins the game, her personal side-narrative takes precedence over the main investigation, and George just comes across as a bumblin' sidekick. It's surreal -- like an alternate universe version of the game I loved. Why not release a separate game or expansion featuring all this new Nico-centric material? It would have saved them the effort of cutting out the old scenes and bugging the audio and video of the game...In any event, i cannot in good conscience recommend the Director's Cut. The Nico side-stories help pad out the game, but come at too high a cost.PS: This game also perpetuates the myth that the Templars were idol-worshipping pagans devoted to Baphomet, a legend which (like ""Baphomet"") was created during the waves of persecution & torture instituted by the French with papal approval in the 14th century C.E. / A.D. This detail will drive historians and even casual enthusiasts crazy, and miseducate those ignorant of the Templars' history and the Crusades, but it doesn't ruin the game itself. Just be forewarned!			"

												9.2/10 - After 20 Years Still One of the Best Point and Click Masterpieces!I didn't play this game in 1997; but nearing 2007 it’s still amazing! I was blown away by the length, depth and especially the fully voiced, comedic 12 hour campaign! The help system is pretty extensive and greatly appreciated; with such a fun campaign it's a pity to stop due to getting stuck on something easy. You take the role of Nico, a French photo-journalist and George a California native that has a habit of getting into trouble. While on Holiday the two meet up in an unlikely circumstance and end up on a journey that spans the globe! Will the pair be able to uncover the treasure or succumb to the countless enemies and perilous obstacles in their way?Overall, this game has held up amazingly over the years. Definitely worth the $6!

												The Good:+ Because of the cartoonish graphics, they surprisingly hold up very well for such an old game, which once again proves  good art style is timeless. You just don't see cartoonish animations in many games anymore so it was very refreshing to see.+ For the most part the puzzles are well designed  given the situation although there were a few times when the puzzles made no sense+ The game provides a hint system to help you if you ever get stuck although it becomes too easy to rely on this if you get stuck. + The story is very intriguing and really brings you into the world. The Average:The characters didn't really appeal to me.  I found them to be the least interesting aspect of the game and sometimes annoying. ConclusionThis was my first time playing Broken Sword so I wasn't looking at this game with 'rose tinted glasses' For such an old game it is amazing how well it holds up in all areas. I can easily see why this game was such a classic when it was first released.  "

												Broken Sword is one of my favourite point and click games ever, when I saw this game in 2009 on the DS, I jumped at it and found very little new content but still the same game I like. A few years ago I got the game on android which first allowed me to hear the voice acting again which was fun. However I noticed something was off, I noticed it didn't have the same punch as the original, a lot of lines are cut and the scenes don't blend well with each other.I recommend watching this scene until George leaves the cafe from the original broken sword game:https://youtu.be/xFMHIu2zKcE?t=536Now I'd like you to watch the same scene from the director's cut:https://youtu.be/c_Qq-wLX-xI?t=124So my original impression of the director's cut having a little more content is kinda wrong as there are spots all over in this game that are like this. Director's cut removes dialogue and cuts scenes in a way that makes it look like it was done by a bunch of amateurs. Nico's side story is poorly done and never even talked about when it is finished and you can't die in the game. I'm sure most are disappointed by this because there is one part of the game where you die and it's kinda scary on the original because you can mess it up really easily. Now the tension is all gone and the scene itself is completely ruined.The developers or Steam should really give the option of playing the original, because then I would say YES BUY THIS GAME NOW, but for now. Find and play the follow:Original retail PC versionPlaystation versionGOG Version (Even the GOG version includes the ORIGINAL VERSION)Even if the number of hours I've played isn't high, I've played this version of the game for a total of 20 hours overall and this just isn't worth it.

Short version: 90%One of the most well-known point ‘n’ click adventures games from the end of the 90s, Broken Sword is still an enjoyable story almost twenty years later. It may suffer from blocky animation and dreadful voice quality, but the thrilling plot and the quality of the puzzles will always make it a true classic.Long version:Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars is Revolution Software’s best-known and probably most successful game, known for its sheer length (easily over 12 hours for a first-timer) and good puzzle balance.The story can be described as a modern conspiracy theory thriller featuring an everyday man getting drawn deeper and deeper into the Templar myth, while trying to solve an ancient riddle and staying ahead of his murderous pursuers. To do his he travels all over the world from Ireland to the Middle East, aided by a sassy photojournalist and a bunch of stereotypical, yet cartoonishly entertaining supporting cast.The puzzles are what you expect from a classic adventure game. They are complicated, sometimes convoluted, not too often logical, but if you get yourself in the typical adventure game mind-set, most of them can be passed with little difficulties. (Except the goat. *censored* that goat.)Although Broken Sword features some exceptional backgrounds and decent animation, it is not without technical difficulties. Especially when it comes to audio: most of the dialogue sounds as if it was recorded in an underground chamber, and none of the actors do a particularly good job. Also, in the Remastered Edition there is an additional prologue segment that just does not fit into the game at all.But these are really minor complaints compared to the sheer amount of fun one can have with this classic adventure title that is still one of the best of its kind even to this day.

												The first Broken Sword game will always have a special place in my gamer heart, seeing how it was one of the first adventure games I played.The game has everything; a good story that gives you the feeling that the creators did quite some research as they wrote the script. It has reasonably challangeing puzzles, humor and wit, as well as loveable characters and beautiful sceneries. And now, with the additions made in the Director's Cut, the game gets even better!If you haven't already, you should really add this classic to your list of games played.			"

												This game sits in a special place in my childhood along with Myst and Lands of Lore. Amazing classic point-and-click game with a wonderful story and amusing characters. There are characters in this game that have stuck with me for years and years after the last time I played. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a laid back game with puzzles of mild difficulty and witty dialogue.			"

Broken Sword: Director's cut	* 8/10This is the Director's Cut Of the First Chapter from the famous Point And Click Saga: Broken Sword. I didn't play the original Adventure but I know that besides a graphic update there's a consistent section dedicated to Nico where we'll see some interesting locations and acquire some informations useful to better understand the main quest. As usual we'll be kicked straight into action: Nico has been invited for an interview with the statesman Pierre Carchon, which has just been murdered the exact moment she arrives. George is just a tourist in Paris enjoying a break just outside a local Café which is blown away by an explosion. Their investigations will make them meet and join forces for a common purpose.I have to say this is the chapter I've enjoyed the most (I've played the first 3, now I'm about to play the 4th) as I really liked the riddles, especially the crypted codes Nico must solve. Another very important thing are characters because most of the people you meet will make an appearence again in the following games which is something I really appreciated (no particular spoiler has been done with this statement). However everything in the game (the characters, some riddles) are not to be taken too seriously as both the protagonists (especially George) and some situations with a few characters are quite silly.The story is interesting and has few interesting turning points and will make you visit various locations from the world, while the interface we'll use to move in this adventure is a classic point & click setup, with mouse controls, a classic inventory system and most importantly many choices of subjects for dialogues with other characters.+++Pros+++ NEW SIDE STORY. This director's cut adds a new Section Completely dedicated to Nico, and this alone adds a lot of depth in the story. This section will alternate with George parts giving the game what will be the classic Broken Sword structure that will become a standard in the next chapters, where we play constantly with both George and Nico in separate situations that will later join in a unique context. PUZZLES. There are some nice and interesting puzzles, though I've been really struck by the crypted code puzzles in nico's section. Sounds odd but I really enjoyed those puzzles. PLOT. Maybe the subject doesn't shine with originality but maybe that's because I've played it in 2015. Still its story is nicely structured and has some interesting plot twists.---Cons--- ACTIONS REQUIRE ACTIONS. Even some obvious actions or sections are completely locked unless you observe carefully or talk with some characters first, but maybe it's right this way anyways... "

												When I heard that my favourite point and click game of all time was being given a director's cut edition I jumped out my chair and cheered. I have tons of memories playing the original Broken Sword game on PC. So what was the Director's Cut version like? The best I can say is ""It was good"" It didn't really give me what I was hoping it would give. One thing that it added from the original game which is probably my favourite addition is that it adds Nico as a playable character and she was just a major character in the original. Aside from that there wasn't really much more of a reason for me to play it a second time through. I like most of the new changes that it gives this game like the hint system. But I'm thinking of one thing in particular, one change that I was annoyed about and that was the goat puzzle. This puzzle that was in the original broken sword was called as one of the hardest puzzles in a video game and it took me a week to figure out that puzzle and I felt amazing after I finally solved it. But in the Director's cut they simplified the puzzle. I'm not sure why revolution would do this. I don't think it needed to be simplified because of the newly added hint system, if players struggled with the puzzle they could just ask the hint system for help. One other problem I have with this Director's cut is that I can tell the difference between the audio that's been taken from the original game and the audio that has been recorded just for the director's cut because the director's cut audio sounds more clear and the audio that has been put into the director's cut from the original game sounds a bit more static. This makes some of the audio sound out of place and some of the new audio is done by different voice actors. Aside from that I do like the director's cut but I only recommend it to people who haven't played the original as there isn't really that much new to offer to people who played the originalSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

												You know, I like action games, the rush of trying to not die and make through a level, the fear of having to restart your perfect run due to some mistake you made, that feeling you get when you defeat a boss without any potions left, I really enjoy that. But on the other side of the spectrum, I also love puzzle games, and adventure point-and-click games from the 80's and 90's, in my opinion, reign supreme on puzzles. I've been playing them since I was a kid, I've played through the Monkey Islands, the King's Quests, the Space Quests, Grim Fandango, Day of The Tentacle, and several others, and if any of you read my Introduction, you know I'm a big fan of Ben ‘Yahtzee’ Croshaw, but I actually got introduced to his work not through Zero Punctuation, but through 5 Days a Stranger and the Chzo Mythos, back when he used to make adventure games.But still, it's been a long while since I played adventure games, and it is a colossal change of pace from my more recent rogue-like and acti on-based masochism experiences, but I'm glad I'm getting around to try one of the adventure game franchises from the 90's I never got around to play.Broken Sword 1 is a cookie cutter adventure game from 1996, still, almost every game at that time was like that, so not really a criticism. Now, of course most of you know what a adventure game is and how to play it, but I have to drown out these reviews, you know.In said game you point to something to interact with it, either collecting it or gaining some information, and with said items and information, you move forwards through the story. Done, see? I explained it in a short sentence just for you.On a more serious note, I actually really like this game's puzzles, they are mostly well thought out and make sense, Cthulhu knows I've suffered through some badly designed and downright insane puzzles in several adventure games. “BUT SHOES, GOAT PUZZLE MAN, GOAT PUZZLE.” Yes, yes, it's from this game that the infamous goat puzzle was born, I personally didn't find it too bad, but my research told me that it actually makes sense in the Director's Cut (the steam version), so that criticism is basically gone, still, by what I read, that puzzle was just sadistic.The story in this game is really good, it's really gripping and interesting, a bit cliche though, but that is forgivable, most of the characters are really well developed and likable.Nicole Collard, a bold French reporter who got this great interview with one of the national heroes, but when she got to his house, he was murdered by this serial killer she wrote several articles on, The Costume Killer, and after some investigation, she discovered that the murders were all connected to some sort of cult conspiracy, and after writing her paper detailing all that, she received a phone call from her boss ordering her to stop writing and never talk about this business again, until a mysterious phone call directed her to meet a man in a café.George Stobbart, an American touring through France found himself enjoying some latte in a café, until he noticed a strange and suspicious man entering said café, he paid no mind to it, but after a while a clown with an accordion rushed inside the café and left without his accordion, but a briefcase, the same briefcase the man was carrying, and after a while… EXPLOSION!!! The whole place was blown to smithereens, and so George feels it's his civilian duty to find this killer clown and help the authorities, until he met pretty reporter Nicole, who told him about the whole conspiracy. And so, together they must find this assassin and put a end to this madness.The writing is pretty good, I give the game that, and there is a quite nice bit of mystery and intrigue, as well as some well done twists, it's a pretty enjoyable ride.The graphical design is well done, the cutscenes are really well drawn, downright breathtaking at times, they also somewhat remind me of the Don Bluth cartoons, which I really enjoyed. That said, the in-game graphics looks kind of odd, the backgrounds are nice, but the characters seem a bit off, I can't really tell what it is, but still, not bad at all, considering when this game was made. The music on the other hand is really good, it gives the vibe of mystery and conspiracy, it really is ear candy. Back to the other hand though, the voice acting has some issues, and it really is noticeable, not experience-ruining, but still, you can clearly notice when they used different microphones and when they recorded on different locations, because at times the voices sound really good, at others it's just awful, but it isn't on the actor's fault, they do mostly a good job, a bit cringeworthy at times, but nothing too bad, the problem really is the microphone. 1996 though, so I'll give it a pass.Overall, the game is great, I definitively recommend it, it's a well done adventure game, the experience is definitively worth the time. It's got good characters, a good story, and good design, if you're a adventure aficionado you've already played this, so I don't know why I even brought that up.DEUS VULT!			"

												The original Broken Sword will probably always be my favorite point and click adventure game due to the fact that it was the first point and click game i ever played and the fact that the story is so strong and the characters are so likable, i really can't see any other point and click game beating it as far as i'm concerned.As for the Directors Cut i have to say that it is still a really enjoyable experience but nothing compared to the original.  Some things i don't like about the Directors Cut are the fact that they removed alot of interactions with characters and other random objects in the game, this may seem like a small thing to criticize but alot of the funny interactions that i grew up hearing when i played the original game on the PS1 have been removed. But apart from this i still highly recommend this game if you like Point and Click Adventure games			"

												Simply said, this is one of the most engaging, exciting and just downright fun point and click adventure games that I have ever played. You play as both George Stobbart and Nico Collard, a tourist and journalist that end up interwined in a thick plot of conspiracy and adventure dealing with the rebirth of the Knights' Templar. The quest for the Broken Sword of Baphomet takes you from the calm and romantic Parisian streets to the most perilous of Syrian deserts as you trek the globe in search of clues and answers to the game's many innovative and ingenius puzzles. Each and every one of these locations are brilliantly animated, resulting in what's simply one of the most beautiful adventure games of recent memory. Broken Sword: Shadow Of the Templars is not to be missed by anyone, whether you are a veteran point and click gamer, or just looking for a thrilling experience with a great plot, fantastic graphics and a somewhat 'Indiana Jones' feel that you won't soon forget!

												The Broken Sword games are nice classic point and click adventure games.This is definitely the type of game I look for when I want to play a point and click, especially with the art style these have. It reminds me a lot of the old King Quest VII game, that I loved so much as a kid.  I really enjoyed this and the second one, I have yet to play the third one but it’s sad to see they have changed the whole style of it, into a more 3D adventure type thing. I’m not so sure that one will be as good as the first two, but this and the second one are definitely worth buying for your point and click section.The art style is great, the story wasn’t too bad and it definitely satisfied my recent desire for classic point and click adventure games.

												An excellent adventure game, one you should definitely play.This is a point 'n' click adventure game, so I won't talk about the gameplay.However, I will state that the puzzles you have to solve are very interesting and challenging, yet not frustrating. You will have to use your brain, but will also have a lot of fun doing so, and there is always a feeling of satisfacion when you hear the audio cue indicating that you solved the puzzle.The strongest thing about this game is it's story and everything related to it. You play as George Stobbart, a young American lawyer, and Nicole Collard, a French journalist, who get involved in a murder investigation that ends up leading them on  a quest to find an ancient Templar treasure. The story is pretty interesting and it did keep me hooked to the screen despite not having a shocking twist or big reveal. A nice take on the Temlpars before the Den Brown era and the time when Templars have become,in my opinion, so overused that they have become annoying. It is a simple story of mistery and adventure, but quite an enjoyable one. Mostly thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting. It is a joy to listen to all the characters and their conversations, and the game is filled with entertaining side characters.It is truely amazing how much work was put into every character that comes in contact with the protagonists, to the point that you remember each and every one of them and some of their lines. The game has a serious tone most of the time, but just enough humor to keep a smile on your face. Conversation that include both George and Nicole are especially fun, since their common dialogue is some of the best in the game, and they have quickly become one of my favourite game couples.An excellent story, great writing, awesome and fun puzzles. What more do you need for an excellent p'n'c adventure?			"

												The game is a fine old school adventure with good voice acting. It's at a good price. It has a good story, and hours of entertainment. However, I had an issue with it that I will describe below after the spoiler alert.***Spoiler alert!My issue is with this particuIar version of the game. I never played the original and I didn't know how different this game was from it. As I playing (the Director's Cut), it became obvious that the game is made of some new material mixed in with the original because the quality differences between the two versions is noticeable. I wondered what the deal was with that when the quality switched over.The game begins with Nico, the attractive girl used on the Steam store page's cover art.  I thought to myself, ""I guess she is the protagonist."" Turns out that the actual protagonist is George Stobbart. Which was fine, I just found it odd that the game starts with Nico and you play her for 10 percent of the game and the rest of the game you play as George. Now I know that her small story was the added content.Some differences that I noticed when I looked up the original on YouTube was that the animated cut scenes were longer, there seemed to be more dialog, and there was none of that comic book windowing with facial close-ups.  The game starts with George at the cafe instead of with Nico. It made way more sense to me, narrative-wise, to start the game there. My advice, if you can, play the original. If you can't, this version will do just fine.			"

												This game is a masterwork of how to make an adventure game and one of the very few adventure games that can live up to any classic Lucasarts titles. Top-notch voice acting doing justice to a script filled with laughs, sly wit, and over the top spoofs and in its own way is every bit as good of a narrative as the Dreamfall series.Once you move away from the story elements Broken Sword shows itself in every way to be a superior game. The inventory system is better, the graphics have been updated, the puzzles mesh with the story, and the in-game hint system both manages to keep immersion intact while allowing the player to set their own level of difficulty, in saying that, it’s still the original content that steals the show.It's impossible to objectively criticize the first instalment of the Broken Sword series without nit-picking. Perhaps the only fair criticism is that the puzzles are not super demanding even without the hints. However, the sad truth is the most of the challenge to the puzzles in other games comes from bad design, not intellectual sophistication. When all and said and done Broken Sword: TDC is the best adventure game because everything in it just works synergistically to keep the player to keep on playing. "

												I haven't played many point and click adventure games, but I can tell you that this is a good one, so much charm. It is of course old now, but it was still a very gripping adventure for me, and I look forward to playing the later entries in the series. In short: Pleasant artwork, wonderful music, interesting story, great voice acting, several humorous moments, and lots of puzzles. Some simple, some more challenging, which would usually be offputting to me, but the game also has a brilliant hint system for when you are really stuck. It is actually hard to fault the game at all, but there are sometimes cases where you know what you need to do, but the game decides that's not how it will be done -- so you need to find a specific person to talk to or whatever first. A small gripe, and a very common one for this type of game, although it feels like the game should have been longer as well... So I rate it: 9/10.			"

												Broken Sword is an adventure game on the must play list. The story is one of the most intriguing I've ever played. It combines with good puzzles to keep you thinking. If you get the game, be aware that the director's cut has this annoying circle that appears on objects that you can interact with and they have changed some of the scenes. This might not be so bad for people getting into adventure games or someone that has never played this game, but returning gamers beware.Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!

Story is engaging, characters are not as good as the later ones but Nico actually looks a little sexier in this one. If a VR version can be made just with Nico And the story of the jewel encrusted♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I will pay top dollar for the experience.Overall it's an old game that still plays good as it's the story and puzzles that draw you to these games. So older graphics don't make much of a difference really its only the 4:3 screen that's a little♥♥♥♥♥♥but on your tv it's big enough these days anyway.Overall it's worth having to work through from the beginning.this was directors cut you can also dl original as Free DLC and play that one.

Most of the puzzles seem well balanced and logical, although maybe too much on the easy side.The whole game can be completed under 10h (took me 8h) - just the perfect amount of time for an adventure game (which usually are linear and play more like reading a book), not too short, and not too long enough to get you bored.

I suggest to get the whole in a bundle to get them cheaper.- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------This is a very old and familiar game I've played when I was a teen. I've played the French version years ago and now finished the director's cut. I would rather prefer the French dubbing than the English one even if the English one is fine too.Broken sword is a saga of 5 episodes connected to each other. In the first episode you'll investigate murders linked to a very uncommon murderer as a female reporter called Nico Collard. She will though need the help of some other people including George Stobbart an American tourist who will be involved the first day of his holidays in Paris. As you'll know more about the murderer you'll also learn that there is an even larger conspiracy linked to the Templars.In that episode you'll play alternatively Nico Collard and George Stobbart. You'll need to travel a lot, mostly for George, in different area of Paris as well as some place in Spain, Ireland and Syria. The story is rich of events, history elements as well as some second-degree humor. The story is narrated at the first person.Travelling is not the only thing in that game, you'll also need to find evidence about the murderer and the conspiracy as well as solve some puzzles with your brain (block-slider puzzle, decipher coded messages, ""jig-saw"" ...) and your mind interacting with the environment using items in your inventory to solve some other puzzles but also ask the help of some people. As long as there is a puzzle there is a hint system providing you a first general hint. If you wish you can always ask for more hints giving more and more detailed information. To help in your quest you've also a notebook where you write every important information.Puzzles are really good and some are challenging. There is also a bonus content to unlock after finishing the game. The bonus itself is a short comic book in 5 parts that cover the event before the interview. I would recommend the saga to anyone that love Point-and-click Puzzle games with a good story. The best way to get the games for low price is to get the whole saga in a bundle.			"

												Broken Sword and Broken Sword 2 are two of the greatest adventure games of all time. They are rightfully up there with the Lucasarts masterpieces such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. But the one thing that BS had in its favour that in some aspects elevated it above those games was the incredibly immersive and detailed story. The story was originally like The Da Vinci Code, before it was even a thing; rich, complex and based on history. It also had great, humourous dialogue, and the exploring element once more elevated it. You could pretty much look at anything, try using anything, and the game never held your hand in terms of completeing puzzles, making for a truly challenging game, in which a wrong move could have your character killed.Broken Sword: Directors Cut has stripped back virtually all the things that made the original great. As someone who has played the original literally dozens of times, I knew from the opening sequence that something was wrong. I don't mind that they have interspersed a couple of new puzzles into the game, but the new animation is jarring and horribly static flash animation, as opposed to the original Disney-esque fluid cinematics from the original. But I quickly noticed that the cafe scene (which opens the original game) is missing a lot of things that I used to love looking at, and getting George's cynical or funny takes on. The dialogue has been halved, the puzzles have been halved, and its just a big mess. Some of the dialogue has been re-recorded for some reason, which is painfully obvious from a striking difference in audio quality.I seriously love BS, but i feel like i paid for a DC and ended up with a Broken Sword: Lite instead. Remember when Monkey Island 2 first came out, and there was an option to play it with easier puzzles? This is basically that, but without the option of the full experience. Is there an original version of this on Steam? If so, i'd go for that.EDIT: I've just been informed that the version on GOG.com comes with the option to play the original or the DC, so i would suggest getting that. The Steam version  has no such option			"

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANAEnglish:Just the game's name it's an assurance. We're talking about Broken Sword, a classic, a masterpiece, one of the best point and click of all time. AND, we're talking about the ""Director's Cut"" version, so, revised from the creators years later and then improved with new contents. The story is fascinating, the puzzles are original and sometimes definetly hard. Anyway, BS made history. If you're a videogames passionate, this game is a must play, and a must have. (Sorry for my bad english.)Italiano:Già solo il nome del gioco è una garanzia. Stiamo parlando di Broken Sword, un classico, un capolavoro, uno dei              migliori punta e clicca di sempre, forse il primo fatto come dio comanda. E non solo, parliamo della versione ""Director's Cut"" che è dunque stata revisionata dagli ideatori anni dopo con il senno di poi, e dunque migliorata e infarcita di qualche nuovo contenuto. La storia è avvincente, gli enigmi e i rompicapi originali e a volte decisamente difficili. E poi BS ha fatto la storia. Se sei un appassionato di videogames, questo gioco è un must. L'unica pecca, è il doppiaggio italiano. Quello fa veramente pena.			"

												A thrilling, good written classic point and click-adventure with some ""deepness and seriousness"" i miss from other adventures today.The game starts with an assassination in a cafe in Paris, where the american George Stobbart unfortunately decided to chill on his travel. He survives it, and starts together with a female journalist, Nicole Collard, to investigate about the assassin. The more they find out about it, the more they get involved into a thrilling, murderous Story about the old temple knights, assassins and a secret society.The original version of this game from 1996 is one of my favourite point and click-adventures, unfortunately only the Director's Cut-Version  is available on steam. The DC-Version got new content included (1-2hours of story and riddles with Nico) and a help system. ""It got new content, and still you like the original version more, why?"" you ask ? Here is why:- new content doesn't fit in (new graphics mixed with the old graphics, same with the audio)- content got cut out from the original version: Scenes where you can die are cut out; dialogues who are not fitting for children; some hotspots are not clickable anymore.That takes a huge portion of the thrill and entertainment away from me.Any way, one of the best point and click-adventures that you should have played, if you like the genre. But better get the original version!			"

												An international conspiracy story with Assassins and Templars seems cliche today but it was ahead of its time when Broken Sword first came out. Broken Sword is a fun Euro-wide romp (with a brief detour to the Middle East), and fun puzzles that rarely ping gamers' innate radar for Adventure Game Moon Logic. For the few that do ask for some dumb counterintuitive leaps or obnoxious gruntwork, the hint system is there to make things merciful.			"

												The game that started it all, the original Broken Sword. A fantastic point-click adventure with plenty of story and dialogue to keep you immersed. Its story set up the story for 4 more Broken Sword games. If there's a game series to have, it's definitely this one. But don't start with the latest, get this first, play this first, learn the story, enjoy everything Broken Sword has to offer, right from the beginning.			"

												This is a decent point and click adventure--made me feel like I was part of a Johnny Quest cartoon. The story is an engaging history lesson in 14th century Templar Knights and the voice acting is well done. It is a very casual adventure; the puzzles are extremely easy, plus the blue markers remove any difficulty in finding whatever you need, plus there is a hint system in the unlikely event you get stuck. On the downside, the graphics are dated and the movement is slow paced making the game longer than it needs to be. But overall, it was pleasantly entertaining.			"

												I first got this game upon its original release for the playstation 1. I was twelve, I think, and George Stobbart's adventure was an amazing experience to me then. 2014 and things haven't changed. The director's cut has a new story weaved in to the original plot concerning Nico's father ( I think we were all wondering why she sat about doing nothing while George was risking his life). That, and some added mini-games make the experience a little fresher for old fans returning to the series. This isn't one for the gameplay, though; it's all about the story, humourous dialogue and the many whacky characters you meet along the way. You'll travel from Paris, to Syria, Ireland (my personal favourite) and a few other countries in Europe, asking people to shake your hand, or for their opinion on your grease stained tissue that you found in a sewer in Paris. Wonderful! ""You want most luxurious taxi ride. Yes?""			"

												To start with - I never played the original so the assessment is based purely in this version on Steam. The Good - The story moves along nicely.  The  mythology into the Templars is probably the best part of the game.  At the end you get a Director's scene telling you how the series came about and that too was moderately interesting.  None of the puzzles are overly onerous.  the bad - The character development needed more.  Almost all characters in this version of the game are somewhat bland - you really feel limited to no affinity for any of them.  Romantic ending was curious given nothing in the game was relationship building at all.   Overall,  takes around 10 hours to play through.  I give it a thumbs up for the lore into the Templars.			"

												Ah, Broken Sword. I have heard a lot about this series as the years passed and now I had the opportunity to play it myself. Normally not a fan of point and click adventures I have to say that given the age and history of the game I really like it. Some cliché story elements to be sure but what really struck me was how incredibly witty this game can be. I have too many scenes to quote that if I would merely start I would quickly fill several pages worth.The puzzles also stood out for me. Decoding messages and moving puzzles around in a fashion that I have, to my great disappointed realization, never encountered in any form in any modern game. The puzzles are simplistic in nature but brilliant in execution and are genuinely tricky even for a puzzle veteran like myself.The hints system is a gem for people prone to getting stuck. It levels small suggestions to more direct hints to giving you the solution outright if you as for enough hints.The story is nice but in this day and age it's not very original. For me it's the journey to the end that makes the fun part of this brilliant game. The side characters you encounter are most memorable in my opinion. English ladies, Spanish aristocrats, French police officers.I only really have two complaints about this game. The ending is a liiittle anticlimactic. but my #1 main issue is when switching areas and watching the characters walking around is sooo slooow and gets old very rapidly.I closing I would very much recommend Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars to friends of classics, puzzles and adventure. I hope you have fun playing. ^_^			"

As an uneducated idiot loving history and the Templar mythology in particular, the story grabs me, but it's the way my nonsense and curious side of my brain wants to grab the undiscovered well in the garden and discover why maybe a clown assassin is possibly a good guy.Replayable genius.

												There's a surprising amount of modern sensibility to this remake of the original Broken Sword.  There's a helpful hint system, interactive objects flash with a small icon, and there are the usual visual and audio upgrades you'd expect.  You'll still run into some infuriating moments of classic adventure game puzzledom, but the hint system is fairly clear and the pixel hunting is, thankfully, kept to a minimum.  The hand-drawn graphics look sharp, but sometimes the speech seems slightly off, as though some dialogue was spliced in using different equipment.  It can be a bit jarring.  For the most part, though, this is a serviceable remake of a classic adventure game, and the story is still a fun little mystery romp.			"

												""Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars"" is a great classic adventure game. This game is on par with other masterpieces of adventure games of all time.Now about ""Broken Sword: Director's Cut"".""Paris in the fall, the last months of the year, at the end of the millenium. The city holds many memories for me, of music, of cafes, of love, and of death"". - George StobbartYou'll never hear this classic words anymore in game intro, because in Director's Cut version it was cut from the original game like a lot of dialogues and some cutscenes. Instead this, developers gave us:- Unnecessary and boring additional Nico's story.- Terrible mix of new and old graphic. Looks funny the fact that old graphic looks better and has much more animations than new. New versions of city and world maps are very bad, not so detailed like in original game...- Terrible mix of new and old character voices. New voices doesn't match old, so a lot of characters now have two voices. Very strange to hear main heroes who every time speaking with different voices.- Awful portraits of characters during dialogues without facial animation.- New subtitles style are too small.Dear developers, why you just have not released remastered version like ""Broken Sword 2"" instead of this Director's Cut version with a lot of terrible innovations?The worst remake (new version or what is it) ever made!I advise you to buy this version only to get for free ""Broken Sword 1: Original Version"".

												Broken Sword still remains as one of the classic P&C adventures that doesn't delve too deeply into ""adventure game logic"" so endemic to the genre, but this Director's Cut has been a double-edged sword. Although it bridges certain sections of the game that were previously left vague or were outright absent, it also messes with the game's pacing and newly added art quality certainly leaves much to be desired, showing it was built for tablets in mind. Also worth noting are new puzzles that seem to somewhat clash with ideas behind the originals and resort more to crosswords and cryptography over actual ingenuity. Still, definitely worth playing as an overall package, doubly so for the fans, even if certain death events are suspiciously absent.			"

												Now as most people (I guess) I was driven by nostalgia and a nagging feel, that there must be some way around the infamous goat, when I  decided to give Broken Sword another shot after at least 10 years. I was quite disappointed to see, how the animated cut scenes have been crippled by the ""directors cut"". Even more after I heard that dialogues might have been removed from the game to streamline the gaming experience for a generation that finds it hard to keep a focus for more than 10 minutes. But even a broken Broken Sword remains a damn good piece of game developer's craftmanship, that more recent games like the ""Secret Files"" series imho have never managed to properly plagiarize.			"

												George and Nicole hold a special place in my young life as the harbingers of a new type of adventure gaming for me.  When I first clicked the game disc into the drive to play, it was the first time I would play an adventure game on a console (PlayStation) and it was a distinct shift in the style of adventure gaming I had played up to that point.The year was 1996 and I had grown up through the golden age of adventure games; Monkey Island, Indiana Jones, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle and Space Quest had all been my staple gaming for many years on the good ol' Amiga! Little did I know at the time but these had all tuned my thinking into a zany, wacky and ultimately illogical thought process where (spoilers!!!) rubber chickens could be used on zip lines, cocktail chemistry is the key to thickening your loogey to win a spitting competition and little lizards ate cheetos.So when I first played Broken Sword, not only was it a novelty to be playing a classic point and click style adventure with a controller on a console (which worked damn well and something we now take for granted), but I was quite regularly stumped by what were quite 'normal' and logical puzzles.  I just couldn't figure them out.There was no plethora of random objects in my inventory to be combined in some obscure way.  Puzzles didn't require a tongue in cheek reworking of cultural tropes and there weren't any in-game phone boxes to call a puzzle help line.  Such is the indelible mark left by this style of the 90s classics upon adventure games that this brand of zaniness has become synonymous with the entire genre.  That's not to say Broken Sword was devoid of wit or charm, quite the opposite.  Not only was the plot brilliant with plenty of depth and twists but the dialogue and inner monologues were sharp and witty too.  The late writer, Dave Cummins, was responsible for much of this humour that still brings out a chuckle in me today.  Here's just a taste of some of the zingers:George: I felt a slight twinge of conscience as I prepared to give the dog a dunking. It soon passed.George: He had the eyes of a cocker-spaniel set in a face like a deflated soufflé.George: You speak very good English for a French girl.Nicole: Thanks. You speak very good English for an American.Jarring at first, I did eventually become accustomed to an adventure set more in reality than not and discovered a new, different and deeper appreciation of the genre.  With Broken Sword, I was gripped by the story and two protagonists who drew me in through a novel-like tale of historical intrigue, deception and an awkward romance.  From the very first almost cliche Parisienne scene I was gripped by the entirety of what was on offer.The art style is iconic which, coupled with the fantastic music, creates a strong ambience throughout with many memorable scenes and moments.  The writing is fantastic with dry humour and an awkwardness that characterises George so perfectly.  This compliments and contrasts so well with the intelligent, chic and curious Nico that by the end of the game, we are left with a compelling duo with whom we wish we could spend more time and indeed has provided the foundation of four sequels.  The puzzles are solid head scratchers for the most part (Irish goats excluded!) and tie in neatly with the story they don't break the continuity or mood which is common in the less thoughtful offerings of the adventure genre.When the Director's Cut was released on Steam years later in 2009, it was an instant buy for me.  The little changes made, such as being able to play as Nico at certain points and the addition of some new puzzles, outweighed the simplification of others.  It's a brilliant polishing up of a classic that was so deserving of its commercial and critical acclaim that launched a series and gave us George and Nico.This is a review from my website:  https://wingedtankard.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-directors-cut/ "

												Awesome and intriguing story. It's worth to play the game only to see how the story unfolds. The characters are tastefully stereotypical (in a very good sense) and the puzzles prove quite challenging sometimes.Overall, it's one of the best adventure games I ever played.			"

												This starts off pretty well, adding some more detail to Nico's investigations while George is pursuing the trail of the clown etc. However, most of the added stuff is just basic, generic puzzles (eg the lock slider puzzle). The game is also dumbed down for the general public and even though the new artwork is nice, everything that's different from the original just serves to take away from the charm. For anyone new to the point and click genre: Give it a try! It's a lot more accessible than the original (with the hints etc) and still has the brilliance in characters, dialog and story development.For any fans of the original: I wouldn't be overly pushed with playing this. It doesn't add anything particularly worthwhile, if anything it takes away from the overall charm.			"

												Great game to play, absolutely a must if you are into point and click. And a real pleasure for a nostalgic player like myself, i used to play this game when i was a child and i loved it, i played this version and i loved it as well, even if it's not as good as the original. :)The director's cut adds an...interesting?...side story to show some of Nico's background, which is a good addition to the game, even if it is not necessary to the main game, it's still fun just for the puzzle solving i guess.As far as the story goes, it's very intriguing even if not historically accurate, but oh well, it's just a game in the end, it's is not meant to teach you anything. Unfortunately this version comes with some really bad cuts. Some cutscenes are missing from the original game, along with some possible choices and interactions. I have to say that this is a very very bad choice for such an amazing game, but still i would recommend getting this game, even though if you can get your hands on the original version, THAT is a true masterpiece!

Discovered:Nothing beats a game with a good story and voice acting.Good/Bad:It was interesting for me to experience a classic such as this. Most of the excitement can be found within the exchange of words and simple actions of cause and effect throughout the game. Each person you meet is as lively and memorable as they can be. The script, minus the voice acting suffering from bad recording, is one of the elements that make this an unforgettable gaming experience.One problem I found myself wrestling with is that it isn’t clear as to what needs to be done next. It is a blessing that there is a  hint system in place. It’s more about discovering something by looking at it then talking to a person and then the person gives information that opens up another conversation to another person somewhere else or opens up a new location to go to next... uhm… I guess I just literally described the adventure genre! I suppose this complaint exists because of me not paying attention to the details of everything happening in the game. My bad! No matter, it was an amazing game, nevertheless.Update: Having seen what the game used to be on Youtube, I was shocked at the amount of original content that was cut from the game! Apparently there were multiple branching choices that led to death sequences and other story content that were cut out. Summary:Director’s Cut Broken Sword has all the pieces that make a great game. Although some of those pieces are worn out and missing, it is still able to keep the player engaged through its smart dialogue and unfolding story. Just be sure to always remember to “point, click, listen & repeat”.Last Thoughts: Definitely for adventure fans who love a good old fashioned story over anything. The humor was smart and made me laugh a couple of times which was great because not a lot of games can get that out of me. I can’t wait to play the sequels!			"

												A fun and engaging point-and-click adventure game. Very intuitive, with a useful hint system (which will give you more useful hints the more you click on it until it gives you the answer... so you're never stuck!). My only complaint was starting it for the first time and it didn't play- didn't even open. You had to run oalinst.exe found in C:\...\Steam\steamapps\common\Broken Sword Shadow of the Templars to fix that issue. It's also uncommon to find this answer on the internet... or at least it was for me.All in all, a good game so far.			"

												Giving this game a positive review since it's a classic worth knowing. With this said, if you are new to the series, purchase a classic version of the game instead of Director's Cut.

												Unlike some old-timers here, I only got to play this game last year, while feeling somewhat prejudiced towards it in the beginning, since the visual style threw me off a bit, plus I'm not too fond of point-and-click games.Broken Sword's elegant, mature charm, good voice acting, likable characters and intuitive, well-integrated puzzles changed my opinion on it in a matter of hours, however. Great humor, probably not Monkey Island-funny, but very quirky and wry - I laughed more times than I could count. Very, very amusing and heartwarming experience, I feel like it's a game that aged very well.I cannot vouch for the rest of the trilogy though, I couldn't get engrossed into the Smoking Mirror at all, unlike this little gem here.

												Loved it! Had good puzzles that actually made logical sense. Unfortunately, I took a year's break when I got to 68% of the gameplay due to RL stuff so I couldn't follow the story very well. So maybe that's why but I found the ending to be not quite what I was expecting. Story overall was pretty good though. You may think that a story about Templars is cliche but if you read the piece at the end of the game from the director then you see that it was made during a time when Templars weren't quite so prevalent in entertainment.

												Broken Sword is a Point and Click adventure game, one of the first 'modern' ones to hit the PC scene back in the 90s. At the time it was hailed as a fantastic game, and even now nearly 15/20 years on, I'd still consider it a game that's worth playing for the experience. The art work still holds up, where as the animation is basic, and the voice acting has been poorly recorded, but I can forgive that. The voice acting itself is outrageous with some of the most over the top accents you'll ever here - Geordie accent included!Some of the puzzles are still genuine headscratchers, but the good type - Mav, Priit and Saj attempted to help. Attempted. The game felt a little long winded by the end, so I'd be interested to know which new scenes were added to the Director's Cut (as I'm not entirely sure they were needed). However, overall I'd recommend this to any PnC fans, but perhaps wait for the Trilogy in the sale if you're a curious bystander.			"

												A really good intriguing old point and click adventure games. Full of mystery and danger like for example Dan Brown's stories. Good for everyone who can appreciate a game for that. The puzzles aren't frustrating at all and progress makes you feel good and smart. Director's Cut version contains additional pieces of the story from the side of the secondary character, Nico. She's a playable character now in these few added bits and we discover some more background related to her that connects to the general story. There are also some added puzzles and some new graphics like portraits of characters when they talk, but that somtimes looks a bit out of place in contrast with the graphics of such an old game. However... They removed the few time critical puzzles where you had to do the right quickly to survive some danger. You can no longer die. The main character automatically knows the right thing to do in those moments. That's just one small regret, no biggie. This is great, play it.			"

												This game is great. It truly feels like an adventure, and makes excellent use of enviornment, music, and game feel to immerse you.I quite like the additions they put in with the directors cut version, most of them fit very well, and it really helps develop Nico's character, but I feel some of the puzzles in that section were unfair (The hint system malfunctioned) and some just didn't fit in, and puzzles like it were never seen again (Thankfully)The characters are lovable, the comedy is quirky- and serious when it needs to be. The story is captivating, and you really feel like a character, discovering things as they do, and that adds to it feeling like an adventure. The dark-cartoon world it takes place in is done very well. It's not affraid to play up its wacky cartoon side, but still feel like a serious story.gr8 gaem 11/10			"

												I am a huge fan of point and click adventure games. This game is no Syberia or Myst, but it has it's strenghts.What I love about the game is the story line and the hint system. The story is actually engrossing and makes sense - the two protagonists are trying to solve a mystery involving the knights templar, leading the gameplayer down a path to understand their order and mission. The hints are great - they have a tiered system and it allows you to easily pick up from where you left off, even if it has been days since you logged on (great if you are a casual gamer!).What I don't like is the often cumbersome animations. This is especially true if you are trying to go from one area to another but there is one short animation prior to leaving the area...you have to watch the character walk all the way across the screen, watch the animation, and then you move to the next room. When you're close to solving a puzzle, this gets rather annoying. Otherwise, this is a fun, casual game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this is one of THE greatest games of all time - possibly my favourite.But this is the newer version released on Nintendo DS, the Directors Cut.Its had some serious revamping, new art, new puzzles and some updated voice acting.But the whole thing feels rushed. The original game had great pace, and the puzzles were difficult -sometimes infuriting (the goat, amirite?) and sensational depth of character and plot.This version feels rushed, the new voice acting is good and with the original actors - but it feels lack-lustre and not as serious as the original. Even the animation seems like its been skipped - the original game had better animation and that was in the early 90's!The new puzzles are not great or difficult and make up around 10% of the puzzles of the game. the old puzzles are simplified and shortened.The other kicker, this version seems to have been censored. No blood and (the real downer for me) you can't die.The whole excitement of the original game came from the fact your very mortal character could succumb to his antagonists at any given moment, this gave the player a fear and a drive that spurred you on - but with caution every step of the way.Thsi version feels very ""that will do"", the skipping of some iconic lines, the rushed feel on animations and puzzle solving and also the cutting of some cut scenes.The good news is, you can buy the original on Amazon for literally £0.01.Which is what I have just done.Do the same if you want to experience the uncensored, de-nintendoed game.Once again, this is one of my favourite games ever - a close second is Broken Sword 2.

												That was a pleasure even after all these years since release. Travels, riddles and relatively nicely balanced difficulty with advice system. Thats how mystery/murder genre starts the age for others, without items juggling. Sure voice acting was something new at that time, and it was hard to get it emotional. It is still pretty good journey worth taking on.And obviously I will be completing rest of the series aswell, I can't see anything against it soo far. Whole series can be obtained easly nowdays.PS: I am not gonna compare Directors Cut with Original since I have no comparision.			"

												Their are games that are so brilliant you need them in your collection and this is certainly one to add.Some of the puzzles are frustrating but it's an example of brilliant writing that draws you into the game, if you are a fan of Lucasarts point and clicks you need this game.I would go as far to say that I tend to prefer the Broken Sword games to the Monkey Island games..Buy this game.

												If there was no original version attached (they've added it recently), I would give the Director's Cut a thumb down for sure.Replaying the game in a form of its Director's Cut after all these years was a truly miserable experience. The Cut is inferior when compared to the original in all aspects. It looks worse, backgrounds are all blurry as hell, characters' animations got cut off and replaced with worse (the whole Nico's models seems to be replaced and sticks out like a sore thumb), the addition of portraits during dialogues is uncalled for and, finally, the game's content has been severly cut in many places. Some puzzles were butchered (the goat encounter is ruined in Director's Cut, for crying out loud!), some scenes removed, there's noticeably less dialogue. The iconic intro scene was replaced with a boring and dragged out Nico's episode that doesn't add anything at all to the overall experience. The game runs noticeably worse, it has problems with registering your mouse actions, so more often than not you will click the same spot multiple times to trigger interactions. Many cutscenes ended prematurely for me during the playthrough.The original is here, though, so I recommend to ignore the Director's Cut and play it instead. Even though it's not that good adventure game, if you put your nostalgia glasses off. Replaying it just strucked me how mediocre the game is when compared to other top adventure titles of the mid 90s. The story is kind of meh and much less interesting than it was when you were, like, 10 years old or so. The puzzles are pretty much standard stuff with more emphasis put on dialogue tourism than actual puzzle solving, and more often than not they're resolved accidentally even before you intend to solve them. But, there are still iconic characters and wit the series is known for and they're all still top notch. If you didn't play the original yet, it's undoubtedly worth a try.			"

												this is a old but pretty good point n click adventure game. i really recommended those who like to play old school adventures games.pros- well drawn cartoony characters and colorful backrounds- there are too much locations waiting to be explored by you.- likeable protagonists and side characters- great variety hard to solve but enjoyable puzzles- lengthy adventure- with a intriguing plot you ll never get bored.cons- unnecessary long and pointless conversations between characters. i skipped some of them.- there are no english subtitles opening and cut scenes.- if you play fullscreen mode, you will encounter tiny subtitles top of the screen.

												I'm writing this review for people who, like me, might look into this game hoping for an adventure game with a decent female lead, or at least co-lead. Spoilers: you're not going to find it in this game.Gameplay-wise: Speaking as a person who only encountered Broken Sword recently and thus in its newest version only, I found the game passably engaging. The puzzles do make you think and offer a large range of potential combinations, although there are places where it drags because the game expects you to do something completely counter-intuitive and gives no feedback on whether you're doing it right, so you go through every single item and combination thereof, then dialogue choices, and finally click everything before you hit it. The hint system might as well not have existed, since it didn't help me and apparently annoyed previous lovers of the game. The graphics are what you might expect from a decade old game, not really updated but not too terrible.[Some spoilers] As for the characters, you play as Nico Marlet, who is a fairly decent character, drawn into the murder of her newest interviewee and subsequent meddling into her life, for about 30 minutes out of a 7 hour playthrough. The rest of the time you play as George Stubbart, whose only connection to the whole affair was he happened to be at a cafe when it blew up to kill the man inside, and decided he had to solve the crime for great justice or something. He takes center stage and then keeps it for the rest of the game while Nico sits at her apartment and waits, or seduces someone over the phone, or talks to an archaelogist friend to create a really gross doubly-oneside love triangle centered around her. Also there is a very dubious (consent-wise) scene later in the game between George and Nico, whose romance doesn't really have any substance beyond George thinking she's pretty a few times? So many things seem shoehorned in without proper support. It's both baffling and irritating. If you want a decent head-scratcher and don't mind a host of gender issues, then pick this up. If you wanted a game which treats its women respectfully, don't do what I did. Buy another game.			"

												Unfortunately this isn't a game I would want to play again anytime soon. As I have understood, a lot of original content was cut from the game and replaced to make the game more storydriven as well as helping you along the way to solve things a.k.a handholding. ~ Good ~Graphics: I think they are beautiful for its time. The animation is extremely smooth, the characters move realistic and at times it's hard to think they are built out of simple pixels. The backgrounds are all well detailed and even the background characters have solid animation. Voice acting:It's quite obvious some of the voices were re-recorded and others are still old. Sometimes it will sound like someone is sitting in an empty room, with a slight echoing sound to it. Other times you hear that the sounds are clearer. The english voiceacting is fine. Nicole has a lovely voice, but I honestly can't understand a thing she says without subtitles. She has a very thick french accent, so it isn't the fault of the game. Characters:I found that the background characters bring most of the fun to the game. Some of them are very weird in a quirky way (the kebab seller) and they are the ones responsible for the funny dialogue. Between the boring story, it was fun to hang around and talk to these characters. I wish there had been more of this and less about the Templars. ~ Bad ~Story:I honestly found this one boring, hence why I am reluctant to play it again. I think it was a bad thing to give the story so much focus. As you are mostly trying to find information about it, all you do is listen to people talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... ugh. The ending was also grossly dissapointing. Imagine spending hours upon hours trying to find this one final part and it's not even half of what it was hyped up to be. Dialogue heavy: This game relies heavily on you listening to conversations and if you don't snap up the important parts, you are going to have hell trying to solve some of the puzzles. A lot of the dialogue feels repeatetive as you are asking about the very same thing. The “oh so myserious” Templars and everyones opinion on it. Soundtrack: I found all the music out of place and some of the special effect sounds got on my nerve. Whenever the characters are experiencing a happy moment, the cheesiest of tunes plays in the background. The music also seems extremely loud compared to the voice acting. I keep the music at 20% and the voices at 100%, yet I still find that cheesy tune overpowering some of the conversations. Whenever you try to use an object on an area which you'll be able to use an item at some point, a glittering sound is played. I am guessing to help the player find clues, but it becomes extremely distracting and tedious, especially when you have 10 items to try. There's also short tunes playing anytime the characters make a conclusion to something, which also gets quite cheesy after a while. Despite these obvious hints, I found the game wasn't clear at all as to what it wanted you to do. Your only kind of help is a question mark that pretty much repeats the very same question you have, without giving any hints at how to solve the problem. Lack of interactions:There really doesn't happen much in the game besides dialogue. Most of the puzzles are solved by listening to dialogue or showing the right item for more dialogue. Sometimes the only way to advance the story is talking to everyone in a different order to get the information you need. And the sad things is, the dialogue about the story is the most boring part of the game. I only had fun when I was allowed to use items in the environment to solve things, or try to figure out how to get past guards without them taking an item from me. Dialogue is 90% of the game and the rest is some puzzle solving. Awful minigames:The first minigame involves solving a cypted message, which contains at least 2 names which you have heard maybe once or twice throughout the gameplay. Another terrible minigames involves you having to put roman numbers in order of a message, then click a button, then order them correctly again. All in a specific order. And what happens if you mess up 7/8? The whole puzzle resets and you have to do it all over again! Ugh! And the numbers move slow.Removed content:This game has obviously been censured by removing the death scenarios. There was supposed to be a timed action scene with a deadly outcome, but instead George will automatically solve the problem for you. So much for suspense? It's also dissapointing that once you solve one of the bigger mysteries, the screen just cuts and all you get is George words about what it was. Appearently he picks up an item from a room, but seeing him do so is completely removed, as is everything he does and sees in the room. And this is after solving the tedious roman puzzle! Way to go rewarding the player by removing one of the most important scenes after forcing them through the worst minigame.			"

												This is an extended version of the original Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars, with some added comics and videos that help filling in the storyline of the game. It's an adventure point&click game full of laughs and cleverly designed puzzles that explores a rather interesting subject which is the mistery of the Templars. The graphics might be a disappointing aspect nowadays but considering you don't mind them you will certainly have a good time the first installment of Broken Sword - a true classic of the point&click genre.

												If you're a fan of the original Broken Sword, then, as you can probably tell from the other reviews... This is, by and large, a safe bet for a great gameAs a newcomer though... I'm not entirely bowled overDone right, point-and-click can be brilliant. Certainly, the start of the game is very engaging. You're exploring places for useful / hidden items and trying to work out how to piece them all together. It's not long before you're given some challenging but great puzzles to solve too (the door lock and the decryption of the letter) - The characters are also quickly likeable, and George's charm in fumbling around Paris is certainly endearing. The game also packs a lot more humour than you'd expect - And I confess I garnered probably too much amusement from showing people soiled tissues, drain-openers and desperately trying to make them shake my handSo why the thumbs down?After the quick-draw of puzzles at the start, they almost seemed to dry up. The 'thinking' puzzles largely became talking to people in the correct order or showing them a certain item to trigger an event... which then required you to talk to yet more people. Whilst the reactions were fresh and entertaining to begin with, I admit I started getting impatient half way through the game and sometimes skipped through the unimportant dialogue or George telling me the item was not suitable - my heart sank a bit when I walked into a pub of about 5-6 characters... all to talk to, all with around 6-8 potential dialgues (based upon the item I show them). It started becoming a lot of sitting around and wasn't massaging my cerebral matter very muchYour actions also don't really seem to amount to much. You have a few 'options' in dialogue, but where they seem to garner the same results, it felt a bit pointless. You can't exactly seem to do things ""wrong"", and it's sometimes just trial and error (and clicking) until you find the right one. In effect, you find you're not quite exploring the game, but just fumbling around until you can find the plot trail it ultimately had prepared for you. It basically started feeling like less of a game and more that I was slowly clicking my way through a filmIt was engaging enough to see me through to the end, for sure - though a tad anti-climactic. The graphics were delightful (nicely remastered without too many elements where the old pixellated style was evident) and voice acting great... but it just didn't do it for me			"

												Yes i'm younger than twenty and therefore know roughly as much about real gaming as a chimpanzee knows about driving a T-34, but being a child has it's upsides like for example not knowing what a naked woman and a picture of a dolphin might have in common. Still, i'd like to talk about this game. 'This game' being Broken Sword: Director's cut. It has been quite some time since it's release, but there isn't a single game that couldn't be brought back to life with a bit of steam and continue it's miserabre existence as an inflatable doll. But back to the point. I like Broken Sword. It's a rather good-looking (for it's age) point'n'click adventure game with occasional puzzles which i found pleasantly challenging and kind of refreshing as i would't get stuck every two minutes like I tend to do in this sort of games. It tells a story of a snob french reporter lady living in paris in her never ending quest for not living adequatly to her means and an american tourist of whom every nazi ideologist would be proud - a blonde, blue-eyed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They visit locations all over the world, or I should rather say the blonde guy does the visiting because the lady is always 'busy', what leads us to the main characters' relationship, which is kind of awkward since they istantly start behaving like a couple of old elephants sharing the same cage in a zoo for twenty years - they don't really like each other, but they will still have sex simply because there's no other option. Apart from cutscenes and logic-based puzzles we have inventory-based puzzles, which are well made - solutions resemble the ones a human in a state of being mildly high would think of. And there's talking. Here, despite visiting various countries including Spain and Syria the biggest problem concerning language is that Americans call holiday vacation. All that serves the purpose of discovering the mystery behind knights templar - a quite exploited theme nowadays, but as we established the game is a classic and what do I know. But wait, there are assassins - what a blatant AC ripoff!			"

A Classic RebornFor people that know the terms ""classic adventure game"" and ""adventure game logic"" but don't have a ton of experience with the actual classics this game may be a bit of a surprise. It takes a fairly restrained, logical (real world logical) approach to puzzles and problem solving which is a nice tact compared to the typical point and click fair.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and, except for a couple of quick revisits in Paris, you don't spend enough time in any one place for it to get stale. The writing is good enough but didn't stand out to me as stellar or exceptionally funny but I did enjoy that the relationship between George and Nico didn't progress in the same cliche manner in which you'd expect.All said this is a solid game at a great price. If point-and-click or adventure gaming are your sort of thing then don't miss this.			"

												I love point and click adventure games so this review does have to be viewed as being written by a slightly biased hand. The characters are interesting enough to pull you in to care about them, the backgrounds are beautiful for the time the game was made and the storyline grabs you from the start. Gameplay-wise the puzzles are usually fairly easy to figure out what you have to do next with a little classic point-and-click trial and error (i.e rubbing everything in your inventory against everything in sight till something works) but there was one part I was stuck on for a while because I had to left click and then right click on an item to trigger an event. The right click function isn't used at any other point in the game, if it had been an integral function then perhaps I wouldn't have been stuck for so long. But all in it's a good adventure game and well worth a look by fans of the genre.			"

												Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars was an awesome murder-mystery themed romp throughout the streets of Paris and all around Europe. I loved the way it combined narrative, character development and puzzle solving into a game that was consistently interesting, and fun to beat.I was genuinely challenged by the puzzles at certain stages, whereas others were simpler than I thought (don't get me started on that roman numeral one). Whenever I got truly stumped, however, the game stepped in with its handy hint system. I like that the first hint never gave too much away, it was a step in the right direction without showing you exactly how to get there - I rarely needed to go any further than that.As for the characters: I love Nico. I think she's brilliant. I like her accent, her smarts, her characterisation, and the way she takes the blows dealt to her in the storyline; I especially like that we start the game out as her, that she has her own personal ties to the story that she doesn't let anyone else know, and that she doesn't fall for George's charms until he proves himself.Speaking of George, I liked how he is the polar opposite of Nico. She's all poise and calculation, whereas he is spontaneity and humour. Some of the things you could make him say or do were very entertaining, and I like that they went there with it. My only gripe with George and his part in the story is that he seemed to dominate it! It was disappointing that Nico, who was set up to be the primary storyteller in this game, had become a side-character of her own story and, by the end of it, fell into place as a love interest for George and the typical damsel in distress he needed to save. On the flip side, it was also a tad demeaning to poor George that he had to spend all his time travelling places to solve a mystery he'd all but stumbled upon, doing all the leg work, while Nico chilled in her apartment in Paris. (Double standards, amirite?)All my venting aside, while not spending more time in Nico's shoes was disappointing, it didn't ruin the game for me, not by a long shot. After all, who you walk around as doesn't matter all that much when it comes to the plot, and the plot of Broken Sword is incredibly compelling. I won't go into the details - apart from saying: PLAY IT - but I remained on the edge of my seat for the most part. There were a few times where the game lulled, but if it didn't, I'd be on the computer for nine hours straight. I'll wind up this long-winded review by saying that this was a great game, and I'm really looking forward to playing the second one. I'm hoping there's more Nico - and that George does return, as despite my complaining earlier I really do like him - and another mystery to solve!			"

												Wow, this game has not held up at all. Even this remade version, it's just not worth playing. The acting feels stilted, the animations bizarre and the lighting and colouring of the entire world. In all fairness I got ten minutes in, but I went back and looked at the original which I loved and I just do not think this is playable/enjoyable in modern times. 2 Stars.			"

												I loved the Broken Sword back in High School and decided play it again just to remember how it was. I was so wrong… The game is glitchy and the production quality is awful. The characters are dumb and emotionless. The story is poorly written. That's how it goes after 15+ years.			"

												There was a popular article by Old Man Murray which used Gabriel Knight 3 as an example for the kind of nonsensical, ridiculously contrived puzzles that killed adventure games. This point & click classic is an excellent counterargument. With its high production values, interesting - if slightly cliched - story, fun characters and good puzzles, it's a reminder of why many of us enjoy adventure games.The puzzles only get frustratingly difficult in one or two places, but the solutions are always logical and with not an onerous amount of try-everything-with-everything-else tedium. Sometimes solutions to later problems are hinted at elsewhere, so it really helps to pay attention. The voice acting is great for such an old game, though recorded a little unevenly. Play with subtitles so you don't miss anything.There are a few bugs in the Linux/Steam version I played - mostly to do with skipping during cutscenes. Having now finished the game I don't feel I missed anything though.Looking forward to getting to the rest of the series.			"

												I remember playing Broken Sword on the playstation when I was a kid. I wasn't quite patient and observant enough at the time to actually enjoy this game but I decided to try it again man years later and enjoyed it very much. I picked up a few games in the series and look forward to playing the rest.Broken Sword is a point and click adventure where you have to keep an eye out for objects in your surroundings you can use to complete puzzles or escape dugeons. The end goal of these games is to stop some cult of criminal organization from accomplishing their task.Pros:- Fun story which is fairly easy to follow- Dialog is fantastic and changes often based on what items you've collected and what's happened in the story- Detailed and gorgeous backgrounds- If you're into puzzle games this series is a must because of it's added story elementsCons:- Some puzzles can be frustrating- If you miss a clue you're pretty much screwed. I wish there were multiple ways to accomplish the same task sometimes.Game Score: 8/10			"

												So I've played a ton of adventure games this year, and found that hardly any of them deserved their high ratings (exception is ""yesterday"").  Almost all suffered from grossly unintuitive puzzles that almost certainly required a walkthrough or insane puzzle hunt an exhaustive attempt of combinations that made no sense.  That's not fun.  The ""wacky"" humor was often seriously stale.Well finally this game is top notch!  The dialogues, characters and story are all thoroughly intelligent , interesting, and believable.   The puzzles are thoughtful, clever, and sensible.This is what an adventure game should be!Incredible the trilogy is only $2.50 today, hopefully the other two will be as good.Edit:  The other two are terrible, just get this one.

												This game is a point and click detective style game.  If you are looking for a more interactive game, this isn't for you.  This game is about deductive reasoning and puzzle solving.  I would say my overall experience is that it started off very strong--puzzles were difficult to solve, the next step wasn't always obvious but would take some time to figure out, and the story/dialogue was entertaining.  As the game went on, I found the game to lose some of its earlier greatness.  The actual puzzles were few and far between and it became less intuitive to figure out what you had to do.  Some of the things you had to do were downright stupid and made no sense--one puzzle essentially makes you enter a set of numbers by tediously turning a wheel and pressing a button, and if you don't get every number right you have to start over again.  If you try to go through the game without using hints, you end up using an oldschool RPG approach, procedurally asking every person about every piece of evidence you have and trying to use every piece of evidence on any interactive element in the game, which simply isn't fun.  In about the last 15 minutes of the game they force a romance on the player between the very likeable French girl and the totally unlikeable American idiot who you are forced to play as for about 3/4 of the game.  Also, the animations in the cutscenes are pretty bad.  In summation, I found this game to be enjoyable some of the time--I do enjoy puzzles in which critical thinking is required, but it fell flat as far as plot, immersion, and consistent novelty.   I'd give it about a 4/10--it had a few funny jokes in there.  Most were cringe worthy, but a few landed.			"

The Story was awesome and to hear about the history and visit countries to solve the mystery put the icing on the cake . I will not reveal any of it and dont be afraid to try this game and buy the trilogy , dont listen to all these haters , its a gem of a game :)			"

												This game is okay.  I think it is much longer than I anticipated it to be, which is nice actually.  I haven't played the first game or any of the new Broken Sword games since, but considering the time period in which it was made, it is still not bad graphicly (granted new games are made to look like this one).  You have two characters who are out to search clues in an old manuscript they have found that have to do with the Knights Templar during the Crusade period.  There is a murderer involved and mysteries to be solved.  You get to figure out clues and follow the trail of finding ""the broken sword"" which isn't really mentioned until halfway through the game, by the way.  I've been playing this game for the past few months slowly at intervals and hope to finish it soon (as I type this I am 71% through the story).  It is good but George Stobbard is annoying with his lame humor.  Ugh. I like point and click games and like learning stories.  This isn't bad. I don't know if I'd recommend it though, but I wouldn't say that I don't recommend it either. I am neutral. I guess I'll say I am more likely to recommend it than not though.			"

												It must have been nearly twenty years since I've played the original Broken Sword for the very first time. Literally this has been the big bang of my adventure love, the origin where everything started, encouraging me to play a nearly countless number of point-and-click games up to the present day. The more it hurts to give a negative review. My criticism concerns the Director's Cut and not the original version of the game, which - while never reaching the quality of the very best LucasArts games - can be considered a classic and should be played at least once by every serious adventure player. For being superior Broken Sword suffers a bit too much from its dull stereotypes and jokes at the expense of others for my taste. That aside it is a good game and a staple of the genre.What flips my review from blue to red are the changes the publisher did in the Director's Cut. For sure I've read other negative reviews regarding these changes beforehand, nevertheless I decided to give this version a try, thinking it can't be that bad. I was wrong. Well, it is always difficult to replay a childhood game, the risk of breaking the rose-colored glasses is nearly hard-wired, but it has not been the game itself that spoiled my experience. No, it rather happened that I felt in love again with all the things I enjoyed in the past and felt familiar with. It's the deviations from these familiar things that broke the magic and in all honesty and objectivity, none of the changes Revolution Software did in the Director's Cut does the game any good. If I want to say at least something positive I would say that the added portraits partly feel felicitous. On the other hand these additions don't fit the graphical stlyle of the game and are as redundant as all the other changes in the Director's Cut. I've been prepared to worry about the new mandatory mouse-over hotspot 'feature', which is a pile of junk treating me like a moron, unable to solve anything on my own (other recent games provide keybinds to enable/disable hotspots) but it is far more than that. The whole new Nico chapter is redundant, feels out of place and adds nothing interesting to the game. Even worse this chapter replaces the phenomenal flight over paris intro from the original game. Furthermore there are a lot less hotspots and hence less comments in the game, making it super simple and less intriguing. The famous goat puzzle is totally ruined (in the past solving this puzzle was somehow special - even for new players it is 2 seconds now), same as every single scene where your character was able to die in the original game. You simply can't die any longer and every option that would have lead to death has been removed without substitution. And the final cutscene... come on guys, nobody needs that.I'm not dissapointed because my childhood game has been changed somehow. I'm dissapointed because my childhood game has been changed somehow in a bad way and it's messed now. It would have been way better if the puplisher just had rereleased the original game as it is. Verdict. My whole playthrough was a rollercoaster of cozy memories and extremely bad 'OMG, what have they done?' moments. Nevertheless even this Director's Cut sprays some Broken Sword charme. So if you've never played the game or if you've played the original game without having close affiliations with it, it might be ok to play this version with scaled down expectations. However if you've played the original game in the past and felt in love with it, avoid this version by all means.9/10 (original game, released 1996)5/10 (Director's Cut)			"

												First off, I would like to say that this is a review of the Steam version compared to the GOG version.The game itself if fine. Great even. One of my favorite point-and-click adventure games.However, the Steam version of the game is inferior to the GOG version.Namely, the GOG version comes with the original version of Broken Sword 1. This version is compatible with ScummVM. If you buy this game on Steam, you won't get the original version.Thus, I would recommend that you buy this game, but not from Steam. Buy it from GOG instead			"

												First of all: I can't recommend this version of the game unless it's to someone who wants an easy handheld walkthrough (and doesn't mind jarring main character switches and even more jarring character voice changes). I'd recently gotten back into adventure games (after having grown up playing Sierra and Lucasarts games in the 80s & 90s). Saw this one listed on a couple of top adventure game lists; thought I'd give it a try. The game begins with our intrepid heroine Nico going to meet with some high-fallutin' Parisien media mogul only to witness his murder. First thing I noticed when I got control of the character? That blue flashing light that indicates things the character can interact with. Helpful at first, but later an annoyance when I realized I was searching the screens for the blue light instead of actually looking at what was on the screen. Really annoyed when I realized there was no way to turn it off. So I stumbled from place to place with Nico, equally despising and yearning for that blue light, occasionally solving mildly difficult logic puzzles made even easier by the detailed instructions that left me wondering if this coupled with the blue light meant the game considered me some sort of idiot who couldn't figure things out on my own. (I'm playing Broken Sword after having just completed Black Mirror, which gave no instructions on how to solve its puzzles - and therefore left me feeling more satisfied when I did solve them.) Then suddenly I'm controlling George, an American lawyer who witnesses another murder and even though he has nothing to do with the murder or the case, he decides to get involved. I'm still unsure on his motivations for that (or why that workman didn't stop what he was doing to come help after the bombing! The dude was RIGHT THERE and never put down his shovel... Egads...) Anyway, the two characters decide to share info, even though so far as I can tell Nico's the only one who has anything invested in all this. From then on the playable character switches back and forth, often when I'm not ready for it (I thought I had more to investigate! Which I guess means I did all the stuff required to move on already...?). And sometimes the game takes me to the next location I need to go instead of letting me figure out where to go next.  I saved my game after playing somewhere in the range of two hours and saw my progress was 25% through the game. That really bummed me out. This was way too fast and too easy. Again, I grew up on adventure games in a pre-internet world. Sometimes I'd get stuck and it'd take weeks or months before I or my brother would have an epiphany and discover what we had to do next. This plays like it's meant to be rushed through in an afternoon, perhaps by people who don't want to stretch their brains too much. So I did a bit of research and discovered this version - the Director's Cut - is actually quite different from the original, in which you only play George (the guy who - so far - has no reason to be involved in this story?!) and there's no blue light and you can die and, ARGH why can't I play that version?!  Well, apparently I can. Now I'll just have to wait for it to go on sale on the other site. Bummer. After I finish Original Flavor, I'll come back and try this one again. The graphics and animations are just fine. So is the voice-work, except for when suddenly someone else is voicing the main character and trying to imitate the original, or certain lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded in a wind tunnel. Also annoying is having to sit there and watch two characters have a telepathic conversation (their mouths don't move), though I have encountered that in other games I've played, and I suppose the animations would be a pain, especially considering the amount of languages this game was made for. I can't really say much about the story so far as I've barely delved into it. The whole thing is giving me a Gabriel Knight vibe (which is a good thing!) except not as dark (literally). But I love Templar history and mysteries so hopefully the story turns out to be groovy (and I can recommend this game after getting my hands on the original). One super-annoyance that I have to point out: past tense. Past tense! Why is everything the characters narrate in the present in past tense?! 'It was a brandy bottle.' Why not: 'It IS a brandy bottle'? And then the 'show-vs-tell' sin of having the characters explicitly state how they feel about something. When faced with entering a sewer, Nico says: 'There might have been clues down there. I was relieved I didn't have a key.' Instead, have the actress 'show' how Nico feels through her line reading of: 'There might be clues down there. But thank goodness I don't have a key.' Except for the too on-the-nose recicitation of their feelings, it sounds like something Humphrey Bogart would narrate in one of his Sam Spade films. It just doesn't work for me here.			"

												This was my first game in the Broken Sword series and I doubt I’ll play another one. It had been on my wish list because it was classic point n’ click adventure, I should have liked the game. I can’t quite put my finger on why I didn’t. Perhaps the game is showing its age. The Templar based mystery felt tired, maybe the subject matter has been overdone. The attempts at humor felt strained and the story wasn’t interesting enough to hold my attention. It’s not a bad game. But it’s just not a very good game. Perhaps it was in its own time, but I think that time has passed. "

												Dont usually bother with these but this game deserves it. If your a fan of point and click puzzlers or are new to the genre id highly recommend this game. Afew puzzles that are quite difficult although what one may find difficult another will find easy. Brilliant thing about this game is that all the puzzles make sense, they were thought out well in be most correct in the situation. What i mean is there is no ""funny business"" puzzles that just make you want to do something crazy, most are logical and will test your patience. Dont listen to all the negative reviews they are just people who played the original version and are upset they didnt see a painting that used to be on the wall or a couple of npcs which were only for dialogue purposes, the whole game is filled with talking, you will ask plenty of questions. Game does exactly what it was suppose to do in a fun way. I havent played 5 but i found broken sword 1 the best for both its story and puzzles. Highly recommended.			"

												So, what can you say about a game that is widely regarded as one of the great classics of adventure games? A game that is often among the top five of various best-of-lists? A game that is held dear by many a gamer around the world? A game that already has been drowned in gallons of words over the decades?Well, I can say I finished it, I guess... And I can say that I'm having a hard time understanding why Broken Sword is so highly regarded by so many people nowadays. Let me clarify my history with this game though because maybe that'll illuminate my lack of enthusiasm. I did not play it back in 1996 when it was released, nor did I play it in 2009 when the Director's Cut was released for Nintendo consoles or in 2010 when it was released for PC/Mac. No, I played it in September 2013 without any prior knowledge. Now, I'm an old man and I enjoy a Werther's Original as much as the next old geezer, so I generally don't have problems with older games for pure technical or gameplay reasons, as they're the games I grew up playing. And yeah, the graphics are fine, the music is fine, the animations are fine, the sound quality is mostly decent, the controls are fine and whatever else is fine. The puzzles are mostly above average, the voice acting is quite alright and the UI doesn't make me want to vomit.The problems, for me, are the dialogs, the story and the characters. The dialogs are just not funny. Not at all. But they're clearly meant to be funny, which makes it cringeworthy. George is amassing all his wit in every interaction and let's lose some quip that is just so out of place. It's not only not funny, it's also not tied into the conversation, so he comes across like some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who constantly interrupts the people he starts to talk to with random and oftentimes even mean sentences. It's really enervating and you start to ask yourself why do these people keep talking to him...The story on the other hand is kinda meandering from some place to the next and then in the end George literally tells us out of nowhere what it is all about and I wondered how the ♥♥♥♥ he knew that... It's really badly written, which is surprising considering that Broken Sword was always lauded for the writing.And lastly, at least to me, the George and Nico dynamic just isn't there yet. It gets way better in Broken Sword 2 and especially 3 but in this game they just don't really click, imho. Again, it's really weird since the characters were highly praised back in the day. According to Wikipedia and Mobygames.So apparently the Director's Cut cuts a lot of content in dialogs, puzzles and areas that was originally in the game. I don't know, maybe the game is really, really cool with intact dialogs and story and the original version deserves its place among the greats but this here does not. Or maybe it is just one of the games that has sooooo horribly aged that nothing of its former glory is left. Like GoldenEye 007 for the N64 or WarCraft 2...It's worth to buy in a 75% sale just to play one of the classics but you're probably better of buying it from GoG where you get the Director's Cut and the original Version together.

												As  the title suggests, there is more content then the original game. Not much more, save for an intro sequence where you play as Nico, that has been added for a bit of extra gameplay, This isn’t bad as it sets the scene well.There are however, some seriously lazy things to behold here, Perhaps the most in your face of these is the voice quality. As far as I can tell, the sound files have been ported from the original game, and are very low quality in places.The Voice acting is a bit hit and miss I have to say. Some of them forget which accent they are supposed to be using for their assigned character, which is actually at times more accidentally comical than anything else.The game has quite a few places to go, and things to see, and all are very well realized. The game will take you from France to South America, to The Middle East, to the UK. You will also encounter quite a large number of interesting people along the way, with some truly memorable dialogue.For the bulk of the game you play as George, who is very well voice acted whereas Nico unfortunately has a voice actress who falls into the inconsistent accent category. This however is not enough to take away from how cool the character is.There is one major fall that the game takes. and that is in some of its overly elaborate puzzles. Some of which are too abstract, and as a result can make the game become rather boring. I reached a point where I simply couldn’t be bothered any more.Over all, the game is good, well written and it has a nice colorful art direction, but should you wish to try this one, be ready for frustration and a degree of boredom			"

												“What does this tissue mean to you?”Broken Sword: Director’s Cut is a pleasant and traditional point and click adventure. It has a typical inventory system with the ability to combine items to solve puzzles and modify the environment to progress through the game. The puzzles are challenging but nothing hardcore at all. I was able to get through the game only using the hint system twice and it was only to confirm I was trying to do the correct thing after feeling stuck. The dialog is ok and read at a good pace for the different characters. The voice acting is not the best. It varies in tone and volume, sometimes from one line to the next. I can’t be too critical as this is an older game. The story starts out as a murder mystery but quickly evolves into something bigger that you uncover. The only gripe is the pacing felt uneven and really accelerated towards the end. I was caught off guard when the game ended. Pros+Classic click and point adventure style+Puzzles are not overly challenging (personal preference)+Lots of characters you interact with+Manual save system+Environments are drawn nicelyCons+Uneven pacing of story+Abrupt end+Iffy voice acting and overall quality of voice+Almost too much hand holding6/10 Above averageBroken Sword has an interesting story combined with challenging yet manageable puzzles. Solid inventory, notes system and a variety of locations you visit on your journey. The seemingly abrupt ending is a bit disheartening but doesn’t detract from an otherwise traditional click and point adventure game. If you are a fan of point and click, grab this on a sale.			"

												Mediocre story, dumb/easy puzzles, and bad voice acting.  I finished it, but I don't recommend it.Update: Since some people are rating this review as unhelpful I thought I should add a little more detail.  This game is often highly regarded as a great adventure game.  I never played it back upon its first release, so I came at this from a fresh perspective.  I thought the game was very poor compared to other classic adventure games for the reasons I stated above.  But everyone's tastes are different.  I have played other older adventure games in recent years that I also never played before and I really enjoyed them, so this isn't a case of not liking it because it's old or something.  I love adventure games.  This game is not bad, it just isn't worth recommending when there are so many other great choices, in my opinion.			"

I give this a 10 because this is 1996 game that still can compete with recent games (Director's cut is a well deserved remake from 2010).The mix of exploration, cut-scenes and different puzles makes the story flows nicely.

												This is the ultimate adventure game in my opinion and here is why.The story is what made this so enjoyable, in the years since its release there have been countless mystery novels and fiction books that feature the Knights Templar including Dan Browns Da Vinci Code.THIS CAME FIRSTForget the ""Da Vinci Code"" or ""The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ"" this is the original, and its a video game! There is more heart, character, mystery and comedy in this than most mystery/thriller movies or books. I think i first played this at the age of 13, and was absolutley blown away, to this day i honestly think this is the game i have finished the most out of any game. Its like a good book you read over and over, you know every line of it but keep going back for more.Even with the updated directors cut, it still didnt take away anything from the game. Don't take my word for it, play this game, if anything try and tell me its not full of soul and heart!			"

												It sort of makes me sad that I only turned to this game when I had no other options during Sandy Fest 2012 because it really deserves more attention, particularly if you're an adventure game fan. The game's got likable characters (Nico is my new French waifu), great writing, interesting locations (Paris, Syria and Ireland to name a few) and clever puzzles. The same goes for BS2 & 3. All in all, a shining example of what modern adventure games can/should be. Anyone even remotely interested in adventure games needs to give the Broken Sword series a shot. The Trilogy was in a recent indie bundle so I'm sure you could easily find people who would trade you steam keys for TF2 swag.			"

A string of mysterious murders inexplicably ties them together and they will need to learn to trust and rely upon each other if they are to solve this bizarre case.			"

												This is a classic adventure game that has aged very well and is worthy of this rerelease. It is a rather lengthy game with a good story and allot of people to talk to talk to all of which are voice acted. The game play is more puzzle based than combining every item in your inventory to create a super item though there are brief moments of this. The puzzles are fun and there is a good hint system in the game that gives u several hints instead of just the answer outright. This is a great game and worth the money you would spend on it. After finishing it all i can think of now is playing the sequel.			"

												A staple adventure game with nice art and animation and an intriguing mystery that involves the Knights Templar. Plot & Story: It was intriguing for most of the game, but I feel like it lacked the kind of pizzazz ending needed. The beginning of the game is from Nico's point of view; unfortunately, though we do meet her again playing as George, the two segments don't seem to fit together so well. Dialogue: I loved the humorous dialogue: ""How satisfying! An Anglo-American alliance that actually worked!""Puzzles: I loathed that one puzzle, and the unconvincing [redacted spoiler]. Besides that one puzzle, the puzzles were great and pretty straightforward.			"

												Love the story but directors cut is like it says its been cut up and has alot of missing parts. Director's cut is not the verison they should have on steam. The original is much better then the director's cut. They cut alot of the story and got rid of some of cool 3d parts. So Sad. I recommend the Original Broken Sword.			"

												It's not a perfect adventure game and half the minor characters sound like they're voiced by the same bad VA, but if you see it go on sale, it's well worth the pocket change that you'll put towards buying it. It's stylized, it's deep, and it has a good sense of humour.			"

												As adventure games go, this one is an absolute win so far. It looks clean and the sound and voicework is fantastic.  The story's been engaging, and there's some pretty crafty puzzles. Enjoying it at least as much as I did the Blackwell games, but this one seems to be significantly longer.			"

Funny, smart, and with few illogical puzzles, this is a great pick up for those looking for some old school adventure fun.The Remastered version of Broken Sword 1 & 2 offer some nice upgrades, and make them a little easier to swallow for modern players.

												What is there to really say about this game that hasn't been said already? If you are a fan of the point and click genre and you haven't played this game then stop reading and buy this game! It's consider a classic and one of the best for a reason.  The graphics are BEAUTIFUL - best out of the series.  So colorful.  The voice acting is spot on.  The puzzles are challenging but make sense.  The mystery/story is exciting.  Honestly one of the best I have ever played and I intend to play it many more times.This game took me about 9 hours of game play, I have played through it twice now.			"

												Bugged. I solve the code at the start of the game but the game doesnt acknowledge it is solved and dont permit to continue the adventure. Terrible design. I'm not that annoyed since the character is painfully slow and insist on walking to every point. See the difference with a game like ""the next big thing"" where you can have characters instajump from one point of the screen to the others AND also dont walk slowly when you want to enjoy the scenery.Shows his age.

												I deeply regret discovering the Broken Sword series as late as I have. I am a huge fan of the classic adventure game genre - always have been thanks in no small part to my father, who has fond memories even of the original Zork. Broken Sword should have been a huge part of my life years ago, and while it wasn't, I couldn't be happier that it is now. Amazing 2D art style, fantastic writing and voice acting, some of the best puzzles the genre has to offer - all of it is just... breathtaking. I finished the game in one long, sleepess night full of clicking and thinking, fully immersed in this world presented to me. The story is wholly unique and spectacular and the characters are beautifully constructed. At this point, I'm gushing, but really, this game really shocked me at just how well put together it is. I highly reccommend it, both to fans of the genre and fans of a good old fashioned story. (My one complaint is that, for the Director's Cut version, they recorded new dialogue for Nico. However, the rest of the game uses the old dialogue from the original game, and the transition between the two qualities of sound can be rather jarring.)Score: 9.5/10 "

												I love Broken Sword The Shadow Of The Templars, ever since it's original release in 1996, and I had a lot of excitement for this version which I FINALLY got around to playing, but it's disappointing, I don't like how one can't click on everything to explore, I hate being driven by the selections which force you to see where the puzzles are instead of finding them oneself, it feels like hand holding....On the other side, I like and also dislike the new puzzle elements for things like the door in the well, it doesn't make sense to use a number lock for a key that one has already found, the window made no sense either... but I did like new puzzle screens, the rest felt ruined and overdone.Nico's story was okay, but I was expecting more, maybe see her planning the museum caper, but nopes, so a little disappointed there. All in all, I'd give this 4 out of 10, maybe some people who never played the original will like this and that's fine, but some of us who lived thru the original may feel let down. It depends on the person playing I guess, and it's not one I think does justice.			"

												Back to sweet paris.....Broken sword is a traditional point and click game, if you don't like the genre then you won't be won over, but if you do then you MUST try out this series, although as usual the first one is the best one. The game follows George Stobbart an american tourist who is sat outside a cafe when it blows up, he sees a clown run out and, well then you take over. Controlling George you must pick up any object you can find and figure out its use to solve puzzles, same as most point and click games.The story is truly amazing and just gets better and better until the very end, the characters are great and the dialogue is actually quite funny at times. The graphics are hand drawn backgrounds with 2d animated almost cartonny looking characters, it has aged brilliantley.The directos cut makes several changes, some great, and some bad. The biggest change is the inclusion of playing as Nico, a french reporter assisitng George. Actually you play as her first this time, which in my opionion ruined the incredible intro, but oh well, the parts you play as her are good, if not really needed. Certain things have been completely removed, such as the ability to get killed in certain segments, and random items you could examine before can no longer be looked at. George travels all over the world on his first adventure, you get to see, Paris, Syria, Spain and even Ireland, and each location has its own charm, it gives the game a lot of variety.Overall a truly great entry into its genre, and would suggest it even if you haven't played one before, as it was my first time playing a game liek this it taught me well, no crazy hard puzzles, except a certain goat........Pros-Great story-Great voice work-Great graphical style-Good Puzzles-Good way to get into GenreCons-Opening not as powerful as it used to be-Death sections removed9/10			"

												Perhaps nostaliga is making my opinion is somewhat biased, but I preferred the original. The graphical update is nice, but - and here's where I might be biased - I prefer how it used to look. This being said, I've not played the original in a long time, so I may be entirely wrong about that - they may look almost identical. This doesn't really matter too much - the graphics are good enough to not be a hinderance. The UI however - and general control of the game - has been changed. As the game was developed for the wii/ds, certain click/drag puzzles (such as sliding puzzles, or puzzles that need precision clicking) don't work as well with a mouse. While you could quite quickly press the inventory button and drag the item to whatever it needs to be used on, having to move the mouse to do this feels a little clunky - and this is the reason why I can't recommend this game. In the original, there were a number of places where your character could die, but (I assume at the request of Nintendo) they've been removed.  The story addition is nice, but nothing spectacular - just giving a little bit more information as to characters. This version of the game is far easier (aside from death being impossible), the game will highlight usable objects around your mouse, and also includes a hint system. I personally don't have an issue with either of them, but in some sense it does remove needing to 'find' the items, which some may not like. TL;DR - I would say get the original, if you enjoy it, play this.			"

												Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars is a classic, comme-il-faut point and click game. It has a good, solid storyline and creative puzzles that sometimes get you stumped for days. For those of you who used to watch Relic Hunter some years back, this game puts you exactly there. If it were a cocktail, it'd surely be a stout drink of creative brain juices with a shot of adrenalin (hint: you might want to save from time to time). I don't know what it's like to come back to this game after years and finding that the original has been changed into the Director's Cut, but to me, as a first time player, it was a pretty good game (and the fact that it signals out the objects you can interact with only makes it more coherent, since you don't waste time pixel hunting only to forget why you were doing it in the first place).

												Broken Sword is a fantastic game, and the director's cut edition certainly attempts to improve upon it, but some of the attempts come over as rather half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and not well thought of.GameplayThe game plays like a typical point & click adventure game. You search for objects and interaction points in the environment that the objects can interact with. Unfortunately, the object interaction is rather two-dimensional. Where monkey island used verbs (e.g., 'use X on Y', 'look at X', 'push X', 'pull X', 'talk to X', 'open X', 'close X', 'talk to X'), the interface of Broken Sword is very much simplified. A left click performs the main action on a target, while a right click inspects the target. The main interaction is whatever the game deems you should do to the target. A door gets opened, a person gets spoken to, a button gets pushed. This removes a bunch of interactions, while streamlining the gaming process. Furthermore, it makes it very easy to just try out every object on every target if you are stuck. Five objects on 1 target result in 5 actions, yet 9 verbs for 5 objects on 1 target results in 45 actions, forcing you to think rather than just to try.The gameplay in the DC edition has been further simplified. For instance, actions cannot lead to player death anymore. Instead, the character will inform you that what you're about to do is definitely not a good idea. Objects are highlighted on the screen, so they're very easy to find. While carefully examining the screen makes you think about what objects would be interesting to inspect, highlighting the objects removes this entirely. While it can be cumbersome, I personally feel it is part of the game and do not consider this an improvement. At the very least, this should have been an optional setting we could enable or disable.Hints are certainly a good addition to the game. Nowadays with the easy access to walkthroughs, the temptation is too large to just ruin the game for yourself if you really get stuck (it keeps getting easier and easier to resort to a walkthrough). Hints will help you out, but still make you think. This is an excellent solution to the widespread availability of walkthroughs.Talking to NPCs in the game is done by using avatars/player faces (or however you want to call it). I'm not a big fan of those, as I prefer the old method where text was displayed above the character in a distinct color. This is probably just nostalgia speaking, though, so I can hardly blame the devs for making this alteration.More ContentThe DC edition has more scenes than the original, and that's fantastic. Unfortunately, it seems not all of those scenes are voiced by the same characters and at the same audio quality. In some cases this is really noticable, even without a good set of headphones. The extra scenes are very welcome, though, especially if you are a big fan of the series. It just feels like the developer either did not know how to prevent inconsistencies with the content (e.g., different graphical styles that clash, and audio quality and voice differences) or approached it in a very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥way.ConclusionWhile the game is worth the asking price, I'm drawn on whether I would recommend the director's cut edition or the original. The DC edition has the advantage of being on the steam platform and having extra content, but it also adds some aspects you simply cannot disable that diminish the gaming experience.As a result I will recommend this game only because the original is not steam. It is a shame, though, that they did not allow you to switch between the original and the DC edition in the settings. In that case, the game would have gotten a more certain recommendation from me, and most of the criticism would be trivial.			"

												A solid point and click adventure, and a very famous one as well.First of all: If you are into the genre, I recommend the game, but there are certainly points of critisim to make.There are some really stupid plot holes, as well as unbelievable character developments. Fe.: Certain drawings are wrong or differentiate from the dialouge popup to the actual character model. A window had a hole cut into it from the outside on a lower part of it then from the inside. Some solutions to puzzles wouldnt be solveable in reallife. at the end the main characters kill roughly 20 ppl and dont even mention it anymore.. The characters mostly act on pure coincidence rather then on common sense, making it hard to sometimes solve puzzles for no reason other then ""because"". One puzzle from the directors cut to mention here, you gotta solve chivered letter and one letter only accurs ones at in the entire letter, as a signitur, on its own. If you place all other characters correctly, the last one remaining is the signature which is: ""X.""..... but you have many letters from the alphabet left that are not used, so really the signiture could be any of 5 or 6 different letters.... Yet your character only accepts ""the one true solution"".As in other p&c adventures your  main characters show no hesitation of just stealing useless crap (and holding on to it) for no reason at all (fe. tools from toolboxes, random cloth pieces, a toilet chain, plaster, and a towel), while being the good guys (in deponia fe you are at least a ""i dont give a ♥♥♥♥"" kinda person, while you are playing good people in this one). Of course most of theses items are magicly important 20% later into the story, but there is no way the character could have ever know that days beforehand.Simply put, the motivation of the characters is basicly non-existing. The entire premise of the main plot is based on the main character being near a crime when it happend. His thinking: I gonna solve this murder..... BECAUSE! THATS WHY! Justice... and stuff.... i guess?Finally: The new story elements are hidden from niko from the actual main character, for no apparent reason, just so they developers woulndt have to rewrite parts of the original game. Its rather clumsely pasted inbetween the first half of the base game.Aside of this story flaws. The drawings are acceptable, yet you can clearly recognize the new content of the directors cut due to its higher resolution and as mentioned above, does sometimes display slightly different clothing etc.The higher resolution options sadly dont include a 16:9, the game is locked to 4:3. But thats to excuse due to a original release date of 1996 (afaik).Now to the actual gameplay:The puzzles are nice, not repetetive and sometimes very challanging. Yet some parts are just not correctly explained or hinted during the storyline. One part especially points you towards a ceratin location (both in dialouge and the diary) but actually wants you to go somewhere else entierly, without the directors cuts addition of the hint system this wouldnt be solveable at all. This situation happens about 2 or 3 times during the game, but only onces its a clear mistake of the devs (or translators maybe?).Other then that the directors cut adds new puzzles and doesnt just rehash older ones, as well as adding new setpieces and animations.Despite my review sounding rather negative the overall experience of the game is very good. I recommend this game, for genre lovers that is. If you dont like point and click adventures, what are you even doing here?If you like them, nothing tooooooo wrong with this. Flaws? Yes. But have you played monkey island 2? Same flaws.Its good.'nuff said.			"

												I would consider myself generally a fan of point and click adventure games, and this one comes recommended highly. Unfortunately I became bored about 1/3 of the way through and chugging through any of the remaining locations became a complete chore.A lot of people would apparently disagree with me but I feel like there must be a nostalgia factor that I'm missing out on. Objectively speaking, this game would have been fantastic to experience in 1996. Plenty of witty banter and dialogue, and fluidly animated cutscenes. It's damn impressive how much animation is provided for random interactions that don't even advance the story in any way.But that's sort of the problem. At first it's not a big deal- there are a few characters to interact with, and a few items in your inventory. It's neat to experience the combination of interactions. Until both categories grow larger and you suddently have to start asking every single person about every single item. Some interactions are over quickly, some take minutes to complete as the NPC tells you something inane. Speeding through interactions can become clunky as you watch your character stumble around the screen with their pathfinding alorithm only to show up at their destination and shrug their shoulders, a way of telling the player 'nope, that won't work.' Fine, but you could have just said that to begin with.I was absolutely shocked to find out that apparently this Director's cut had substantial sections of dialogue missing. With each syllable of spoken dialogue I pray that the game takes mercy on me and makes it the last. And you guys wanted MORE?You might argue that the superfluous dialogue is optional. You don't have to ask everyone about everything. Well, sometimes you do. Sometimes when the puzzle solutions are completely arbitrary you'll wander around for ages in hopes of obtaining a relevant clue, only to find that you forgot to use that one item on that one thing that gives you that one other thing. Because why wouldn't you need that one thing. Of course you need to take a tissue full of facepaint all the way to syria, to polish a statue, to sell to a tourist, to get fifty dollars, to buy a cab ride. Never mind that you've been eating, living, and travelling for days on your own budget. THE GAME HAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THING YOU WANT.You might also argue that I have a short attention span. I want to know which one of you enjoyed pounding through minutes of dialogue with the shrill-voiced woman in the hotel just to get that room key. The dialogue is not really witty. I laughed a few times because of how stupid it was.The story is arbitrary and convoluted. I didn't think I could enjoy a game like this so little.			"

												I bought the BS series (except the 4. one, steam reviewers thought it sucked and fairly irrelevant to the story) in a sale after seeing it has five games and a fairly big fan base and thought this must be good and it is not bad I'd say but doesn't really deserve all the praise. Maybe it did back then but now it's just an average point and click adventure game with annoyingly slow moving characters and a hugely out of place main character. Not regretting buying it but hopefully the rest of the games are better.			"

												A classic game that I enjoyed very much when I first played it in 2000. It has a lot of positives: its characters, moments of humour and difficult puzzles to solve with an interesting and intriguing story. The reason why I was left disappointed its because the new content, although it is very well done and it adds a few new puzzles and conversations, this is at the cost of some cuts in conversations and cutscenes from the main game. Another problem that I had is the game difficulty. They added a so much needed help button which gives you hints on how to solve some puzzles, great addition to prevent frustration. But I found out that some of the most difficult puzzles were changed to be easily solved and I dislike that. I think that the help button was enough. You can get this game for the same price in GOG and you also get the original one which I recommend playing rather than the director's cut.			"

												As the game that first hooked me on the point and click genre I'll admit that I have a massive soft spot for Broken Sword.I much prefer the original version to the directors cut as I don't think the added scenes really fit all that well into the narrative and the newly recorded dialogue has a distinctly different sound to it.The puzzles can be slightly obscure, however once you get in to it the globe spanning story ""of music, of cafes, of love, and of death."" smooths the way into a very cinematic experience.The story is well written and the acting is certainly more than good enough if you're willing to ignore some cliched accents.If you're a fan of the genre you could do a lot worse than give this a try.

I was expecting more graphics wise from this remake the animations are rubbish and you cant choose your display resolution you can only stretch the 640x480 display to fit your screen resulting in black borders if you have a widscreen.

												As a fan of 90s point and click adventure games I had never played the Broken Sword games and so with the DC ported to Linux I finally did!The game played fine, apart from the fact that I was not able to switch virtual desktops or alt-tab, which was a bit annoying...I just read that the DC added new content for Nico, which is great, I haven't seen any remastered game doing something like that and smoothly! (Double Fine, maybe something to learn?)I liked the hints in game, it must have been super useful in the 90s, though the last one is not a hint but the solution and that's no good!The game plays well,though I find it a bit unbalanced, some puzzles are really easy while others took me a while to figure out. It might be the difference between new and old content though.The voice acting was fine, though a bit strange that French people speak English between them but with a French accent.. it made me wonder if the original language should have been French.The story is nice (I usually like templars games) though eventually I got a bit lost with all the names.I didn't like the ending at all though, it feels weak and too quick.Let's not mention the forced romance either...Overall a really nice game with a lot of content, though not my favorite in the genre.It should been fairly nice to replay as I don't think I'll remember most of the puzzles unlike other games.

												A classic point and click. Some say the greatest point and click adventure in the canon, and it was certainly the one that got me into the genre. No spoilers here, but one advantage to the directors cut is the addition of the hits system. Whilst I feel that this is technically cheating, i have to admit that I did use it a couple of times. The fact that it gives you hits rather than out right giving you the answer strait off makes this a highly usable and intuative system.Basically, if you like adventure games, you will love the dry whit and the puzzle solving of this game.

The game's got likable characters (Nico is my new French waifu), great writing, interesting locations (Paris, Syria and Ireland to name a few) and clever puzzles. The same goes for BS2 & 3. All in all, a shining example of what modern adventure games can/should be. Anyone even remotely interested in adventure games needs to give the Broken Sword series a shot. The Trilogy was in a recent indie bundle so I'm sure you could easily find people who would trade you steam keys for TF2 swag.			"

												Very well-written point-and-click adventureThis game has a captivating story and some of the best dialogue I've seen in computer games - it's pretty rare that I laugh out aloud at a game, but this one does it all the time. The characters are developed well. The graphics are simple by today's standards, 2D characters on a static 2D background, but is beautifully done and atmospheric.The gameplay is perhaps a bit simplistic. There isn't really any way to make a mistake - kind of like in the old Lucasfilm games. The game can be solved by clicking on everything and trying all combinations of items; the worst that can happen is that nothing happens. The plot is also rather linear.Still, I'm thoroughly enjoying Broken Sword - one of the nicest games I've played in recent times. If you liked the old Lucasgame adventures, or point-and-click adventures with a strong story in general, you'll love this title. "

												Point and clicks will always have that nostalgic feeling, and is a style that always fits in with mystery. Though the frustration of most in this genre is where you miss that combination of items, or did not see where to click.   There is a hint system that slowly guides you in the direction without completely spoiling the puzzle.The story itself is a blend of realism and a bit of supernatural, but the characters show themselves to have a bit of depth to help develop the story.It's not the best of the point and clicks, but it was a step in the right direction compared to the many that was released.

The puzzles are a mixture of item using and minigames. Nothing too difficult and manages to avoid anything too convoluted. By highlighting all areas of interest it also avoids a lot of the pixelhunting that older adventure games were prone to.All in all a good time if you like adventure games.

												Broken Sword is a fantastic game, and the director's cut edition certainly attempts to improve upon it, but some of the attempts come over as rather half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and not well thought of.GameplayThe game plays like a typical point & click adventure game. You search for objects and interaction points in the environment that the objects can interact with. Unfortunately, the object interaction is rather two-dimensional. Where monkey island used verbs (e.g., 'use X on Y', 'look at X', 'push X', 'pull X', 'talk to X', 'open X', 'close X', 'talk to X'), the interface of Broken Sword is very much simplified. A left click performs the main action on a target, while a right click inspects the target. The main interaction is whatever the game deems you should do to the target. A door gets opened, a person gets spoken to, a button gets pushed. This removes a bunch of interactions, while streamlining the gaming process. Furthermore, it makes it very easy to just try out every object on every target if you are stuck. Five objects on 1 target result in 5 actions, yet 9 verbs for 5 objects on 1 target results in 45 actions, forcing you to think rather than just to try.The gameplay in the DC edition has been further simplified. For instance, actions cannot lead to player death anymore. Instead, the character will inform you that what you're about to do is definitely not a good idea. Objects are highlighted on the screen, so they're very easy to find. While carefully examining the screen makes you think about what objects would be interesting to inspect, highlighting the objects removes this entirely. While it can be cumbersome, I personally feel it is part of the game and do not consider this an improvement. At the very least, this should have been an optional setting we could enable or disable.Hints are certainly a good addition to the game. Nowadays with the easy access to walkthroughs, the temptation is too large to just ruin the game for yourself if you really get stuck (it keeps getting easier and easier to resort to a walkthrough). Hints will help you out, but still make you think. This is an excellent solution to the widespread availability of walkthroughs.Talking to NPCs in the game is done by using avatars/player faces (or however you want to call it). I'm not a big fan of those, as I prefer the old method where text was displayed above the character in a distinct color. This is probably just nostalgia speaking, though, so I can hardly blame the devs for making this alteration.More ContentThe DC edition has more scenes than the original, and that's fantastic. Unfortunately, it seems not all of those scenes are voiced by the same characters and at the same audio quality. In some cases this is really noticable, even without a good set of headphones. The extra scenes are very welcome, though, especially if you are a big fan of the series. It just feels like the developer either did not know how to prevent inconsistencies with the content (e.g., different graphical styles that clash, and audio quality and voice differences) or approached it in a very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥way.ConclusionWhile the game is worth the asking price, I'm drawn on whether I would recommend the director's cut edition or the original. The DC edition has the advantage of being on the steam platform and having extra content, but it also adds some aspects you simply cannot disable that diminish the gaming experience.As a result I will recommend this game only because the original is not steam. It is a shame, though, that they did not allow you to switch between the original and the DC edition in the settings. In that case, the game would have gotten a more certain recommendation from me, and most of the criticism would be trivial.			"

												A solid point and click adventure, and a very famous one as well.First of all: If you are into the genre, I recommend the game, but there are certainly points of critisim to make.There are some really stupid plot holes, as well as unbelievable character developments. Fe.: Certain drawings are wrong or differentiate from the dialouge popup to the actual character model. A window had a hole cut into it from the outside on a lower part of it then from the inside. Some solutions to puzzles wouldnt be solveable in reallife. at the end the main characters kill roughly 20 ppl and dont even mention it anymore.. The characters mostly act on pure coincidence rather then on common sense, making it hard to sometimes solve puzzles for no reason other then ""because"". One puzzle from the directors cut to mention here, you gotta solve chivered letter and one letter only accurs ones at in the entire letter, as a signitur, on its own. If you place all other characters correctly, the last one remaining is the signature which is: ""X.""..... but you have many letters from the alphabet left that are not used, so really the signiture could be any of 5 or 6 different letters.... Yet your character only accepts ""the one true solution"".As in other p&c adventures your  main characters show no hesitation of just stealing useless crap (and holding on to it) for no reason at all (fe. tools from toolboxes, random cloth pieces, a toilet chain, plaster, and a towel), while being the good guys (in deponia fe you are at least a ""i dont give a ♥♥♥♥"" kinda person, while you are playing good people in this one). Of course most of theses items are magicly important 20% later into the story, but there is no way the character could have ever know that days beforehand.Simply put, the motivation of the characters is basicly non-existing. The entire premise of the main plot is based on the main character being near a crime when it happend. His thinking: I gonna solve this murder..... BECAUSE! THATS WHY! Justice... and stuff.... i guess?Finally: The new story elements are hidden from niko from the actual main character, for no apparent reason, just so they developers woulndt have to rewrite parts of the original game. Its rather clumsely pasted inbetween the first half of the base game.Aside of this story flaws. The drawings are acceptable, yet you can clearly recognize the new content of the directors cut due to its higher resolution and as mentioned above, does sometimes display slightly different clothing etc.The higher resolution options sadly dont include a 16:9, the game is locked to 4:3. But thats to excuse due to a original release date of 1996 (afaik).Now to the actual gameplay:The puzzles are nice, not repetetive and sometimes very challanging. Yet some parts are just not correctly explained or hinted during the storyline. One part especially points you towards a ceratin location (both in dialouge and the diary) but actually wants you to go somewhere else entierly, without the directors cuts addition of the hint system this wouldnt be solveable at all. This situation happens about 2 or 3 times during the game, but only onces its a clear mistake of the devs (or translators maybe?).Other then that the directors cut adds new puzzles and doesnt just rehash older ones, as well as adding new setpieces and animations.Despite my review sounding rather negative the overall experience of the game is very good. I recommend this game, for genre lovers that is. If you dont like point and click adventures, what are you even doing here?If you like them, nothing tooooooo wrong with this. Flaws? Yes. But have you played monkey island 2? Same flaws.Its good.'nuff said.			"

												If you haven't played this game yet, you should. Even at full price, it's worth at least trying out this classic game. Apparently this Director's Cut version changed a few things from the original and some people are complaining about it, but a first time player won't miss out on anything. It's a very charming game that will suck you in and make you want to keep playing until the end. Even though there are a few problems with the game it's still enjoyable. It's basically an interactive novel with an interesting story, funny commentary, cool characters, and lots of suspenseful moments. As long as you don't take it too seriously and don't dwell on all the minor issues, you'll be in for a real treat. And then you have 4 more Broken Sword games to look forward to.			"

												Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars is one of the most popular point-and-click adventure games made in the 1990's.  Originally released in 1996, the 2009 Director's Cut is an update that adds additional content as well as change some parts of the game, the latter which will be described later.As a note, while Nico Collard appears in most of the screenshots and in the banner on Steam, the vast majority of the game is centered around George Stobbart.  This is a heads up to those who were looking forward to playing as a female protagonist.  Having never played the original, I can only accurately comment on the Director's Cut version.  It's pretty apparent while playing where the new audio is used due to the difference in audio quality.  The newer audio sounds fuller with less static while the older ones sound a bit quieter.  Fortunately, despite the differences there's no noticeable variations between the voice acting of the same characters, which would've been jarring if there were.  Because this is not a modern remake, the artwork, while beautiful, is noticeably lower resolution, so I preferred to play it in windowed mode.  As another note, playing fullscreen on a 16:9 ratio monitor will leave the game in its original 4:3 ratio with blackbars on either side, which I prefer to a stretched image.  Also for some reason it looks like Nico Collard wasn't completely animated by hand as certain actions will replace her sprite with a 3D model.Overall the game has solid puzzles and a good comedy vibe to a rather serious plot.   There are many locations to visit and a soundtrack to match, and there is plenty of dialogue and banter between characters.  There is a hint system if you get stuck, but I highly recommend to try your hardest to solve the puzzles yourself otherwise you may spoil your enjoyment of the game.  Despite its age, the game is not dated and is recommended to all those who enjoy point-and-click adventure games.  My wish for improvements in the game would be for more consistency between the newer assets and the game.  Also having read about the differences between the original version and the Director's Cut, I wish that this version would have all of the content available in the original and any differences between the two would've been toggable in the options.  I think these changes would've satisfied those new and old to the game.________________________Now onto the differences between the original and Director's Cut.  Because I haven't played the original, I can only comment on the more obvious changes that I've read about.- It's possible to die in the original game.- Removal of interactions with many objects in the game. This change is probably due to the nature of the times where people have more games to play and are less likely to continue if they get stuck.  The downside is less dialogue.			"

												I'd gotten this in a Humble Bundle several months back and never played it. I finally decided to sit down and play through the first level and see if I liked it -- and I ended up playing through about the first 3/4s in one sitting. It was surprisingly engrossing, and the puzzles were just about the right difficultly for me to have to think about them without pulling up a solutions page out of frustration. What's actually one of the best things about this game is that in the director's cut there's an in game hint feature for when you get completely stuck! That to me is the reason this game is a recommend. It doesn't matter if you're good and point and click adventures or not. The in game help guide doesn't spoil the solution at first but simply gives prompts to show you where you may have gone wrong. In my play through I missed one clue and couldn't figure out why I couldn't move on, having the in game hint system helped me to realize what I had missed without spoiling the rest of the puzzle. I love that! Sometimes I miss really obvious things and with other puzzlers can end up stuck unless I want to cheat.The story line is sincerely good. I liked the amount of real historical research I felt went into it. Everything felt to me like it was actually plausible seeming. The Knights Templar is a super interesting historical subject to begin with, and this game sets up a continuing story line about it in a very sincere and realistic way. Also there are journalism jokes. That alone makes this game worth getting.Pros- great voice acting- clever story- solutions to puzzles in game if you get stuckCons- only about 4 hours long- disjointed animation - needs more Nico			"

I am French and Georges was having such a lovely american accent in the original version.In the French version they kept it here but in all the additional scenes (director cut's) you can notice easily that there is an other voice. The mix between the two voices for the same character definitely RUIN the experience. So ugly to hear.Secondly, the mix between the old graphics and the new ones (Nico is drawn more precisely with a higher resolution than Georges) also give a weird taste.Globally I feel like this director cut's version is nothing more than an ugly bandage on a healthy leg.I was expecting to enjoy again this wonderful game, it has finished in the trash... what a disappointment!!!

												I'd already played through the original Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars a while back and when I saw that the director's cut edition was on Steam, I had to get it. Still following the same storyline, but adding Nico as a playable character and how her investigations tie in with the main questline, it was certainly enjoyable. The addition of this helped to flesh out the story more and an extended ending was nice too. The addition of new puzzles was also nice too.But, as with any game, there are flaws. Many of the possible death scenes in the original were removed from the director's cut edition, and the audio quality of the sounds did vary immensely as some was clearly taken from the original. Some of the puzzles were tricky to figure out and some even had precursors that weren't clearly defined, but maybe that's because I was a little rusty!All in all, this is a game definitely worth playing and the new content certainly adds to the background.

												Curse of Monkey Island being my favourite adventure game ever, Broken Sword has revealed itself to be a pretty big disappointment. The setting and lore employed in the game is extremely fascinating, just as the lovely hand-drawn backgrounds, but all that potential is squandered by the awful remastering (the portraits are amateurish and the dialogues are horribly acted and translated, at least in Italian) and by the bare bones gameplay. In fact 80% of the puzzles are about distracting someone to do something (I wish the whole game was built around the remaining 10%: mechanisms, old texts to translate, codes and such), speaking to people is a chore, because they too often keep rambling about personal stuff or other inane and absolutely humorless things, there's not enough stuff to check in those beatufil backrgounds, making oft too obvious the solution to a problem, there are no dialogue options, far too few items, silly choices (the only guy who wants to shake your electric hand in the whole game is the assassin? REALLY?), and you constantly feel as if you're forced in a certain direction. The plot is intriguing at first, but soon becomes too complex for its own good, with too many worthless, two-dimensional characters, and too many unanswered questions: most of the time you proceed through the game wondering why you're doing something, or what you have to do; George himself admits to have no clue about what they're searching at one point. By the way, George Stobbart has to be the most dumb and annoying main character in the history of gaming.			"

												I played this game as a kid and I never got to finish it. I since started two further attempts of finally beating the game, but due to reasons I can't remember, I kinda lost track of it (You know how it is with games sometimes).However, when I saw it on steam a few weeks ago, I thought to myself that now is finally the time to beat this game once and for all. And Oh my God was it worth it!This game has everything that a good game needs to have. It's thrilling, emotional, has a nice artistic-style to it and is just overall a very good game. Every piece of this story just fits so well into one another and you can really feel, that there has been put a lot of thought into this game. The characters are always convincing and it's really fun to explore the world of Broken Sword. This game even has a new Storyline added to the game, that fits very well into the overall storyline. It adds approximately 2 Hours to the original game, which is very nice. You also get some new features with the Remastered Version, such as small dialog-windows, whenever you talk to someone, ""updated""/remastered riddles and puzzles, HotSpot-markers and a Hint-feature that shows itself to be very helpful when you are stuck with something. When you beat the game you'll get a small surprise, which made me love the game even more :)Broken Sword is a game that has been thought trough from start to finish. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes Point-And-Click adventures from this time (Monkey Island, Day of The Tentacle, etc.), adventure games in general or to anyone who just enjoys a well-written and thrilling story. This game made me feel so nostalgic and has not alone therefore probably earned a place in my Top 20 games list.			"

												The best and most original classic point and click adventure game, apart from The Secret of Monkey Island. Funny, entertaining and a mystery that rivals that of the Da Vinci Code based on the Knights Templar and has the American tourist George Stobbart trekking across Europe and Syria. Yes the graphics and sound quality are somewhat dated, but the puzzles are excellent, the hint system useful if you get really stuck, the voice acting is brilliant although the sound quality is not as good as newer games. I have played this game four times now, and I can recommend this game and all of the Broken Sword games if you like a great puzzle game, that is really funny, with a great story and fully developed characterisation. Buy it to add to your library it's well worth the purchase.			"

Fortunately, despite the differences there's no noticeable variations between the voice acting of the same characters, which would've been jarring if there were.  Because this is not a modern remake, the artwork, while beautiful, is noticeably lower resolution, so I preferred to play it in windowed mode.  As another note, playing fullscreen on a 16:9 ratio monitor will leave the game in its original 4:3 ratio with blackbars on either side, which I prefer to a stretched image.  Also for some reason it looks like Nico Collard wasn't completely animated by hand as certain actions will replace her sprite with a 3D model.Overall the game has solid puzzles and a good comedy vibe to a rather serious plot.   There are many locations to visit and a soundtrack to match, and there is plenty of dialogue and banter between characters.  There is a hint system if you get stuck, but I highly recommend to try your hardest to solve the puzzles yourself otherwise you may spoil your enjoyment of the game.  Despite its age, the game is not dated and is recommended to all those who enjoy point-and-click adventure games.  My wish for improvements in the game would be for more consistency between the newer assets and the game.  Also having read about the differences between the original version and the Director's Cut, I wish that this version would have all of the content available in the original and any differences between the two would've been toggable in the options.  I think these changes would've satisfied those new and old to the game.________________________Now onto the differences between the original and Director's Cut.  Because I haven't played the original, I can only comment on the more obvious changes that I've read about.- It's possible to die in the original game.- Removal of interactions with many objects in the game. This change is probably due to the nature of the times where people have more games to play and are less likely to continue if they get stuck.  The downside is less dialogue.			"

												Perhaps nostaliga is making my opinion is somewhat biased, but I preferred the original. The graphical update is nice, but - and here's where I might be biased - I prefer how it used to look. This being said, I've not played the original in a long time, so I may be entirely wrong about that - they may look almost identical. This doesn't really matter too much - the graphics are good enough to not be a hinderance. The UI however - and general control of the game - has been changed. As the game was developed for the wii/ds, certain click/drag puzzles (such as sliding puzzles, or puzzles that need precision clicking) don't work as well with a mouse. While you could quite quickly press the inventory button and drag the item to whatever it needs to be used on, having to move the mouse to do this feels a little clunky - and this is the reason why I can't recommend this game. In the original, there were a number of places where your character could die, but (I assume at the request of Nintendo) they've been removed.  The story addition is nice, but nothing spectacular - just giving a little bit more information as to characters. This version of the game is far easier (aside from death being impossible), the game will highlight usable objects around your mouse, and also includes a hint system. I personally don't have an issue with either of them, but in some sense it does remove needing to 'find' the items, which some may not like. TL;DR - I would say get the original, if you enjoy it, play this.			"

												The game that started my love affair with George Stobbart and his terrible penchant for big trouble! But what fun trouble it is! Great dialog, amazing main characters and supporting cast alike, an exciting story about the American tourist turned super sleuth as a conspiracy comes full circle and beautiful visuals that bring Paris, Ireland, Syria and Scotland to life! One of my favorite point and clicks ever, big cheers for Charles Cecil!			"

												Classic point/click adventure game. Good voice acting, set in paris, mystery/thriller with occult influence. Nothing new or surprising here but decent work on the animations, backgrounds, and voice acting. Puzzles are nothing spectacular and thus, leaves the game feeling a bit wanting. Otherwise, enjoyable, if not commonplace.TL;DR: Yeaaaaaah, it's alright for what it is - just another adventure game. Don't bother if you have something else to do.			"

												A classic game that I enjoyed very much when I first played it in 2000. It has a lot of positives: its characters, moments of humour and difficult puzzles to solve with an interesting and intriguing story. The reason why I was left disappointed its because the new content, although it is very well done and it adds a few new puzzles and conversations, this is at the cost of some cuts in conversations and cutscenes from the main game. Another problem that I had is the game difficulty. They added a so much needed help button which gives you hints on how to solve some puzzles, great addition to prevent frustration. But I found out that some of the most difficult puzzles were changed to be easily solved and I dislike that. I think that the help button was enough. You can get this game for the same price in GOG and you also get the original one which I recommend playing rather than the director's cut.			"

												As the game that first hooked me on the point and click genre I'll admit that I have a massive soft spot for Broken Sword.I much prefer the original version to the directors cut as I don't think the added scenes really fit all that well into the narrative and the newly recorded dialogue has a distinctly different sound to it.The puzzles can be slightly obscure, however once you get in to it the globe spanning story ""of music, of cafes, of love, and of death."" smooths the way into a very cinematic experience.The story is well written and the acting is certainly more than good enough if you're willing to ignore some cliched accents.If you're a fan of the genre you could do a lot worse than give this a try.

												If you havn't played the original version go play that first. It's a decent enough remake with slightly better graphics and a few adjustments to the story here and there. I was expecting more graphics wise from this remake the animations are rubbish and you cant choose your display resolution you can only stretch the 640x480 display to fit your screen resulting in black borders if you have a widscreen. Its a descent remake and worth buying in a sale if you like the series			"

												As a fan of 90s point and click adventure games I had never played the Broken Sword games and so with the DC ported to Linux I finally did!The game played fine, apart from the fact that I was not able to switch virtual desktops or alt-tab, which was a bit annoying...I just read that the DC added new content for Nico, which is great, I haven't seen any remastered game doing something like that and smoothly! (Double Fine, maybe something to learn?)I liked the hints in game, it must have been super useful in the 90s, though the last one is not a hint but the solution and that's no good!The game plays well,though I find it a bit unbalanced, some puzzles are really easy while others took me a while to figure out. It might be the difference between new and old content though.The voice acting was fine, though a bit strange that French people speak English between them but with a French accent.. it made me wonder if the original language should have been French.The story is nice (I usually like templars games) though eventually I got a bit lost with all the names.I didn't like the ending at all though, it feels weak and too quick.Let's not mention the forced romance either...Overall a really nice game with a lot of content, though not my favorite in the genre.It should been fairly nice to replay as I don't think I'll remember most of the puzzles unlike other games.

												I own the entire Broken Sword Series. I love this original Director's Cut, it's just a brilliant game with a deep and intricate story. I can't say enough good things about the entire Broken Sword series but if you're interested in intriguing and fun adventures, something that has some historical relevance and some taste of reality and fiction, then these games are well worth a try. Without spoiling too much, the destinations were very interesting, I love the main character in the story, the protagonists are believable and the intermittent characters and plots are allot of fun. I literally felt like I was watching a movie or reading a really great book. Lastly the game implements a quarry guide which helps you out in the stickiest of puzzles. Highly recommended if you love Point-Click adventure games. "

												While I don't love the visual style of the game (maybe a little too cartoonish for me), that's just a matter of perference, and it didn't at all detract from the excellent story and pretty good voice acting. If you get stuck, there's a great built-in hint system, but I rarely had to use it. All in all, I give it an VIII out of X.			"

												This is one of my favourite point and click games. The music is great, the puzzles are not too difficult that you need a walkthrough (and even if you do get stuck, the game has an in-built hint system which is awesome) and the characters are witty and humourous. The quality of the voice overs are a bit dubious but other than that, it's a fantastic little murder mystery with conspiracies abound. If you love the Knights Templar you will adore the story line, and if you don't, well, you'll love it anyway because the game also teaches you a bit of history. Definitely give it a go!			"

Broken Sword - A Classic of the Point and Click Genre, just got ClassierSo... There you are, sitting at your computer, expecting to be taken to the cafe, when suddenly, you find yourself thrust into a new beginning, where murder, a mime, and a familiar French photojournalist of notable repute, find you delving into a realm of new puzzles, and an intriguing little mystery of its own. And what about the poor American tourist who has to travel across Europe to solve the more bigger mystery? Well, he's still got his own story, albeit with a few improvements aimed at engaging your brain a bit more. Thought you knew the story well?  Well someone felt a little extra work to solve the mystery of the costume killer and the secret of the Knights Templar was in order.The Director's Cut is just what you expect - an updated classic given extra content and a few more puzzles. While the danger of death is no longer there from making a mistake, it's still remains a nice, calming title to play. While the main story and puzzles you need to solve remain unchanged, the side story involving Nicole is a welcome look extra, and the puzzles added in on both her story and George's are a nice little touch.  This Classic remains a fine example of the Point-and-Click genre, and the updated version just cements how good a game it still remains.			"

												That's definitely the best game in the series (although the other five games are outstanding examples of the genre as well), and I dare say it is one of the best point-and-click adventures I know.The Director's cut unfortunately doesn't have all the dialogue and interactions from the base game, but makes up for it by adding more story.Overall, I recomend this to anyone who likes playing point-and-click quests!
