												Cube & Star is a game I very much wanted to enjoy, but unfortunately, the game doesn't give you enough back to warrant continued play. You're a cube in a mostly-colorless land. You begin your quest mostly without direction. You interact with other cubes and surface-dwellers. You start to color in the environments. You meet a tiny thing and discover there may be more to them to meet the eye. It all seems like something very clever is beneath the surface, but as the hours went by, I couldn't find it. Like the other reviews say, achievements are broken. Even after you decode the language of the tiny things, not much is revealed other than cryptic laments. As you collect currency and stars and such relics, you eventually feel the grind and pointlessness of your quest. You can spend hours coloring in the world...but when you figure out how to open the map and figure out how the big world is....you release you could easily spend another large quantity of hours filling in all the empty spaces. And for what? The tediousness of my journey weighs heavily on my cube-like shoulders, and it is with much regret that I finally ceased to roll across the plains. Cube and Star feels like it aspires to something great but then maddeningly keeps it forever out of reach of the player.			"

												Like Noby Noby Boy and Mountain, this is a toy more than a game. It's a constantly changing environment to interact with, where your cube bumps into stranger and stranger things as you explore the world further. You can influence the world in various ways, but it's a subtle, slow influence, especially compared to the industrious gardening of the game's other characters. So it's a zen game, something to switch off and relax with, an antidote to hours of SpaceChem brainburn. On another level, it's also a commentary on the psychology of achievements. Why collect coins that can never be spent? In a game about spreading colour and life, does it make sense to burn and kill things to unlock one achievement among a hundred?I think this is going to to have limited appeal. In particular, if you absolutely need action, or character progression, or puzzles, or a story -- any of the things that constitute a game -- then look elsewhere. But in its best moments, Cube & Star goes beyond all that to capture the feeling of ambling along the shore, picking up shells and bits of wrack.			"

												I adore this game and I can hardly explain why; the color, music, and totally minimalist gameplay create an experience can perhaps only be described as 'fun', pure, simple 'fun' untethered by our expectations of a plot or any discernable end goal.At its current (sale) price you'll more than get your money's worth from simply trying to decode messages.Confused you? I'm confused myself. All I know is I'm having fun.			"

												I, like many others here, can't help but be strangely compelled to play. Instead of just leaving it at that though, I'll try to put what I feel in words. This game seems like it was developed to be the ulitmate abstract expression of both the 90's ""collect-a-thon"" platformers and the modern open-world ""sandbox"" games.  It's minimalistic aesthetic serves well the feeling of exploration and the occasional bits of story you recieve from journal pieces and conversations are tantalizing enough to entice you to find them all and piece together the entirety of the narrative. While the gameplay so far has never diversed from ""roll around, color, collect, talk"" I don't think it needs to, it's a testament to the philosophy that simplicity is key and sometimes overthought in the game design process isn't required. In addition to the of the world beng a clever mechanic, it also lends a hand to the relaxing nature of the game and imparts a sense of ownership as no two worlds will be the same and you can feel proud of your coloring as you traverse your world.There really isn't much negative to say about the game, but one should be informed the game has no save mechanic. This is by design and I really don't think it needs to have saving, but definitely make sure to make time for this game because all of your work will be lost upon closing. (edit: ive been informed this is no longer the case and the game saves on exit. YAY!)That's really all I have to say about Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love. I don't think this will win over some gamers but I would encourage everyone to at least try it. What's here is something that to the best of my knowledge hasn't been done before, and the results come together in a delightful and fascinating way.			"

												Visuals and Graphics: 7/10Gameplay Mechanics: 2/10Overall score: 4/10; TLDRI did not buy this in a bundle. I bought it solo on IndieGameStand for $1 because it looked great.This interactive screensaver (**not game) is tolerable for $2-3. $5 is too much. To be fair, I did enjoy my zen time in this flawed non-game.This application is like an alpha concept demo.  LIke wandering through a 1st person shooter with no bullets or melee, you get a good sense of feel of the presentation without any game mechanics implemented.The gameplay is missing.  Like a small developer who had a beautiful project envisioned which he never had time to finish.  Rather than junk all the work, he/she releases the incomplete alpha app (avoiding the word 'game').  I get it. Developing a game is tough; life moves forward; the author must eat; other priorities overshadow this project.  I think it is a beautiful project.  Sell the Alpha for $1 maybe and perhaps finish it at a later date.If the author were to finish the game, I envision a bear eating berries and having a transformative effect on the environment.  Or a bee or collection of bees pollinating the neighborhood and effecting change on the makeup of the flora.  (The dev is like a bee--he works very hard, and we gamers come expecting delicious honey for next to nothing $$ and do not care whether the worker starves for his hard work.  I actually applaud what the author started here.)However, again, there is NO real game mechanic.  I read the reviews that say this app was meant to behave as a tranquil zen sandbox--No, that is a cop-out excuse for a demo released before it had a game built around the concept.I have extra time on my hands, so I can drop my 12 hours into this game for even Zen foolishness.  Most of you cannot--play 15-30 minutes of this, then Uninstall.  The app is like painting your house with a trimming brush and full set of watercolors.  It takes forever but you end up with a nice kaleidoscope result.  That is all that happens.The app even mocks you with fake/useless collectibles and makes parallel references to the futility of life.  Why not take this beautiful app as the pollen/seed spreader and tack on a few simple game mechanics.  (ex: Cultivate this red plant in the NE side of the garden.  The Blue plants and ladybugs and animals flourish as you succeed.)  Develop some weak but simple game mechanic by producing/accomplishing a small goal.  Rinse and repeat for a few dozen challenges.  The sandbox all works mostly the same, but my idea gives some reason to play or immersion to polinate/transfer/spread each plant color.Instead, there are no instructions--nothing accomplished--All the plants, bushes and trees have their own inherent colors that do not change.  Your only action is to paint a hue to the ground/grass beneath them by picking nearby color from a unchangeable plant.  As you paint, there are 100 other bugs slowly painting the areas that you have brought to life--so you have no real control of color.Instead, you paint the world with a tiny trim brush. You do a little--then do a lot until you realize that your own input is not really having much effect but the world remains grey and incomplete, so one might grind for the futility of a full color completion.  The world needs to be 5 to 10 times smaller because it takes too damn long for no better finished result.Pursuit of Achievements is a silly set of badges in many games.  There are a plethora of nonsensical achievements.  ""Make a swollen and fertile world"" 0/50 What?! How would any of this be accomplished? ""Sprinkle a modest joy over the world"" 0/20. It wants you to cover 20% of the world with Yellow.  Over half of the areas are painted by bugs with a semi-permanent color which the player cannot change.  So, how would I get 20% of the world yellow?  Most of the achievements revolve around a find-a-needle-in-a-haystack subgame.  After walking the whole world around and making small interactions--you will quickly accomplish quite a few nonsense achievement. (Bump into 1 beetle.)The only controls are WASD (configurable + controller)    Remember I have the luxury of doing nothing but wander for hours WASD, redipping the paintbrush every few feet,  After revealing color to the world 6 hours later, I was about to uninstall the app.  4 of the needles-in-the-haystack are colored runes that go into the useless stacks of Zen sayings, Zen history, Zen coins, Zen jewels, Zen artifacts.  All useless.SPOILER ALERT that should have been put in the nonexistant instructions/tutorial:6 hours done, ready to uninstall, it turns out, that if you click the 4 Runes while standing still 6 times, your paintbrush will drop a few paintballs which will bounce around and change a small to medium area around you.  It is random--so you have a new tool which just introduces more randomness into the world.  Not a means to guide the color development.  Now there is a population of little people that walk around with their paintbrushes too.  So, instead of competing with the 300 bugs, you now also compete with 100s of ""LittleThings"" that also shift the colors of the environment.  No control.  Just beautiful paints wandering the canvas--with your tiny ability to shift the localized colors a bit.  The rest of the world shifts as it wants.Keep doing that for hours instead crafting the look of the gardens, or making honey, or scaring a competing hive out of the neighborhood, or stinging the brutish humans who trample the gardens.  All of these mechanics are missing.Beautiful interactive screensaver game though. 4/10.			"

												Today is 2014.Feb.19.  At the time of this review, the game came out five days ago.Firstly, this game needs a patch.  Secondly, if you read the other reviews you'll notice that they all talk about how colorful and/or pretty the game is.  Yes... this game is both colorful and pretty.  But that's it.The game offers nothing in the way of plot, gives you no motivation to explore other than to complete your map, and has very little in the way of interaction between you and the environment.There is no options menu, the game forgets your music settings and always launches with music ""on"", I found three different bugs, experienced one crash, and most importantly lost some of my interface because I can't change the graphics settings (because there ARE NO GRAPHICS SETTINGS) and the HUD icons fall off the right side of my screen.The three bugs I found were a missing ""congratulations panel"" when you find all the lore icons, I went invisible while ""talking"" with one of the NPC critters, and I have found several dozen ""invisible trees"" where they are there but not displayed.The cryptography puzzle was laughably easy and solved in under four minutes.This game's fatal flaw: filling in 100% of the map is almost impossible because the creatures that paint the world in their own right don't count toward your ""fill"" percentage and yet they have painted the tile so you can't visually tell which tiles you have missed.  I got to 91.30% map completion in six hours and getting the last 8.7% is not going to happen because I'm done with this game.			"

												Starts off as interesting and relaxing but quickly becomes tedious after a while of playing. I think the game doesn't want you to play it, though. So the developer accomplished that much at the very least! I really did enjoy this for a while, but the fact that most of the achievements are broken as well as a lot of them being largely about wasting time (good luck with the 1 million stars achievement, seriously...) and I get the feeling that this game could've been better with a more interesting execution. There's some neat ideas here but ultimately it ends up simply not being too much fun for more than an hour or two.			"

												Fun simple game. It's minimalistic but enjoyably so; you can color the world in rainbows or destroy it with the agony of fire. Raise hundreds of ""tiny things"" or leave them extinct, Super simple game play, feels monotanous at first but that quickly leaves and is replaced by the satisfaction of a colorful musical sandbox world from the perspective of a cube traveling across the land. At this sale price right now, definitely worth a try.			"

												The worst part about this game is that it has a lot of potential but doesn't live up to it. You start out knowing nothing. It tells you to move with the arrow keys and that's it. Awesome! So I go exploring and see little foreign cubes and pyramids and wormy things. Awesome! I approach one and see four little stats or something appear above it, with little symbols by each stats. I don't know what those mean, but great! More mystery! Some of the little cubes speak a different language. I find out I can collect little foreign sentences, which will help me decode the language. Great concept! I wanted to find all the sentences!But then I found a coin. Great! What's this do? I see a menu appear on the right of the screen. 1/100 next to a coin picture... Oh. Well. That's a lot of coins. What do they do? Then I find a relic. 1/250 or some high number like that. What?? A gem: 1/75. What is this? I don't care about any of that. But that's the majority of the game. Explore new areas (they all look the same: grey until you get there and add color) and collect useless stuff. I never could understand the foreign cubes (the translation tool was crap; a programmer needs to sit down for a week and make the interface more usable). I never figured out what the stats were all about. And how could I with all the fluff in between me and the riddles' answers?			"

												Fun little game about putting color back into the world.There aren't really any instructions so it can be hard to figure out what to do at first.Once you find out how to color the world, you pretty much spend the rest of the game coloring up a certain % of the map until you win.Unfortunately the map is kind of worthless except to show a kind of general idea of where you've been, and where the Cube and Star are. The game has multiple kinds of collectibles, most of which only show up after you've colored in random tiles. Unfortunately, once you've started coloring in the map, all the activity going on makes it hard to find the rest of them, so I was never able to finish the Diary or the History collectables to read the full story,I don't know if the game is worth $5, and I definitely wouldn't recommend trying to 100% this unless you REALLY want to meticulously color in the MASSIVE map to get each of the collectibles.But if you just want a chill coloring game to relax to, and have some spare time, you will enjoy this.

												Next up today was ""Cube & Star"" (Doppler Interactive). I rolled a cube around a geometric environment, collecting objects of unknown purpose, and reading cryptic messages. I supposed I would have had to play the game longer for its purpose/goals to reveal themselves, but the gameplay itself was tedious, and the music was extremely repetitive and quickly got on my nerves.For a game that doesn't explain itself from the onset, it would need to have much more engaging mechanics to hold my attention long enough for me to come to an understanding of what I'm supposed to be doing (a game like Starseed Pilgrim comes to mind, which I played for about two hours before I even began to have the foggiest idea of what I was supposed to be doing—but it was a fun and engaging two hours of cluelessness).Maybe Cube & Star this is a life–changing game that I'll never experience because I lacked the patience, but there's also an opportunity cost to that sort of hopefulness…			"

												Cube & Star is supposed to be an ""art game"". Now, if you 're familair with my tastes in games, you know it's a genre I appreciate: I can't sing enough praises for ""Papers, Please"", and I really liked ""Flowers"", for example.Cube & Star is nothing like those. It's a pretentious mess that mistakes random word juxtaposition for poetry. You're a cube and your goal is to... what? color the world? collect useless junk? It's never quite clear. The only marks of your progress are the collectibles you gather. These show up every x steps. With x being random. And they're usually made of 2-3 polygons and have fancy names that mean nothing.There are no lethal enemy, no interesting sightseeing (past the first 2 minutes). You can bump into other cubes or animals and A random, meaningless sentence will pop-up (and will take painfully long to fade out) before you'll continue your travels.After what seemed like an endlessly long time, a new power showed up, seemingly at random, that allowed me to burn a bit of my surroundings. What purpose does it serve? Probably none.I suppose you begin to see a pattern: there's nothing that makes sense, there is no challenge, no reward, no loving craft that was used to shape the world. It's all an empty, meaningless random experience.Playing Cube&Stars would be like playing Diablo if Diablo had no enemies, was painted with pastel colors instead of grey and brown, and if Blizzard's title used a tileset that had just 10 element for generating levels.Stay clear of this one. It's not worth its cheap price, let alone your time.			"

												While somewhat interesting in concept, I can't really recommend this game, as it essentially lacks much of anything of interest to actually *DO*.  You start play plunked down on a gray world full of trees, and are functionally tasked with making it a colorful world by bumping colored trees, rolling over their colorful fruits, and then spreading that color to other trees. Your color fades to gray after a dozen or so moves, so you have to bump another tree.  Rinse and repeat.  And repeat. And repeat. And repeat for hours on end...As you roll around, you collect random collectables that you collect because you get an achievement for collecting them all.  (Unless they disappear because some random critter activated the object outside your sight range, and then you can never collect 100%.) The game world is huge, which is something of a negative, because, with gameplay from start to finish basically consisting of just bumping trees and spreading color, I ran out of interest in the game before I could cover the world in color or get any of my completion.  There's a ""mystery"" to uncover by collecting journal bits, but it just doesn't have enough suspense or reason for players to care to carry the player to the finish line.  Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I actually managed to decypher the language... and was not particularly impressed by the results.  It's a simple symbol-to-letter cypher that is made even easier with each line starting with Roman Numerals, but the need to click through each symbol is *HIGHLY* tedious, yet served as a distraction from a tedious game... No wonder so many people quit with lower hours played than I have.I hit a crash bug, and didn't have the will to see if or how much I'd lost in game progress, because it all felt like a waste to me to try to complete painting this world.

												It's an interesting concept that starts with some promise as you begin colouring the world, but boredom sets in as soon as you realize how slowly things progress and how large the world really is.This has been described somewhat as a Zen game, but unlike other such games such as Flow, etc. there is little sense of progression and the pace is so very, very, slow.  Nudge trees slowly, collect the colour that falls from them, and paint the world until the colour runs out.  Repeat.  It is the very definition of grinding, only with no real goal in sight.There are some redeeming qualities: it is pretty, and the music is tranquil, fitting with the zen-like feel.  Unfortunately that wears thin quickly as there is precious little actual game-play.  The little bits of text you unlock are simply small statements designed perhaps to evoke deeper thought, but there really isn't much to them and they don't add much to the experience.  Some would say it is art, but to me it is a game without actual gameplay.  Evocative statements and abstract graphics cannot make up for the fact that there is simply little to do, and what there is is so drawn out you would need to grind for hours and hours just to see it.  It simply tries too hard.The trailer shows all sorts of interesting parts of the game that I suspect are many hours away.  Getting there is simply not that interesting, and takes too long.			"

												Complete waste of time and money unless you are really into toys and eye-candy.Cube rolls around the world, colors the ground, bumps into things and gets collectibles which mean nothing but achievements.

However it is still a fine work of art that can hold its own in the world of games.			"

												Cube & Star: A Love of Life and of the Arbitrary.  This is a very simple yet complex game.  The controls are few and guidance is absent which leaves most players lost looking for the point.  I was drawn to Cube & Star by the beautiful design and the colors; I played because I enjoyed spreading the color.  The question this game brings up is ""What is the point?""  Cube & Star is similar to life, the search for meaning.  As I spread color, I discovered the purpose of the tiles that I collected- they create life.  Originally, I only payed attention to my effect on the landscape but soon found out that the game is more widespread than that.  Now I watch as each action my cube takes affects the entire realm of the game from changing simple colors to creating life that changes the face of the map in their own way.  This is a game for people who enjoy the search for purpose.			"

												This game is pretty, and well put together, but it is BORING!The core mechanics are painting the world with color, and collecting items. It takes many hours to fully paint the world or collect everything, and there's no reward when you finish, other than a few achievements. To further add to the tedium, there are smaller achievements for painting the 20% or 50% of the world with a specific color. It can take several hours per color, and there are about 10 colors.This game would be enjoyable if the exploration and painting were more fun, but they're not. You move around slowly and awkwardly, and any desire to experiment with the more intricate mechanics will be promptly subdued by boredom.			"

Mabye there is more to ferret out but the game is so repetitive and bland it didn't seem worth it as I lost interest because your only control is to roll around. You can start painting things but the game doesn't explain exactly how or what each item you get does. Apparently there are controls but the game doesn't state them clearly. No thanks.			"

												This game is absolutly wonderful.  Initially I wanted to find the goal of the game but soon I found myself so wrapped up in enjoying the experiance as a whole to care if there was an end or how I should go about reaching it.  This game is VERY artistic, and peppered with cleaver meta-level metaphores about life and existance, though thinking about the dialog is purely optional.  Its a sandbox where your free to color the world however you see fit!  At its core the mechanics involve collecting which are your way of interacting with a living, breathing, highly abstract world.  As you explore you'll gain a few abilities, tons of collectables and build/burn the world as you please.  Strangly enough, its by far the most relaxing game I've ever met and as I colored the world I found myself rather happy, as my progress was simply making the world a more colorful place rather then the collectables.  It's been a long time since I've met a game that doesn't feel compelled to string me along with a stick and carrot, but freedom from those chains to play in a quirky, colorful sandbox with no real threats has changed my ideas of what a game can, and possiably should be.  Sadly, I can't really tell you why its so relaxing or happy, you'll just have to find out for youself.			"

												Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love is defiantly a strange casual  experience. You play as a cube and must color the world around you by first coloring yourself. You will meet a variety of other lifeforms and most everything you interact with gives you an achievement. I wasn't really sure what I was doing but I kept playing. If you are looking for casual game-play or love collecting everything in a game then join in on the confusion and bring color back to this simplistic world.Here is my full review:

												I completely adore this game! It is a very simplistic exploration game where you bring color to the world. I haven't decrypted any of the journals yet and that will be a challenge on it's own. It's one of those games where I can just relax and let the color flow. I don't usuall play games with the sound on but the music is very charming and I find myself tuning on the volume for this game. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for soething to unwind with after a long day.			"

												Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love is more of a sandbox than a traditional game. And this sandbox can also be seen as a metaphor for life. Which is a weird thing, and sets it as a very ambitious game from the very start.Now, whether or not this is my type of game, or I enjoyed its execution, let there be no doubt that this is certainly unique, and has its head on its shoulders.If you're looking for a good, traditional game, this is definitely not for you. On the other hand, if you like playing interesting games, with unique concepts, regardless of a flawless execution, then give this one a try.I decided to give a conclusion right at the start, because I honestly don't know if I should recommend the game. As a result, there you have the disclaimer. If you're still interested in reading my more in-depth thoughts about the game, go right ahead.From an audio-visual standpoint, Cube & Star is a very minimalistic game, with a very relaxing feel to it. There's no tension, no horror, no fast-paced action. You take thing as they come, and just hopefully enjoy the ride. There are no visual settings or anything, but from how the game looks, I don't think there's any need for it. It doesn't have crazy lighting and particles effects or anything of the sort. But it works, and I thought it looked pretty cool, specially seeing the world fading away in the horizon.If I have one complaint, is that the colors can be a bit blurred at night, making it hard to distinguish between them. But again, that's how night time is.Despite being very simple, I was satisfied about how it looked and sounded.Gameplay is a weird one for me. You're thrown into a very cryptic world with no goals, no enemies, no friends, no direction at all. The sky is the limit, they say. Oh, and you're a Cube. The first apparent objective for the player is to try and color the whole world. By hitting trees, they can drop either stars, or color ""seeds"". If you pick them up, your cube changes color, and spreads it as you walk by, progressively getting weaker, until it fades away and you need to pick more seeds. And I'll try to keep it more or less spoiler free.On the world, there are other creatures, each of them with their own purpose. Some are trying to carve colored paths, others are trying to erase the world of all color.You can talk to each creature, and they'll give you simple phrases about their purpose in life. Mostly flavor text, but it's a nice detail, and well written.Besides, there are also lots of collectibles in the form of history pages about the world's previous civilization, coins, gems, trophies, and each of them reflects on an arbitrary aspect of life, regarding work, greed, lack of purpose, etc.These collectibles appear when you color the respective square on the ground. So, as you're coloring the world, you'll get these. Why? I don't know. Do you? Must there be a purpose? And I think these are the question that serve as pillars to this game.Aside from these collectibles, you'll also get 4 powers. These powers essentially make you a God, and let you shape the world as you will. Along with this, there's a ""shore list"", or an ""achievement list"", to give you some purpose, if you need it. It guides you in playing a game in certain way, and it's a good thing, if you don't like being completely lost all the time.You're a God. A purpose-less one, but a God nonetheless. You can create civilizations, you can burn them, you can just let the game play out and feel happy to be a passive observer. And that can be relaxing. If you like the sound of this concept, you might enjoy the game. But it was not very much to my taste, to be honest, and there's why.The world is pretty huge, which can make it a bit too time consuming to walk from one point to another. As you color it, there's a map, with colored and grey zones. This is supposed to send you in a direction if you're missing something. But, since there are creatures undoing your work (in a very minimal way), you can never be sure where exactly you need to go, after a certain point, and there are a lot of people getting stuck at 90% of the world, and the sort. The same goes with the collectibles. If you don't know what's left to color, you don't know where the rest of the collectibles are.And, since the game is mostly about collectibles and coloring the whole world, it can feel like a shore.Now, it only feels like a shore if this is not your type of game, of course. I can see this being a very good game for some people. It has a lot to do, many interactions with the living world, with the colors, with everything. There's a lot that can be done!But I feel like this appeals to a very niche market.For everyone else, once you figure out more of less what to do, the game loses a bit of its compelling nature, since it's simply too laborious to achieve its purposes, once you set them.This is a game to play without purpose, honestly. It's a game for you to be immersed in, relax, and go in and out of it at will. Just enjoying your stay. And that's fine. I think it works for some people, just not for me.The game feels too big for what it is, and it can at times feel a bit empty. The map is very messy, as I stated. Besides, most of the achievements do not trigger outside of the game, which can be disencouraging for some people, so take that in mind.Also, note this, as I think it might be important: Most of the positive reviews have a very small amount of time into the game. These people have most likely appreciated for what it is for a short time, but rapidly moved on into something else.So yeah. Be careful if you feel like picking it up. The game has a very unique and interesting concept, but it is definitely not for everyone, and definitely not for me. If this feels like you cup of tea, go right ahead. There's a lot that can be done, and you can get a huge amount of time for your money, if you want to do everything there is to do. Otherwise, I don't think I'd recommend it. I enjoyed going through it, it was interesting, and refreshing. But I doubt that I'll play it again, and I certainly have left tons of content unseen. "

												25 minutes was all i needed to make the conclusion that this was a single guy who bought a ""philosophy for dummies"" book and a ""baby's first poem"" book, and then asked his friend to make  3D models for this great idea he had because he was so inspired, disliked what his friend made, and decided to just use some shapes for characters because he didn't have the money to commission anyone, and then tried to pass it off as artsy and minimalistic because he spent some cash getting the software to make the ""game"" and wanted a quick buck.everything about this game VERY LOUDLY screams ""I'M PRETENTIOUS AND DEEP"", from the store page to the exit screen.  i haven't mentioned a single thing about the gameplay because there is none - you hold arrow keys to roll a box around and pick up potentially tens of thousands of certain kinds of shapes while you bump into other shapes, and get cryptic and sometimes condescending messages on the topic of life shoved into your face, which even when i tried to read them i couldn't because sometimes the text faded too fast.pretty glad i got this in a humble bundle a while back, and i'm pretty glad i gave my 1 dollar entirely to the humble staff.

												This is a very relaxed game and there is a clue that I only know because I read a review that will help most of you. At first, you wander around and spread colour. The clue in the game is, however, the four sign tower that are somewhere in the world. If you reach one of them and take it down, it'll give you a special power. One of those is to simply clear the space around your cube, but the other three are notes. Playing six notes, a combination of any of the three, or just two, or just one, will make different things happen.The previous sort of useless things that wander around will suddenly have a purpose and the clue will become more apperent. Or:Plus:+ uniqe+ a lot of freedom+ very calming and relaxing (the music too)+ a big world with a lot of hidden stuff+ gets interesting once you get the clueMinus:- the clue is very vague- which makes the game vague somtimes. Or, this is a love or hate game.			"

												I guess I should start by saying I only booted this game up on Steam so I could review it.  I have, however, played it for a crazy number of hours on my DRM free copy I picked up over on IndieGameStand.  That's not a plug for IGS; it's just a disclaimer about the time Steam says I've played the game.I just played Cube & Star again this evening, and I'm a bit confused about why I enjoy this game so much.  The tone is incredibly melancholy, even though you're playing a game about spreading color over a grey world.  There are several secrets to be found in the game, and after far too long, I just finally solved one of them.  It felt great!I am reminded of the feeling on a long summer afternoon, when dinner was hours away, and I sat by a creek, blindly feeling around for stones to skip across the water.  I don't know that I was ""happy"" about the plip of a thrown pebble or the overlapping concentric circles after a successful skip, but the experience was deeply satisfying.			"

												Before you buy this game, go to it's website and read the creator's description about it's mechanics. Now ratchet back your expectations a few knotches. The things bouncing around your mind don't happen. If you are a person to whom media which are condemed as ""art-y"" appeal, and are willing to make the experence fun largely by the locomotion of your own inner monolog, then this game may be for you.If you are a person like me who's world view is unlikely to be shaken to the very core by a cube talking to you in annoyingly short lived text boxes, then perhaps skip out. I went in looking for a whimsical sand box adventure driven by the complicated relationship between a cube and a star. The game is nothing like that. If something like that sounds good, go play Grow Home.All in all the meaning of this piece is intended to be created by the viewer, as a colaboration of maker and player. This has only neice appeal and should have been wrapped up in a game that is actually fun, or engaging as to make the person interested before you ask then to come up with their own story.The experence could be replicated and probably improved by walking around a meadow talking to your grandad about the meaning of life, and that doesn't cost $5 usd, assuming you bring a packed lunch.

												I used to like this game, but the developer has abandoned us. No one should buy this game. Hit him in the wallet where it hurts most.			"

												I don't know if I should recommend this or not. It looks like a proper game but plays like an artsy walking simulator. I guess I won't give it the thumbs down because I don't hate it. Idk, if you like aimlessly bouncing a cube around in a simple but visually appealing environment, get it?			"

												A strange, zen journey, oddly addictive. I'm afraid to open it lest I get trapped again. Oh, let me just color over here... oh, there's something to pick up this way... oh, another thing to pick up...The only downside in my experience so far is that the decoding puzzle is buggy--basically, don't assign a letter unless you're very sure that's the one you want, because it might mess up and undo your changes and leave you in a confused mess. Someone did post a translation guide if that happens to you.			"

												Cube and Star is essentially a Zen sand garden. If you go looking for meaning, then the game will oblige with some light brainteasers, but if you want to ignore all that and just bounce around daubing the world in pale citrine and nightmare red, you go bounce. It's a pleasantly relaxing experience. The Unnecessary Collectible is Unnecessary joke gets tedious after five seconds and you'll probably wish there was more than one music track, but otherwise this is a little gem.			"

												The ultimate 'WTF am I doing?' game. I bought this game on sale when I really just wanted something casual and relaxing to play. It didn't disappoint in that regard, you start out just ambling around painting the world. There is no tutorial or anything to tell you what's happening, you just have to experiment. You'll find more to do and a story will start to unveil itself. I think I see the meaning behind this game, but I won't spoil it for others. I recommend trying it for yourself. It won't be everyone's cup of tea of course, but it fit the bill for a quiet afternoon.EDIT: I'm (hopefully temporarily) changing this review to a down-vote because over half the achievements are broken and you do not recieve them.It was the 15 of May when the developer orginally said he/she would look into it and no fix or update on a solution has been made.

												It's a bit buggy, but nothing a quick restart doesn't fix. If you enjoy semi-aimless exploration it's worth buying at price. It's worth your time.			"

												There isn't really a word for this game, and how peaceful and calm it is. In that sense, it's akin to Proteus, even though the bright palettes and sense of safety are where the similarities end.I'm not very far into this game. I don't even really understand what the game is - you walk, you pick things up, you talk. There is an underlying plot, but at this point, all I'm seeing is the pretty colours and the fact that it's very unlikely that something will pop out and kill me.			"

												Yet another modernist art piece masquerading as a game.   The writing and art are very charming.  This is definitely a casual game, and it's very telling that most of the people who don't recommend this game have more playtime on it than the ones who do.The piece is quite abstract, featuring generic solids with a pastel color pallete.   The gameplay is completely open world, with the vague goal of making the grey grid of squares a little less depressing, and no particular end to that.Throughout the game, you're peppered with little bits of backstory written in a simple substitution cypher, and a ton of incredibly generic but nearly universally applicable bits of life-advice, generally aimed at convincing you to be less boring.I don't recommend this game.  It's an experience that is surpassed in nearly every way by reading a self-help book under a tree in the park.However, if you've watched the trailer, and the idea of moving the cube around is more appealing to you than a cheap sandwich, you'll definitely get your money's worth.

												I'm still trying to really figure out exactly what this game wants from me, but I do find myself enjoying playing it, even if it is a bit odd. It's actually one of my favorites and I love just chilling out and listening to music while I play. It's awesome.			"
