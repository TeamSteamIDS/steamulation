												If there's one game that completely failed to find its audience, it's Pid. On the outside, Pid looks another artsy puzzle platformer, with its gentle, softly rendered backgrounds, and relaxing acoustic soundtrack. Upon playing it though, the game honestly has more in common with Super Meat Boy than any puzzle platformer. The distance between checkpoints is tiny, you have infinite lives, and enemies, traps, and spikes are everywhere. I personally love the game to death, but I can see why the huge dissonance between how the game looks and feels, vs how it plays, turned a lot of people off.  It's really too bad though, because I think Pid is one of the best games around. The main gimmick here is the ability to place down beams of light that can carry you around. The way this changes how you navigate through the game world is dramatic, and a bit reminiscent of Bionic Commando Rearmed, which some of the Pid team also worked on. The game thoroughly explores this mechanic, with every area in the game having a slight twist to how the game plays. Most of the time you use the beam to carry yourself, but other locations have you using it to carry bombs towards enemies, carry enemies themselves, or even push around light sources needed to light the way for you. The other great thing about the beam mechanic is how the solution is always right there in front of you, but you have to figure out where to place the beams, adding a bit of a puzzle aspect.Overall though, I really can't stress enough how much I like this game. The scenery, music, atmosphere, and gameplay all combine to form this truly unique experience. The game is pretty long as well, but has a great flow and variety to the areas. If you like hard platformers, you should check this game out.			"

												No game has frustrated me and entertainmed at the same time so much than Pid.Underneath the beautiful aesthics (it honestly had a pixar vibe going on) and the ♥♥♥♥ing amazing sound track lies a game so god damn hard it made me want to burn my computer.The game starts out friendly enough. You learn the basic mechanics of using the game's gravity gems to float to high unreachable platsforms. Then you are introduced to bombs, music boxes, smoke bombs, lazer beams, and so on to assist you. Then approaching the first boss there is a sudden difficulty spike. Platforms got smaller, enemies became faster, and oh god the ♥♥♥♥ing spiked walls. EVERYWHERE. Even at the easiest difficulty setting if you don't have the patience to retry a level again again you will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unlike other precision platoformers like Super Meat Boy the game has a larger focus of utilizing the gravity gems/timing. For instance you'll teach yourself how to wall jump even if there isn't a wall sticking mechanic, which will help you find the collectables throughout the game. The collectables are what almost ruined this game for me. There are 12 ""souviners"" and 17 ""secret constellations"". Finding them are almost impossible without guides and even when you reach them you will have to try. try. try and try again to get them. one of the souviners took me at least 40 mins to get. Collecting all of them doesn't give you an alternate ending or anything, but it certainly makes you feel good knowing that you challenged yourself to the MAX. Also an achievement.BUT, the game is gorgeous. Even when i was frustrated i couldn't get over how amazing the game looked. The soundtrack is definately up there with hotline miami in terms of quality. The timing of when the tunes started playing according to where you are in the game is pitch perfect also. One moment you're hearing gusty fast paced drum, when suddenly you reach a calm zero gravity zone and a calm piano track kicks in. Perfect. These two factors kept me pushing through the more unforgiving parts of the game. The levels also very greatly from robot sweat shops, to an opera stage with flying airplanes.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets creative, and you will grin ear to ear everytime a new set piece is opening.The story is also starts out simple, and gets pretty interesting by the end. It's pretty cliche, but it's like a reallly good children's picture book. If you like platformers that are challenging you might want to pick this up. It's pretty cheap, and it's been in like 3 bundles this year alone. While it has an extremly unforgiving diffuiculty spike,  it also has alot of excellent redeeming qualities. Reccomended if you have time.7/10 it's also the 3rd game I 100%. Why do i do this to myself.			"

												Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but the story is quite interesting. It has a great soundtrack and audio. Pid is very atmospheric and graphics are smooth. It asked me a while to complete the game, because there are many secret areas and some puzzle parts are kinda tricky. Co-op mode is intense, because you need to collab with your pal a lot. You won't get far if you play alone in co-op mode. Also some levels gets boring after a while aaand challenges are really challenging. I recommend this game to everyone who likes unique platformer puzzles. Oh, and I also recommend to play with a controller. 7/10			"

												Pid is a super atmosperic, dreamy and hard game. Really Freakin' hard.I died 888 times (I swear I'm not making that up).This is a punishing game, and were I using a controller, there would have been numerous holes in the wall by the time I finished Pid. If it wasn't already clear - I'm not talking about ""hard"" difficulty.I picked this up for cheap, but if you like platformers that are a little ""different"", then always look for games coming out of Scandinavia ;)The main mechanic is quite uniqe (kind of a tractor beam) and this is what differentiates pid from most other games of the genre.Definitely worth picking up if you're into unforgiving platformers!

												8/10. Overall, I would recommend this game except if too difficult puzzles and situations can cause anxiety or too much problem for you.Pros: - CUTE!- Interesting and different kind of gameplay.- Nice idea and story.- Levels are designed beautifully.- Some levels are absolutely gorgeous. - Perfectuly suiting audio and music. - Great artwork.- Great character design.- Some very nice puzzles.Cons:- Too difficult sometimes. It feels unnecessary. Some boss battles are frustratingly difficult. Same goes with the speed run levels. Makes you sometimes want to ragequit forever. lol.- Repetitive to some extent.- Too long. I my opinion, it should've been at least 25% shorter than the current length.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. On first blush, it should really satisfy: interesting art direction, unique music, and a nifty little gameplay mechanic. The difficulty seemed on par with my meager skills: not super-frenetic, but needing a little thought to keep it from being a cakewalk.The trouble is, it all just seems too sluggish. Character control is incredibly slow. Just try ""running"" (loping?) one way, and then quickly change direction: young master Pid does an excruciatingly tardy about-face.Worse yet, this sluggishness extends to jumping, as well. Platormers live and die by their jump-physics, and Pid sadly comes across as clumsy in this department. I think the benchmark for controllability in a character is to stand on a ledge, jump out into space, and then reverse direction to land on the edge again. The distance that you can get from the ledge safely tells you how ""in control"" you will feel with the gameplay. Pid does not fare well here.I suppose it can be reasoned that everything *else* in the game is slow as well (animations, enemies, dialog, checkpoint restarts) so perhaps a slow character fits in with the dream-like feel. Or perhaps you could say that the emphasis is on the force beams instead of jumping, and you'd have a point. And there are plenty of people that loved Pid, so I won't begrudge them that.However, for my own taste, the poor character control turned gameplay into a chore for me due to being unnecessarily challenging for comparatively trivial tasks. Life is short, and I have more games in my library than time to play them all, so I'll move my attention to more rewarding fare! "

												Pid is a delightfully pleasant and challenging platformer / puzzle game. It is striking in every sense and plays a lot like that of LIMBO, you are a small boy who is lost and trying to find a way home. Using a strange power where you are able to create traction fields on any surface for a limited time, you use them to navigate your way through the alternative, artistic world. I don’t see there being too much length to the game and it’s a but short on achievements but it’s a well-crafted game and piece of art.			"

												Kind of game that brings you back to childhood (SNES era) when many games was like this. This is puzzle-platformer where you have to get your way through levels by jumping, evading and fighting enemies. At the end of each ""world"", there're boss battles, which are fun and challenging. Levels are well designed and fun to explore. Colors are beautiful, everything in this game is painted with eye pleasing color. Soundtrack is awesome, it is written for this game and, compared to similar indie games, it really stands out. As for the difficulty, this is hard game, it starts slow but gets really hard towards the end. Aside from single player campaign (which can be played solo or co-op), there're plenty of short ""challenge"" levels which reminds of Super Meat Boy kind of levels.All in all, fun little game. If you like platformers, you shouldn't miss this.			"

												PID.. possibly one of the best platformers I've played... ever, definitely one of my all time favourites. This game is very original in its gameplay design, its just gorgeous to look at and faultless in its programming from the controls to the collision detection. The music and sound effects also are top quality and extremely well chosen for the various levels, suiting each situation perfectly.Don't get me wrong, you will spend many a time shouting at your monitor/tv screen lol, its frustratingly difficult at parts but acheives being awesome at the exact same time lol.. not many games can do that. It also gets the brain working as you try to find the best way through some of the levels.I was lucky enough to get this game for free as a giveaway one time but after playing through I kind of wish I had paid for it and hence given something to the developers.. so this is why I am going to make sure I buy this for at least 1 other friend as a gift, my way of giving something to the developers for such an amazing game, as a thank you to them.If you haven't given this game a go yet then I urge you to get it now.. you won't regret it.

You will need some retries in some tricky passages. And if you can't find your way, there are useful walktroughs. A must have for all platformers lovers.			"

												Pid is a charming looking physics-based puzzle platformer that quickly runs out of ideas, falling short in both design and fun.The game starts you off as Kurt, a boy who misses his space-bus stop and lands on an alien planet. Here, you're mysteriously granted the power to throw little starts from your hands that will generate a flow of gravity perpendicular to the surface they're attached to. This will be your main tool traversing the world of Pid.Your goal is to find a way off your planet. You follow the indication of the alien residents (humanoid robots that look like teapots most of the time) and go through cities, old libraries, restaurants, caves... And sometimes boss fights against particularly hostile robots. Abnormally huge ones, obviously.The retro sci-fi looks are really solid, you find yourself in a place that feels both futuristic and ancient. Soft colors and dim lights give everything a nostalgic atmosphere.The game keeps going strong for a while with great flow between screens, starting with a good tutorial that shows rather than telling. Puzzles are mostly of the ""traversing"" kind: you have to get to the exit of this screen/area and the challenge is finding how to do it. The physics and controls are a bit sluggish and in some components janky as well, as physics-based games often tend to be. Fortunately, the early level design gives you some leeway with your precision so you'll have a challenging but enjoyable time.What's not to love, right? Fun puzzle platformer. Charming look. Rewarding level design.Well, all those three start falling short about 1/3 through the game. The devs seem to run out of ideas and start putting badly designed, bad looking unfun stages almost all the way through the end.Visual design: after the initial sequence of good looking and creatively crafted areas, you start going through the old known stuff: red hot factory; silent rocky catacombs; dark maze; spiny death trap (because why not) and more. The only exception is likely the opera house near the end, which is at least interestingly crafted although still not entirely fun. After 1/3 of the game, everything starts looking very generic and your eye loses interest very quickly.What's left then? The gameplay. Oh boy...One third of your way in, the level design stops being fun and intuitive while at the same time becoming tedious and time consuming. Puzzles begin requiring more precision the closer you get to the end, but it's a precision the game just doesn't offer. Checkpoints become disparaged, sometimes chaining several faulty-prone puzzles together and making for a frustrating experience.A particular section will even force you to traverse the same area back and forth in search for a certain amount of collectibles and a secret location (which is too well hidden as well). That's simply not fun considering Pid's controls, which are studied for traversing levels in one direction looking for your way out. There's also a couple of bosses with chase sequences before you're done, which are nothing but frustrating because the controls aren't as tight as you'd want them to be.Throughout the game, you also get introduced to several extra items other than your star-gravity power: bombs (timed and not), extra high jumps, stealth smoke bombs... While those all look fun, they do nothing but polluting the purity of the level design. Near the end you'll find yourself with several items that would allow you to break puzzles, letting you to force your way through them. So what was the solution they implemented to avoid you just breezing through all the stages? Simple. Cover everything with spikes and enemies. Tie the difficulty of the rooms to the imprecise star-gravity powers, so the player will have to wrestle with them to get through anyway, regardless of how many extra items they saved.See all those positive reviews? Now check how many of those have more than 3-4 hours.The early sections of the game are really fun and well made, but the game unravels as you go on, leaving you with more frustration than fun and a bad aftertaste for the 10 hours you could've spent otherwise.

												Splendid game. I actually purchased it three times; once on Xbox Live, and twice on Steam for myself and a friend.Firstly, the visual style is superb. As well as creating a rich sense of depth with blurs and diffused lighting, there seems also to be a seperate layer of color grading (shadows tinted blue, highlights tinted orange) which is why many screenshots have a cinematic aura about them.The light beam mechanic quickly becomes second nature, and I find myself missing it when I hop over to other platformers. The gameplay is more of a navigational puzzler than a logic one, and there's a nice steady progression of what you can do with the beams which prevents it from becoming stale.I'm a fan of ""strange world"" concepts in games. Pid in particular creates a surprisingly inviting atmosphere for a planet of mechanical characters. What's more, each citizen is unique in appearance, which could've been an easy cop out for the devs if they decided that robots would be mass produced in one model. A fine level of variation worth noting. The length of the game was also pretty satisfying. It's taken me between 12 to 13 hours each time I've played through, though it felt much longer. Finally, and without giving anything away, the last few sections of gameplay were just brilliantly executed. The music/sound design, art direction, physics, storyline, and everything else, all came together in those final moments to ensure a great memory of a great game. "

												It's not a bad game, it's just... kinda boring, you know? Like, this game has a very ""boring"" tone, not necessarily in a bad way, but it does make the game not very exciting to play. And it doesn't really get more fun or more varied as you progress. It just stays boring all the way through. Still, I played this game for about 3 hours, so that probably means I kinda liked it, but... when I think back, I don't really remember having fun playing it. It's like it wasn't bad enough for me to quit playing right away, but it wasn't fun enough for me to finish it and recommend it.6 / 10, good if you like platformers that feel slow and calm.

												I have to say, when I started toplay this game I thought I would really enjoy it. However, after I got past the first zone I began to find the game incredibly unforgiving, and by extension quite irritating.There are many areas that I found frustrating: One of the boss battles seems to take an inordinate amount of time to complete, because his movements are erratic, and when jumping around you can often bounce right off him into another enemy [dying, meaning you have to start over].Also, when trying to complete many of the platformer puzzles, I found myself frequently grazing ""forbidden zones"" and dying, which makes for incredibly tedious gameplay.It isn't all bad though, If you can stomach the tedious parts of the game you will find that it has a very nice story with some very nice graphics and music. The environment almost seems like it is played out by toys, which looks very nice.The game runs very well, and I have had no problems with it on the software side.That said, I couldn't complete the game. If you are the kind of person who *can* persist when faced with a tedious challenge, then you will probably enjoy this game. It just wasn't for me.			"

												I think we've all gotten off at the wrong bus stop at one point or another, and the experience can be anywhere from annoying to positively harrowing. In Pid, your little spaceboy Kurt falls asleep on a bus and ends up on a planet of robots, where the busses haven't been running for 300 years. In his journey to find some way off the rock, he comes across a shining gem that creates pillars of levitating force. But someone isn't happy about him having it, and sends a veritable army of robot minions to chase him down.How's that for a puzzle platform hook? Pid compliments its children's book premise with appropriately soft, pastel visuals, collectible stars, and goofy characters. The presentation is the real stand-out here, making each level appear inviting and mysterious and charming all at once. The soundtrack is both subdued and peppy when it needs to be, and there's some cute writing on display with the NPCs and cutscenes. It's really everything you could ask for in an indie platformer.The lavish charm makes the game's intense difficulty all the more jarring when it starts smashing you against spikes and explosives. Pid wastes no time in wasting you, pitting you against tiny platforms and precise timing puzzles in the first hour. The levitation is a clever gimmick done well, but you'll have to master it in a hurry to survive. You'll also gain a number of supporting abilities and items including bombs and super jumps that will need to be used to their fullest. Stars you find are used to replenish expendable abilities, but even if you're completely awful at the game you shouldn't run out.Levels abound with secrets, but by the time you reach the city they'll likely be too frustrating to sniff out. I kept running into annoyances like secrets you only get one chance at, spoiled by checkpointing or unscaleable heights. The clever and colorful bosses offer yet another source of frustration, since they have very long lifebars and patterns but you can only take one or two hits before dying and starting the whole thing over. There are challenge rooms beyond the lengthy story mode as well, but even the very first set required pin-point precision to complete, let alone get the par or challenge time.I wish I could recommend Pid without reservation, I really do. I adore everything about how it looks and sounds. But it suffers from that most common affliction among indie games, a poor difficulty curve. I still say it's worth a try, because if you have the time to devote to it you can surely overcome its challenges. Just don't go into it thinking it's as friendly as it looks.			"

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Pid skip to Results and read from there.Might and Delight creates an epic platformer that combines puzzles and combat to propose an amazing experience. Pid is a game with a difficulty curve that borderlines abuse, puzzles that push the mind and skill to levels unheard, and secrets abound.Story:A small boy known as Kurt has a regular day at school, but the bus-ride home is where the adventure really begins. Kurt falls asleep finding himself waking up on a weird little planet, which no one has come to or left for over 350 years. Stumbling upon a magical orb Kurt becomes connected to the planet and is the boy who must solve its mysteries and return it back to its former glory. With a fascinating story, and wonderful character development this game will keep you gripped.Campaign:The campaign is about eight hours long, depending on your skill and the difficulty choice. I played on Normal for the campaign, thinking it wouldn’t be too challenging. Well I was definitely wrong; Pid is a difficult game which pushes boundaries. If you try to get all the secrets you will most likely rip out most of your hair. The campaign combines puzzle solving, action, and an amazing physics engine. Pid combines such elements as collecting items, pushing switches, carrying keys, manipulating gravity wells, spike traps, and much more. There are multiple bosses throughout the campaign one that are entirely fighting, one that combines both puzzles and combat, and  even one that is just puzzle solving. The bosses push your mind and skill as each one requires unique approaches for victory. Gameplay:Pid starts out with you obtaining a special orb that allows you to create gravity wells that push you in some direction. You must use these gravity wells in order to complete objectives, defeat enemies, and race across levels. You will fight enemies who shoot rockets, lasers, or even shine spotlights that for some reason cause you to lose. You acquire items throughout the campaign that allow you to push through the campaign: crank boxes (that confuse robots), explosives, timed explosives, laser grids, armor, hyper beams, gravel, and more. Results:Pid is an awesome platformer that combines puzzle solving and combat to produce an invigorating experience. The game pushes you against spike traps, bottomless pits, rockets, and laser grids. You have to utilize special beams to launch yourself through the levels, but sometimes the surfaces don’t allow you to use your ability. You must combine strategies and tactics in order to complete the levels and solve the puzzles. Pid makes for an amazing and incredibly challenging experience that really puts you to the test.Pros:+Awesome level design+Brilliant art work and soundtrack+Fantastic story+Challenging Puzzles with high amounts of variation+Simple, but soothing soundtrack+Bundles of enemies that keep you on your toes+Lots of items that give you loads of varieties+Secrets abound: constellations and souvenirs. +Whimsical nature that makes you smile as you progress through+Three difficulty settings that keep the game entertaining.Cons:-The slingshot requires you to use your keyboard to control direction rather than using a mouse.-Difficulty spikes in the game make some parts more annoying than entertaining (such as running away from the Grandma or the wormhole level).

												First, I have to say, I bought this game at gog.com over a Year ago and Played it without using Steam, thats why I got that little playing time here.I Played the game at a Friends house, Coop, Normal difficulty (and later on hard), it took us some sleepless nights (as we sometimes just weren't... really productive ^^).it is awesome. the Puzzles are nice, and it's not boring at all, IF you are playing with a Friend. - the 2Player mode is really nice, your Life depends on the teamwork (and thats why some nights weren't productive at all). It is a pretty nice Puzzle-Plattformer, which had so many haters in the beginning because of the difficulty, that's why the developers had to add an easy mode.If you want to really have fun with this game - play it at least in normal difficulty, and do it with a Friend. Don't forget to use Controllers.I can recommend this game - and I would buy it again. (I bought it a few times now, gog, steam, steamgift for a friend ^^)			"

Some of the puzzles and bosses can be frustrating but when you complete it, you feel like you just impregnated the planet! Definitely pick it up if you're looking for a challenging puzzler with excellent visual effects and a fun little story!			"

I would have never expected. I haven't finished it yet, but my experience was very nice. Keep making games like these!10/10			"

												Overall 9.5/10one of my most favourite gamesI got Pid for 80% off using a coupon a guy on reddit gave me, after beating the game in 8 frustratingly challenging hours i would pay double the original price to play it some more, the controls seemed fit for the game in my case, although many others have complained about it before, the soundtrack was more then delightful to listen to the entire time, and the whole idea and concept of the game was intruiging from start to finish!During my gameplay i often found myself comparing it to the Portal games in the way that you have to think outside the box in order to properly get through each puzzle they throw at you, during the game you are given small quantities of items ment to aid you along your way, i often avoided using these items whenever i could because they didn't quite fit my gameplay style but none the less they were unique enough to give each one it's own purpose!side note: Not once during the game did i feel like i was lost or didn't know what to do, the game was fairly straight forward in letting me at least know my final destonationPros:-Soundtrack-Creativity-challengeCons:-Quick changes from avoiding easy enemies into challenging boss fights-Often requires quick reactions in order to stay alive-(SPOILER ALERT) after the final boss fight i was annoyed to find myself having to make a near flawless run across a changing foreign landscape in a timely mannerthe third boss i think i found most difficult i knew what i needed to do for most of the fight it was just the exicution i found most dificult, timing the jumps and getting accurate item placement was a huge challenge in such a time crunch			"

												I've started playing Pid at the same time with FEZ. Both three-letter titles, both platformers, both Indie, both obtained without any real financial effort (I had FEZ from an old bundle and got Pid for free from the well-known giveaway). FEZ had a huge Metascore rating (91 if I remember correctly), while PID has a mere 63. Therefore I had no expectations of PID. Yet it proved so much better than FEZ.The graphics are really fine. There's a lot of creativity put into them, reminding me somehow of a colored Limbo. Both artistic and original, I prefered them anytime to the already-ubiquitous 16-bit approach of FEZ.The gamestory is decent. It's not exactly impressive but also far from ridiculous or disappointing. Despite being dull at times and lacking wit, the few dialogs are passable as well.The gameplay is its best part in my opinion. It finds the right way of being challenging without being frustrating, and this can make it unbelievable addictive. It can be very difficult at points, but since the levels are short and the checkpoints are often, you often get to feel the satisfaction of solving a level and that's what makes it so addictive. It keeps you playing without feeding you false rewards or ridiculously easy challenges. Until you get to the boss known as the ""crook"". Then you might experience some frustration like never before. There's also plenty of complexity involved in terms of items, scenes and characters, and the music really adds to the awesome overall atmosphere created by the neat graphics.I hardly managed to play a bit more than an hour of FEZ and then I realized I had no fun and had no idea what was I supposed to do and why. I'm about to reach my 5th hour of playing PID and I can hardly wait for my next work break to give it another go.In my humble opinion, it's really unfortunate that this game was the subject of that giveaway. It makes it look so much cheaper and lacking attractivity. A lot of people now have it just for the sake of having one more game in their library. That's too bad, Pid deserves a lot much more than that. On the other hand, that's how I got it too, and I love it.			"

												The game idea and aesthetics are great, but the design of the controls and mechanics which you play by are a big let down. Most of the time spent playing will be dedicated to achieving an absolute perfect execution of the solution identified to the second half of the game, when the puzzles drastically increase in difficulty. If you are VERY patient, this game would be enjoyable.			"

												Great puzzle platformer, very intuitive.You can solve puzzles in more than one way which I highly approve of in any puzzle game.One of the most important aspects for me in a game is having the freedom to choose and beat it at your own pace.If you're going for 100% then definitely use a guide on your first playthrough, because as much as I like this game, it has low replay value and TONS of missables, I wouldn't want to do normal mode all over again. Just beat normal with a guide, then go for hard (which overhauls the majority of the game) and that's about it.			"

												Pid is a game with a lot of great ideas, but poor execution makes it frustrating to play.Being a platform/puzzle game, Pid demands precision jumps and skilful use of the central game mechanic - the ability to lay beams that propel Kurt, the player character, away from the surface they are fixed on. Unfortunately, poor controls let the game down in this department. Kurt routinely 'sticks' to the end of the beams, making it difficult to jump off the end of them. Poor design of several puzzles exacerbates the problem, as many puzzles and boss battles are timed, and leave no margin for error. The result is controlling-smashing levels of frustrating in many of the puzzles.This is all the more disappointing because of the excellent game concept, graphic design, animation, sound and music, which help bring the simple but engaging story to life. Each area has a unique aesthetic and introduces new game mechanics, which ensure that the game never becomes routine or old. Each new challenge requires skilful use of the skills and abilities you have accrued so far. I can only recommend Pid if you have considerable patience to look past its flawed controls. Be prepared to spend 30% of the time enjoying the calm ambience of the game's better-designed areas, 10% of your time working out the solutions to the more challenging puzzles and areas, and 60% of your time wrestling with the terrible controls and dying over and over again as you try to get past a challenge once you have identified the solution. If you are willing to take on this frustration, then the game is definitely beautiful, original and occasionally offers some thought-provoking puzzles.			"

												Pid is an extremely charming 2.5D puzzle platformer, but its unforgiving sections in the game can often make for a frustrating time. You play as Kurt, a boy who falls asleep on a space school bus and needs to get back home. Unfortunately the planet he's on is less than willing to let you go. You must dodge clever robots and learn about the planet, which has a surprising amount of lore.The gameplay has a lot of satisfying controls like precise jumping, but its core mechanic is a superpower Kurt gets early on. You have the ability to place down up to two beams that can carry you like the Funnels in Portal 2. This opens up a lot of solutions to puzzles considering that you can place them down on almost any surface. These puzzles, as I've said before, can get a little frustratng because most of the game a single hit will kill you. And sometimes the beam placement can get finnicky and you get killed. To top off the great story and puzzling, there's a co op mode that takes Audrey with you. With two people, each person gets only one beam. Personally I think the beams are a power you shouldn't dumb down to force co operation. Instead, either give one of the partners a different power, or just give both partners two beams.Summing up Pid, it's really fun if you are normally really precise with your movement. The story is engaging and charming, and if you can part with half your power to enjoy the game with another human, then more power to you!			"

												This game just narrowly gets a thumbs up. At the beginning, you have this feeling like you're going to play a mediocre game but then it surprises you with its stunning graphics and added game mechanics. However, the plot is extremely stupid and a lot of it just isn't logical. After a few hours of playing it, you begin to grind it out essentially. The game becomes dull, and very infrequently has bosses. When it does have bosses, they are too easy and it feels like you're playing a little kid's game despite it having dark undertones. The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a shame some of the aspects of the game are mediocre. It had serious potential  to be a classic but was underwhelming at that. Should you spend the $10 for this game? Honestly, I think so. It's well worth a shot, and it's relatively easy to get addicted but its just as easy to become bored. Do not fear spending those $10 because this game is decent enough to merit spending that much.			"

												Pid was my first bought game on Steam. I started my gaming process with this one. Mixing up platforms and puzzles, Pid offers old-school difficulty and a very enjoyable experience. Definitely recommended for those who want to go back in time and make the most of a game that will bring us many hours of fun.Pid can best be described as a typical indie game: it offers a unique world, interesting audio-visual presentation and great platform gameplay with a twist. The gameplay does have some shortcomings, but overall it's a fun game.SPOILERPid's world is charming, graphics and music create a wonderful atmosphere and the puzzles are clever. But on the other hand the game punishes you for every mistake and could infuriate a Tibetan monk.			"

Even on easy it is extremely hard. Very high frustration.Kids Rating: Cartoon minor violence.Bugs: Crashed a few times.Game Control: Standard. I used a Xbox 360 controller on my PC to play the game. There seems to be a microseconds delay with my 360 controller. It might be my hardware but it did made the game harder.Save System: Check Point System. The check point system increase the frustration level of the game.Option Menu: Limited on video and audio. Typical for platformers.Recommend Buying Price: $2.50 or lower for general public. $15 or lower for players that love very hard platformers.---Pid is a very hard puzzle platfomer. Pid is one of the hardest platformer I played in some time. Took me 470 deaths to beat Pid.Proof of deaths.http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/612775985111887717/273B40F271AB9E797BB4CF6C7EC38192D0D0C5CA/The frustration level is very high and the Boss fights is a nightmare. Some bosses fight needs perfect timing jumps especially on chase scenes. If you missed a jump you have to restart the entire boss fight over again. Puzzle element in the game is pretty simple. The hard part is platforming.The developers did a wonderful job on the art style and music of the game. The ending scene is pretty wild and hard. They did a good job on the ending. No voice acting in the game but that is typical of most platformers.			"

This is on a par with Half-Life 2 for how it moves between scenes. I approve entirely. Some frustrating repetition not enough to dull my pleasant memories of this game.

												Pid is a game that is seriously at odds with itself. On one hand it wants to be an atmospheric and dreamy little puzzle platformer that has great sense of style and a fun take on traversal, and on the other it wants to be a masocore platformer, killing you over and over again until you get it right. These elements unfortunately never come together.  It feels like two entirely different games shoved into a room and told to play nice, but they never really want to. Pid's strong suit is its take on using gravity to get yourself around the world and using it to solve simple room puzzles to progress. When the game sticks to that, it's fun, and as it tucks more and more items into your inventory to play around with, the mechanics can get quit advanced and demand a lot of your critical thinking and reflexes. When the level design allows for creativity in passing obstacles with your collected items, Pid excels head and shoulders above most puzzle platformers.The parts of Pid that are out for your blood however really drag the game into the mud. When the game decides to go all ""Action Game"" mode, you're being asked to perform tasks that the laboured character movement, weapons that are needlessly hard to work with, and weak jumping arc simply can't provide. Enemies in this game work better when they're used as obstacles or a means to complete a puzzle. When on display, Pid's amazignly realized world, fantastic jazzy soundtrack, and fun gravity puzzle mechanics are when it feels truly alive and sure of itself. Real shame about those parts that don't work, though.			"

												Pid is one of the really few puzzle games, that need not just the ability to think your way out of a level, but to do it fast. Being smart alone won't get you to finish this, since in many level you have to dodge 20 rockets, avoid the spikes, kill robots, and all that while you're floating mid-air. Besides that, the story is quite sweet too. You really can feel the excitement while you're playing this game, and even though I finished it alone, I can't wait to share it with my sister an restart the whole thing all over again.			"

												Ah, where do i start with this amazing game, first off, some of the puzzles are super frustrating and can take a few tries to get past them, that is one of my only ticks with this game, Pid begins as a young boy named Kurt is left stranded on a remote alien planet. As he travels across the mysterious land, the boy must defeat terrifying robot enemies, as well as befriend unfamiliar allies in his quest to uncover an alien conspiracy and return home. Throughout the game, you can find stars, you can use those stars to buy upgrades like armor, stuff like that, but enough about that, lets talk about the most praised thing about pid, the soundtrack, i absolutely LOVE the soundtrack for pid, now the gameplay, sadly i have to be a tiny bit mean, its super repetitive to do the same puzzles and fight the same robots over and over again and it gets boring after a while. My final verdict is an 8/10, pid is an amazing game that has a beautiful soundtrack, all though it can get super repetitive, there is no doubt that this game is absolutely amazing, but i would wait until it is on sale before you get it			"

												pid is a lovely 2D platforming puzzle adventure game with a gorgeous visual aesthetic, and a charming, somewhat extra-ordinary story about a boy who, on his bus ride home from school, gets lost and trapped on a distant planet where the interplanetary traffic has died down for centuries.Unfortunately however, the controls are too floaty which makes for a frustrating platforming experience. The music is okay in itself and definitely sports a colorful variety, but it gets fairly annoying in die-a-lot sections. Same for some of the sound FX. Speaking of sounds: Kurt's footsteps sound way too heavy for a little boy, which threw me off the entire time. There are difficulty spikes all over the place, and especially the chase scenes are absolutely abysmal. If I were to guess, I'd say this game hasn't been playtested thoroughly.I wish some of the checkpoints were placed differently (for instance, not at the beginning of a cutscene). As for the gameplay, it *is* innovative at times, I'll give it that, but … bottom line: I did not enjoy myself much of the time;  I did not enjoy playing through this game. Even though I did finish pid, the experience was all in all too frustrating.5.5/1o(I have to pick Yes or No? Hm … then I rather do recommend this, but with a caution).			"

												Pid is a game that is seriously at odds with itself. On one hand it wants to be an atmospheric and dreamy little puzzle platformer that has great sense of style and a fun take on traversal, and on the other it wants to be a masocore platformer, killing you over and over again until you get it right. These elements unfortunately never come together.  It feels like two entirely different games shoved into a room and told to play nice, but they never really want to. Pid's strong suit is its take on using gravity to get yourself around the world and using it to solve simple room puzzles to progress. When the game sticks to that, it's fun, and as it tucks more and more items into your inventory to play around with, the mechanics can get quit advanced and demand a lot of your critical thinking and reflexes. When the level design allows for creativity in passing obstacles with your collected items, Pid excels head and shoulders above most puzzle platformers.The parts of Pid that are out for your blood however really drag the game into the mud. When the game decides to go all ""Action Game"" mode, you're being asked to perform tasks that the laboured character movement, weapons that are needlessly hard to work with, and weak jumping arc simply can't provide. Enemies in this game work better when they're used as obstacles or a means to complete a puzzle. When on display, Pid's amazignly realized world, fantastic jazzy soundtrack, and fun gravity puzzle mechanics are when it feels truly alive and sure of itself. Real shame about those parts that don't work, though.			"

												Seems to have a lot going for it; cool art style, good sountrack, and what seemed like interesting gameplay. However, I agree with the other most helpful negative reviews on here. This game never managed to keep my attention for too long, which is pretty rare for me. It just felt a bit...meh. Even in co-op.Edit: Co-op has a terrible camera system as mentioned by others. Probably a big part of the reason we didn't enjoy it. Follows only player 1 and ignores player 2, whereas other games of this kind would zoom out to accommodate both.			"

												An incredibly slow, occasionally frustrating platformer with charming aesthetics. If you want a very slow game with some tricky platforming elements, you will probably enjoy Pid, but the pacing and method of maneuving (toss the beams) struggled to keep my attention.PROS:-Art style is endearing.-Levels have a variety of platforming elements.NEUTRALS:-""Dispensers"" are oddly designed and seem pointless, especially since the same items are dropped by enemies and found throughout the levels anyway. -Collecting stars seems just as pointless as the dispensers. It seems the stars are finite, although there is no HUD to track if you've collected them all or not (and you spend them on consumable items..??). CONS:-For a platformer with some tricky setups, the games ""toss a beam and float through it mechanic"" leads to some very looses controls at times. It would have been much better if the player could control the actual landing point of the beam instead of it just being a set distance in front of you (this requires a bit of practice just to learn where the beam lands, and in a game with already poor pacing it really struggles to keep the player engaged).-Incredibly slow gameplay.  Looking at the achievements, less than 15% of players have beaten the first boss....probably because they got bored...-Slightly floaty controls (not bad, but they aren't tight).			"

												To my understanding, this game is still in development, so my expectations were undoubtedly exceeded when I first played this beautiful game. Whenever I play a platformer-styled game, I feel under pressure, and was pleasantly surprised once I realised how sooting the gameplay has proven itself to be.			"

												Pid is an interesting and fun puzzle platformer that uses a more nonviolent way to make the gameplay new and innovative. A simple story that takes an interesting turn of events as a child tries to find his way home and help a large body of people in the process for a new life. Sadly, Pid missed the boat when it came to the main stage. It’s definitely worth a play through.http://iamericm.com/2014/05/pid-indie-game-review/ "

												Pid introduces a fun mechanic of antigravity beams to the platformer genre, and even if the story is a little obtuse, it's a stunning game that is a lot of fun to navigate. Until you reach an obstacle. And die. Over and over until you figure it out just at the moment you're about to punch a hole through your screen and strangle your neighbor's cat. There are plenty of discoverables to challenge you, but the last thing this game needed was a bigger challenge. Not that it's hard — the solutions are right in front of you, they're just barely capable of being executed.In the end, I look forward to what Might and Delight will come up with in the future. Although, I think I’d be more excited to see them switch gears and produce an animated children’s TV series. The visual and sound design, the soundtrack, and the cast of characters was what made this game top notch, not necessarily the gameplay.			"

												First I'd like to say that I dont hate the game. The graphics are enjoyable and beautifully rendered, the style is great, character design and everything are fantastic. The story is interesting and enjoyable. The mechanic of the lifting beams is very cool and makes for a great puzzle platformer. The problem I have is with the level design.The first few ""worlds"" are really fun; not difficult, but they make you think, and you feel good for completing them. The early bosses are fun too. After a while though, around the point where -*-SPOILERS-*- you enter the city atop the castle, things start to get really frustrating. What was a linear series of puzzles became a sort of Wizards and Warriors kind of very large room with random platforms and hazards throughout, including some tough enemies and spikes, and long fall distances, coupled with strange checkpoint locations that make you start in the wrong place if you fall the wrong way. It makes it more platforming focused, and in my opinion, the mechanics of the beams and the jumping don't work well for a fast pace, precision oriented platformer. When you get to this point, expect to die a LOT; and while dying doesnt mean much since there is no game over or anything, starting off at a far back or wrong checkpoint after barely missing a tiny platform and falling onto a bullet in motion can feel very frustrating. Now they tend to keep rooms like that to a minimum, when you come across them it's easy to not know where to go, and to feel like you're missing things. Eventually I got tired dying so many times in one spot that I just gave up and went the easy way to the exit, forfeiting any would-be hidden items for the sake of just completing the game. When you get to that point, it's like, why even play the game at all? But past that specific ""room"" the puzzles just flat out get worse. They're all about precise timing and movement and not about thinking and figuring things out - which would be fine if the game hadn't taught me to think otherwise. I eventually just stopped playing because the puzzles were too annoying, I kept dying unfair deaths and felt cheated. The puzzles were easy to figure out by then, but hard to accomplish because of the tight platforming and the NUMEROUS enemies and hazards. Overall, the game could stand to be more linear in the large levels or have more and better checkpoints, they should get rid of many of the enemies, and make the puzzles more thought oriented instead of reflex oriented.If you're a masochist and like puzzles more frustrating and difficult than the worst of Limbo, then this is a great game, but honestly I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, at least not without some kind of balancing patch. Maybe I'll try it on easy mode someday and change my review, but ""notmal"" is way too hard and frustrating to be enjoyable.			"

												This is a game I totally would recomend using a controller, unless you like the idea of a 4 + 4  controll layout on the keyboard.-Not saying it doesn't work, but the actions only being labeled by a picture hurts it for me.use a controller, it makes it easier (except it refuses to treat the Dpad the same as the left stick, you can't have both mapped to  the movements.)Can remap the controlls, but still limited to pictures for the actions (no keys or buttons), & it doesn't  show wht the buttons are in the mapping, unles you know what button is what when you computer sees the input (-J1A1, +J1A1, -J1A2, +J1A2, J1B0, etc etc) and can identify them.   Also frustrating note, only keyboard buttons can be mapped  as secondary inputs, & though an external launcher that doesn't always show up.Despite those flaws, this is an honestly interesting game and worth playing.

												This is a game I totally would recomend using a controller, unless you like the idea of a 4 + 4  controll layout on the keyboard.-Not saying it doesn't work, but the actions only being labeled by a picture hurts it for me.use a controller, it makes it easier (except it refuses to treat the Dpad the same as the left stick, you can't have both mapped to  the movements.)Can remap the controlls, but still limited to pictures for the actions (no keys or buttons), & it doesn't  show wht the buttons are in the mapping, unles you know what button is what when you computer sees the input (-J1A1, +J1A1, -J1A2, +J1A2, J1B0, etc etc) and can identify them.   Also frustrating note, only keyboard buttons can be mapped  as secondary inputs, & though an external launcher that doesn't always show up.Despite those flaws, this is an honestly interesting game and worth playing.

I can't get over how much I care about the character and the story by the time I'm 2 minutes into the game. The whole world!!

												The PID is really great and smooth game, i totaly recommend it! In PID one boy's main tool to traverse the world is a beam of light: the beam moves you, your enemies, bombs and other bits of the level around, and you can have a pair in play at any time. You can also play Co-Op with your friends. There are some smart puzzles in Pid and the variety is admirable, using beams to push you over chasms, shift security cameras, or delivering primed bombs to their target. These mental tests are about the only thing that keep you engaged; ultimately, you end up fighting against the controls rather than the levels.Apsolutely recoomend from my side!			"

												The main attraction here is the beautiful art and the dreamy world. These are the best aspects of the game.The gameplay / basic mechanics essentially boil down to:1. Basic platforming (at which the game is mediocre and sometimes bad)2. Throwable levitation pebbles.The levitation pebbles are an item which you have an unlimited supply of. You throw them at a surface and it creates a sort of tractor beam rising up from the surface at which you threw it. If you throw it on the floor, you get a vertical beam that levitates you upward. But you can also throw it at walls to get a horizontal beam that carries you across gaps and so on. There are also diagonal/slanting surfaces, which allow you to create beams that elevate you in a diagonal direction. The pebbles can also be used to push enemies off of edges, lift them into spiky ceilings, and so on.However, the game is extremely repetitive, the platforming feels mostly boring, the controls don't feel very tight, and the levitation beams are more difficult to use than you'd like them to be. What starts off as a relaxing stroll of a platformer through a beautiful world of child-like whimsy soon becomes death after death after death, as the game repeatedly punishes you for failing to demonstrate accuracy and precision using a very innacurate and imprecise toolset.6/10 is a pretty fair rating, in my opinion. It's definitely not an awful game, and it's worth checking out just for the interesting art/atmosphere. But it's also not a particularly great game. Worth checking out if some of your favorite things are platformers, light puzzling, and constant repeated deaths. Otherwise, you may find the gameplay isn't as captivating as that wonderful art makes it look.Art/atmosphere: 9/10Gameplay: 5/10Overall: meh / 10			"

												I want to like this game. I love the beam mechanic and the game feels like it has so much potential, but the item system is horribly designed and kind of ruins the experience. Throughtout the game you collect stars which can be used to purchase items, but the only thing you can purchase is refills for your consumables. And the refills cost a rediculous number of stars. So essentially your consumables are then so valuable that you dare not use them unless they are absolutely required. (Like elixers in pokemon).			"

												Fun concept. Poor execution.The checkpoints are poorly thought out. There are many times where a checkpoint will save your progress beyond a place with an item, so that if you fail on your first attempt, there is no way to go back and try again. Or the checkpoint will be back far enough so that if you die you have to redo much of the level.Seems that the game was designed for controllers, not a keyboard+mouse, as there the game's functionality would be significantly improved if you could actually *aim* your light beams with a mouse. For example, consider Ori and the ability to aim where you shoot. I got about 4 hours of gameplay before getting frustrated to the point where I never want to play again, and not because of difficulty, but rather because of poor checkpoints, poor controls, and annoying enemies.

												Pid is a 2.5D platformer, standing between hardcore and puzzle approaches to its design.It certainly stands from the crowd for how beautiful it looks, with a colorful and joyful visual style, but left me a bit skeptical in its gameplay.I had my eye on this game for a while. After playing Shelter (Might & Delight's other game), I was interested in what else they had done, as Shelter is certainly a unique game! Pid seemed more traditional, but hey, why not give it a go?You play as Kurt, a kid lost in a totally unknown planet, after oversleeping in the bus. This new world draws the player in with its visuals and, well... peculiar characters. It certainly creates a wonderful world, and that was the main factor that kept me going.You visit several different places, slowly learning more about the planet and the crisis it's going through, while trying to get back to your home.All you know is that traffic and communication to the outside has suddenly stopped, leading you to help with its problems so that you can get back.The story wasn't its main focus, but it was certainly well done, and fairly interesting.And to be honest, it wasn't the actual plot I cared about, but the setting, and the people living there. And Pid certainly did the trick for me.Let's talk about its presentation.The game looks pretty incredible. Everything is very clean and smooth and has a characteristic look to it. Every person/creature looks like a puppet of sorts, and I think it contributes positively to its vibe. Its simplicity is its great strength. Also, the areas you visit look significantly different, with detailed backgrounds to draw your attention (whenever you don't have to worry about dying).Despite all the enemies in the game, it doesn't feel hostile, and it reminds me of certain games of my childhood, which is good.The music was also one of its highest points for me. Retro Family did an incredible job with it, maintaining the feel of old-school games, with a more jazz-y feel to it. Again, fairly simple, but it sounded really great, and went along with the game perfectly. It's actually something I'll be listening to outside of the game, it's pretty great!They also managed to keep it on par with the different areas, making some things more classical, or eerie, others more fast paced... I liked it a whole lot.So, let's about gameplay, shall we?This... is what left me very uncertain about the game. On one hand, I wanted to fully recommend it, but it's not nearly as well designed as I had hoped.The main mechanic is a beam of light, which alters gravity. It's a simple, yet effective mechanic. Throughout the game, you'll unlock many different items to go along with it. Some of them seemed pretty useless, however. Other were fine, but none particularly interesting that I remember. Still, it kept the gameplay varied enough not to get too boring, and it led to many different ways of approaching each problem.With this mechanic, it's obvious the it could go both ways: being a puzzler, or a hardcore platformer. It ended up doing both, but these two just felt thrown in together, with no sense of pacing, in my opinion. You'll also collect Stars to buy more items (if you don't find enough in the environment), and there are Special Constellations as well as Souvenirs, that are hidden, and work for achievement hunters, and just exploring in general. The game starts out great! Smaller rooms (with good maneuvering space, but not overwhelming, and good recovery time), with good checkpoint placement.I started out taking the time to get these secrets, and despite being challenging, it didn't feel frustrating. You would get back in the action quickly enough. I was having fun!Then, the game started to show far bigger areas, with very sparse checkpoints. And I've found myself trying to collect these secrets, and dying afterwards. And I had to do everything over again, which started to get infuriating. Besides, these checkpoints aren't reactivatable, which means that even if you get back to the supposed checkpoint, it's pointless. With the smaller rooms, this system worked fine, but as soon as it opens up, it all falls apart. You'll have to thread the same territory over and over again... the game simply doesn't respect the player's time in these circumstances.There is also a fair amount of vertical paltforming, which won't kill you for mistakes, but it'll throw you all the way down, resulting in even more time where you're not actually having fun. And this is probably my main problem with the game, and the reason why I stopped trying to go for the collectibles at one point. It was simply not worth it.While trying to be an hardcore platformer, it went against the games' foundations, and resulted in a frustrating experience, unfortunately.I don't mind hard games, but I hate games that thrive in trial and error, and repetition due to lack of checkpoints. One simply change would be letting the player keep the stars after he died, or just save whenever the player reached those secrets. It would have made things so different... but it doesn't, and it feels badly designed, in my opinion.Other than that, it's a pretty good game! If you focus more on progressing itself, and try to get into the world and the story, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. Maybe go for the collectibles in a second playthrough.The game has 4 Boss Fights (if I remember correctly), and each fight feels very different from each other, as well as each Boss. Each of them looks unique, and has its own very simple, yet recognizable personality. And they're also a good challenge! Several patterns to memorize, but you'll surely ace it after a few deaths. I enjoyed these quite a lot!Now, each stage is mostly about getting to the ending without getting killed, more in the style of a hardcore platformer than a puzzle. I say this because its focus was in execution rather than identifying the solution. Even after knowing what to do, you're likely to die several times, sometimes due to a bit unpredictable enemy behaviour.Still, as I said, there are several ways of completing each area, and while a bit hard, they're accessible, as long as you don't try to collect every Star, which gets infuriating fairly quickly. At least it did for me.Now, one big flaw, it the lack of pacing. Instead of spacing out the hard sections with a couple of puzzles in the middle, Pid just seems to have no specific order in which to throw ou problems. And it keeps getting worse, unfortunately. I think it would have benefitted from being more intervaled. Do a hard section, and then give the player a break. Let him look at the world, solve a couple of puzzles, relax. Then throw another hard sections. And then rinse and repeat.There were two moments where it had short periods of calm (after the storm) and they both felt great! On of them was the farmlands. After going through a lot, you reached a very green and lively place, that was pretty striaghtforward, without challenge for 2 minutes. Just that. Look at the houses and the trees, appreciate the world. They you're on your own.Another moment was right after the first Boss. He summoned a few creatures that felt quite hostile, with the music, the Boss and everything else. Yet, after the Boss was defeated, only one of these was alive, and there was no music. And it was at that moment that you could just look at it, listening to the noises the creature done by jumping, and realized how simple and easy it was, without all the chaos of the Boss fight. I'm not sure this was intentional, but it was certainly something that amused me!Some moments in Pid made me smile at how some simple things worked so well. The rest was a bit too frustrating, unfortunately. It seemed to punish exploration, rather than encouraging it. Don't do that...But despite its flaws, it's a good game!			"

												It's a nice little game, a little puzzle platformer.  Played this as coop and on one hand it was easier to be able to do the levels with 2 players than as a single player.  However it hasn't really have a coop ending to the game.  The most important person is the main character and it's harder to finish it in coop if you are not playing the main character.			"

												This is the first non hard-core product(AAA title) on my steam account, and let me tell you. It is one of my favorite games by far. Its a very light hearted yet challenging platformer about a young boy in space who has to travel through a house to find his way home. The visuals are very unique and honestly I never get tired of them, the music fits the mood of the game quite well and is a joy to listen too. The controls are easy to master as well, admittedly I still sometimes mess up when playing its not much of a hindrance. All in all I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a light hearted, fun loving and highly enjoyable game.10/10			"

												After playing almost 2 hours, I have to admit it is a good game... if it were not a platformer. The atmosphere is good, story is interesting to make me want to see it to the ending. But the fall down is the platforming part, 1)	It is too demanding for a casual gamer, I can accept that you die after 2 hits, but it is just impossible with the lackluster controls. 2)	Moreover, the stupid check point systems that only saves when you enter a new area made me want to smash my controller more than once when I died at the last part of a long puzzle. 3)	Having no “easy” or “people who cannot handle hard platformer” mode, it makes me sad not being able to finish the game and give it praise.Well, I guess I’ll have to youtube it then.

This game is not enjoyable difficult, it is frustratingly hard and by being so, it artificially increases its lenght. I’m playing using a X360 controller and the controls and character moves are not tight and precise. AestheticsBeautiful and colorful game. The soundtrack is great.Final NoteI really wanted to fisnish the game but I wasn't having fun. No point playing a game like this. "

												I'm really not sure why there was a sudden hype for this game, please comment here and let me know why, PLEASE!I have had this game for some time, just after release, and it was sold through videos as a really inovative platformer, but honestly, there really isn;t anything new here.ART: the art style is cool, but its nothing stunning or eye opening, and after a while you actually start to get frustrated that they havn't used much texturing at all, and then suddenly notice the lazy design desitions for this titleGAMEPLAY: Imagine a platformer... you imagined it yet? Well there you go, thats the gameplay, trust me, there isn't anything new (if you have ever played a platformer before, so don;t expect much.SOUND: I could say that the sound is like the graphics and the Gameplay, dull, simple and nothing new.CONCLUSION:If you ever wanted the most lazily designed playformer to play, look no further. Also don;t mistake me for compleatly hating the game, its alright, it functions and that better than some titles that have released that are bugged on release.Sadly it falls short as nothing new is added in the level design, so you find yourself playing the same exact levels near the end, that you did from the start.Trust			"

												Pid has all the makings of a game I would enjoy, but it falls short in so many places. It wants to be a puzzle platformer, but the puzzles are too simple to be challenging, and the controls are too squishy to platform. The controls are especially frustrating during boss fights.I think it was about the second boss fight where the game really started to go off the rails for me. Everything up until that point made sense within the world and lore of the game, but the second boss is just completely ridiculous for no reason. There isn't even any reason for him to be there story-wise. It's just something that happens to annoy you.Also, some sections require exploration and a lot of backtracking, which I normally don't mind for something like a metroidvanian game, but with Pid it's just tedious.I think this is my main problem with Pid. A lot of the design choices seem to artifically lengthen the game for no reason.I haven't beaten it yet, and I'm doubting I will, because after an obnoxious scavenger hunt section, I was rewarded with an hour of wandering aimlessly in a level literally called ""Maze"". It's just another example of how the game likes to grind its gameplay and story to a halt so you're forced to spend more time with it.It's really outstayed its welcome for me.EDIT: I finally got through the maze, and now there's a chase sequence. This game has lost all its charm for me. The controls are ~not~ tight enough to do the kind of platforming it requires. I'm done with it.			"

												Pid might be a game that you would enjoy if you are really into platformers as I thought it was pretty solid in that regard and on top of that it is really well drawn and looks unique and beautiful to me. But, I can't recommend it since I found the experience rather boring and the only reason I finished it was the fact that I just wanted to beat the game and get a few more achievements and not have it count against me in my game completion percentage.If you want to read more about my opinion on the game you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/12/pid.html.

												Well, it's a very pretty game, that's for sure!And it's fairly standard modern-games-kind of short, can be beaten in 6-15 hours, but there's a bunch of challenge modes and collectibles, too, so ya can extend that time by a bunch of hours.As for the gameplay, the main mechanic is fairly solid and pretty fun to use, and new mechanics get introduced at a nice pace, so there's always something new to catch your attention before it gets too boring. Howeverrr, it's also a very frustrating experience at times, with boss fights I personally didn't find to be very fun at all, annoyingly placed invisible checkpoints, and a slightly off spike-hit-detection, making you die way too often than you should.If you can overlook these flaws that get pretty frustrating at times, you'll find a pretty okay game experience, with some pretty cool moments hidden here and there, both visually and gameplay-wise.idk what to think of the story tho lol			"

												I was fortunate to get this game for free from a BundleStars giveaway. This game is yet another indie puzzle solving game. The game feels very polished, and I didn't run into any bugs. The gameplay concept is mostly unique among of the modern indie puzzle games that I can think of. You can use two beams to travel to out of reach areas. One hit is enough to ""kill"" your character unless you have armor. You have to avoid missles, ground units, or say out of size of other bad guys all while trying to get to progress though the environment. There are pickups you can use to open up secrets or deal with bad guys. The game is fun, but as difficult picks up (mostly from obtaining the optional stars that you can collect to buy stuff) it gets a little bit more frustrating than fun to play. If you enjoy puzzle time games this is for you. If they frustrate you it isn't. If you can get it pretty cheap it could be worth a look at if your in the first group.			"

												Pid is a great 2D platform game with a very interesting story.The physics and the graphics are stunning and the music awesome.Sometimes it will be very easy but sometimes it will be very difficult too.This game combines everything perfectly that's why the result is awesome.Buy the game!!!9,5/10			"

												Well, it's a very pretty game, that's for sure!And it's fairly standard modern-games-kind of short, can be beaten in 6-15 hours, but there's a bunch of challenge modes and collectibles, too, so ya can extend that time by a bunch of hours.As for the gameplay, the main mechanic is fairly solid and pretty fun to use, and new mechanics get introduced at a nice pace, so there's always something new to catch your attention before it gets too boring. Howeverrr, it's also a very frustrating experience at times, with boss fights I personally didn't find to be very fun at all, annoyingly placed invisible checkpoints, and a slightly off spike-hit-detection, making you die way too often than you should.If you can overlook these flaws that get pretty frustrating at times, you'll find a pretty okay game experience, with some pretty cool moments hidden here and there, both visually and gameplay-wise.idk what to think of the story tho lol			"

												This is probably the hardest platformer I've ever played, and I A+'ed all but a few of the dark levels in Super Meat Boy. The problem is that Pid isn't fun hard, it's just frustrating and annoying. Controls are awkward and inconsistent, and the checkpoint system is dreadful (invisible checkpoints everywhere, so if you fall into one while failing a difficult platform puzzle, now you have to start from a different place and if you complete the puzzle you have to make it to the NEXT checkpoint to save your progress). This is the first game since the NES days that I actually considered quitting because it was too hard.Granted, I played on Normal difficulty because I didn't realize that Easy was specifically patched in because of complaints at release. I could've dropped down to Easy, but was too proud. But if you go into this expecting a nice chill Metroidvania, as I did, then you're in for a big surprise (not the least of which is that it's not at all a Metroidvania, whoops).One especially frustrating thing is the lack of a level select. There are some secret areas that I wouldn't mind going back to, or puzzles I would like to figure out, but instead you're forced to complete them as you go. I did do a couple of the challenge rooms, and they are a fun way to do some tough puzzles without having to play through the game.			"

												Even if you got this for free, as I did, it's not worth your time.  Great atmosphere and environments, sylistically pretty, endearing characters. Occasionally well paced, with a well thought out learning and difficulty curve (I found this only to be true early on and in the factory area).  Terribly sloppy and imprecise control for what they want you to do.  Much of the game design is centered around exploiting the crappiest aspects of the control scheme to create challenge.  Boring, repetetive enemies with little to no character.  Often times, the play areas seem too open ended, with much of the game taking place on small platforms out in the open, making the game feel disjointed and since the penalty for failed exploring is so great, pointless.  Very long for a game so lacking in fun, clocking in at 12 hours to completion for me.  I did not have the trouble with bosses most are reporting, and only found the last boss in the backstage area to be truly garbage and cheap.I can't tell if they wanted this to be a punisher or not, as it seems to be mostly hard because of the design being often centered on making you battle the control to get what you want.  After more consideration, I do think they were going for a punisher style game, but they got several things wrong.  Most punishers really on precise control and overwhelming difficulty with progress gained by learning patterns and pitfalls.  This game adds an unacceptable level of randomness to an already slimy control scheme that makes me question the intentions of the designers.  Had I known the miniscule amount of enjoyment and satisfaction I would have gotten coupled with such a high level of frustration, I seriously, absolutely, 100% would never have played this.  I hope this dissuades at least one person from wasting their time and sanity on such refuse.If you must play, don't explore, and don't seek out the secrets.  Just get to the end of each area as quickly as possible.Hopefully, the developers will do something better with their obvious talents, but the lead gameplay designer needs to go take some classes.  Unfortunately, the high sales of this game have perhaps convinced them that they made something of merit.  Shame on you guys for releasing something so obviously intended to enrage people.			"

There isnt any cooperation to solve any puzzle when you are playing coop.			"

												I was fortunate to get this game for free from a BundleStars giveaway. This game is yet another indie puzzle solving game. The game feels very polished, and I didn't run into any bugs. The gameplay concept is mostly unique among of the modern indie puzzle games that I can think of. You can use two beams to travel to out of reach areas. One hit is enough to ""kill"" your character unless you have armor. You have to avoid missles, ground units, or say out of size of other bad guys all while trying to get to progress though the environment. There are pickups you can use to open up secrets or deal with bad guys. The game is fun, but as difficult picks up (mostly from obtaining the optional stars that you can collect to buy stuff) it gets a little bit more frustrating than fun to play. If you enjoy puzzle time games this is for you. If they frustrate you it isn't. If you can get it pretty cheap it could be worth a look at if your in the first group.			"

												Game is not well balanced. Beginning was very promising. Story began so smoothly and the style was fantastic. Then I have seen how the puzzles work....it's not figuring how what you have to do to progress in the game, but some things have to be precise to the micrometer or millisecond, that is not skill, is madness. At least, it is not the 'fun' I want to find in a game, Will give it another chance when I will not have something better to play.			"

												Got it for free via giveaway.  Worst $0.00 I ever spent, but at least I got my money's worth.  Played for 1 hour....and it simply made me SICK!Terrible controls.Crappy story.Bland characters.Oh...and you must be an octopus if you want to play this game.Avoid this at all costs.			"

												I really enjoy the art style and the whole look of it. Sadly 30minutes of game play was all i could stand due to the very very sluggish controls.The controls in General are just frustrating as heck which is why i stopped playing.If the developer added the mouse as a new control so you were able to aim when using items this game would be 10 times more enjoyable as you could get acurate aiming and would not need to press down then the use item button to set the light beam.

												This game is beyond frustrating, the keys for the game are so packed together, it makes you forget which key does what. With this it makes getting extra things in the game very difficult. Sure you could just ignore them, but once you do the game gets boring. Nothing special about this game at all. Now I got this game for free, I would not recommend buying this game, it would be a waste. Though I will say at first the game seemed to be a very well done puzzler, but as you move on you realize that this game is out of this world. By that I mean it should never be on planet earth because this game is garbage. Nice concept, horrible execution of the concepts, 4/10.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine An absolute adorable game, with nice animation and nice music to relax you with some puzzles and platforming. Kinda reminds me of Deadlight but without any zombies, just... robots. But be warned! It can get boring really quickly, and me personally, I got so bored that I removed it from my PC which is a shame because the art looks nice... I mean who on earth would make a puzzle platformer this difficult 9 hours long!?! NOT RECOMMENDED :(  Also, best played with a controller  "

												Forgot I even played this soon after uninstalling it. It's hard for me to review it because I can barely remember it now. I figured coming in to say that however was good enough for a review. I do remember getting this traded for me for a code I was giving away. I was like, ""sure, whatever, no idea what that is, may as well take it and try it."" I should have turned down this free game and just let him have the code for free. Games like this used to be free to play in your website's flash. Now they sell on Steam for money. Do yourself a favor. Go to a flash game website. There are tons of these, for free to play. Or buy any other platformer that exists instead. You could throw a rock out into the open ocean and probably hit a platformer better than this one now days. We're not exactly at a shortage for them.			"

												decent puzzle platformer. i dont understand how you can die on a rotating block (which apparently can happen here).. has some bugs. the game is boring and the way you have to time jumps and get through obstacles is bad. The game isn't very hard but really could use more responsive combat system and refined movement. It's not uncommon to adjust your jump next to a spike obstacle and hit it even though you weren't standing on the spikes.7/10			"

												A pretty game that is riddled with mediocre controls, frustrating segments made difficult due to the mediocre controls, and repetitive replaying of failed sections.  A 'do it again, stupid' mentality is utilized; this game is not afraid to let you die to inform you of how the developer wanted you to play through a section.  I get the feeling of a lazy, rushed, and untested approach to the many puzzles you will face.  It has attractive graphics, but be prepared to be frustrated due to no fault of your own.  It was designed that way, and is only worth purchasing at a steep discount.			"

The soundtrack is Awesome too. Finding hidden constellations <--[is that spelled correctly??] can be a treat too. (=Cons: The controls can be a little clunky, especially the jumping, takes a while getting used too;  but it can easily be made up for once you learn how place the ""gravity beams"" All it takes is 1 hit to kill you, unless you buy a vest from collecting the stars thoughout each level. That will allow an additional hit from an enemy. So prepare to die a nice amount of times. 7.5 /10			"

												TL;DR: Bad gamedesign and leveldesign ruins a good looking game and causing massive rage from someone who wants to pick up all of the things.Long version:So this game… ♥♥♥♥ this game. Don’t buy it.Ok, maybe a bit harsh, but I’ll try to explain why I feel that way.I will begin with the good thing: The graphics.The style of the graphics, or the focus, I say, is the lighting and atmosphere, they have very noise-free textures, and focus more on the models and the edges, I have to say that most of the time I loved it, although it never reached a crazy level of amazement.With that out of the way: The bad.The bad in the game is just the whole design. From what I’ve heard they wanted to create a “hard game of the past” and made the normal difficulty in this tone, theres nothing really bad in doing that and I enjoy a challenge normally. The puzzles or levels start out kind of complicated and they continue from that. I can live with that, a challenge is something to overcome. However, here’s where the extremely bad thing comes in: Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing Gamedesign Decisions.As in most games, when you take damage, you get a short invulnerability time to recover. Their time is about 1 second, which mean that your character might not even land on the ground before taking the second point of damage, which means death. This, of course, is if you have armor on you, if you don’t, you just die instantly.The game consists of moving about on the levels using a ball that you can drop to create air lifts, you need to attach that to walls, platforms, lift enemies and other things, and it works pretty well. Until you fall down onto an old area you just were inside so you have solve that area again. So not only did I fail, but I now have to move my way back to where I was to try and move on again.But here comes the closing deal for my 3 hours with this game. I am somewhat of an achiever, not anal, but if I see something that I can pick up, then I will ♥♥♥♥ing pick it up. And within 20 minutes of gameplay, the game locked me away from two of these pickups because of bad checkpoints.So what happened was: I traversed a room full of spikes on every side, climbing and managing the ballthrowing as I should, carrying the key to the door where I needed to go. Key unlocks door, I jump down at the door to look around at the optional route I saw above me outside from where I just came. I go up and yes, here’s a puzzle with a pickup as a reward. Naturally (because bad designers) you have a risk of dying while trying to solve the puzzle, because that’s fun!I make a few tries and eventually I figure out how to solve the puzzle, but get stuck in a bad way and fall down on spikes and die. And respawns down by the door. Which is now closed. I cannot get back to the pickup.I cannot backtrack, at all.Now at this point I have played for about 3 hours, I’m kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because the game is annoying to play and have very untight controls, but not willing to quit just yet, I move on.Then it happens again, barely 20 minutes later, similar situation with a door and an optional route and a puzzle where you can die. I don’t even remember how the area looks like now, but when it happened I just alt-F4’d the game.Don’t buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Firstly, this game is mega hard and I mean so hard, sometimes it made me want to just quit and never pick it up again.  However I'm glad I didn't.  Yes, that game can be frustrating, but apart from that, the story's excellent, the visuals are gorgeous and the soundtrack is so good I've started listening to it casually.  I got this game on sale.  It was about 69p (don't know how that is in other currencies) and I got my money's worth and more.  I got about 19 hours out of it on normal difficulty.  I think I'll give hard difficulty a miss though.  Great game, really recommend it.			"

												I originally saw this game played by Kurtjmac and when he ragequit, I felt I had to play this game. This game is hard, almost unfair at a particular bossfight that likely consumed a third of my playtime. That said, the story is captivating and the visuals are beautiful. Those with angery problems should either play on easy mode or avoid this game entirely. Thosed used to the difficulty of a game such as this will be welcomed.			"

												Pid is an interesting puzzle platformer game with a unique light ray mechanic that is used for mobility and problem solving.The aesthetics of the game are top notch, and for the most part, the levels themselves are well thought out. There are a few exceptions to this however (maze level, dark maze, and final escape) that are just poorly thought out and feel like a tiresome grind rather than something that is skill-based and enjoyable.Great game up until the end.

												A truly intriguing platformer with a solid, enjoyable story, Pid will keep you captivated for hours. Simple playing mechanics with nearly impossible secret areas will test the player through multiple unique levels requiring much coordination. But be warned, the game can be very frustrating at times, and some areas will warrant several restarts. Gameplay is easier with a controller, and some monotonous moments will have you feeling like the easiest solution is the necessary one.			"

												Pid is really a great game. You started as a child named Kurt and journeying in a distant planet because of bus traffic problem. The journey is quite challenged in normal difficulty(i havent tried easy and hard difficulty yet), but what the most challenging in this game is exploring secrets. The secret is always the most difficult part in this game, even beating the Boss(which is hard too). I would like to you that if you finish this game without completing at least half of the secret, you havent taste the real taste of this game.The graphic is good. Graphical part like the particle, animation, environment, debris and doodads are all good. Personally, I like the way they(whoever draw the game) draw the house, city and the environment. The sound is also good.  All sound when using item or ambient sound are all good. The sound is not excessive nor too minimal. Thats make the sound recognizanble and ad the same time didnt disturbing the gameplay. Well, i think most of game follow that rules, but i just feel i have to say something about that.The music is good too. Background music when exploring and beating boss is quite good. Personally, I like the music when beating the last boss. Its like remind me that ""this is the last boss, so this is the hardest part of this game"", or something like that.The control is easy, so i think this game is good for everyone. Its just 11 button to play this game, and you mostly only use 8 of them. The game story is also good, with shocking ending. Its the matter of perception, though.To summarize, i recommended this game. Try this game!			"

												After about 10 years of using Ubuntu and it's easy to manage packages I decided to make the move to Gentoo, a slightly more obscure linux variant with much fewer help. In Ubuntu occassionally I would blow stuff up, installing a new programming language would mess up something or maybe an update would conflict my own software, in Ubuntu I was never more than a few minutes away from a kind chat room and some decent help. Gentoo on the other hand kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ I actually managed to delete windows when installing Gentoo, then I had to access the internet from a command life before I could get into Gnome which in turn turned out to be a hassle because Gnome was doing a controversial upgrade only partially supported by the Gentoo community. I really thought I knew a lot about Linux before Gentoo, it turned out knowing a lot about Linux meant being on the road to a computer science degree. In the forums, I could go days with out a reply to my messages, and ops often didn't have answers as simple or easy to follow as the Ubuntu folks, the end result was that a simple global update might take 2 weeks of weeding through errors, manuallying compiling libraries, pruning independencies, it was a nightmare. Pid is a lot like that experience. The game is tough. How tough? It's so hard they had to add an easy mode. This comes in a day and age in which difficultly is often praised as a feature in games. Pid doesn't reward you for failure, you don't get a cute animation, and often you already know the sequence to the puzzle Pid is asking you to solve, it's merely getting the timing right that makes it hard. You also die in one hit at the beginning, you do get sweat shirts later on that pile up into a small comfort zone, but Pid also lacks a few seconds of invulnerability after being hit, hence one bad fall onto an enemy can destroy your entire safety net. However, if you perserve great things await you. The game becomes a Miyamoto like pile of mechanics. Pid is organized into small sections which often operate idependently of each other. The mechanic in one part will disapate into a new one in the next room. Pid doesn't lack ideas. It also has a mega man style inventory that grows into items which while rarely used (I never used the boots the entire game) are the key to certain puzzles in the game. Pid is so difficult that one sequence of play taking at most 5 minutes to finish took me almost 2 weeks to complete (it turned out I needed to use bombs). The major problem with the difficultly is the way it doesn't reward variety of use the designers are so strern as to disallow alternative solutions forcing you into often ardous sequences of hand eye co-ordination), however making it through these puzzles does have it rewards. The later sections of PID open up into wonderful puzzle platformer segements that will keep you thinking and are thankfully laid out in such a manor that frequently dying to them isn't a chore. The art style is simply amazing and continues to excel the whole game through, the music hits a crescendo in the theater, but is original and well done. The story line lags, but the world tells a surrealist fable that's hard not to love. So essentially if you're the type of person who sit around debugging linux updates for weeks on end, or loved Braid to the bitter end of 100% completition, PID is definitely the game for you. It took 10 hours to finish it with over 637 deaths in total, but I am so glad I finished this game and got to see it for all it's worth. The challenge levels are also nice.			"

												Puzzles + Platformer is a great start in my book, but combine it with great art direction, music and atmosphere and you have yourself a game that is as enjoyable to look at as it is to play.The mechanics are simple, but requires time to master. Initially, the gravity well will be used to assist with reaching greater heights but later on you'll be forced to apply this mechanic to get across obstacles and bypass enemies...or impale them. Speaking of enemies: there is a nice variety of them, each with their own peculiarities and weakness. Hint: Take notice of their color.Finally, be prepared to die often. You only have 1 HP - 2HP depending on how you equip your character, but fortunately in most cases this means reverting back to where you were 1 - 2 seconds before you met your untimely demise.Solid game.

												This game will make you scream.I played it on easy and the first half really is fun.  The levels are challenging but achievable and they make you think as well as twiddle buttons.  But then the second half comes along and it's a matter of playing and replaying the same checkpoint over and over again.  Scraping a baddie with your toenail will cause you to die, and the game has no problem killing you a millimetre from level completion.  In the statistics it gives you on completion, I found out I had died 459 times.  Excessive much?I finished the game, but I felt no sense of achievement, only relief.  However, I did finish it, the game compelled me to keep going, and that's why I give it the thumbs up.  But only just.The game is pretty, has a nice story, and the first half is enjoyable, but you need to be prepared for the frustration and hair pulling that comes with the second half.  Also, the co-op mode is a nice extra touch, makes it replayable. Though you do need to make sure you are good friends, or never really liked each other that much in the first place...			"

												Pid is an interesting puzzle platformer game with a unique light ray mechanic that is used for mobility and problem solving.The aesthetics of the game are top notch, and for the most part, the levels themselves are well thought out. There are a few exceptions to this however (maze level, dark maze, and final escape) that are just poorly thought out and feel like a tiresome grind rather than something that is skill-based and enjoyable.Great game up until the end.

												Very interesting little 2D scroller platform game where you (Kurt) have to find a way to the city by traversing through an unknown land. Along the way you must find secret caverns which contain star contellations. There are also secret contellations in hard-to-reach areas. Aswell as these challenges you also have 12 memorabilia items throughout the entire game. This game can be fairly hard however i believe for it to be a great game!8.7/10Jimsayshi96			"

												This game will make you scream.I played it on easy and the first half really is fun.  The levels are challenging but achievable and they make you think as well as twiddle buttons.  But then the second half comes along and it's a matter of playing and replaying the same checkpoint over and over again.  Scraping a baddie with your toenail will cause you to die, and the game has no problem killing you a millimetre from level completion.  In the statistics it gives you on completion, I found out I had died 459 times.  Excessive much?I finished the game, but I felt no sense of achievement, only relief.  However, I did finish it, the game compelled me to keep going, and that's why I give it the thumbs up.  But only just.The game is pretty, has a nice story, and the first half is enjoyable, but you need to be prepared for the frustration and hair pulling that comes with the second half.  Also, the co-op mode is a nice extra touch, makes it replayable. Though you do need to make sure you are good friends, or never really liked each other that much in the first place...			"

												Puzzles + Platformer is a great start in my book, but combine it with great art direction, music and atmosphere and you have yourself a game that is as enjoyable to look at as it is to play.The mechanics are simple, but requires time to master. Initially, the gravity well will be used to assist with reaching greater heights but later on you'll be forced to apply this mechanic to get across obstacles and bypass enemies...or impale them. Speaking of enemies: there is a nice variety of them, each with their own peculiarities and weakness. Hint: Take notice of their color.Finally, be prepared to die often. You only have 1 HP - 2HP depending on how you equip your character, but fortunately in most cases this means reverting back to where you were 1 - 2 seconds before you met your untimely demise.Solid game. Thumbs up.			"

												A truly intriguing platformer with a solid, enjoyable story, Pid will keep you captivated for hours. Simple playing mechanics with nearly impossible secret areas will test the player through multiple unique levels requiring much coordination. But be warned, the game can be very frustrating at times, and some areas will warrant several restarts. Gameplay is easier with a controller, and some monotonous moments will have you feeling like the easiest solution is the necessary one.			"

												Great platformer, sadly it didn't get the attention it deserved. It has a few flaws (sometimes there are too many enemies on the same screen at the same time and it ends up making the screen too busy and difficult to navigate, for example), but the game, although difficult, is never infuriating (I'm looking at you They Bleed Pixels), has enough charm, length (~10 hours), great visuals and an incredible soundtrack. A Castle, a dinner room, a kitchen, an opera house. You will complete a world and want to keep playing, just to see what's next, even after hours into the game. Give Pid a chance, you won't regret it.			"

												This game is a rose: it's pretty to look at, comes in a variety of colors, and its thorny difficulty might throw you off guard if you're coming in expecting a walk in the park. But to me, the enjoyment gained from pid is not undone by its difficulty. The repulsor beam, cruel mistress though it may be, once mastered leads to a not imprecise puzzle platformer that requires skill and mind both. But that difficulty is subdued in it sharpness by the wonderful moments that the player meets throughout the story. My personal favorite moment came when, whilst traversing the maze level, a traditionally tedious experience in most games, soft saxophone music started playing as you neared the exit, turning an otherwise trying level into a moment of sudden zen where the tone aided the design of the level. The story itself weaves these pleasent moments into a charming tale of a marooned little boy forced to fix the bus schedule of an alien world. And it's this story, this subdued tone, and the enjoyable gameplay that for me make this game well worth experiencing if you have the time to savor them.			"

I like the overall look of the game and the story,  my only dissapointment was that the ending was more like pictures and not a cutscene.

												Pid is both great and terrible at different points in the game. I'd estimate 75% of it is a very well made and very well thought out puzzle-platformer. The remaining 25% is a frustrating mess that has terrible controls and frustrations. Its frustrations do not come out of its difficulty, but out of the fact that the controls do not live up to the challenge. In some of the key difficult moments in this game, the game does not behave like a well-designed platformer(Rayman Origins, Ms. Splosion Man, Super Meat Boy, etc).However, when the game is good, it is really good. Lots of challenge, lots of great levels, and a whole lot of fun. I played it in co-op mode with my wife. The co-op is nice, but it has problems. The camera is not smart and follows only one player. Frequently, one of us would fall to our death and the camera chose to stick with the falling player, cutting off the living one and making it impossible. Total mess. Also, the game is not optimized for co-op. It's the same single player mission, which sometimes makes levels much harder. We had to have one of us sit still while the other played. Then again, a few puzzles were cake with co-op, but we saw the difficulty in single player.Pros:+ Lots of variety(platforming, puzzling, stealth, bosses, and more)+ Neat mechanic(beam)+ Controls adequately most of the time+ Offers a co-op mode+ Lengthy and highly worth the low price pointCons- Co-op is badly designed- Controls can be terrible at time. Poor response. Used Xbox 360 controller. - Infuriatingly difficult at times and not in fun ways. - Poor music and not a beautiful game- Boring story that think it is better than it is.I got the game for $3 and it was definitely worth it at that price. Pick it up, but know there are some issues. 6.5/10 "

												PidPid (Planet in Distress) is a platforming/puzzle game made by Might and Delight. I was lucky enough to get it from a Twitter Giveaway. I feel not enough people have played this truly amazing game, It features a unique art style with kooky looking characters and world, The only game I feel it bares resembles to is Little Big Planet for the PS3, PSVITA. It has great level mechanics, with the inclusion of a tool which allows you to place beams which will lift you up (similar to Light Bridges from Portal 2), this makes for most the puzzles in the game, to aid the player on his journey he can get items using Stars he collects, Items Include things like Armour, Bombs etc.But also along the way there are hidden items, called memories which are souverniers, from playing the game, they seem to be very well hidden as I haven't even found one yet!.One thing I really love about this game is the soundtrack it is amazing! really sets the mood, from the slow jazz at the beginning of the game to the catchy melodies later on. A concept I find really intresting in this game is there are sort of stealth elements to it, some enemies will if they detect you cause you to die, this makes more stratergy as to when to time movements, which leads me on to my next point, Pid is Hard, the puzzles aren't to hard but some of the platforming bits require movements which are done in a window of only seconds.Once you have finished the story the game also has some other content, such as CO-OP, Challenge Maps and the Leaderboards to see how fast you can finish the game.The only problem I have with the game, is at times it can feel a little repetive, I feel should there be a sequel, maybe adding more power ups or something would spice it up.So In conclusion even though I was given this game I would happily pay for it, and I recommend you do as Might and Delight are making some excellent indie games.Go Buy It!

												Pid is a super atmosperic, dreamy and hard game. Really Freakin' hard.I died 888 times (I swear I'm not making that up).This is a punisihng game, and we're I using a controller, there would have been numerous holes in the wall by the time I finished Pid. If it wasn't already clear - I'm not talking about ""hard"" difficulty.I picked this up for cheap, but if you like platformers that are a little ""different"", then always look for games coming out of Scandinavia ;)The main mechanic is quite uniqe (kind of a tractor beam) and this is what diffeerentiates pid from most other games of the genre.Definitely worth picking up if you're into unforgiving platformers!

												I got this game for free, I've loved it ever since and I would definitely pay money for it.Pid is a charming and atmospheric platformer that combines mysterious gameplay and a cute art style with mechanics that are not seen in most games. The development that went into this game must have been from an artistic genius, because the amount of care that went into animation and drawing is good enough to exaggerate about. The mechanics, they offer a style of gameplay which cannot be found elsewhere. And lastly, the difficulty, it provides a challenge that will have you screaming for hours, but at the same time completely relaxed.This is a wonderful game, highly recommended.			"

												After about 10 years of using Ubuntu and it's easy to manage packages I decided to make the move to Gentoo, a slightly more obscure linux variant with much fewer help. In Ubuntu occassionally I would blow stuff up, installing a new programming language would mess up something or maybe an update would conflict my own software, in Ubuntu I was never more than a few minutes away from a kind chat room and some decent help. Gentoo on the other hand kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ I actually managed to delete windows when installing Gentoo, then I had to access the internet from a command life before I could get into Gnome which in turn turned out to be a hassle because Gnome was doing a controversial upgrade only partially supported by the Gentoo community. I really thought I knew a lot about Linux before Gentoo, it turned out knowing a lot about Linux meant being on the road to a computer science degree. In the forums, I could go days with out a reply to my messages, and ops often didn't have answers as simple or easy to follow as the Ubuntu folks, the end result was that a simple global update might take 2 weeks of weeding through errors, manuallying compiling libraries, pruning independencies, it was a nightmare. Pid is a lot like that experience. The game is tough. How tough? It's so hard they had to add an easy mode. This comes in a day and age in which difficultly is often praised as a feature in games. Pid doesn't reward you for failure, you don't get a cute animation, and often you already know the sequence to the puzzle Pid is asking you to solve, it's merely getting the timing right that makes it hard. You also die in one hit at the beginning, you do get sweat shirts later on that pile up into a small comfort zone, but Pid also lacks a few seconds of invulnerability after being hit, hence one bad fall onto an enemy can destroy your entire safety net. However, if you perserve great things await you. The game becomes a Miyamoto like pile of mechanics. Pid is organized into small sections which often operate idependently of each other. The mechanic in one part will disapate into a new one in the next room. Pid doesn't lack ideas. It also has a mega man style inventory that grows into items which while rarely used (I never used the boots the entire game) are the key to certain puzzles in the game. Pid is so difficult that one sequence of play taking at most 5 minutes to finish took me almost 2 weeks to complete (it turned out I needed to use bombs). The major problem with the difficultly is the way it doesn't reward variety of use the designers are so strern as to disallow alternative solutions forcing you into often ardous sequences of hand eye co-ordination), however making it through these puzzles does have it rewards. The later sections of PID open up into wonderful puzzle platformer segements that will keep you thinking and are thankfully laid out in such a manor that frequently dying to them isn't a chore. The art style is simply amazing and continues to excel the whole game through, the music hits a crescendo in the theater, but is original and well done. The story line lags, but the world tells a surrealist fable that's hard not to love. So essentially if you're the type of person who sit around debugging linux updates for weeks on end, or loved Braid to the bitter end of 100% completition, PID is definitely the game for you. It took 10 hours to finish it with over 637 deaths in total, but I am so glad I finished this game and got to see it for all it's worth. The challenge levels are also nice.			"

												Unique 2D action adventure with beautiful graphic, neat music and attractive storyline.The protagnosit young boy, Kurt, was on the interplanetary bus for his school trip, only to find himself left alone on the unknown planet. At first he tried to board on the bus to go home, but strangely the bus had never arrived there since the last time 300 years ago. He had to find another way to get out of the planet. And there's something happening which shut out everything from outside...The system is unique which uses the beam to carry himself and certain kinds of enemies. Other tricks such as bombs and laser are also abundant so the gameplay is far from sterile. Some stages are challenging. I had to start over several times there, but I could bear it and eventually went through. It has many auto save points to get players to feel the progress. Also it has additional challenges to keep players going on if they want more. The graphic is atmospheric and detailed as screenshots show. One of the highly refined games on steam.			"

												Firstly, this game is mega hard and I mean so hard, sometimes it made me want to just quit and never pick it up again.  However I'm glad I didn't.  Yes, that game can be frustrating, but apart from that, the story's excellent, the visuals are gorgeous and the soundtrack is so good I've started listening to it casually.  I got this game on sale.  It was about 69p (don't know how that is in other currencies) and I got my money's worth and more.  I got about 19 hours out of it on normal difficulty.  I think I'll give hard difficulty a miss though.  Great game, really recommend it.			"

												Pid is a beautiful game and very creative. Buy this if you enjoy challenging platformers!Pros:- great level design- spot-on controls- unique mechanic: throwing beams- captivating world and story- lovely art and soundtrackPossible Cons:- especially the last level is very hard, you will need the patience to attempt the same section dozens of times- do not play if you are a 100%er. Some of the secrets are simply insanely hard. I am talking ""100% super meat boy"" kinda hard. "

												Great platformer, sadly it didn't get the attention it deserved. It has a few flaws (sometimes there are too many enemies on the same screen at the same time and it ends up making the screen too busy and difficult to navigate, for example), but the game, although difficult, is never infuriating (I'm looking at you They Bleed Pixels), has enough charm, length (~10 hours), great visuals and an incredible soundtrack. A Castle, a dinner room, a kitchen, an opera house. You will complete a world and want to keep playing, just to see what's next, even after hours into the game. Give Pid a chance, you won't regret it.			"

												Puzzles + Platformer is a great start in my book, but combine it with great art direction, music and atmosphere and you have yourself a game that is as enjoyable to look at as it is to play.The mechanics are simple, but requires time to master. Initially, the gravity well will be used to assist with reaching greater heights but later on you'll be forced to apply this mechanic to get across obstacles and bypass enemies...or impale them. Speaking of enemies: there is a nice variety of them, each with their own peculiarities and weakness. Hint: Take notice of their color.Finally, be prepared to die often. You only have 1 HP - 2HP depending on how you equip your character, but fortunately in most cases this means reverting back to where you were 1 - 2 seconds before you met your untimely demise.Solid game. Thumbs up.			"

												Pid is really a great game. You started as a child named Kurt and journeying in a distant planet because of bus traffic problem. The journey is quite challenged in normal difficulty(i havent tried easy and hard difficulty yet), but what the most challenging in this game is exploring secrets. The secret is always the most difficult part in this game, even beating the Boss(which is hard too). I would like to you that if you finish this game without completing at least half of the secret, you havent taste the real taste of this game.The graphic is good. Graphical part like the particle, animation, environment, debris and doodads are all good. Personally, I like the way they(whoever draw the game) draw the house, city and the environment. The sound is also good.  All sound when using item or ambient sound are all good. The sound is not excessive nor too minimal. Thats make the sound recognizanble and ad the same time didnt disturbing the gameplay. Well, i think most of game follow that rules, but i just feel i have to say something about that.The music is good too. Background music when exploring and beating boss is quite good. Personally, I like the music when beating the last boss. Its like remind me that ""this is the last boss, so this is the hardest part of this game"", or something like that.The control is easy, so i think this game is good for everyone. Its just 11 button to play this game, and you mostly only use 8 of them. The game story is also good, with shocking ending. Its the matter of perception, though.To summarize, i recommended this game. Try this game!			"

												This would be a great game if not some of the gameplay elements.Despite my long in-game time and overall fondness for hard games, I cannot call it well spent time - it was full of frustration and boredom, which kills great atmosphere, pretty good soundtrack and awesome idea behind this title. Respawn times and terrible checkpoint system made Might and Delight game painful for me.Sites like Indiegala sometimes gives away this game for free, or you might buy it for lowered price - maybe you'll enjoy this title more than me, what I wish for you.

												This game is a rose: it's pretty to look at, comes in a variety of colors, and its thorny difficulty might throw you off guard if you're coming in expecting a walk in the park. But to me, the enjoyment gained from pid is not undone by its difficulty. The repulsor beam, cruel mistress though it may be, once mastered leads to a not imprecise puzzle platformer that requires skill and mind both. But that difficulty is subdued in it sharpness by the wonderful moments that the player meets throughout the story. My personal favorite moment came when, whilst traversing the maze level, a traditionally tedious experience in most games, soft saxophone music started playing as you neared the exit, turning an otherwise trying level into a moment of sudden zen where the tone aided the design of the level. The story itself weaves these pleasent moments into a charming tale of a marooned little boy forced to fix the bus schedule of an alien world. And it's this story, this subdued tone, and the enjoyable gameplay that for me make this game well worth experiencing if you have the time to savor them.			"

												5.9/10 I guess I will have to give it a thumbs up because it a solid well built game with a fun story, solid chill music, really nice artwork and character design...But while I offer it a thumbs up I can't really recommend it if that makes sense. The game is pretty darn long and while your not hating the game while playing it, after the first sitting your probably going to find yourself just wanting to get to the end....Pid is just kinda boring...It's more of a platformer than a puzzle game. There are a few satisfying puzzles, but mostly you don't get that invested in overcoming the puzzles because they are just little stops between platforming. For me a big sign that a game isn't very compelling is if I am willing to cheat...I love puzzle platformers, and in games like Limbo and Inside I never considered cheating, but in Pid there where a few point where its like ""what am i supposed to do? ehh this game is dragging♥♥♥♥♥ let just looks this up and get to end already"" Did Limbo and Inside in 6ish hours but they didn't feel like short or long games cause pacing was great...Pid took 20 some hrs ugh.FOR A GAME THAT FOCUSES ON PLATFORMING THE CONTROLS ARE FLOATY AND MUSHY...thats my biggest gripe....I need to be able enter and exit beams in a consisten way and throw beams in a certain direction with some reliability.  Pro's-Unique Art style-Interesting universe and story -Good music at times...Very chill wich is unique for this type of game-Voice acting is cool and diolouge is goodCon's-Controls will make you throw things at times...especially thowing beams and trying to exit them with any precision-Combat is pretty meh-You just sort of want the game to end after not to long...I'm not sure why...maybe the story isn't that gripping...not that satisfying to advance the plot			"

This game has impressive 3D graphics, though the game operates in two dimensions. The level design is excellent, and is made so few new features have to be formally introduced, but are rather taught to you subtly. It follows many major, yet basic, game design rules modern games often fail to address. Artistically, this game makes me squeal with joy. The lighting engine is brilliant. I especially enjoyed the outdoorsy bits, where it was very open-wordly. This game has a very simple premise, yet introduces new concepts consistently, even till the point where it introduced several major features in the last level. The bosses are clever, and require dexterity, as well as problem solving skills, as the rest of the game is. One of the biggest things about this game is its impressive co-op integration. Storyline-wise, NPC speech never addresses the second character, which is a bit of a shame, but gameplay-wise, it's done amazingly. With a second player, each player has less maneuverability, but together new tasks can be accomplished. It's a nice trade-off, and yet, none of the level design has to be changed for it to operate. I've played through the game almost two times now, and that filled 25 hours. Even now, I still have challenge rooms to complete, and easy and hard mode for new depth. I'm excited to continue this game, and would argue that it supplies a minimum of 40 hours to a player as dedicated as I am. I would give this game a solid 9.5 out of 10. Excellent game.			"

												Pid differentiates from the unholy slew of mediocre 2D platformers in a couple of ways which excuse it for existing.It works well enough on modern systems, many other 2D platformers don't.The developers decided to use 3D graphics presented in a 2D way - the graphics are simplistic but tastefully done, enough to give the game a pass for this.   Gameplay controls are customisable, but points are lost for pushing the tablet/console aspect.Gameplay is the same old stale 2D platformer guff, however.   If you really like 2D platformers, then this is probably one of the best out there.   Should you buy it? No, unless you love 2D platformers, in which case, go right ahead, although bear in mind this game does look like a console/tablet port.Recommended simply for accomplishing the developers somewhat questionable goal.

												PID is an interesting, entertaining and sometimes challenging platformer game. It's a game, which exceeded my expectations in many ways. I get it when it was free and wasn't expecting anything good. But when I tried it I was fascinated by its lovely graphic design and interesting gameplay. I recommend playing this game in coop - I found the cooperative gameplay really entertaining. I've rarely had such fun in a platformer game. Sometimes it gets a little frustrating when you can't figure out a certain puzzle or when you're stuck somewhere, but when you share your gameplay experience with someone it's always funny. The game keeps changing a lot - graphically and in terms of gameplay - you'll never do the same thing twice. The story is good and keeps you interested. Although I got the game when it was free I'd definitely buy it if I knew how good it was. So, yes, I recommend getting this game, it's fun.			"

												Soft on the eyes and easy on the mind, except for those randomly scattered locals that are usually suspended above a pit of death and require some sort of god-like manipulation of the mechanic to traverse and usually only reward you with more stars, the which I seldom use because baddies often drop everything the stars can buy.  This game has a lot of side content that, for some reason, I feel completely fine with skipping over.  It is similar to the stars in Braid - I could dedicate the time to search out and figure out how to get all the extra content of this game, but I won't - I have too many other games on my steam backlog and too little time to play them.  Makes me wonder.  If this game was the only game I owned, certainly I would play it until the end of the Earth and unravel all its mysteries until 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ completion.  And if I did such a thing, certainly my experience with this game would be much more profound and emotional.  Similar to when I was 8 years old and would play over and over 'A Boy and his Blob'  on the NES.  But, due to games being so damn cheap and accessible, I tend to use my time to experience superficially 15 different games than experience in full capacity one game.  These words would probably make the guy who made 'The Witness' turn over in his grave because that guy clearly wants you to be willing to spend a lot of your time not just on one game, but one puzzle in one game.  He wants you to invest countless hours to one moment so that when it all clicks you can have that cocaine-like reaction of 'WOW!!!""  ""AHA!!!!""  ""I GET IT!!!!!!""  He is like a drug-dealer for my mind.  I guess I get that reaction elsewhere because I am not motivated to pursue it in this game.			"

												Don't get me wrong. It has a beautiful concept and gameplay but I wouldn't recommend this game for short-tempered gamers. You must have lots of patience because you'll die hundreds of times that it becomes too repetitive and frustrating. Why? First of all, the frame rate drops. It's smooth almost but on parts that has many visuals going on the background added with Kurt's power ups, it slows down. I played this game on windowed mode with a controller just so you know. Second, keyboard controls are confusing. I tried it but man.. you'll definitely have a hard time. Finally, in my case it's very frustrating especially in the near end of the game. Right after I finished the story, I immediately uninstalled and yelled, ""♥♥♥♥ you Pid I beat yo'♥♥♥♥♥in the end!"".100/1000 would rather die thousands of times in Dark Souls 2 than in this game.

												Going to keep this short and sweet: This is an awesome platformer with a ton of variety, well thought off concept that works well. Make no mistake this is a difficult game, and you will be retrying on some portions quite a lot but in general its all very doable (at least on normal) and the difficulty is just right in my opinion. The sweet part is that you can bypass certain obstacles in multiple ways depending on the strategic use of all of your items. There is ton of areas to explore and logical puzzles to solve which is all good. I really don't have much to take against this game, it is severely underrated. 9.5/10			"

												I've had Pid in my library forever but only recently got around to playing it and while I have not beaten it yet I feel it is a fun game worth your time.You play as Kurt a kid who falls asleep on the bus and gets dropped off at an unfamiliar place and has to find his way back to the city to get the bus back home.  You start off only being able to jump but soon get a new ability which allows you to throw gems to create beams of light perpindicular to the surface they land on.   These beams of light last a short while and propel you along them.  You can pickup bonus items, both passive and active, and assign two active items at a time, one to each trigger on a game controller.  The art style is unique and the animations and control are well done; not once did I feel like I was fighting the controls of the game to accomplish getting to the next room.   The music was pretty good but got a little repetitive even after a few hours of gameplay.Recommended, but pick it up on sale as it is probably not a ""must have"", rather it is a ""neat game to have"".

I had just unlocked the main ability in the game, the tractor beam thing, and I thought to myself, being the absolute completionist that I am, ""Well now that I have this thing, I better go back to the start of the level and see what secrets I can find there"". After like 10 minutes of backtracking, I was there, and I saw this perfect ledge to go up on, and another, and another. It was perfectly laid out to help me up this tunnel, and after 10 more minutes I got to the top, and I was graciously rewarded by... an invisible wall.Not for the completionistGet it on sale - 6/10			"

												This is what I would consider the Medea of indie games.It has an amazing story, a beautiful art style, and enthralling music. The boss fights are truely some of the best I've seen in a long time. There is one problem, though. Being in my books the ""Medea of video games"", it shares the exact same problem Medea has. The beginning is amazing, the middle is enthralling, and all the way up to right before the final boss, it is a generally good time (I found the final ""giant"" boss to be quite dull, and the Ken boss fight wasn't great, either, but at least they were both enjoyable). The problem is, though, the final boss fight is, sadly to say, mediocre at best. Compared to the others, it seems stiched together at the last minute. You beat the final boss with no satisfaction, more just a feeling of relief that you don't have to deal with his annoying attack patterns anymore and it's all over, only to realize that it is then followed by 3 platforming sections (2 of which are, like the final boss, more annoying then enjoyable). Though, all of that said, I can easily say that this is one of my favorite video games of all time (I love Medea just the same), and I would recommend it to anybody that likes platforming games (word of advice, it strays a bit more towards the frustrating / difficult side of platforming in some times) and to I believe all people I know!

Similar to when I was 8 years old and would play over and over 'A Boy and his Blob'  on the NES.  But, due to games being so damn cheap and accessible, I tend to use my time to experience superficially 15 different games than experience in full capacity one game.  These words would probably make the guy who made 'The Witness' turn over in his grave because that guy clearly wants you to be willing to spend a lot of your time not just on one game, but one puzzle in one game.  He wants you to invest countless hours to one moment so that when it all clicks you can have that cocaine-like reaction of 'WOW!!!""  ""AHA!!!!""  ""I GET IT!!!!!!""  He is like a drug-dealer for my mind.  I guess I get that reaction elsewhere because I am not motivated to pursue it in this game.			"

												I both like and hate this game, so unforgiving checkpoints on some of the secrets it's just rediculus. Wrong type of hard in my oppinion. It's not hard to figure out, just hard to execute and I feel like it's the wrong kind of choice for this game.I still give it a recommendation but I only paid 1$ for it on sale. 10$ is stretch.			"

												I believe I got this game key from a trade on another website. However, today I decided to give it a try. It was a relatively small download, which is nice. The game has a simplistic story, but the presentation is pretty good. I have only played a short while, but what I have played so far is good. It seems to be a platformer with emphasis upon puzzles over action... at least at this point. While my PC can play it, it doesn't run the game at a very good FPS, even on low graphics settings, it does at least playable. I do feel like my PC should be able to run this game at a higher frame rate, but I've seen much worse. So, I'd say the optimization could be better, but is not horrible. I have tagged this game to play more in the future when I have a faster computer. The graphics are pretty cute and have a certain charm about them. The presentation is good. There are some characters who speak by means of text and gibberish which sounds like a foreign language. I believe the Zelda games may have used this method in the past. I believe it is effective and is much better than mere text.			"

												I got this game for free, I've loved it ever since and I would definitely pay money for it.Pid is a charming and atmospheric platformer that combines mysterious gameplay and a cute art style with mechanics that are not seen in most games. The development that went into this game must have been from an artistic genius, because the amount of care that went into animation and drawing is good enough to exaggerate about. The mechanics, they offer a style of gameplay which cannot be found elsewhere. And lastly, the difficulty, it provides a challenge that will have you screaming for hours, but at the same time completely relaxed.This is a wonderful game, highly recommended.			"

												A Indie styled platformer with some unique mechanics and a decent story arc. It keeps gameplay fresh by introducing new alterations to the levels that force you to use your tools in different ways. The bosses, while typically looking pretty great, are the most tedious parts of this game. Between those and several indiana jones-esque running levels, the games dificulty level not only curves up, but ANGLES up. A few hours in and it goes from a somewhat casual game to meatboy like brutality. Only this isn't meatboy, your controls are super floaty and the tools don't always go where you expect them, making you yell obscenities at your screen. The ending and final boss left me unfulfilled for the 10 or so hours I put in. Still a decent game, but I wouldn't be surprised if tons of people start this game and then abandon it when the dificulty spike leaves them throwing a controller into the wall. Not reccommending it due to that, but it is well made, didn't crash, and I played through it to completion, so clearly nothing offended me so much to quit playing.			"

												This game came out of nowhere...I knew nothing of the game's existence until it was suggested to me in my ""Recommended"" Steam page. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, and, given my penchant for challenging platformers (with puzzles), I gave it a shot. Afterall, it was only $10USD (no sale at the time). Was it worth it? Well, it definitely fit the bill in terms of challenging. It is definitely a beautiful looking game with a quirky feel (without being hipster-style nauseating). I would say its mechanics were better suited for the puzzle aspect v. the platformer. The controls are adequate, but need a bit of tweaking for near-end-game speed and reflex. In summary, if you're looking for a nice looking, long and hard (that's what she said) game, this is the one for you.			"

												This game is a rose: it's pretty to look at, comes in a variety of colors, and its thorny difficulty might throw you off guard if you're coming in expecting a walk in the park. But to me, the enjoyment gained from pid is not undone by its difficulty. The repulsor beam, cruel mistress though it may be, once mastered leads to a not imprecise puzzle platformer that requires skill and mind both. But that difficulty is subdued in it sharpness by the wonderful moments that the player meets throughout the story. My personal favorite moment came when, whilst traversing the maze level, a traditionally tedious experience in most games, soft saxophone music started playing as you neared the exit, turning an otherwise trying level into a moment of sudden zen where the tone aided the design of the level. The story itself weaves these pleasent moments into a charming tale of a marooned little boy forced to fix the bus schedule of an alien world. And it's this story, this subdued tone, and the enjoyable gameplay that for me make this game well worth experiencing if you have the time to savor them.			"

												An underappreciated gem of the platformer genre. In Pid you play as a young boy stranded on a planet trying to find his way home. This simplistic story manages to grow into something much bigger through the surprising twists you experience further into the game. The meat of the gameplay is in its puzzle solving. Your primary method of solving these puzzles is the gravity manipulating gem you acquire early on. With this item Kurt, the main character, can create beams that can drag or push you and/or your enemies. Pid increases the difficulty at a perfect pace while introducing more new and interesting items and concepts on the way, which makes it accesible to everyone. By the end of the game you will have amassed a large amount of items and a sense of flow that goes with mastering them. The boss battles are a great place to test you at what you've learned and provide a good challenge.This game is beautiful visually, the character design and art style is very charming. The soundtrack is incredible and is definitely worth checking out even if you have no interest in the game. A sample:

												A fantastic and very much underrated old school 2d platformer. It's chock full of unique mechanics that are all used in interesting ways, with a wide array of playfroming challenges that range from exploration, puzzle solving, straight up platforming and even stealth. It's a game that remains challenging, but rarely frustrating. The unique visuals and music also create an amazing atmosphere that intrigues the player. Overall, while I have some minor nitpicks with Pid, it's a fantastic game that I recommend to fans of the platforming genre.			"

												Pid looks like a cute, charming platformer that should be a relaxing way to unwind.  I mean, it's a little blue kid in his adorable backpack and hat.  He gets lost and just wants to get home.  He can toss a tiny white gem and light bursts forth, gently pushing him away.  It's harmless, like a marshmallow, right?WRONG.  This marshmallow is the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.  Sure, you'll have long sections of unhurried navigation through some of the levels. Then you'll hit that one room that requires absolutely precise timing.  Or you'll get chased in an auto-scrolling section.  You'll repeat it again and again and again and again.  You'll curse.  You'll reason.  You'll bargain.  Eventually, after many, many retries, you'll make it through.  Cue the soft jazz.This platformer isn't for everyone.  What did you think of Super Meatboy?  That will be a pretty good indication of whether or not you'll enjoy this one.  You do get a number of items you may use to navigate levels, but largely you can ignore them and stick to your native ability.  It's a cool mechanic, and it is put to good use.			"

												I enjoyed this game quite a lot. This game features a lot of difficulty and a lot of fun. The story is nice, unique music and amazing art style and I enjoyed every second of this game. As it is for most games, it's not perfect but it is worth playing it. Sadly, it requires you to complete the game first in order to play in hard difficulty; which is my only negative aspect about this game. However, playing in both normal difficulty and hard difficulty again was still worth my time.I've seen several comments saying how the controls are very challenging and hard to grasp but in my eyes, I think it's adaptable and playable. Additionally you can change your key bindings so I don't believe there is a big problem.			"

												This would be a great game if not some of the gameplay elements.Despite my long in-game time and overall fondness for hard games, I cannot call it well spent time - it was full of frustration and boredom, which kills great atmosphere, pretty good soundtrack and awesome idea behind this title. Respawn times and terrible checkpoint system made Might and Delight game painful for me.Sites like Indiegala sometimes gives away this game for free, or you might buy it for lowered price - maybe you'll enjoy this title more than me, what I wish for you.

												5.9/10 I guess I will have to give it a thumbs up because it a solid well built game with a fun story, solid chill music, really nice artwork and character design...But while I offer it a thumbs up I can't really recommend it if that makes sense. The game is pretty darn long and while your not hating the game while playing it, after the first sitting your probably going to find yourself just wanting to get to the end....Pid is just kinda boring...It's more of a platformer than a puzzle game. There are a few satisfying puzzles, but mostly you don't get that invested in overcoming the puzzles because they are just little stops between platforming. For me a big sign that a game isn't very compelling is if I am willing to cheat...I love puzzle platformers, and in games like Limbo and Inside I never considered cheating, but in Pid there where a few point where its like ""what am i supposed to do? ehh this game is dragging♥♥♥♥♥ let just looks this up and get to end already"" Did Limbo and Inside in 6ish hours but they didn't feel like short or long games cause pacing was great...Pid took 20 some hrs ugh.FOR A GAME THAT FOCUSES ON PLATFORMING THE CONTROLS ARE FLOATY AND MUSHY...thats my biggest gripe....I need to be able enter and exit beams in a consisten way and throw beams in a certain direction with some reliability.  Pro's-Unique Art style-Interesting universe and story -Good music at times...Very chill wich is unique for this type of game-Voice acting is cool and diolouge is goodCon's-Controls will make you throw things at times...especially thowing beams and trying to exit them with any precision-Combat is pretty meh-You just sort of want the game to end after not to long...I'm not sure why...maybe the story isn't that gripping...not that satisfying to advance the plot			"
