												Daedalic is no LucasArts, not being backed by some insanely popular moneymaking franchises that rhyme with Mar Bars or Diana Clones. But the LucasArts we knew isn’t coming back, so I suspect it’s a good try it if you’ve got a hankering for that style of gameplay (with a similar amount of difficulty).In contrast to its clear inspirations found in series such as Monkey Island, it suffers from production iffiness issues such as variable voice acting and animation quality (in the English version, there are some nasty translation-isms throughout, and multiple lines of that sort where they clearly stressed a word in a sentence that wasn’t the one that should have been stressed), as well as an indecisiveness as to what constitutes an appropriate style of fourth-wall breaking.Much to the game’s credit, however, the setting is a unique junkyard world and the protagonist Rufus (at least at the start) is more the sort of guy you might expect a point-and-click adventure game kleptomaniac vandal to be: a near-irredeemable jerk. Unfortunately, people are all too willing to point this out to his face, which sometimes works in the story’s favor and sometimes doesn’t. Moreover, there are a lot of artistic details in the world that you simply can’t click on and have Rufus snark about, which is something of a must to get a real feel for an adventure game world’s presence.One thing that is much nicer than typical old-school examples is that you don’t have to do the pixel-hunting if you don’t want to (hold space to see the interactive spots), and most of the time, you don’t have to watch a slow walk animation just to explore the map (double-click to fast forward through navigational arrows).Finally, the game is kind of crashy in a few spots (at least the Mac version is), so you may want to do some saving on top of the auto-saving. Some achievements are skippable, but at least one achievement guide in the Steam community is relatively spoiler free.For all its flaws, the game is usually about as funny as it thinks it is, so at least I can say I enjoyed it. Nonetheless, this game has some mature humor, so don’t get too fooled by the cutesy noseless art; it’s not really for kids.Droggeljug.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Deponia Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Charming; Funny My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-9 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWDeponia is a highly entertaining point-and-click misadventure with lovable characters, an interesting world, and wacky humor. If you like adventure games and goofy narratives, then look no further. It should be a pretty easy game to enjoy for most fans of the genre.The crazy characters and zany game-world combined with the pleasing art style and soundscape make Deponia charming and atmospheric. This alluring ambiance is definitely the backbone of the game.  And as everything else falls into place, the overall presentation of the game just exudes an aura of “enjoyability” that is hard to defy.Interestingly, the music and sound effects really play a much larger than usual role in the establishment of the ambiance. Relatedly, even the voice-acting in this game is not only well above the standard for the genre, but also objectively well performed. The end result shows how these elements can really help elevate the overall presentation of a game when they’re handled with care.As far as gameplay goes: it is pretty standard for the genre. The puzzles are decently challenging and mostly fair; although some of the solutions don’t really make sense in terms of real-world thinking. You must remember to think in terms of the wacky logic of the game-world when solving puzzles. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating because it is hard to think like that. I suppose that if you get truly flabbergasted, you could always check a guide. Regardless of how you make it past the confusing parts, the rest of the presentation of the game is well worth experiencing.So if you are a fan of point-and-click games, Deponia should be a good bet for you.  You definitely should beware of the outside-the-box (inside-the-game) logic, but in my opinion, it is one of the features of the game that makes it unique and worth playing. Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

 A point-to-click adventure game in 2D environment with comic style characters that utilizes ridiculously humourous dialogues; which is why its so fun to play!! Its all about a bold, stubborn and egocentric boy called Rufus who listens to no one but his own thoughts. The only thing he wants is to leave Deponia- planet of junkyard and to go to Elysium which is a floating city above the planet that holds all the beauty and wealth.Everyone, including his close friends tell him he is a maniac and can never succeed in his stupid plans of leaving deponia. But as the attractive lady called Goal from higher sector falls into the trash heaps of deponia and she needs to go back; Rufus assumes that helping her and taking her back to her fiancé would be his only salvation.  Some characters are weird, some are cranky and grumpy but all are really full of amusement. Most of the ideas that Rufus gets to escape from junkyard is by talking to different kind of people that show less politeness and more of a sarcasm. Most of the dialogues are often packed with lot of humor which will make you laugh out loud. The voice acting is top notch which is why i found the game really amusing and didn't stop playing.The puzzles in the game were quite difficult(especially for me). Rufus has to collect weird stuff in his inventory; combining some of them together to make them work and to proceed his mission of leaving deponia. Finding the right tools and items was a difficult task. Backgrounds are colourful that even the whole junk and heaps of trashs seems to hold beauty in them.In the end i want to say i loved this game a lot. It has unusual love story. I recommend this game, even to those who are not fan of such games. But you should try something different, as different is sometimes cool!			"

												Let me start off by saying that I am new to point-and-click games. I bought the Deponia trilogy when it went on sale for $14  on greenmangaming. Worth? I think so. I really liked the story because it has it's funny moments. But I suppose because I am new to this genre, I would often find myself stuck and wondering what do next. If it wasn't for online walkthroughs I would never have completed this game. But after completing it with much help, I'm glad I picked it up. It was fun, memorable, and something that I am not used to playing. I suppose trying something new was what made this game refreshing for me.  I would recommend it for that reason alone. Buy if on sale.			"

												9/10 - One of the Best Point and Click Adventure Series!I waited so long to play this game and I regret that! It's one of the best point and click adventures I've played in a while; so good that I'm sure I will complete the remaining 3 games in the series. The story is fun and entertaining and the puzzles, objectives, voiced actors and graphics really put this game at the top.The story takes place on the world of Deponia; a futuristic world that has turned into a floating garbage dump. You are tasked with helping Rufus get the girl, save the world and get off that dump Deponia! Never EVER pay $20 for this game! If I didn't know any better I would have said it's worth the price... because it is! However, this game is on sale for 90% off literally 8 months out of the year. You can grab the whole bundle for about $4!Although worth full price for sure! The bundle is on sale for 90% all the time! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

 ""Everything you do will end in chaos."" Deponia is a point & click adventure and the first of a three-part series developed by the company Daedalic Entertainment with emphasis on character and story development. Atmosphere & presentation: + Original ideas and well-animated comic look create an interesting world.+ Creative puzzle sections with interesting solutions throughout the game.o Solid musical background.   o Complex puzzles can be skipped. - The sometimes illogical item combinations can lead to a break in immersion. Characters & story: + Surprising and refreshing depiction of side characters.+ Witty dialogues and unconventional conversation options.+ Coherent and fluid story telling.+ High quality voice acting.o Characterization of the protagonist can be polarizing at certain points.o Based on the German origin of the game, some of the jokes are lost in translation.- The partially sexist jokes of the protagonist could be considered inappropriate for the younger audience. Summary: The debut of Daedalic Entertainment represents a good start of the trilogy offering a multitude of original ideas, which make Deponia well worth playing.

												Judging superficially, I should love this game. The art design is good, the sound design and voice acting is fine. Overall it's competently implemented and predictable from the perspective of a mid-age mouse-centric adventure, like say Monkey Island 3. But there are a couple of problems.The easy one is the mechanics. I've been spoiled by more recent adventures like Broken Age that provide sensible shortcuts for getting around, such as running or warping across screens. None of those are present here, which means watching the protagonist Rufus amble infuriatingly slowly across the map. And you'll be doing a lot of that, because the puzzles are often of the logic-free, ""lateral-thinking"", try-everything-with-everything-else variety that have thankfully become less fashionable these days. The walking in particular annoyed me more than other older games I've been playing such as Broken Sword. How did they manage to be worse than adventure games from almost twenty years ago? Not sure. In any case, dealing with these irritations to push through the game would be easier if it weren't for the second problem, which is the writing.It tries so hard! But the jokes are either flat or just mean. I recognize the jokes, I just don't really feel like laughing at them. None of the characters are really likeable, the protagonist least of all, so I don't at all feel invested in seeing the story through. As a result, I've done my few hours of play and have given up.Sorry, Deponia. Close, but not good enough. Perhaps the later games are better, but I'm not willing to play through this one to find out.			"

												I really, really want to like this game. I really, really do. The art is pretty, and I usually love point-and-click adventure games with comedic bends, but Deponia just falls flat. Some of the jokes are pretty funny, but Rufus falls on the wrong side of the line between ""charming/witty/loveable jerk"" and just plain ""jerk"" more often than not. It's really difficult for me to enjoy playing a game when the main character grates on me so badly.			"

												One of my favorite adventure games from the last few years due to its fairly quirky nature and its original characters. It also has a very beautiful and charming art style and great music and voice acting to go along with it. The humor is great...most of the time, and the puzzles make sense most of the time but every now and again it goes full on Monkey Island-logic, and you need to think way outside the box to progress.The game has a lot of missable achievements so would recommend having either a guide handy or use saves very frequently to avoid more playthroughs then necessary. It also has an achievement for beating the game in its alternate mode that you unlock by beating the game: Droggeljug mode. This will replace all written and voiced dialog with the word Droggeljug along with all the info boxes. While funny for the first few minutes it gets really annoying, and you want to uppercut a kitten.Time to 100%: 6-8 hours			"

												Germany. Elegant cars, cold winter, awesome beer. Ok, I'm definitely relying too much on stereotypes, but from now on we could surely add ""very nice point and click adventure games"" to that list. Interesting enough, german developers released a lot of good adventure games in the last few years, becoming probably the main contributor to this little ""renaissance"" of the point and click genre. And Deponia is one the best examples.Someone described Daedalic as ""the European Lucasarts"" and I'm not entirely sure I can agree to that, but their games are solid. Very good story, challenging puzzles, polished graphics, everything is surely above average, Deponia is definitely a nice game. Characters are crazy enough to make you often laugh, A LOT of location to explore, non linear puzzle solving, and Daedalic recently added new languages, which is always kind. As a first chapter of a trilogy Deponia works just fine, the player is always pushed to play more to see how the plot will evolve. I got stuck two or three times, which is great in my opinion, 'cause it means they focused a lot on the intellectual challenge of the game and not only on the narrative side. Definitely worth a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

												Highly recommended for those who are achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s. You can get every single one of them through the game, just remind yourself to check the game's guide to make sure how to get some secret ones.If you like point-and-click game, be sure to play Deponia, you won't be disappointed. Since I normally don't get the feeling of 'adventure' from some point-and-click games other than 'boring'; I did get it from Deponia. The art, the voice acting and the animation are fascinated, making the game more enjoyable. I didn't skip the cut scenes even once. The story and the characters are well designed. I enjoyed the story so much that I played them right away after I bought the game, non-stop through the end. The main character is a complete jerk, but also an opposite somehow, and that's why he's the most interesting one. There are also mini games which are fun to solve. And how you can combine items you find through the story is freakin' cool. Of how cool it is, I just can't spoil you unless you play it yourself.Plus, you will be surprised how Deponia, the planet covered in trashes, can create such an environment you'll grow to love.			"

HUZZAH, THE CHORUS GUYS RULE!Short Verdict: Must-have for point-and-click fans. Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!Overview: Deponia is the first game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium, following his dad's footsteps. The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even some romance.Pros: The interface is really great and easy to navigate The story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the way Good length for an adventure game The puzzles are really nice and sober--the game provides you not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world and they've really hit the perfect mark in this aspect. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. You probably won't need a guide, if you can deal with just the right amount of frustration that pushes you forward. Characters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some ""role play"", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles. Great voice acting The 2D graphics are really amazing The BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songs The cliffhanger for the next game is just perfect--it closes a chapter really well, but you'll want to know what happens nextCons: The game crashed a few times for me (probably 2 or 3), mostly after videos. But it was so rare, it didn't annoy me much, especially because the autosave prevented me from losing progress. Some people report that a few of the achievements didn't unlock for them, but I didn't have any problem with them (maybe it was fixed after a recent update, idk), except for the Droggeljug one (I did use the shortcut, though, and it eventually unlocked) Speaking of which, Droggeljug is probably one of the worst ideas I've seen in a game. All sentences, characters' names, item's names and literally every text in the game is replaced with ""Droggeljug"", from start to finish. But it's just a bonus mode you unlock after beating the game, so not a big deal. Still, it's so stupid I had to mention it.Bought on: Scorched Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$ 0.27. This amount is ridiculously low for such an awesome game. The full Steam price is not exactly a steal, but I think it's fair. If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buy The Complete Journey (the full trilogy) instead.Verdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check Deponia! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it!			"

Droggeljug! This game is absolutely fantastic. Deponia is a point-and-click comedy adventure game about a poor guy named Rufus and his desperate attempts of leaving Deponia and its trash heap. PROs✓ Charming graphics✓ Ridiculously endearing characters✓ Funny dialogues✓ Awesome soundtrack and voice acting✓ Entertaining plot✓ Challenging puzzles✓ Extremely fun to playCONs✗ Buggy mines sectionGameplayThe gameplay is simple, you play as Rufus, you explore the areas then pickup and combine things to get yourself out of scenario puzzles. The puzzle difficulties can range from easy to extremely diffcult depending on how logical and creative you think. Characters and PlotI like how Rufus is presented as a whiny idiot with high levels of self-importance and yet comes off likeable. Actually, most of the characters on the game are likeable as they are unique. Denzel, Goal, the secretary guy and even the miners lining up are all weird and funny. Same goes with the story, it's weird and funny. Everything's well thought out and the execution is great.SoundtrackI love the homeless guitarist who sang the intros and the ending theme. The soundtrack and voice acting are just awesome in this. It's amusing and refreshing. Huzzah.OverallDeponia just made it to my all-time favorites list. Can't think of anything negative to say about this game (i'm cringing at how much adjectives im using in this review. ugh). Seriously. Eventhough i listed the buggy section in the cons above, it's not actually an issue since the developers have provided a work around for it. So yep, this is such a great game. I mean, the gameplay is simple, the story isn't mindblowing but the experience is definitely something. This game is unique and hilarious. 11/10. Highly recommended!			"

												The ""point-and-click-adventure"" aspects are done pretty well although some puzzles come down to plain guess work and in a game of this type there should always be some clues - even if you have to dig deep for them.  Overall, that section of the game is more good than bad.  The rest of the game is in its dialogue and ""humor.""  This is all just opinion but I found the game and its main character to be crass, vulgar, lewd, rude, offensive, egotistical and just all-around someone I would not want to know.  Since the game relies on its humor as a form of charm - and I must posit that the developers misread the definition of charm - I must give the game a bad review.  Being stuck in the shoes of Rufus for several hours was an unpleasant experience at best.  The Droggeljug mode that you unlock via game completion is just mind-jarringly awful - every line of dialogue is replaced by, ""droggeljug"".  I'm a bit of a curmudgeon though so at the same time, if you like this type of game, give it a shot - perhaps you will like the humor more than I.			"

												I should like this game. I’m always on board for ye old point-and-click adventure, and Deponia knows it predecessors.  It forgets, however, that their fan base is now living the year 2014.  You know, where annoying manboy protagonists are not at all endearing.  Manboy Rufus is bad enough without his town of whiners. Every character you speak with has to either insult Rufus or recall some stupid thing he’s done in the past. Everyone.  I put two hours in before I found a kernel of a plot that didn’t involve someone proclaiming Rufus as a failure or the ginger-haired damsel in distress that fell from the sky. Her name is Goal, by the way, and, she’s spent most of my playthrough unconscious. Rufus claims that Goal belongs to him and that he will save her. The only other female character is Rufus’ roommate/ex-girlfriend, who’s your typical, annoying girlfriend that never stops complaining.The puzzles are solid, I’ll give it that.  I found a few head scratchers.  I even laughed a couple of times. But, after a few hours of the game, I couldn’t deal with Rufus and his friends.  The story seemed to be circling the disappearance of Rufus’ father, the former mayor that abandoned him years ago. I wanted more of that and less of Rufus’ attempts to woo the woman in the tight jumpsuit.			"

												A well-made point & click game reminiscent of the old-time Monkey Island series. Loads of humour and quirky solutions to get ahead in the story. This would be my only complaint: sometimes the solutions are so outlandish that you either have to stumble upon them accidentally or follow a guide to help you when you are stuck, which to me takes away from the immersion and enjoyment of the game.

												A hidden gem of a game. A well designed and written point-and-click puzzle adventure game with a charm to it. Though I admit it has a few strange things that might get you stuck like it has done to me a few times (Eg. having a very small object to find only by clicking on everything and making sure your cursor covers every pixel of your screen). But yeah I still think the game is great but you should consider buying ""Deponia: The Complete Journey"" rather than just this one game  because there are 3 parts split into each game (so 3 games) and its a lot cheaper to get the complete game.

Short Review: Deponia is a fun Point-and-Click adventure that excells at everything it aims at. As most of these games are 100% about the story, you certainly wont be disapointed with this one as its one of it's strongest features. Long story-short: It's a must for any fan of the genre and a good choice if you're just looking for something different overall.PROS: Excellent Cartoon-ish, almost Penny Arcade style of Graphics. Every background and character is so rich in colors and every screen was amazingly crafted. Top notch voice acting. They really put time and effort into this one, Great mix of both Dry and Dark humour. There's plenty of scenes that will just make you laugh out loud. Simple interface and overall user-friendly game mechanics. It doesn't punish you if you happen to be completely new to the genre. Difficulty it's just on the spot. What most of these Point-and-click graphic adventures fail at is the crazy amount of times it just leaves the player blocked at a certain puzzle or scene, which just unables him of advancing the story. I found myself completing Deponia without hitting many roadblocks. There's always a tip or two hidden in the description and the game gives you the option of just Skiping the Hard Puzzles and advancing. Even though this is a trilogy, there's still a few good hours worth of game here, which is always good. The Soundtrack is catchy, specially the Bard cutscenes. ""HUZZAH, the chorus guy rule!""CONS: Sometimes the subtitle apeared in German, instead of English. The voice was still in English. On the Mine Cart level, the game oftenly exited to Windows right after the cut-scene. On the other hand, I'd always find an autosave right before it, so at least there's that. Minor crashes, probably got 3 or 4 on total. Again, the autosave really comes in handy here. There were a couple of Items that were totally useless and were probably thrown there to confuse you. This isn't really a con since it's a staple of the genre but Newbies may find this irritating.VERDICT: As you probably know by know I just loved Deponia as I find myself enjoying all this crazy Junk world and the completely obnoxious character of Rufus. I strongly recommend you buy the Complete Journey pack which includes all three games. If you only get the first and you enjoy it as much as I did, chances are, you'll end up buying the other two on singles and that will really cost you.			"

												I bought Deponia during a Steam Sale because it looked like a cute game and I haven't played a point-and-click styled game since I was a kid.  Boy, I was in for it when I started playing Deponia.This game is really tricky.  ""Tricky"" meaning that it's difficult to know exactly what to do all the time.  Some tasks are easy to figure out while others are extremely random.  Often, I was stuck wondering how anyone could have figured out what to do without exhausting every possible option beforehand.  However, I liked this aspect of the game because if it was too easy, you would be able to finish it pretty quickly.  If you are an achievement hunter, this game is pretty easy to 100% with some help from gamesaves and/or backtracking.Another thing I liked about this game was the art.  I really liked the different areas and animations of the game.  I enjoyed discovering new areas and going into all the rooms, ect.The story line was alright, I was curious enough to keep playing it but not curious enough to purchase the sequel.  What really killed this game was the characters.  Although Rufus changed a bit towards the end, his personality in the beginning really put me off.  I almost found the game unplayable with his ever constant nagging about literally everything, and the way he talked about and viewed women.  There were likable characters in the game, but Rufus took a dump on all of them and made some pretty mean jokes.  Maybe his character in the sequel improves and this is all just about his ~*~character development~*~, but I wouldn't purchase the sequel at full price after listening to him for one game.			"

												This is the first game of a trilogy. It tries to mimic the Monkey Island and Guybrush fell, even though it never hits that sweet spot. Interesting game even though sometimes dialogs are a chore. I found this one to be the least likable in the whole trilogy (a good game 7/10) but I think it is worth as the complete trilogy is really nice and fun. Buy it if you plan to play the whole trilogy.			"

												A Review of the Deponia Trilogy as a whole:More info on BrokenCartridge:  http://www.brokencartridge.net/deponia-trlogy-a-retrospective/ Score: 4.5/5I will not be covering the story in complete detail because there is a lot you should experience on your own while playing through the game. The story in a brief few sentences is that you play as Rufus, an egocentric self-centered slob whose only goal is to leave his trash heap of a planet to go to the city in the sky.  The world that he lives on is called Deponia, a planet littered with trash. All of the rich folk moved up into the city in the sky, Elysium some time ago. During one of your endeavors you knock an Elysium girl off of an Organon cruiser. Throughout the first game you try to use her to find your way onto Elysium, only to end up finding out that the Elysians plan on blowing up Deponia! The second and third games are mainly spent trying to stop the Organon from doing this devilish deed while figuring out their motives along the way.The story is a very big part of the game, which is why I only covered the basics. The series itself does not like to stray too far off of what is expected from a point-and-click game. As great as that is, if you are looking for an innovation in the genre, you might not find that here. Here, you will find a wacky and hilarious adventure that is dependent on the silly world and narrative. If you already enjoy point-and-clicks, you are in for an incredible treat. Besides the awesome narrative and dialogue, we have a lot of things that set the Deponia trilogy above the rest. The game universe in general is surreal and charming; nothing really comes close to its style in my opinion. You will be surprised how much a planet covered in trash can mesmerize you with its environments.The trilogy gets better as it goes on. While the first game is great, everything just seems to improve with each one. The story makes unexpected yet oh so juicy turns and twists, increased amounts of detailed environments, an increasing diverse cast, and becomes one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time. The amount of information to tie up the trilogy in the third game alone will leave you with your jaw dropped to the floor. Then include that the second and third both have their own unique mechanics that make them much more puzzling, but so much cooler. One of the best things is seeing Rufus evolve as a character. It is incredibly rewarding to see everything come together.My only sense of bitterness goes towards the ending. Before I go more into it, I am not saying the ending is bad. If anything it is awesome and leaves a lot for you to speculate and imagine. However, in this particular story, it wasn’t what I was hoping for.  There is so much I wanted to see and experience that was sort of thrown up into the air and left for you to speculate. It is not fair to spoil it, so I won’t. It just left me eager to know more, yet knowing the sad information that this is intended to only be a trilogy. Of course the possibility of a fourth game is always possible, but it isn’t intended. With that being said, I am personally dissatisfied with the ending. Not for the ending itself, but for the thing it did not answer. Good thing Daedalic (the developers) have made many more amazing games to sink my teeth into while getting over it.That is all you need to know about Deponia before poking your head in. This is a must own for any people interested in adventure games. Daedlic is truly becoming today’s Lucas Arts, and now is a better time than ever to find out why by trying out this trilogy.			"

												I wanted to like Deponia – I really did, there's lots of great stuff here, but it all falls flat. To me there are four things that make a great adventure game: A good story, clever puzzles, interesting characters, and an interesting world for those characters to inhabit.  Deponia gets one of those four right. The world of Deponia is interesting. This great junk planet is not only a bit unique, but it is also beautifully rendered. A junk planet full of scrappy, adaptable people should be a great setting for an adventure game, right? Well...right. But that game is not Deponia. Lets take a look at those other three categories...Story. Can't have a good adventure game without a good story. Unfortunately for Deponia, it didn't ship with a great story. While it starts off well enough, the plot becomes a bit predictable and uninteresting. Some reviewers have even complained about an undercurrent of misogyny in the game. My take? I can certainly see what those reviewers are talking about, but I'm not going to go into that here. Lets just say that there are few women in the game. Of those women: one gets naked, one is unconcious for 90% of the game, and the other is a man. And the unconcious one? Getting her and winning her over is the goal of the game. Her name? Goal. Clever.Puzzles. Some are good, but most fall into the ""meh"" or unintuitive category. Puzzles don't have to be unintuitive to be wacky or challenging. It's a cheat, and a poor one at that. Characters...well...they're forgettable. That's not the worst crime though. The worst crime is that the main character - the one you should be made to empathize with (or at least get a good laugh out of) is actually irratating and unlikeable. Rufus, who is supposed to be a likeable slacker with a sharp wit and an inflated ego often comes off as posessing a grating personality with few likeable qualities. The puns? Bad...in a bad way. A few might be amusing, but the rest are either cringeworthy or fall flat.My recommendation: Skip it or wait to pick it up in a bundle on the cheap - and only if you're desperate.			"

												deponia is a great game with stellar characters . rufusRufus is the protagonist of deponia, he's a amazing character  and a big part of what makes this game so stellar.rufus is a idiot and he is  always cooking up some hair brained scheme to get out of deponia and get in to elysium.He plays off ever charter well or vise versa, he also cleverly responds to every item you pick up.game playThe game play is your standard find this object rub it on other object fare, sometimes the puzzles can be smart other times they are just plain dumb, but you can always use the guide or press space to reveal all the items if you are having trouble. artthe art in this game is amazing the backgrounds are vibrant and detailed and tend to focus on 2 or 3 colors thought this varies fro each one.The charter designs make good use of thick outlines and have a really unique art style.voice actingall the voice actors did a realy good job and expressed lots of personalty that really fit with the charters i personally like rufus's VAlevel  sturturethe frist half of the game put you in a big open world and the second half focused on 2 smaller levels. While to 2 smaller levels where better in the sense that they where more straight forward a downside of this second half is that it had less pepople to talk with i would highly recomend you get this game and the others as this game ends on kind off a cliff hanger			"

												This entertaining point and click adventure presents some difficult puzzles that require some elaborate thinking and therefore completing them releases a sense of satisfaction into ones mind. It takes place in a rather interesting universe that is somewhat different than the normal catch in most games nowadays. It also presents a beautiful story and a set of characters that I felt - somewhat - attached to. Huzzah-huzzah onwards to the sequel we march!

												Deponia has you play as egocentric, lovable rogue Rufus as he tries to get off of Deponia and reach the elite heights of Elysium.Deponia is really fun, engaging puzzle adventure game, point and clicky type stuff. It took me 17 hours for full completion of the game, I missed 2 optional achievements which would've taken about 2 minutes at the time so 17 hours is a good bet on time.Full disclosure: I did not use any guides or cheats or tips to assist me. There was one part I was forced to look up as it was a potential bug (crane, no spoiler) and I inadvertantly saw the solution (literally 1 click, not a puzzle). Most of my played time in the game was me sitting there saying ""wtf do I do next, dear God"".That said, the game was fun. The voice acting was mostly okay. The Organon are horribly voiced, as was the Captain of the ship, but otherwise everything was great.If you like point and click adventures, and have patience, check out this awesome game!Nilesy			"

												Deponia is an adventure game that's a bit difficult to describe.  It has great art, decent writing, some very creative characters, and a pretty interesting story.  The writing and voice acting definitely isn't the best I've seen, but it gets the job done.  The game has a very clean interface, letting you access your inventory with the mouse wheel and providing interact and inspect functions on different mouse buttons.  It's also significantly longer than most adventure games I've played as my playthrough clocked in at around 10 hours.The one off-putting thing about the game is that you play as an idiot who frequently causes havok around town and everybody hates.  It's a really odd position to be in though the character is quite interesting and is responsible for most of the humor in the game.The puzzles can get overwhelming at points with tons of items piling up in your inventory with little clue about how to use them though the game keeps it mostly reasonable.I did run into a very frequent bug where the dialog options window was misaligned, sometimes dropping options off the bottom of the screen, but it never impeded the game.  There were also one or two occasions where certain subtitles were displayed in German.Deponia is definitely a good game and stands by itself, though it is designed as a trilogy and buying all three games can be a bit of an investment for adventure games.  If you want good adventure games though, it's probably worth the price.			"

												A cartoon looking point and click adventure game that allows you to take control of Rufus, a dimwit jerk who uses everyone around him without care. The story starts off slow and begins to pick up a little bit as you reach the middle of the game, but I still found it lacking even 5 hours in. You play as Rufus, a selfish and slightly empty minded tinkerer who wishes only to leave the junkyard he calls home. Well, the planet he lives on is a junkyard.Did you know if you double click a location you don't have to walk to it? I didn't, you should probably do the tutorial.I found the characters hard to like and the protagonist even harder to enjoy. He acts like a childish pig and makes for really cringe dialogue when talking to his ex girlfriend. I also found that there was too much highlight on the protagonist, making you fall out of the story every time he opens his mouth.The puzzles follow little logic, often being very hard to follow and require the use of a walkthrough if you don't want to go insane. I've found many other reviews complain about this problem too, and it really put me off. I found trying to finish this game was a chore.It does have neat steampunk graphics that are fun to look at, and silly humour that will give you a little giggle here and there. The music is also pretty decent for an indie game.Save often, as this game bugs out every so often ending you not being to move or just plain out interact with items.I got it on sale, and I would recommend avoiding the full price as the game is too short (around 8-10 hours for first playthrough) and has little replayability.Personal Rating: 2/5			"

												Writing this after beating the game in offline mode.I found the aesthetics and mechanics of the game to be pretty good. The art and animations are nice, the setting is pretty interesting and the voice acting is decent.The puzzles can get on the cryptic side, but I was able to get through all but one of them without looking at a hint. Somebody that is new to, or doesn't really like point-and-click games might have some trouble with them though.Now for the reasons I don't recommend the game.First of all, the protagonist is pretty unlikeable. At first his behavior seems like it's being played up for laughs, or that it's a set up for future character development. Eventually you'll realize that nope, He's just a terrible person, and it's not funny. This is a big problem when often the protagonist is the driving force behind the player getting past puzzles and finishing the game. Maybe this will change in the sequels.Secondly, this game is pretty unpleasant throughout. There is a lot of sexism, mean-spirited jokes and uncomfortable implications throughout the game, all seemingly in an effort to make the player laugh. Some people might think I'm being oversensitive about this, but I'm absolutely not. It is there and it is blatant. The fact that none of these jokes are even clever or funny makes it that much worse.Despite the game being decent art/mechanics wise, I really can't recommend this.tl;dr "

I never tried a point and click game before, so this was my first and hoped for the best.  Thank God I did, coz I enjoyed playing the game.  The humor, character voices, unique setting, puzzle games galore and the story telling won me over.  This game made me want to buy more games with this type of gameplay (pont and click).  I can't wait to play the next chapter of this comedy of errors love story between a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag (Rufus the Dufus) and a girl with brain implants.  Try this game you will enjoy it.			"

												Honestly I don't know how I feel about this game. The art style is great but the storyline is lacking, and I just can't stand the main character. I can only play for fifteen minutes at a time before I start to feel like I'm going to punch something. His personality is grating and falls short of witty with few positives to compensate.As far as gameplay goes, it's fairly good. If you enjoy point and click games then you'll enjoy this one, I guess. There's an undercurrent of misogyny throughout the game, not too big of an issue but it is bothersome at times. The three girls in the entire game consist of an unconcious love interest who's name is Goal (yes, really), a drag queen used for purely comedic effect, and the ex girlfriend, a '♥♥♥♥♥' and several other lovely names who appears nude for no actual reason. The puzzles aren't too difficult, and while some can be too easy they give you something to do other than wait for your character to walk across screen at the same, slow, unchangeable pace playing fetch. I bought this game when it was on sale for maybe a dollar or so, and I think it's about worth that. Maximum, $5. Seriously beautiful artwork though. Well done on that front.If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group! "

Along with cleverly writen diolouge and an amazing story line, all I can say is: buy this game! It is worth it.			"

												ehhh... mechanically, it's a gorgeously-artistic, excellent point-and-click. with a few flaws.  some of the puzzles are a bit more obscured than it feels they should be, and these tend to crop up when there are dozens of possibilities.  you spend a LOT of time wandering aimlessly when you encounter this.writing is amusing.  the egomaniac protagonist gives lots of opportunities for humor, and it's lol-worthy surprisingly often.  that said, I couldn't get past the continuous, degrading treatment of every female in the game.  Goal is brainless so she's ogled and manipulated.  old girlfriend is a tropey pain, so she's drugged and manipulated.  they're both targets of many female-only insults through the entire game (there are basically no male equivalents anywhere).YES, this is almost totally at the hands of a known-egomaniac-jerk (this is the defense in many reviews I've seen), but *that jerk is the protagonist* and you as a player are forced to act these out.  it even portrays this behavior as the norm, not as an obvious character flaw of Rufus's.add to that the OVERWHELMINGLY male cast (~ 10x more, nearly all with names and significant roles), and that many of the men are basically good people who are not given any personally-degrading treatment, and I really don't see how else you can interpret this side of things.tl;dr: it's very pretty, well constructed, but good god does it have heavy-handed sexist overtones.  and it sounds like the sequel(s?) are the same or worse.  can we get some women writers at Daedalic?  or playtesters?  the rest of the talent there shouldn't be wasted like this.

												Awesome point and click adventure! One of my favorite adventures of all time - and I've played Quest for Glory, Kings Quest (and all others ""Quest"") and Monkey's Island A LOT. This game is full of win only by being together on this list with such glorious games from the past.It's good enough to remind me a lot of good games from Sierra and Lucasarts - which I have great respect and a forever earned place on my game shelf as they made my childhood gaming -, while remains original and fresh at the same time. Not by case, Daedalic used to be called ""Lucasarts from Germany"". You do not earn a ""title"" like this by not being awesome, folks.The graphics are astonishing for an adventure that simple. The story is rich and lovely, part of a 3 chapters arc - Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia (buy all the series at once if you can and enjoy the full experience). The gameplay has nothing new, LMB, RMB will be your bread and butter. The scroll wheel is your utility knife to open and close the inventory.The puzzles are amazingly made, fun to complete. Some of them will make you think hard.At last, no definetely not the least, the humour... ah, the humour! The cherry and cream of the top at the same time. You'll be caught so many times laughing so hard. The characters are finely developed, the voiceover fulfils its role (you may want to try it on German aswell, the original language, while using subs). Hard to tell some of those genial jokes without spoiling the details. There are two specific funny as hell scenes that I love: one of them involves cats and the other one a post delivery robot and its predilection for bubble wrap.It's getting harder and harder put the hands on titles like this, focused on a new and captivating story, with a fine sense of humour. This game, trust me, definitely worths its full price, but if you see this marvelous piece of art with a discount, so, man, what you waiting for?? Grab it! Grab multiple copies and install on all yours PCs, give it to your mom, give it to your GF, ex-GF, ex-wives, spread and sow the seeds of love and awesomeness to all yours friends!			"

												NOTE: This is the same review for the other two games in the original Deponia trillogy aswell. I thought that as they are a continuation of the same story that they should stay together. What the game isThe Depnonia trillogy is a classic point and click game on a wold filled with garbage. In the trillogy, you assist the, at first forgettable/dislikeable, protagonist Rufus try to reach the floating paradise of Elysium. Over time, the originally forgettable Rufus uses his witty dialog to slowly get you on his side rooting for him on his quest.Pros+Amazing storyThe story, although only really played out during cut scenes to new areas, is deep in detail. It pulls you in, really pulling you into the world.+FunnyNot many games have blaitently funny dialog, but these games definatly do. Rufus has funny responses to other characters, his own acvtions, and stuff you try to have him do.+CharactersAll the characters seem fleshed out quite well. Each has a uniques personallity, displayes different emotions, and just act different. The variety is also pretty good.+EnviromentsMost enviroments are well detailed with other people and objects to bring the scene alive. In some cases, youll get people who are from other games showing up in the envirments aswell.+MusicThe music worked well with each area you would be exploring. Although mostly being simmilar themed, it all was different and interesting. Cons-Animations/MovementThe walking animation on Rufus, for me was a bit weird. He didnt really face where he was going and took odd paths to where he needed to go.-DurationSome areas seemed too short, while others were too long. It was an odd thing and may have just been the way I solved the puzzles in each area, but it struck me as odd how I could clear one area in ~30 min and another in 2+ hours.Final OpinionThe Deponia trillogy is an amazing set of games that brought back tthe nastolga of point and the point and click style. The quirky dialog was fun to hear and laugh at resonces. The story makes the narcissistic Rufus someone whos actions have you rooting or cying for the duration of his adventure. If you have some time free I can highly reccomend all the games in the Deponia trillogy and Deponia Doomsday.			"

												[May contain spoilers. Read with caution.]I don't think I have words to describe this game.I don't think I am even capable of remotely justifying how much I loved every second of my Deponia playthrough.This is the kind of game I had been needing for a long time. Not because of its genre. Because of its charm. Its passion and attention to detail. Its... OK, you get the point.You play as Rufus, a despicable inhabitant of the massive wasteland that is Deponia, and a damn cool character all around. No matter how many messes he has and is still getting into, you will definitely take his side in every confront of the game - because, well, it's him who you're rooting for since the beginning! This, blended with the game's very lively sense of humour and the intelligent puzzles that come along the way, make for an outstanding experience in Rufus' egotistical point of view.It's difficult not to love Goal. She is adorable even while in her unfortunate damaged status, and becomes even more lovable after waking up and realising what is going on. On a more personal side, perhaps I may have connected her far too much to someone I love - but let's not get that in the way, shall we? At least for now.Overall, this... game? Wait, scratch that. To classify Deponia as a simple ""game"" is to insult this masterpiece of humour, storytelling and cringe-inducing moments.So, if you're not even remotely interested in getting it for you and giving it a go, I'd recommend checking your brain activity and blood pressure. I'm serious.Damn Cletus.			"

												I got this game for 99 cents. For that price, I would definitely recommend it. At a much higher price, I wouldn't. But I don't want to base my recommendation on price, and since I wouldn't play the sequels even for free, I'm gonna go with ""not recommended"".If you like humorous 2D point-and-click adventures, Deponia might be for you. It combines a fresh setting with ""industry""-standard storytelling and mechanics. I liked the artwork a lot and the protagonist, Rufus, is quite enjoyable.There are a lot of things I didn't like, however. First off, it aims for the classics, but the writing is not remotely as good (with a some exceptions). A few times the humour is so forced that I couldn't help but feel remote shame, as in ""did they really think anyone would find this funny?""Most of the quests and puzzles are straight-forward. But some of the puzzles are just aggravating. We've all been there, trying anything with everything in the inventory, to no avail. Or clicking different levers to see the desired effect. But some stuff in Deponia is just completely non-sensical and drove me mad. I admit I had to look into a walkthrough a few times, and mentally flipped the finger towards the developers a few times once I'd found out how something was supposed to work.From a technical perspective, there are 2 things I found wildly inappropriate for a 2012 title, especially if it's published at (almost) full price: #1, the animations. You will see a lot of generic ""empty hand movements"" when you do stuff with things. I found this particularly disappointing given how much love went into the artwork otherwise. #2, lots of interactions will just yield the same line over and over again. For instance, when you are trying one specific item in your inventory with every other item, you'll hear the same crappy joke over and over again. Very tiring.Overall, I would say Deponia shows lots of promise, but some aspects are just disappointing and frustrating.			"

												I'm a big fan of point-and-click games, but this one fell short for me. The puzzles and adventures were discouragingly random-- for instance you finally find clean drinking water but Rufus doesn't want anything to do with *that* water, and you have to find completely new water? It's just complicated for the sake of being complicated, instead of being challengingly fun.The storyline was all right, but the characters were pretty insufferable. I'm all for having a protagonist that we love to hate, but there wasn't really anything truly clever in Rufus' constant snark--it was more ""emo goth kid"" than ""Louis CK."" The dialogues were pointlessly long, and I wish they didn't automatically re-activate the entire exchange when you click on people and things again. Can I just hover over an inventory item to see a description instead of hearing three sentences about it over and over? I wish the ending was a little more fulfilling, since I'm not sure I'll go on to the sequels.Definitely prefered Memoria by the same studios.			"

												Ah Deponia. It's one game every adventure game enthusiast should have in his or her library. It's goofy, quirky, and annoyingly clever with its puzzles, gameplay, and plot. Your main hero, Rufus, is a character you love to hate with his dimwitted yet sometimes strangely ingenious ideas as well as his egotistical personality. Storywise, this game gives an excellent job  creating the setting and world of Deponia.It has memorable characters with excellent voice acting. Not to mention the gameplay is quite fun and makes you scratch your head a few times, questioning your sanity. (Postal cats, really?)Anyway, it's a great game part of a now FOUR game series. So I'd better get started and... DROGGELJUG.			"

OVERVIEWDeponia is a 'soft' science fiction humorous point-and-click adventure game from Daedalic Entertainment, the developers of the excellent Edna & Harvey games.In Deponia you play Rufus, a selfish, lazy, entitled young man whose father escaped to the beautiful floating Elysium and left Rufus on the junk planet, Deponia, to fend for himself. The game begins with Rufus ready to leave his few friends behind and attempt another flight to Elysium in a craft of his own devising. In short order he encounters an Elysian woman, Goal, who becomes seriously injured. Your job is to guide Rufus through trying to heal Goal and reach Elysium.GraphicsDeponia uses the same game engine as Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, although it seems to have had a facelift. The graphics are cartoon like and have a lot of charm. Animations are great, and there's obviously been considerable attention to detail paid to most of the scene backgrounds, which are detailed and often humorous.The gameplay is interspersed with animated cutscenes, done in the same style as the gameplay graphics. These are also very well done.Graphics options are few, but the game performs well on my ageing gaming laptop, so there shouldn't be any need for optimisation of settings anyway.SoundMusic is good and fits the game world well. The narrator sings through the introduction for each chapter; he's the same performer as in Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, and in the same way the humour in the songs occasionally falls a bit flat with rather forced rhymes, but it's still a nice touch.Sound effects are appropriate. They're well sampled and normalised for volume, and they work well in the game, even when they're a bit over the top.The game is fully voiced, and the voice acting is generally very good, although the default volume level is too low (hint: turn the music down). In particular, Rufus is acted well -- he sounds suitably obnoxious -- and Goal's voice is perfect. The script is a bit lacking in places, making for a few awkwardly worded lines, most likely due to translation into English, but the subtitles at least match the spoken words very closely. There are some very funny parts, too: try showing the platypus toy to Goal.GameplayDeponia plays like any traditional point-and-click adventure game. It can be played exclusively with the mouse, using the pointer to highlight interactive objects in each scene, right mouse button to examine them (note: this sometimes also interacts with them!), and left mouse button to interact with them. The inventory, key to any traditional adventure game, can be accessed in one of two modes; I played with the mouse wheel being used to open and close the inventory panel, and this worked well.In keeping with traditional point-and-click adventures, the story is completely linear, with dialogue choices available for flavour, and humour only, and not to allow any real freedom of choice. Puzzles mostly make sense, although the translated script makes some solutions less obvious than I feel they should have been, and I confess to having to resort to a walkthrough to complete the game. The story is interesting, too, and the characters are well realised. I'm glad that Daedalic have made sequels, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.In typical Daedalic fashion the Steam achievements are mostly unlockable through playing normally, but there a few that you'll be very unlikely to get unless you follow a guide. If you're an achievement hunter, but still wish to enjoy the game, I'd suggest playing through once normally and saving often, then using one of the many achievement guides to go back and get the achievements you missed. The Drogglejug! achievement is a right pain.There are a few minor bugs, but I found that Deponia was more stable than either of the Edna games. Clicking on objects in the inventory often doesn't work first (or second, or third) try, but this is only a minor annoyance, and seems to be due to mouse sensitivity. Also, one of the achievements didn't unlock properly for me or many others going by the Steam discussion forum, and there were a couple of little script hiccups where a character appeared and disappeared briefly once, or text disappeared. But there were none of the non-working saves or other critical bugs from Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes.PROS AND CONSPros+ Interesting story in a fun game world+ Well-realised characters that made me care what happened next+ Great cartoon-like graphics and animations+ Good voice talent+ Some funny jokes+ Achievements+ Trading CardsCons- Occasionally inelegant translation leaves a few jokes falling flat and puzzles obfuscated- Minor bugs in places- The ending seemed a little bit rushed, after so much time spent in KuvacCONCLUSIONDeponia is another great point-and-click adventure from Daedalic, and introduces a fun and interesting game world. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any adventure game fans with a sense of humour. I'm really looking forward to playing the sequels.8/10 "

												This is as close as I've got in many years to play a quest like in the good ol' days of Lucas Arts. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet expectations. The story is bad, the script is terrible. The dialogue is tiresome, lengthy and not funny. Maybe it's me, I got too old for this stuff. I also dislike all characters, especially Rufus (The guy you play), which is a problem. Had some issues with the way women are portrayed as well.The quest itself is okay, for the most part I could figure it out by myself. Solvable but not too easy. For some reason it can get really buggy, which is odd for such a simple game that has been out there for the past 3 years.All in all, I will probably finish it and might even play it's sequels (already got them in a bundle). But I wouldn't recommend myself playing it in the first place.(*) Edit: Re-played Monkey Island 1 & 2 recently. Still fantastic as it used to be. So it's not me, It's Deponia.Plus: Didn't manage to make it through Deponia's seconed title.			"

Deponia sets new standards for the genre, some bad and some good.Pros: Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Gameplay, Characters, PerformanceDeponia's hand-drawn graphics suit the colorful, cluttered setting perfectly and the voice acting is excellent.  The simple controls work well, but perfect controls should be mandatory for any point-and-click game.However, the gameplay is unfortunately rather standard for the genre with goofy puzzles (wasabi pea on mousetrap to catch toothbrush, duh!).  The main protagonist is completely insufferable and there is some lightly disguised sexism (don't agree? let me switch your brainchip).  Lastly, there are performance and gameplay bugs that shouldn't exist in as simple a game as this.Perhaps a no-brainer for point-and-click fans but a cluttered mess for most everyone else.6/10			"

												Nice try. But no cigar.Let's get the pros out of the way first, there are not many anyway:Pros- I actually like the visuals and setting. I don't think the story, the dialogues and the characters are horrible. They are acceptable. Too many people complain about the characters not being likeable. Try living in a junk city for a while, let's see if you will be likeable then. (In fact you can try this IRL)- It runs with zero bugs/glitches on Linux.Although I don't hate this game, I don't recommend it for the following reasons:Cons- Random puzzles.  Using peas as bait to catch a toothbrush. Fuuuuuuu - Silly puzzles.  Place detonation marks based on the resemblance of the hats and rooftops. C'mon. - Because most puzzles are of the two kinds mentioned above, you need to consult walkthrough and it kills all the fun. Instantly and completely.- Pixel hunting is annoying. This could have been easily solved, just flash clickable stuff if I have been stuck for a few minutes.I guess we shouldn't expect a Simon the Sorcerer or a Monkey Island anymore. Modern games are so sophisticated and highly stimulating (well, compared to old games), we expect a lot... Wait, still  making coffee with battery acid  is way too silly and not at all funny.			"

												Deponia invokes feelings reminiscent of playing those old adventure games from my youth. I played through the game without object highlighting, because only a defeated man makes use of that particular button of cowardice. Visually, Deponia excels. The characters and environments are consistently good throughout the entire game. While the humor does fall flat at times, the overall tone and presentation of the game harkens back to a time I remember with nostalgia. Rufus, the main protagonist in the game, is a deeply flawed character. He’s not a hero, but he’s persistent, goal orientated (haha), and in a weird way, endearing. And the puzzles. Modern adventure gaming, I feel, has become too streamlined and simplistic. Objects in many of the newer games have obvious purposes and the puzzles are too easy. This is not the case with Deponia, at least initially. The first “act” of the game takes place in a town filled with interesting objects to interact with and puzzles whose solutions are not readily apparent, but still approachable. However, the quality of the puzzles, and to some degree, the game itself, degrades when you progress to the “second” and “third” acts. Certainly, Deponia gets progressively worse, as the environments become more linear, and the puzzles become more of a chore than an engaging game play element. That’s not to say that the more advanced stages lack puzzles that will give you some pause, they just don’t have very many of them. Without spoiling too much, the story and characters seem to suffer the same depreciation in quality to an extent. Furthermore, there’s a mini-game type puzzle at the end of the second portion of the game where I encountered a glitch that would not let me proceed, even though I had the correct solution. Luckily, I received a steam achievement upon configuring the solution, so I was able to overcome this glitch after several repetitions using the same configuration. Overall, I would recommend Deponia to any fans of old adventure gaming, because many of its more charming elements have their roots in the old titles. I like the environments, puzzles, the artistic direction, and many of the characters. It is not a perfect game, nor is it the best in the genre, but if you can pick it up for half of its retail price, the game is worth looking into if you like point and click adventures.			"

												Coming from a background of Spy Fox games and other point and click adventures, Deponia is a great series with plenty of  puzzles and excruciatingly interesting plot. If you like any of the Humongous Entertainment games from your childhood or coming in fresh to the genre or just yearning for a great story overall, I sincerely recommend the Deponia series.Pros: The art direction for the game is absoutely enjoyable and unique with everything retaining detail to backgrounds and foregrounds and character design. Simply eye candy.Soundtrack is astonishingly marvelous, very catchy and not too repetitive like elevator music. Every scene is accompanied by amazing music making the atmosphere pop in any mood or situation.Deponia is filled with unique and lovable characters, all of them serving a purpose to the game in some way. The main character is a lovable jerk that can be easily attatched to. Plenty of dialogue to compliment the characters as well as the very well done voice acting to top it all off to complete the characters.The intriguing storyline and plot is probably the best selling point of this game (ofc its an adventure game) along with its great sense of humor. The univerese of the Deponia series was well crafted and it's obvious that the developers poured heart and soul into making Deponia make sense and rotating the cogs of this complicated universe. It serves as a motivation to finish puzzles to get to the end.Cons:The puzzles in this game can be either simple, difficult or just frustrating that you want to pull your hairs out. A good chunk of the puzzles are not built on logical reasoning and consists of clicking everywhere until something happens. I've spent a good few hours trying to figure out answers to puzzles that didn't make any sense. Without following a walkthrough or being the luckiest person in the world, you can be easily spending hours upon hours trying to figure out the solutions.Overall this game is a must play  "

												Deponia! This game is breaks all the rules. Without going into too much detail and spoiling the whole thing, I would just like to say that I found myself enjoying a game that I thought I would hate. The opening sequence (not the tutorial) should have been a key indicator of what was about to go down. The humor plays a huge role in this game. Although not outrageously funny, it provided a few chuckles on occasion. The art style is not my favorite, but I also admit that this particular game would not have been as good without that particular style. The puzzles were a key piece to making the game. I did find a few moments throughout the game where I was unsure what to do next. The game is good at letting you know what needs to be done, but not necessarily how it is to be done. Even so, I found a majority of the puzzles had a good balance. They were neither too hard nor too easy and they always seemed have a unique variety to them. Although on the outside the game might seem like a pile of garbage, the game has so much more to offer. The story (not the greatest, but pretty well thought out), the music (you'll see what I mean), the locations (Kuvaq was one of my favorites), the puzzles (probably the best thing about the game) will all transport you to Deponia and unlike Rufus you won't want to leave!""Huzzah, you should buy this game!""Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!

												A cool point-n-click adventure game by Daedalic Entertainment.DeponiaThe game has reminded me of some point-n-click mysterious adventure games which I've loved to play, but this one has fine and unique comic style graphics, seriously impressed me when I saw this game from Steam's Queue. Never been told to play this one, so I managed to figure it out by myself, and it's true! This game has so many preferential features from its steampunk world to puns. The game also has rather lengthy story but you can still enjoy it (and there are lots of silly plots in here).You will be playing as a reckless guy named Rufus, who has a strange sense of humour (he's basically amusing and smart), and you will start with a tutorial you cannot skip it because it is the part of story, uhm maybe (I forget)? . It's like an introduction to character, and you barely find yourself fall in love with this game. You can also choose preference for the control, since it is just a 2D and point-n-click style game, you don't have to do many things with WASD stuff, the control is absolutely simple and easy. You can also skip events and movement, for example when Rufus talks too much or NPC becomes boring because you click him/her several times, or you want to travel faster.Let's talk about the puzzles, some puzzles are requiring some efforts, not simple like you think that's why the game becomes more challenging and fun, sometimes you manage them by trial and error, or you can be so confused because there are so many missing parts that you can't even find (there isn't any hint button) which means you need extra efforts to pay attention what Rufus/NPCs say. Good things you are given considerable space to save your game in case of need. There isn't Game Over to this thing (let's say Rufus is untouchable), you just have to solve the riddles.However, the game is a little bit difficult for some new players who are not familiar with riddles, like I say some puzzles may be too hard to solve, but it's kind of a new challenge for those who want to give some efforts, Deponia is still enjoyable. It can also be played with kids who love puzzle!TL;DR:Pros:-Affordable price-Amusing characters and Puns-Controls are easy-Different difficulty for puzzles-Music is decent-Obviously cool graphic and art-Great storyCons:-Some bugs can be encountered while playing-Puzzles are sometimes too hard for new players			"

												If you enjoy classic point and click adventure games, this is a must.  The art style is great with quirky/odd music and  well done.  Both fit the game world well. The story line is humorous with a strange ""love story"" with a couple of twists thrown in.  Puzzles and mini-games were east to moderate difficulty, although some combinations were a bit on the strange side. Completing the game for experienced adventurers would be around 10-12 hours for the first run through.  For achievement seekers, the last one needs to be done with the sound turned off or you will go insane!  The last achievement is a bit of a challenge if you try it, but easier if you just finished the game and have a good memory.Bottom line is that this was a fun, short adventure that I am looking forward to playing the sequels.

												I picked up Deponia based on the trailer vids, lovely art style, and excellent music. The first chapter was quite enjoyable, with some clever puzzles that got you thinking outside the box.By the third chapter, what had started as a few stereotypical gags was now a blatant streak of misogyny underlying the whole game. As the puzzles descended into opaque trial and error, I was counting on a good story with interesting or at least growing characters to pull me along. Instead the game delivered more woman bashing (as in literally bashing an unconscious woman into things). I had to turn it off.Then I went and read what others were saying about the game, and I'm glad I stopped when I did, because the series keeps getting uglier: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/11/11/wot-i-think-goodbye-deponia/I regret the hours I sunk into this game, and that by buying the game I gave support to this kind of hateful content. Daedalic are clearly extremely skilled creators, but until their design and writing grow up a bit I won't be buying another of their games.			"

												Deponia is a beautiful designed Point & Click Adventure Game with a lot of humor. You play Rufus, a clumsy and egocentric guy , living on a planet full of trash called Deponia. His biggest wish is to escape from this awful planet and travelling to Elysium, a planet full of harmony.Rufus experiences a funny adventure in a wonderful designed game, which is only the beginning of a Game Triology. The story continues in the two games Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.I had a lot of fun playing it, so i just can recommend it for you. :)			"

												A sometimes amusing adventure game along the lines of Curse of Monkey Island, Deponia features an often unlikeable ""Guybrush"" in Rufus, a mainly absent damsel in the aptly named Goal, and many frustratingly dumb puzzles. It's a charming game, in a way; hopefully the sequels are an improvement.			"

												Having played point and click from space quest to monkey island, this is nothing innovative.The comedy is pretty lame, maybe kids would like it, but then its not that wholesome either.Admittedly I did finish it, because the art is pretty nice, and the story is okay, but the puzzles are completely arbitrary - there is no logical connection between the object required to interact.  They tried a quirky monkey island style but didn't quite get it.			"

												I tried to play this game, but found it tedious. The puzzles make no sense most of the time, and leaves you with little help. It's difficult to figure out what the next step is. And, it seems to be every step.The main character is completely unlikable. He has no redeeming traits. No one likes him, and he doesn't like anyone. He is a selfish, arrogant♥♥♥♥♥and he was only motivated by his own self interest.Now, the game setting was interesting, the artwork beautiful, and the voice acting great, but I couldn't get going any faster than a snail's pace. I wanted to know more about the world and the rest of the story, but couldn't get past the slow, clunky gameplay. Perhaps this game is only for the extremely patient.			"

												A funny point and click game but very challenging.- first of all the plot, you play as a guy names rufus and his main goal in life is to escape a planet full of junk to a heaven-like place called Elysium for a better life but faith has other plans for him (the plot gets more interesting as you progress in the game).-the gameplay is smooth and as any ponit and click games you have to solve puzzles to progress but in this game i find it very hard in the begining cause you dont have hints or anything to point you in the right direction, the combination and the solutions to the puzzles are very wacked and a bit crazy , kinda remind me of the RUNAWAY series ( chek guides for more helps)-the graphics are 2D/3D comics drawing art style (funny and enjoyable)-the voice acting is perfect , various dialogues and interaction between characters , music is enjoyable but gets repetitive sometimes-sadly the game has various bugs and some of them kills the progresion of the game but hopefully teh devs made it possible to download savegames from the site ( savegame for each lvl of the game ) better then nothing i guess.-all achivments are easy except for the last one , you need a special savegame from the site to unloak it r just use SAM and the price is a bit too much but you always can get it on sale ( get the full journey cause you gonna love the game )finally i recomend it for point and click fans specially RUNAWAY series7/10			"

												I've played the whole Deponia Series and, put simply:Deponia (1) is good, but a bit short and easy.Chaos on Deponia (2) is better, takes longer.Goodbye Deponia (3) is a lot better than both.The writing is awesome, the dude(s) behind it is(are) brilliant. I can't remember the last time I actualy read every single line of a game, if I ever did. Every single line of 3 games, in this case. Once you get familiar with Rufus, you laugh your whole way through... he is one of the best heroes ever... characters... anti-heroes... imaginary world threats... whatever.I hate to admit it but I had to read a walkthrough once in Chaos on Deponia and once in Goodbye Deponia because there's one particular situation in each of them that requires unusual solutions, which is great and in my opinion should be all over adventure games... but I couldn't figure them out, and now I hate myself. (Maybe if they ocurred more often we'd be ready for it... I tend to assume the game bugged... but, sadly, no, it didn't)Other than the dying/permanently screwing up your game that was possible in old Sierra games (although it is possible in one point), I think everything you can hope for in an adventure game is here, specially in Goodbye Deponia. A bit of Day of the Tentacle, some Full-Throttle's-end-like parts, and...THE MINIGAMES! I almost forgot about them... mini-games, puzzles, call it what you will. Lots of them throughout the series, very creative, very interesting. Daedalic team was really inspired-- those guys are good and they sure put a lot of effort into this stuff.Another thing is that instead of things declining by the end of the game (series), which I feel happening quite often these days, in the Deponia it ramps up nicely.It is hard to compare against adventure games' golden age classics such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Monkey Island 1-2 and Day of the Tentacle-- which in my idealized childhood memory are unbeatable-- but, from the adventure games I've played in the last 15-20 years or so, I'd say the Deponia Series is the best.Each game has several achievements that, if you want, you will have to go after on purpose. I left several behind, having no idea whatsoever of how to get/how did I miss them but they are there, and you can fry your brain further if you dare chase them all. Damn... now that I think of it, along with the achievements I probably also missed some good lines...Last and least, there's a con, which you may not see as one: you can hold the spacebar down to show all interactive spots on the screen. I hate that, it feels like cheating... and it's right there, so easy to use that I end up doing so.Put shortly, if you like adventure games, I say definitely get this one (these three).			"

 DEPONIA REVIEW Deponia is a 2012 point and click game made by Daedalic Entertainment. I havent played their other games, but I got the other three games and the adventure bundle to play after this. So I have no shortage of their games to play. But the first one I played, Deponia, is pretty good so far, and probably in the top three point and click games I've played.PROS:+ Great art style+ Fully voice acted+ Good humor+ Great soundtrack+ Excels in all places a point and click game should do well.CONS:- The vocal songs are sung by someone who can't speak English, and they are really hard to understand. They will grow on you however.- Puzzle solutions are sometimes insanely long and confusing. Without a guide, this game will be very frustrating.- Fairly short, I'm already in the final third of the game at 3 hours.FINAL SCORE:I would say the game isn't worth 20 dollars, thats a little too much for the length, but that doesnt mean skip it. The games a crazy 90% off on sale, and has been bundled on Bundle Stars and Humble Bundle for a dollar. The Daedalic Adventure Bundle on sale for 4.99 is the best way to buy the game.Deponia's Final Score8.5/10 "

												   Ah Deponia the start of the series that has kept me laughing, cursing, hating myself for the horrible things I did and given me a bald patch from trying to solve certain puzzles.  These games may not be for everyone with the humor that can at times cross boundries some feel to be too questionable but to me feels like it never goes too far while still being unafraid to let anyone be a target for a joke. Combined with puzzles that all make sense once you get used to looking at the world with the eyes of a mad scientist who bumped his head a couple of times too many you get an unpredictable journey to a predictable destination.

												Deponia is, at its heart, a love story--a tale of boy meets girl. The boy, Rufus, is a dreamer, the archetypal down-on-his-luck underdog who aims high but fails oh so miserably time and again. The girl, Goal, is classically unobtainable--rich, pampered, spoiled, and blissfully unaware of her own attractiveness to the opposite sex. Oh, and she has a removable chip in her head, lives in a floating palace in the sky, and has the power to blow up the entire planet. No, this isn't the most conventional of love stories, but such wackiness is befitting for a game that is as much about providing oodles of comic relief as it is about telling the tale of two lost souls.

Overall it was a really good game and it was worth the coin I spent on it. The only thing that bothered me was Rufus, the main protagonist. He is a bit of a  self-absorbed jerk.

												This is going to be kind of a rambly review because... I... I... don't know. I don't know what to say about Deponia.It's got some hilarious writing, especially for an adventure game, and I got through most of it without a walkthrough, so those are some good points.The art in the game is spectacular. Like, really spectacular... until you get to the cutscenes, where they look like strewn-together flash animations. It still looks good enough that I can let it pass.But... there's something about when the game says it's going to sit down, shut up, and be serious when it feels like something's amiss. The game just... can't be serious. Too much silly stuff is going on.I really like the way the game presents itself, as sort of a set of 3 open-world-y ""scenes"" where you have to work out the puzzles throughout each scene, and get to see the place turn to chaos as you slowly manipulate everything for your personal gain. It also fits the protagonist very well. Hell, the protagonist is basically the epitome of adventure game protagonists. He's basically how an AGP would actually act. He's actually kind of annoying to play as sometimes for that reason, but it kind of delivers with him a message about the genre. It's silly, and really shows Daedalic's writing style.I just feel like there's so much about the world we haven't been informed about though. I guess that's why Deponia is a trilogy, but it feels a tinge too short to make it worth being released in a trilogy.The game is weird and silly and a whole lot of fun and hilarity, but it's just the ending that makes it fall flat, when you realize you've hit the ending and there's quite a few loose ends to tie up in the later sequels,I adore the setting in the game. It's beautiful, and I so badly want to explore it more. All the little eccentricities of the world really show itself off. Daedalic seems to be absolutely god-tier at worldbuilding, and if you really like a world that feels like it's full of life, you should check out this game. Heck, the stellar worldbuilding gets you so attached to the world that it makes a later twist in the game all that much more impactful. Too bad our protagonist doesn't share the same views.I'll probably amend this if I ever get the other games in the series, but right now Deponia is standing as ""a pretty good adventure game"". I do recommend it, but be warned that what you're getting into is a little below par.			"

												Deponia kind of suffers from the adventure-game syndrome of old where you don't actually know what to do to progress the story or solve a puzzle so you wind up going in circles for awhile.  Then once you figure out that you had about half of the solution right but you didn't figure out the rest of it, you'll feel really stupid at not realizing that you were supposed to send a baloon up a chimney and that you spent probably about half an hour before you caved and looked at a walkthrough that made it seem oh-so-obvious.Adventure games rule.  Pick this up if you like adventure games and their somewhat obtuse solutions.			"

												Love this game. I like the story, the humor, the voice acting, and the artistic style they've used for the graphics. The puzzles aren't too easy. Most of them are not too challenging to the point you just start grinding your teeth. The puzzles aren't bad. I've not come across anything like that horrid rain dance in the Book of Unwritten Tales yet, which is less a puzzle than it is an exercise in frustration. That required you to tap the keys given in a list that scrolls down the screeen. The list speeds up as you go along so if you're terrible at things that require precise timing or have painful arthritis problems in your hands that stiffen your fingers like I do, a puzzle like that can quickly render a game unplayable. Thankfully, there's nothing like that here in Deponia. Some of the puzzle solutions are obvious so if you like a constant challenge you may be disappointed. What I definitely find aggravating though is that some of the solutions bear no resemblance to logic at all and I found myself seeking hints. There were a couple points where I resorted to walkthroughs because the solutions made no sense whatsoever and I'd have never figured it out in a million years. I've also been tripped up by the related problem of some of the puzzles not using the logical and, to me, obvious answer and like I've mentioned before, using instead an alternate solution that makes no sense. It would be nice if I could use an alternate solution I see instead of being locked into the one the developers thought of. Still, those are the only drawbacks and while they are occasionally frustrating they haven't ruined the experience for me. I got enough enjoyment out of the game that I still consider this a good purchase and I have no regrets. I enjoyed the story and can't wait to play the other two games in the series.			"

Short version: 83%The first part of the Deponia trilogy isn’t exactly a bold game that tries to discover new territories in mechanics or storytelling; it’s just a well-constructed point ‘n’ click with proven character concepts, plot mechanics, and puzzles.Long version:The Deponia series is arguably Daedelic Entertainment’s most famous point and click title. Yet the first instalment, for the most part, is just another good adventure game, nothing more.The protagonist, Rufus, is a stereotypical egocentric jerk who just wants to achieve his one goal in life (leave his home for good), no matter how much grief it causes to everyone around him. When the other main character, Goal from the (literally) upper society drops into his life, he sees her only as a ticket out… but eventually gets entangled in a much larger plot, which– the game being the first part of a trilogy– naturally ends in a cliffhanger.What makes this often seen story stereotype work is the writing. The dialogues are perfect from Rufus’ self-centric monologues to the sarcastic responses he gets from everyone else; the characters may be simple, but they have a good synergy.The puzzles are what one expects from a point ‘n’ click: mostly inventory and map hotspot manipulation, with a few occasional (and skippable) minigames. The difficulty is moderate; if you know how adventure game logic works, you shouldn’t have problems– except for maybe the middle segment, which require some trial and error.As a final word: the trilogy was re-released as a single game, making these individual titles somewhat obsolete… unless you want to play the famous drugglejug mode, which was never implemented in the Complete Edition.

The game graphics is safe for people who can´t handle bright and strong colours, it´s made with care and will probably make you smile as they bring you as a member in the game. Sure you control the main character even tho the main character see you as a different person. All of the characters in the game are pretty well made and easy to get know. The details in the game are amazing and sure deserves a  thumbs up to the game designer. The story this game is breathe taking and will make you want to finish it as fast as possible. If you are new to these kind of games I would deffinitely suggest Deponia for you. I really hope this helped and I really enjoyed the game,texture, voice acting and all the well thought details. :mana: ~:mana:			"

In the end, however, I found myself lost a lot of the time trying to figure out what to do next. When I knew what I had to do, I found myself searching around random areas trying to find anything that I could use to help me solve the puzzles because it wasn't clear what I needed.

												First of all , I'd like to say that this game is OK. Let me explain why. Let's start from the positive side. For the quest game graphics is awesome and visualization is good as well. Story line is ok , dialogs are pretty good and sometimes it's really fun. Here positive side ends. Now let me explain why i wouldnt recommend this game. As a person whos finished this game i'd like to say that it's ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to complete it without using guides , especially second half of chapter 1. No hints , no help , nothing. It's impossible to use logic to solve some problems. Music is horrible , sometimes it's very annoying. This game has the worst ending in videogame history. I know that it is trilogy , but why the ♥♥♥♥ would they split the game into 3 games? Why wouldnt they do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥as telltale games did with walking dead? Commercial side right. In conclusion i'd like to say that this game is waste of time if you are not going to complete the full trilogy.			"

												Summary: Deponia is a fast-paced comedy of errors and one of the most unusual love stories in gaming history. The twist-filled story takes its off-beat characters all over trash planet Deponia, a unique game world in the style of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Matt Groening. From Kuvaq, an improvised village built inside a giant trash heap, to the swimming black market and the dark corners of the elevated planetary railways: Deponia is brought to life with detailed hand-painted backgrounds in widescreen format and top-quality cartoon animation. 8/10			"

												Pros:Solid visuals, animation, sound, and game mechanics.  I didn't come accross any bugs.Option to highlight items so you're not stuck pixel hunting.Cons:Several obscure and unintuitive trial-and-error puzzles (walkthrough required).Thouroughly unlikeable main character.Unimaginative storyline.I found this game to be oddly mean-spirited (though perhaps its just a mismatch in target audience or something culturally based).  The ""humor"" missed the spot and I had to force myself to finish the game in order to judge it fairly.  The only enjoyable part was the songs summarising each section, even those aren't worth subjecting yourself to the game though in my opinion.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but the good things in the game, the settling, brilliant art direction, and whatnot, are all undercut by the worst main character ever.  It's like all of his lines were ghostwritten by tim buckley.  I'm fine with playing the villan, or antiheroes, but this is a bridge too far, this guy is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, seriously.  I get that the game riffs on him for that, but it's still beyond grating to hear every one of his lines.			"

												The gameplay is solid enough and it has a nice style going for itself. In all the technical forms it's a decent point-and-click adventure, but it just fails in every aspect story-wise. You play an extremely unlikeable character, which I suppose you can write off for the sake of ""you always play a good guy, be bad for once"" kind of thinking. The humour is crude and cringeworthy, e.g. you drug your Nagging Sexist Trope Ex-Girlfriend and innocent cats, while the game tries to play it off as humouristic. What made me grind me teeth most of all was the Really Just A Man In A Dress Trope trans woman at the Town Hall. Ha ha. High quality humour, am I right? I absolutely love laughing at people who are already dying at such a high rate. Ha ha ha. Ha.Only to top off all of that with Ms. Goal; a mostly (in a way) absent or unconscious main character who is a prize you're essentially fighting for. She is literally nothing but a Goal. An empty character that you are trying to conquer. Mm, sweet casual misogyny that isn't even clever. This game had the potential to be pretty good and enjoyable, but at every twist and turn it opts in on gross writing. Even if you ignore the crude and lazy ""humour"", the story still remains flatter than an open bottle of coke you left in your fridge for 2 weeks. Disappointing. I don't understand why this game is so loved by many.			"

												A beautiful game with a funny and interesting plot. What I think about it: Rufus is an interesting character because he seems just a clumsy slyboots who wants a better life, but he is also a hero in search of ascension. It's like he knew Deponia is just the byproduct of a more advanced civilization, and therefore nothing in Deponia have much value. He lives in an abandoned planet and he was abandoned by everyone. You can even forgive him for his selfishness. You begin to cheer for him. I think this is the strong point of the game. I have not played the other parts to see if it changes.			"

												Deponia aims to be quirky to sets itself apart from many of its kind. It has however fail in many different aspects:1. Characters: In a story-driven game such as this, the characters are far from memorable. Each one seems to try its upmost effort to sound sarcastic, cynical or downright idiotic to an extent that it fails to deliver an exciting blend of characters. Don’t get me wrong, I love characters that make a fool of themselves (e.g. Rincewind from Discworld) but what Rufus tried to portray feels way too forced. Instead of the light, bite-sized comedy pieces that I was expecting, I witnessed sloppy production and narrations. Granted, there were some funny moments, but it is difficult to give proper credit given the rarity of such occasion.2. Puzzle: Again, another essential element to a point-and-click game. This is the major flaw of the game. I give huge leeway to such games where logic and questionable detours need to be taken or when pesky puzzle elements are involved that somehow blocks the progress of the game simply to discover that it makes little sense. Deponia is King of this behaviour right here.3. Artwork: Despite the fact that I am not a fan of this kind of artwork, I must say this is where Deponia shines the most, the artwork of its kind is downright stunning, exuding a very unique feel towards the world of Deponia.4. Music: Passable music, though there are some memorable ones. This, together with artwork, ensures a great thematic feel of its kind.Problems: As of 11th May 2013 a bug exists in the middle of the game where you will be stuck and unable to continue. I find this very mind-boggling that such a bug could have existed until now. This needs immediate repair.Overall, if you're a fan of point and click game, this game might be worth it, otherwise, stay clear away. "

												Deponia is the 1st part of a Trilogy that takes you to the junkyard world of Deponia where the stubborn, egocentric and yet bold boy Rufus dreams of leaving the tedious Deponia for the paradise Elysium seen floating in the sky above. For me the games biggest strength have to be it´s quite humorous tone which is especially notable in the often hillarious dialogues filled with sarcasm. It should be noted that the main protagonist Rufus is not a very likeable character, he´s actually an excellent example of the 'anti-hero', which might put some people of but I myself found it refereshing to play as a flawed character instead of the usual Paragon.The graphics and especially the backgrounds are really nice and the character models are not far behind. The Audio is excellent and especially the Bard theme during some of the cutscenes. The puzzles are varied in difficulty which I like but all those who where tougher to crack had some form hints often found in dialouges with characters nearby. The puzzles also have a 'skip' option for those who find them annoying and want to get on with the story which is nice I guess.One final notice is that the 'silly mode' called Droggeljug which is needed in order to get the final achievement for 100 % is super annoying and I would actually go against my usual view and recommend to 'cheat' in order to get it. Having to play another full playtrough with no dialouges in a game based on dialogue was not a very bright idea by Daedalic in my opinion but it´s a minor flaw in a otherwise great game.I fully recommend buying this although the full price of 19,99 € might be a tad to much considering the lack of replayability but at a -50 % or better discount it´s definatly a good buy.

												Deponia is a purebred point-and-click adventure that follows the misadventures of Rufus, a dreamer, an inventor, a visionary - and a jerk. And make no mistake, he's not a misunderstood scoundrel who does his best but always seems to end up on the wrong side of the right thing. He's selfish, egomaniacal and a legitimate, all-around♥♥♥♥♥♥ He has no qualms at all about putting the screws to his best friend, and considers his long-suffering girlfriend's insistence that he get a job and do the dishes once in awhile to be utterly unreasonable. His only goal in life is to escape his dirty, dreary life and make his way to the distant realm of Elysium, a land of milk and honey that floats high in the sky above his home.The opening segment of Deponia is dedicated to Rufus' latest scheme to reach Elysium, and while the outcome is all too predictable, I laughed like a fool at the payoff anyway. It's not what you'd call sophisticated humor - think Wile E. Coyote meets Homer Simpson and you'll have a pretty good idea of how it plays out - but the presentation is so well done that it works anyway.Unfortunately, after getting off to a strong start, Deponia sags rather dramatically in the second half of the lengthy opening chapter, when the oddly-named and inconveniently-cybernetic Goal is introduced to the action. She's a beautiful Elysian female who may well be Rufus' ticket to the good life, but before any of that can happen he must first revive her and then prove his ""claim"" to her with the town's mayor. It lacks direction and is weighed down with frustratingly obtuse puzzles, and although I may not be the sharpest cookie I have no idea how some of these puzzles could be solved without a walkthrough. It drags narratively too, as the priority shifts from sharp storytelling to confounding players with an overload of tough brainteasers. The story thankfully picks up again in the second and third chapters, which pass much more enjoyably with better pacing and far more reasonable puzzles.The game suffers from a few technical issues, most of which relate to the translation from the game's original German. There are occasional spots of odd or awkward terminology, one line of subtitled text appears in German rather than English and the subtitles don't appear at all in a multiple choice puzzle in the second chapter, forcing you to either guess your way through it or, again, rely on a walkthrough. It doesn't do much to fill out its fiction, either. The role of the Organon, a sort of half-robotic military organization-slash-secret police that seems to serve the people of Elyisum, is never clearly explained, nor is the exact nature of Goal's brain implant, which is really just a cheap way to bring her in and out of the action as needed. But in spite of those missteps, Deponia is a success. It brings absolutely nothing new to the genre, but it's legitimately funny, brilliantly produced and, aside from some slogging in the middle, moves quickly and smoothly from start to finish. It's not quite great, but it's awfully good.			"

												Overall, I found the trilogy enjoyable. I loved all the art in this. The backgrounds were very interesting, detailed, and beutifully portrayed a wide variety of the many towns cities landscapes, and other areas of this trash-heap of a planet. The character designs had this simplistic ""kiddy"" style that I found particularyly appealing. I think that the characters designs were pretty effective in expressing each characer wtih a huge variety of characters of many shapes, sizes, and postures. The art of the game, while playing, overall reminded me of pajamasam, being a point-and-click adventure with upbeat, ""kiddy"" looking characters in combination with a vast world of many areas drasticly differeing from one another in tone and atmosphere. Now with gamplay, well... Puzzles in this game, thinking back now, where ususally ridiculously hard to solve. I was stuck several times only to look at a walkthrough only to find that the answer makes me think ""how in the world was I supposed to figure THAT out."" Without the walkthrough I porbably would not have finished the game. I already spent like a good hour sitting there trying to think of answers. I did NOT have the patience of trying EVERYTHING on EVERYTHING so it was either use my own logic to its most abstract limits or the walkthrough. There were sometimes were I was on a roll in solving puzzels and that was pretty satisfying. The voice acting was pretty decent. It sure beats Dream. My friend told me he quickly got tired of Rufus' voice but I wasn't too bothered. I was pretty invested in the story. The story was the otherthing besides the art that kept me playing. It has some cool twists and reveals that suprised me. Aand I think the ending of the trilogy beats Mass Efect's.  "

Deponia has a simple history and goal: you are Rufus, you hate your planet and wants to leave it. That's it. However, don't think that leaving your literaly trash planet will be simple. You will have to think, explore, realize things and be creative. You will find yourself in situations like ""WTF DO I DO WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS PARROT, A LAUGH GAS BALLOON, A DENTIST DRILLING MACHINE AND THIS DEVICE THAT CHANGES THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE PLANET??"" that will drive you crazy and curious. Deponia is the only Point-and-click game that is funny instead of annoying that I have ever played. I do recommend.			"

Downsides are that you're launched straight into a tutorial, rather than given time to watch the scene be set; in addition, the voice recordings aren't great in that a) the artists haven't received full direction, so sometimes they stress the wrong word and ruin the joke, and b) there isn't enough variety in responses. The game is also fairly short but is actually a lot longer than most, and definitely longer than your average Indie game. In all, really, really good. Enough to make me buy the sequel :)			"

												Top notch characters, artworks, and musics. If you want to relive the old Lucasarts games atmosphere this is the game for you. (note: only the first chapter, reasons in the edit)EDIT: Just finished the first 3 chapters (the 4th has just been released). I still recommend Deponia, but I can't compare it to Lucasarts games anymore, there's some racism/sexism/and just some plain bad ideas that has been put into the second and third games. I think the creator's idea was to make the character ignorantly racists, sexists, and a bad person overall, but I think it would have been better to just leave Rufus as it was in the first game, a goofy clumsy hatcher of bad plans. Nonetheless, this haven't changed completely how I feel about this game's characters and artworks. It's still a great game.			"

You will find yourself in situations like ""WTF DO I DO WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS PARROT, A LAUGH GAS BALLOON, A DENTIST DRILLING MACHINE AND THIS DEVICE THAT CHANGES THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE PLANET??"" that will drive you crazy and curious. Deponia is the only Point-and-click game that is funny instead of annoying that I have ever played. I do recommend.			"

												A great adventure game - graphics, setting and gameplay wise - placing you in the shoes of one of the most unlikable protagonists (and female sidekicks) in video game history. Also, minor problems when selecting inventory items (you have to click in the very center of the item to actually pick it up) and the usual Daedalic translation issues here and there.Still, a really worthy adition to your point'n'click adventure library overall.

												Overall, I found the trilogy enjoyable. I loved all the art in this. The backgrounds were very interesting, detailed, and beutifully portrayed a wide variety of the many towns cities landscapes, and other areas of this trash-heap of a planet. The character designs had this simplistic ""kiddy"" style that I found particularyly appealing. I think that the characters designs were pretty effective in expressing each characer wtih a huge variety of characters of many shapes, sizes, and postures. The art of the game, while playing, overall reminded me of pajamasam, being a point-and-click adventure with upbeat, ""kiddy"" looking characters in combination with a vast world of many areas drasticly differeing from one another in tone and atmosphere. Now with gamplay, well... Puzzles in this game, thinking back now, where ususally ridiculously hard to solve. I was stuck several times only to look at a walkthrough only to find that the answer makes me think ""how in the world was I supposed to figure THAT out."" Without the walkthrough I porbably would not have finished the game. I already spent like a good hour sitting there trying to think of answers. I did NOT have the patience of trying EVERYTHING on EVERYTHING so it was either use my own logic to its most abstract limits or the walkthrough. There were sometimes were I was on a roll in solving puzzels and that was pretty satisfying. The voice acting was pretty decent. It sure beats Dream. My friend told me he quickly got tired of Rufus' voice but I wasn't too bothered. I was pretty invested in the story. The story was the otherthing besides the art that kept me playing. It has some cool twists and reveals that suprised me. Aand I think the ending of the trilogy beats Mass Efect's.  "

												You play the part of ""Rufus"", a quirky odd fella' from the village Kuvaq"", on the trash and scrap-covered world of ""Deponia"" - Think: Junkyard with housing opportunities!This Point & Click adventure is full of funny, clever, and sometimes very tricky puzzles to solve. It goes to redicilous lenghts at times, so there might be a couple of self-loathing moments where you look up a guide, and then *facepalm yourself, due to the obvious ( in the world of Deponia) solution. But don't worry, the pace of the game is great, and you wont find yourself stuck to often.It tells it's story with a humongous portion of humour. You will surely smile and stay curious throughout the game.The voiceacting is also very good - where every character seems to have been properly worked on.- If you like Point & Click games with a twist of comedy. This is for you!			"

												A decent entry in the point-and-click genre. I'd recommend getting Deponia on sale, though, considering the amount of gameplay. I consider the replayability to be a bit low, considering there are not multiple possibilities and you've already figured out the puzzles. A few pros and cons: + I thought that the story behind the world of Deponia was fairly interesting. + Rufus grew on me by the end, despite his obvious flaws.+ Good style and gameplay.- A lot of the puzzles were counter-intuitive to me, and I did reference a walkthrough quite a bit while playing.- No well-developed female characters.- A bug with the inventory button disappearing forced me to play with a mouse instead of just my trackpad.

												   This is the first part, out of a 3 part adventure story, where the main character is Rufus, a pathologically egotistical individual, that wants to escape from a planet that is now all filled with junk. I found out that middle click would highlight all the objects that you can interact with, close to the end of the game but I didn't had any real problems finding objects as the art style is pretty well done. The game has humor everywhere and unless you really get stuck, it's a really fun experience. I don't normally play adventures, so when I say that I didn't use any walkthroughs, it means that the game is not that difficult and things are generally intuitive enough. There are also a few fun puzzles thrown in there that you can skip if you want.Rating: I, me, and mine!*Editors'Choice*http://pixelloot.com "

												Review for the whole saga.First of all, I don't really like point-and-click games, but for some reasons... I loved Deponia saga. Pros:Puzzles: In a lot of point-and-click you have to figure it out on your own, without hints, and so you should try to combine random items\click everywhere\etc... In Deponia you'll get tons of hints, in dialogues\descriptions\etc... you'll always find great hints.Awesome graphics Awesome musics Awesome voice acting Nice storyFUNNY ! Dialogues\puzzles\descriptions\even trying to use the wrong item, will make you laugh. The whole saga takes ~30h, it's never repetitive Platypuses RufusGreat inventory system Cons:Last chapter (Goodbye Deponia) it's a bit buggyI don't want to spoil so I'll just say that I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY disappointed with the ending...

												I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!This has to be the funniest point and click I have played in ages. Not only is it hillarious from start to finish. It is also incredibly challenging. You really have to think outside the box for some of these, but at the same time it makes sense, just like in Sam and Max. So you will find yourself explaining your reasoning for solving a puzzle to someone who doesn't play this, to only get a facial expression thrown back at you that says ""What on earth are you on??"" Lol. The mechanics are very old school, which is great, and definately hark back to the early DOS days. Being able to bring the items menu up and down via the mouse wheel is pure genius, and gives me a great sense of pleasure every time I do it.The visuals are gorgeous. Every landscape and character you see is very sharp and clean, with loads of colour and detail. The script, storyline, characters, songs, music and voice acting is phenomenal! The humour is very adult so I'd steer younger kids away from this (It's not Deadpool or anything but there's the odd bit of language and double entendre and it can get a little dark in places). This game had me hooked from start to finish. Even though I had to break away from and come back to it occasionally when I got stuck. Getting stuck was definately the most frustrating thing about this game, because you'd get a real head scratcher, not be able to solve it for a while, but really want to know what happens in the story. Still I don't think I would change anything about this game. Amazing. Would definately recommend it and am looking forward to playing the next installment 'Chaos on Deponia'.			"

												I’m certain I have finished this game but I was so bored and frustrated by the game I can’t really remember. I know and appreciate that many people enjoy this game, I really wanted to like it as it was my first attempt at seriously getting into point and click style games. The plot was lost on me at the very beginning, the dialogue was painful at best and all the characters annoyed me. I know there are a few other people who have a similar view as me, and I respect that other people love this game, I would recommend playing some via a friend’s accounts if they have it or watching videos and just seeing if you can enjoy the game before buying it. I KNOW IT IS ON SALE ALL THE TIME BUT PLEASE SEE HOLD OFF AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT, for me it was like slow death by a cheese greater.			"

												This game shows the usual quality that is expected from Daedalic: Great production values for an adventure game, especially in terms of the animation. It’s also quite a novelty to play as an absolutely horrible person, and it’s interesting how that concept is integrated into the puzzles.But still I think it was a missed opportunity, since the game suffers from many pacing issues and illogical puzzles. There are many parts where the objectives aren’t evident, when at the same time there are many screens and objects to interact. Also, there’s many puzzles that even after checking the walkthrough I’m still scratching my head, which is a big no no in this genre. Newcomers are advised to check The Whispered World instead. "

												Where to start?With a lot of point and click adventure games, getting stuck is just part of the process and peeking at a walkthrough is fairly standard. The person making it is trying to be witty, creative, yet logical at the same time with the item combinations and just miss by a long shot. I’m fairly sure any point and click adventure fan has had this from time to time. There is always a moment or two you ask yourself… “Well, how was I seriously supposed to figure out that you had to put the chicken in the blender to get egg yolk, use that yolk with a daisy to make a cake, eat the cake and fart out the key to why I’m stuck.” My point being, the solutions aren’t always as obvious as they might think. I was very glad to find that Deponia isn’t like that. It’s consistently logically throughout the whole game. Admittedly, I did get stuck a few times, but it was more of a “how DIDN’T I get that?” rather than a “how did they think that made sense?”The Art style in Deponia is beautiful. A planet consisting of junk has never looked so good. The animation, music, voice acting and humour are all great to. There is a real charm about the characters and the little witty things that they say, that makes this game all that much more enjoyable. Which, talking of voice acting, reminds me… Droggeljug mode!I finished this game, looked back on the achievements I had left to get and I thought… …This is going to be interesting.Well, I never knew that Droggeljug mode would be as painful as it was. Finishing the game unlocks a new mode, where everything and anything that anyone says ever, comes out: “Droggeljug!”Now this is amusing all of a 10 second period, but after that it is quite painful. They say it in the same tone of voice every time. You may get the odd “Droggeljug?”, but apart from that it is fairly robotic. That being said it was still a funny little thing that they added which I thought was quite unique. I can imagine that this mode would make it a lot more challenging to play through if I didn’t literally just finish the game and still have everything fresh in my mind. Due to parts in the story where you need to note where the chat options are to get what you want off of them. (E.g. a character quiz’s you before they’ll give you a key, and all you have is a list of Droggeljugs for answers)It’s a challenging achievement, but a fun one. Despite that a lot of people probably muted it because the noise drove them crazy, I left it on low. Just to keep reminding me how ridiculous what I was doing really was.All in all, I love this game, it’s great. I can’t wait to start the next part in the story.TL;DR : Logical item combinations, engaging story, great humour, wonderful art and definitely a must have for any point and click adventure game lover.For anyone interested, My Review for Chaos on Deponia:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/220740For anyone interested, My Review for Goodbye Deponia:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/241910 "

												Point and click adventure game in my opinion stand on three pillars as a genre, narrative, game aesthetics and the puzzle complexity. If any of these pillars suffers it could entirely break the game and make a bland if not a terrible experience. This is what happened in Deponia with its narrative that just utterly failed the game's mostly good puzzle and aesthetic design. I just found that I was never engaged with the protagonist or the overall narrative which lead me to simply turn off the game on multiple occasions because I just got bored of the entire affair. The worst part was that even when I finally did finish the game I was given that utterly vapid void of an ending that brings closure to nothing and essentially demands that I play the next Deponia game to get a better picture of the narrative, which just isn't going to happen when I couldn't give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about anything going on to begin with.  I definitely saw the potential in Deponia and I saw the reasons people like it, but I can't in good conscious bring myself to anything other than warn people not to play this game. This is something that I hate to do to game's since I'm a big adherent to the philosophy that a game can be good regardless of how long it is, but for 19.99 a six hour experience just isn't good value for money for the player and that isn't acceptable in my opinion especially when its a mediocre experience at best.If you want to read a more detailed review you can find it over here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/07/deponia.html.

												I was given Deponia as a gift by a friend, as a point and click I can play on Mac. It's been fun and the puzzles are fun and the animation is good. However, near the end of the game there is a gamebreaking bug that prevents any progress whatsoever. Good luck contacting customer services for assistance; they have taken two weeks so far to get back to me on this issue and I am still waiting for any useful feedback.Recommended only if you like a pretty fun game only to crash near the end, preventing you from ever finishing!

												So, the game is regularly on sale for 0,99€, which is a STEAL don't get me wrong. I suppose that's how most are going to be picking this up.But this game did not inspire me to play the rest of the series. Didn't enjoy it enough. The game is a classic point'n-click, with all the hallmarks of the genre. The humour, collecting things, rubbing things together to make new things, list-based dialogue trees and ""quirky"" characters. So If you have nostalgia for these sort of games, you may enjoy it more. But I grew up in a different era, and while I enjoyed some of the monkey island games for their kickass music, this game doesn't quite have the same sort of charm. It also brings along the thing that ruined my enjoyment of the game: the adventure game logic. I played this game with a guide open in another window, and I have some shame for that, but I spent maybe two hours of play time stuck on various puzzles, and that just isn't my idea of a good time. One unintuitive puzzle would be an anomily, but more than three is more like poor design. The Visual are, well, lopsided. from the stills and the promotional art, you might thing that the game looks pretty good. in action though, the animation is really basic, with a minimum number of frames used to convey movement, and a limited number of facial expressions. Voice acting is also decent overall, with few standout performances for better or for worse.  And the story.... well, the writing has some pretty good moments, but on the whole it still often fails to entertain. I will still give the game credit for the writing of Rufus, the MC. A lot of games try to go for a ""scoundrel"" type of main character, who's somehow a rebel who doesn't play by the rules, but also has a heart of gold, but here they bring the contradiction in that type of hero to it's logical conclusion: Because he acts like typical adventure game character, the other charcters see Rufus as a useless, kleptomaniac, harebrained and unpleasant person, while he sees himself as ""too good"" to live among them. I would say his defining character moment is when he has an arguement with his ex-girlfriend (who still houses and feeds him) to get the key to her first aid kit, from which he takes some tranquilizer which he uses to  come back, drug her and steal her stuff. Having Rufus be a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is what's important for him to have any real character developement. As for the side characters, some get laughs, and some get groans, and some are simple plot devices. Unfortunately, the latter category includes the series female lead, Goal (seriously?) who is the cornerstone of the plot for the whole game, yet doesn't say anything meaningful to make you invested in her. All in all, Deponia is only recommended to the fans of this particular genre, and especially hard puzzles. For the uninitiated, the game can be frustrating.			"

												Deponia is a great adventure game that almost reaches up to the big titles like monkey island, machinarium and runaway. Atleast i had some nostalgic moments playing this game, and you can tell that the developers have som love for the genre.There is some really great puzzles and the story is.... Not that bad... It is ocationally funny but i feel they could have done alot more with the dialogues and humor. Somtimes it is really great and they have implemented some really funny ""try and fail combinations"". If only they had been a little more consistent about what the character said when you tried different combinations, trying to solve puzzles. Another thing I think would have done this game better would be more animations around using items and character reactions. Deponia have a lot of moments where a little turn around, looking into the camera and just nuging the shoulders or something, would have mede it a lot more funny. Or when you use items, that you would actually see him using it. Like in monkey Island, what is more funny that when you see Gybrush pull out a monkey from his pants using it as a monkey wrench! Overall Deponia is a great point and click adventure. But it is not consitent enough about this little extra that would put in in my classics shelf. Yet, If your a point and click adventure fan, buy this game!			"

It has everything i could ever want from the genre (exept a walk-speed dial, but double clicking while the mouse is over a new area does just as well) humor, adventure, and, well, just being damn pretty to look at in some parts. yes, sometimes the animation looks a tad budgeted, it never takes away from enjoying the adventure, unless your the kind of person who cares about DEM GRAPHICS (ECK!) more than the game. 10/10 would buy again.

												Deponia is vaguely amusing. Forget comparisons to Terry Pratchett, Deponia is far more firmly based in the ground of a Piers Anthony novel. It excels in slapstick, crudity and vague jokes in reference to science and technology yet lacks the aplomb and depth that Pratchett conveys.As a game, it works well... the inventory system is effective, the navigation easy to grasp and the puzzles significantly *puzzling* with hints that are not overly obvious yet definitely helpful for someone paying attention. Graphically the game is most certainly comical, the character designs and environments well executed in terms of conveying character and atmosphere. However even on a system that exceeds specifications I did occasionally experience a drop in frame rate that threw out the animated voice synchronisation which was slightly offputting.In terms of sound the games is interesting, each animation and area has it's own unique sound, and the music is again... amusing and in keeping with the satirical elements of the game.However Deponia amused me, it did not quite captivate me as I hoped it would. I enjoyed the puzzles, and the graphics but the story simply failed to grab me. Perhaps this is slightly due to the characterization of Rufus. As much as he is meant to be an egotistical, narcissist incapable of helping others, it's not exactly an engaging sort of character to play. He ended up annoying me rather than maintaining my interest. As for Goal, the ""heroine"" she lies docile and helpless most of the time, the old archetype of the damsel in distress, so I couldn't even engage with desire to help her... who wants to save a lifeless body in a white jumpsuit... because that's pretty much Goal's character for most of the game?? (or perhaps that's just the feminist critic speaking)Plotline and characterization issues aside... Deponia does still manage to be fun to play, mainly because of the excellent level designs and puzzles.So I still recommend it as a fun game to play.			"

												If you enjoyed Monkey Island, be sure to give this a try. Awesome graphics, quirky characters, hilarious dialogue (that intro though XD) and it's difficult enough that you may need a guide. Huzzah! 10/10			"

												I grew up playing lucas arts adventure games, like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. That's why i wanted to play this game, cause it looked like those game that i love so much, and it didn't dissapoint. It's a great game, a bit short but still, i recommend it. Must play for every adventure point and click fan. =)			"

												Not half bad actually. If you like point and click games, puzzles and a lot of thinking(unless you're too smart for this in which case you should be able to solve anything just by looking at it with little brain usage), then this is for you. If not then probably not.It's got a nice storyline and quite a bit of humour too! And this is only the start of the triology, should get the remaining two if you wanna finish the story off - I haven't yet so can't comment anymore on this.Haha, had to use a guide on a few of them as I'm one of those dumb people who can't think, think but somehow not able to connect the dots right or do but probably after a few hrs staring at it or something hahaha!(on one of them it took my like an hr and still never got passed it and then looked up a guide and then there it was, as simple as putting this item here and done - and I was like ""Wow......how did I not see that?!!)!=============================Played on: Dell Insprion 15 3521Windows 10 Home Edition x64, 8GB RAM, every other specs are stock.

												One of few games, where game trailer doesn't lie. If you like trailer, you're going to like the game(s). The story is not complete in this standalone game, you will wonder how it's going to end until the end of 3rd game.The graphics are nice, music is good, cutscenes are usually the best.I had some problems with the ""WTF i'm supposed to do now"" situations and I had to solve them using walktrhougts, but nevertheless I like the game very much and would recommend it.

												I grew up on the Police Quest/Space Quest/Sam & Max/Monkey Island/etc (Lucas Arts and Sierra), and having played the game Memoria from this studio a few months ago, I was looking forward to Deponia. I find myself disappointed. I have no problem with a game having an anti-hero character, but this main character is a twit. He does show character growth through the game, but it's only realized in the ending. Maybe. Most of the game he is just really a jerk in a way that's obivously meant to be over the top and slap stick, but wears out its welcome pretty quickly. I am going to try the sequel - I am  hopeful that the main character does improve.I would NOT recommend this game for someone trying out adventure games for the first time, or trying them again after a time away. It's not that this is a bad game - it's very solid in many aspects - but that main character is going to be very off-putting to some people.			"

												I was playing the game with my GF and we both loved it. There are many great things about it that i can mention, especially dialogues. My favourite character was Rufus who was incredibly hilarious, but other characters were also fantastic. About riddles - they were not so obvious. There were a few times in which we got stucked, but after all it was doable. Duration of the game was not that long, but I can say it was enough.I will keep in my mind some moments of the game for a long time and definitely I will play a sequel. I strongly recommend it.			"

												Deponia features the mechanics of a classic point-and-click with a beautiful hand drawn graphics and an interesting (if a little short) soundtrack. In typical P&C fashion you explorer various environments, interacting with set pieces and collecting items to be used later, completing various tasks that range from the mundane to the ludicrous. The first act dragged on a little and had some real out-of-the-box puzzle solutions but the last two acts really pickup and are paced a little better.The artwork really is gorgeous and does an excellent job of bringing a world full of junk and debris to life. The soundtrack is pretty good but isn't what you would call easy listening so after hearing the same few songs over and over again in each act it can be a little grating. The writing was typically funny and the voice acting is top notch although at times the main character is a little overbearing.Overall Deponia is good fun (although maybe a little overpriced for the length when not on sale) and if you're a point and click fan it will be right up your alley. Be warned, if you're following the plot at all you're going want the rest of the series, cliffhanger city central.

'Deponia' is a humorous point and click adventure, which is near to 'The Books of Unwritten Tales' where you can feel the world and want to be part of it. *Hussa!*Desc:You play as 'Rufus' who is a egomaniac, prides himself on being the best and who wants to leave his scrap home planet Deponia to Elysium with a vengeance. On his mission he meets 'Goal' the love of his life. He is willing to do everything for her to win her heart AND to get to Elysium.Pros:+ Really nice painted graphics and animations+ Strong audio speakers+ Funny as hell (sometimes very rude humor)+ Tutorial is available+ Skippable mini-games + References to previous Daedalic games+ Demo available(+ Sequels for continuing fun)(+ Achievements [easy to collect] )Cons:- Annoying Droggeljug achievement (no shortcut)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because of the great story and the awesome trappings playing on a planet/world full of scrap.9/10 "

""Life's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you look at it..."" - Monty Python pretty much summed up what living on Deponia is like. So it's no wonder protagonist Rufus wants to escape the literal pile of trash. Too bad he's an obnoxious, egocentric idiot who can barely do anything right, other than perhaps make various things blow up in various faces...A not-entirely-likeable definitely-not-hero for a protagonist is a classic ingredient for adventure gold, and Daedalic followed other parts of time-honored recipes, too. Puzzles from trivial to head-scratchers (the way some of them don't really have good hints for them may be the game's one Achilles heel), a graphics style that fits the comedic tone of the game and is executed well, plus some nifty little tricks that make playing eassier (like quick-warping to sscreen exits).If you think you live in a dump and have it rough, you ain't seen nothing yet and totally need to treat yourself to the Deponia experience. Ideally, look for a package deal that includes the sequels - even though this is a full-length adventure, it's really rather open-ended.			"

												Deponia is a good little point and click adventure game. It has its share of tedious puzzles but most of them are good and makes sense (not a la Discworld). The story is good enough although very linear (we can argue a story is always linear :p ) in my opinion. We are far from games or stories such as the Longest Journey or Monkey Island.The recommended inventory system using the mouse wheel is extremely good and works very well, you can also hit the space bar at anytime to highlight every clickable objects in an area and the hand drawn graphics are really fantastic.I noticed a few bugs here and there, some of the clickable objects would eventually become non-clickable, and sometimes, the dialogue options are sometime off screen (probably not optimized for my resolution ?). The dialogues are well written and the actors did a great work in my opinion but the sound is not normalized very well making it sometime an inaudible mess.Finally, I want to mention that Rufus (the hero) goofiness only worked halfway for me. He is very one dimensional and his lines became very repetitive quickly. Some other characters such as Toni, Kuvac's mayor or Lotti are just more interesting making the world of Deponia a very believable one.If you can go through all the above, then yes, I think you will like Deponia.

												Old school point and click adventure. Tries to balance between adult themes and childlike wonder. If you're a fan of point and click adventures, old school feel, completely oddball puzzle solutions, and Guybrush style protagonistsseses, this game is worth the play. But I wouldn't pay full asking price, it's length is short, and the game comes in three pieces.			"

												If you're looking at this game when it's going for 2$ get the damn game. If it's going for 20$ as usual... maybe only if you're really into point-and-click games, and have tried other ones. It's a solid enough buy nonetheless. (just my opinion)A fantastic game with a unique cast of characters and beautifully drawn sceneries. The story itself, beneath the cartoonish appearance, was actually quite intriguing and compelling at times, though admittedly hindered by tedious game pacing (a good example being spending easily 30+ minutes simply making a espresso.). Playing while reading a walkthrough is probably a good idea unless you intend to be in it for the long haul.The voice acting I particularly enjoyed; I did notice it did not always sync (particularly in the earlier parts of the game), something which bothered me- but it was nonetheless enjoyable to listen to the voiced dialogue anyways. Even for ""supporting"" characters I found the voice acting to be rather spot-on.Content-wise the game seemed rather sparse, but it was consistently enjoyable from beginning to end.			"

												Excellent, funny, point and click puzzle adventure.Great stylised graphics, good sound and voice, hilarious script. The humour fondly reminded me a little of the first Discworld game.Very simple and easy controls and game play, the silly intro teaches you all you need to know to get right into the story.Throughout, the characters and descriptions provide good (but not too obvious) clues to help you move forward and complete the various puzzles.Very well put together and nicely balanced. Good length.100% is easy enough with a little help from the community for one buggy achievement.Recommended for chimps not chumps.			"

												I got this game on a hunch (& on a discount), because I'm a fan of  ""Monkey Island"", ""Telltale""  and other point click adventures, and I wanted something new from this genre to explore.+ This game has a unique and quirky art and a flowy animation.+ The achievements are interesting and challenging to achieve, and I was able to get all of them (Droggeljug droggeljug droggeljug, droggeljug? Droggeljug!)+ The adventure lasted me about two or three days of gameplay.+/- The puzzles are doable and somewhat ""easy"" at first, but as the game progresses the puzzles do get more difficult and all around brain aching, though still enjoyable (most of the time).+/- The music is catchy but somewhat repetitive.+/- Conversations are not always helpful, but most always funny and add laughable moments and many, many references.+/- Locations vary, at some you stay for what feels like the longest time and there is a lot to explore, others are small and frustrating because there's not much to do in them and yet you get stuck in them in what feels like forever.+/- Characters are rather boring and go through NO development what so ever. Rufus stays stupid, Toni stays angry, Wenzel stays annoying &  Goal is just boobs on legs. Overall, I enjoyed this game and will recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good point click adventure, though not for the full price. It is not the best one out there, but it was a fun experience & I have played the whole trilogy.7\10			"

												Very enjoyable p&c game with good atmosphere and quite a lot of humour.You play a guy called Rufus trying to get off his boring literally trashy planet and go to the cool-people-place. On his way point&click and puzzles happen. The puzzles for progress are mostly solvable without the use of a guide, though I did have to look up a few things so I would not have to use every item in my inventory with every useable spot.All the achievements are gettable on first playthrough if you go full tryhard and read a guide all the time. If you're slightly less tryhard you may want to remember to save your game every once in a while so you don't have to go through entire chapters to get that one last thing you need. One achievement seemed only achievable through downloading a savefile (check forums), at least it wouldn't work for me the proper way and seemed a common problem.Definitely recommended, at least if purchased on sale, and I will play the other games in the series (when they go on sale).My one nuisance with this game was after doubleclicking to auto-go to next place, Rufus would take a few seconds to stroll slowly into the screen before I could doubleclick move to next place. Really annoying if you're not sure what you're supposed to do where and check every place because walkthroughs are for uncool people.Art, sound & voices all good, music is pretty cool, even Rufus thinks so as one of his idle moves is air-guitaring to the currently played music.

It reminded me of that old game on the PC back in the early 90's Space Quest, where I always had trouble with anticipating what I should do next. Turns out it was some off the wall, wacky thing. This game is full of that. The story line is what kept me playing, but in the end I was a bit disapointed. How quickly they managed to wrap up the end. I was left feeling alittle empty.

												This is a puzzle game that can easily eat quite a bit of your time. It's pretty challenging but also lots of fun. That game offers you some reasonable liberty to explore around many places and find the items you need in any order. However, that might make you feel a bit lost or stuck at first, as you don't have idea of where to start. Quite a few times I got stuck because I didn't know what I should do or who I should talk with it. But it's just a matter of trying different combinations between your items and getting the clue of how certain things work in the area. Nonetheless, the game is pretty funny and worth the time spent. If you like challenging puzzles, hop on with Rufus in this hillarious adventure.			"

I would definitely play this game again in the future and going to go play thesequel shortly after this :PNote: Some puzzles need to think extremely outside the box, like, outside the planet.			"

												really nice point'n'click! old school 2D gameplay, cool modern cartoonish graphics, good storyline, charismatic characters and funny dialogues. there you have all the ingredients to enjoy a great adventure game! on the cons side the game still has a few minor bugs and I found it out to be a little light on the dialogues, lots of repetitions and unnecessary dialogue-ending sentence coming over and over again, except that perfect!

												When I was a kid I played Monkey Island and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis so when I spotted this game on Steam and saw the fun, easy going attitude I simply couldn't resist it.You're playing the local celebrity(?) Rufus who's dreaming about reaching Elysium, the city in the sky and, being the genious you are there's nothing that's gonna stop you.The game got a nice sense of humor that I found very amusing and all the dialogues have voice actors who did a really nice job. In addition to the normal adventure clicker you also get to test your wits in some mini-puzzle games in order to progress (they're optional though so if you're not into that then there's a skip button although you won't get achievement for it).The controls were easy since they were just point and click, the mouse-pointer showing you the options available and the scroll-down inventory was a nice touch as well.As far as difficulty goes I'd say it's a little bit easier than the Monkey Island games while still hard enough to keep it interresting.Cons: Low replay value (since you already know where to go, what to do etc) and I also felt as if the game was a bit short compared to for example the Monkey Island games.Having trouble deciding weither to give it a 4 or a 3 due to the low replay value but I'm guessing that, based on the genre, nobody really expects that to be high anyway so... *drum roll*... 4 it is!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

His german voice, man, it makes me wet in places that I really shouldn't get wet. But well, I guess its still funny in the english version. Just not nearly as much. Also, the following games just get better and even better. One of my favorite game serieseses, and I'd say the third game could be my favorite Point 'n Click adventure ever. Next to Edna - The Breakout anyway. Gosh, even the title of that doesn't make as much sense as the german one. Eh... they did the best they could do I guess.			"

Great design and a fun story (that has been made into a movie with Matt Damon, ""Elysium"" with some minor adjustments), and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, selfish and destructive protagonist any game has ever had.The dialogues are hilarious and the characters too are beyond anything I've ever seen. Seriously, if you don't like the humor this game has, go kill yourself.Puzzles are extremely hard for someone who's a complete noob at such games, but even failures are commentaded in such a sarcastic way that you can keep trying the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things and you'll be entertained if it works out or blows up in your face.Did I mention that the dialogues are fun as hell?

												Ok. I never played a lot of point-and-click adventure games in my lifetime, so its possible that my judgement isnt the best, but to me, Deponia is a just a great game. It has everything i could ever want from the genre (exept a walk-speed dial, but double clicking while the mouse is over a new area does just as well) humor, adventure, and, well, just being damn pretty to look at in some parts. yes, sometimes the animation looks a tad budgeted, it never takes away from enjoying the adventure, unless your the kind of person who cares about DEM GRAPHICS (ECK!) more than the game. 10/10 would buy again.

												The artistic style is visualy appealing, and the game itself is stable, but there are a lot of tedious elements to this game that don't quite add up. The puzzles aren't exactly connect the dots, more a combination of complete trial and error and hunt and peck. The story, although there, is brought to an almost complete hult by the puzzle mechanics in the game. Usually, a game like this tries to give you enough input that you still have challenging puzzles to figure out, but keeps things flowing enough that the story progresses in a fluent manner; not so much with Deponia. The game is bogged down by constant running around, back and forth, through the same areas, over and over again--which can get old rather quickly--and re-talking to the same people, time and time again, in order to get new items and information after every completed step, that it starts to bog down. Often times, the way that puzzles are put together (if you can even call most of them puzzles) gets old. Including how you are supposed to combine inventory items, and the silly things you are supposed to do in the environment to trigger actions. These elements get in the way of what could be a really great game. I enjoyed parts of Deponia, and detested others. A hate to give this game a 'no' recommendation, because of the clear presentation and easy interface, but unless you are a hardcore fan of point and click gaming that is more hunt and peck than puzzle based, and you have lots of time on your hands, this probably isn't the title for you. Certain puzzles make no logical sense and even seem hindering, especially when other solutions seem more readily available, but are completely unavailable. Puzzle and story should be singlular and lead into one another and Deponia is lacking in this respect. If the developer can improve on these elements in future releases then they will have an outstanding product!			"

Really good at times. The puzzles arent always easy and they made sense. Pretty witty puzzles in my opinion.

It has an average plot, but the game and its mini games are extremely hard, like, its impossible to finish it without looking a bit in walkthroughs.

												Deponia is a very challenging point-and-click game about a loaner trying to escape his junk-filled home planet. As a disclaimer I should say that I haven't finished this game and probably won't come back. The fact of the matter is, the game is just too difficult for me to finish. However, other than that, I actually really like what I've seen of the game, and I don't think a high difficulty alone should be enough to not recommend it. Just know that it's only for ""hardcore"" point-and-click players.Pros:+Decent humor that made me chuckle+Nice art, if you like the cartoony style+Even though it looks like a game for kids, it's actually targeting older players (hence the difficulty)+Lots of quirky characters and dialogue+Interesting storyMixed:+/-Difficulty wise, this is the Dark Souls of point-and-click games.Cons:-I had a bug where the game was too zoomed in and didn't fit the screen. Googling this revealed I could fix this by editing a config file, but occasionally the game would auto-edit the config file back and I would have to change it again. I was playing the Linux version of the game.In a way, I'm not qualified to write this review, since I haven't finished the game and therefore haven't seen the end of the story. I also can't speak for the length of the game, although I do already have 10 hours in it, and it feels like I'm not even halfway. Bottom line, I definitely like this game, but it's hard as balls, and you are going to end up tearing your hair out. It got so bad that I ended up trying to brute force solutions by making every single humanly possible combination of inventory items. But I'm sure there are people who are either better at this type of game than me or just like the challenge. For those people, this is the game for you.			"

												An adventure game that looks like a LucasArts one but, at least in terms of the puzzles, occasionally feels like a Sierra one. The story is pretty simple: A loser wants to escape his garbage dump of a home, and leave for someplace better.  The captions have some spelling errors, the voice acting occasionally falls flat, and the puzzles both halt the game's pacing, and sometimes serve to frustrate the player. Not many times, mind you, but there are a few that will make you ask, ""Really?""So, why do I like the game? Well, I love adventure games, and Deponia is a nice throwback to the 90s halcyon days. Even the lead character, Rufus, feels like Guybrush Threepwood (Monkey Island). Actually, he feels more like a mix of Futurama's Fry and Bender, if that makes any sense.Of course, Deponia fans know what Rufus is really like: Herpes. Or, should I say, ""a cooler version of herpes.""The trilogy goes on sale fairly often, so I'd say wait for a deal and scoop up all three. Happy gaming!			"

												This is a cute point-and-click game with a Steampunk flavor.  Like a many p&c games though, the hunt for items to use on other items or locations can, by the end of the game, be more annoying than fun.  I do recommend the game though, as long as you're aware of a few things;There is dialogue.  A lot of it.  And while you can skip over it, kind of, it's not as easy to skip as in come other games.The main character walks slowly.  Seriously slowly.  I assume that was meant to be part of his laid-back character but, again, by the end of the game, it gets to be annoying.  There are cuts to different places that you can use but still, he needs to walk some places.  Slowly.I had a few technical issues. The Inventory link would disappear at random intervals and a couple times the program shut down, with no explanation as to why.  A reload always fixed it though.Ultimately, the game was fun and I enjoyed it, which is why I recommend it.  The story was engaging as well, so I'll definitely play the sequels.  All in all a nice, relaxing couple of hours.			"

												Very enjoyable p&c game with good atmosphere and quite a lot of humour.You play a guy called Rufus trying to get off his boring literally trashy planet and go to the cool-people-place. On his way point&click and puzzles happen. The puzzles for progress are mostly solvable without the use of a guide, though I did have to look up a few things so I would not have to use every item in my inventory with every useable spot.All the achievements are gettable on first playthrough if you go full tryhard and read a guide all the time. If you're slightly less tryhard you may want to remember to save your game every once in a while so you don't have to go through entire chapters to get that one last thing you need. One achievement seemed only achievable through downloading a savefile (check forums), at least it wouldn't work for me the proper way and seemed a common problem.Definitely recommended, at least if purchased on sale, and I will play the other games in the series (when they go on sale).My one nuisance with this game was after doubleclicking to auto-go to next place, Rufus would take a few seconds to stroll slowly into the screen before I could doubleclick move to next place. Really annoying if you're not sure what you're supposed to do where and check every place because walkthroughs are for uncool people.Art, sound & voices all good, music is pretty cool, even Rufus thinks so as one of his idle moves is air-guitaring to the currently played music.

												The most recent point and click games that I have played are The Walking Dead and The wolf Among Us, stuff like that. Deponia reminded me of the great games that I used to played a long time ago, games like Sam & Max and Syberia.  With games like Deponia you have to think about what you are doing, the puzzles are real and very enjoyable, some of them are insane.The game is visually stunning alongside a great soundtrack.			"

												It has good things and not so good things.Things that I liked:- Good looking game, nice art.- Great music.- Interesting story, keeps me wanting to see more although it's unfinished...- Most puzzles are fair, not too hard but also not easy.Things that annoyed me:- The protagonist is a jerk. I don't hate him, but he could shut up sometimes, he keeps talking and talking every time you click anything, not alternative short lines when you click a second time, like in every other point 'n' click game.- The story is unfinished, the ending was really disappointing. And not just for the story, but also because it was rushed and anticlimactic, even the setting was depressing and dull. I already knew there are like 5 or 6 other games, but I thought at least the first one would have a satisfactory ending.- Every new scene throws too much stuff at you, it's confusing to have to visit like 5 different rooms filled with new stuff when you don't even have a clear idea of your objective. That's bad design and could be done better, just look at other games like Broken Sword or even Monkey Island, much better in that sense.- BUGS. This wasn't a problem until I got to the end of the game, where it kept crashing and I had to click like 3 or 4 times on a item in the inventory to select it. I ended up playing in windowed mode and it seemed to solve the crashing.Despite the annoying things I recommend the game, it's fun and the story is interesting, but keep in mind it is NOT finished, so get it on sale and then decide if you want to play the other games.

												Overall score: 8/10This game definitely has been a lot of fun.  The humor in it reminds me a lot of the Space Quest point and click adventure games from the 80's/90's with its silly humor.  It is graphically beautiful for the main stage being a futuristic wasteland that you live in.  Story line is quite humorous and well written.  The only thing that occasionally became annoying is it wasn't always clear on what you are supposed to be doing next to progress forward further into the story.  Definitely requires a lot of ""out of the box"" ways of thinking for some of the puzzles and figuring out how to use the objects you pick up.  For any fanatic of the classic point and click games, this will definitely bring you right back to it!			"

												Oh my, well I have to say I fell in LOVE with this game!Another gem from Daedalic & fans of point & click adventures will adore this.Pros:: Great soundtrack, from beginning to end it's really awesome how well thought {& well made} the music was.:: During game play, general movement & such is beautifully smooth:: Stunning art style - you can truly see how much work was put in to make Deponia look beautifully bleak:: Awesome characters - if you enjoy supreme amounts of sass with a main character, you won't be dissapointedCons:: This is more of a computer issue than an actual game fault issue {I assume anyway} - but during video cutscenes the frame rate was a bit terrible.  Just felt supremely laggy.  I wish there was an option to turn down the resolution to prevent the lag & aid other folks {similar to myself} who don't have the most awesome of computer set ups.:: I found at times during gameplay, Rufus {the main character} would randomly stop walking at points when I clicked on somewhere for him to go.  Most common places this happened was in Deponia city center area & the Mayors office {tried to click on the door to let me in, took like 4 tries}Other than that, I genuinely don't have many negative things to say about the game.I beyond loved this game, so much so that I took advantage of the steam sale & bought the 2nd & 3rd parts to the Deponia saga...  Even if it wasn't on sale, i'd happily throw all my money at steam to buy the full set, at full price.Would highly recommend that you invest in the saga!			"

												I can understand many of the points presented here. The pacing definitely is a bit off, and I completely agree about Kuvaq: They gave you the impression that it’s “just one more puzzle and then we can escape” the whole time, and that is kind of frustrating.What I absolutely can’t understand is that story, dialogue, animation and humour are being criticised. Those are the strong points of the game that actually make it one of the best classical adventure games I’ve played in a long time. The cutscenes are top notch and beautiful to look at, the characters are quirky and funny and just thinking of the scenes with the post robot going crazy on bubble wrap or the doctor “transforming” into a police officer makes me chuckle.The story was also misinterpreted, I think. Rufus actually is a pretty selfish guy, and you can’t possibly describe his relationship to Goal a romance. He treats her horribly and in the beginning it’s basically pure lust that drives him. Seeing how he slowly starts (!) to change is what made his character interesting.And concerning Rufus’ father, I’d say that it’s just not true that this plotline gets dropped. Just look at the ending and the characters involved… the cliffhanger ending ties everything together.Oh well. One last thing we agree on: This was merely an overture, the real adventure is just getting started. But personally, I’m very excited about that.Bless you, Droggeljug!			"

												A fun point & click adventure... not quite up to the Lucas Arts glory days, but still fun.You play as Rufus - oxygen thief pretty much sums him up, but so much so that he ends up being likeable.  The other characters are amusing and the world is interesting - a trash heap planent, a city in the sky & hints of class warfare:  I want to know more, so guess I'm going to have to play the other 2 games in the trilogy.For the most part, the puzzles make sense.  Where they don't & other characters don't give you helpful hints, you generally have few enough inventory items & interaction options to go through the trial & error grind without having too many murderous thoughts.  A nice touch to bypass any frustrating pixel hunting - pressing the spacebar shows you all the objects you can interact with.Overall, a nice diversion.  Not going to blow you away, but still worthwhile.			"

												This game... is AMAZING!!! When i completed it I felt sad bc i had grown attached to the character known as Rufus. Sure he is kind of a horrible person, but the levels of sass from him and from the other characters make the humor that much more unexpected. The puzzles are really engaging and deviously clever and you really have to sit there and think about how to get the right outcome because it will take you a while to figure out the puzzles. One thing that i didnt like is when you have the right items but when you go to click on the object for the item, Rufus will say some phrase that just gets suuper annoying and you are left saying, ITS RIGHT THERE, WHY ARE YOU NOT USING THE ITEM IN YOUR INVENTORY ON IT?!! Some of the outcomes really blew my mind because i was like, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, THATS AWFUL!!! but, it was so so funny! I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new game to play or just a person looking to relax.			"

												If you like one one-time 2D click-and-action puzzles, Deponia is that's, what you needed. If not, well, skip this game.I think, to avoid spoilers and plot twists, that's all I can say about Deponia. All the trilogy. Wait, it's not! Be ready for jokes - they can be homerically funny, or complitly frustrating, depends of your mind position.Now, that's all, folks. I wish there's button ""passive"" in recomendation of games. So, I can't deny I favor this game a bit, so I recommend  it, but with great caution.			"

Do you by chance like the indie cartoon art style in games that reminds you of Dragon's Lair?A: er...I'm not wearing a blouse but YES!! I LOVE DRAGONS LAIR!!...wait...is this where you are going to say that this game is none of those?Q: Why then you have come to the right place!! (plebian...).  This game has it all! The epic story line with this being the begining of the trilogy, whimsical puzzles, quirky humour that is a staple of this genre, the cheesy one liners from its awkward protagonist, the strong female damsel in distress who probably would have been better off if she had never met said main protagonist...A: But...Q: But....there are a number of bugs, especially *spoiler ol'chap* when you are on top of the post office. Trust me when I say that you should make a seperate save just before you enter the post office as there is a bug that doesn't always happen but it can where you can't climb back down the ladder. being stuck up there whilst doing a DroggleJug speed run is not fun, trust me. *end spoiler*A: So is it worth having?Q: Oh my my YES! its a must have of any fan of the genre, it even works quite well with a touch screen (played on a surface pro 3) although you dont have access to the space bar hint but then hints are for the WEAK!!...thinking about it...are'nt I supposed to be the one asking questions?A: You just did ask a question.Q: Jolly good.

												Update: Finished the game and woah. I really did enjoy the game through the end! And the ending is kinda a cliff hanger which makes me want to play the 2 remaining Deponia game! A must buy game10/10 Droggeljug!I'm not really into ""point and click"" games. But this game caught my interest.I havent finished the game, but this is what i can tell you so far.The game has a good sense of humor. Dialogues are fun to listen to which will keep you going through it instead of skipping them. When it comes to characters based from my observation, they well describe the protagonist (Rufus) characteristics very well with dialogues (well because beside point and click, its a text/dialogue game). As you go deep to the world of Deponia, talking to people and do puzzles, you will learn who Rufus is and the other supportive characters, that every which one of them contributes to the story of the game. Also the Puzzles, this game have puzzles scattered through out the game which needed to be solved to advance in the story of the game. It involves logic skills, on what items to be used or combined to make other things works, and etc. But sometimes things isn't really possible and out of the boundary of logic or realism but is supported by dialogues stating the FUNNY reason why. I'm totally happy with this game and looking forward to play Chaos in Deponia and Good-bye Deponia.Another gem in the rough. P.S.

												If you like one one-time 2D click-and-action puzzles, Deponia is that's, what you needed. If not, well, skip this game.I think, to avoid spoilers and plot twists, that's all I can say about Deponia. All the trilogy. Wait, it's not! Be ready for jokes - they can be homerically funny, or complitly frustrating, depends of your mind position.Now, that's all, folks. I wish there's button ""passive"" in recomendation of games. So, I can't deny I favor this game a bit, so I recommend  it, but with great caution.			"

												Beautiful artwork and a funny story. Most of the puzzles are tricky enough to have you think for a good while about what you should do next, but I've only once gotten in the situation where I could not think of anything other than trying every combination of items and actions in the hopes that one of them advances the story.Here's a tip: if you need something that's under another character's nose and they won't let you take it, you often need to distract them for a short while so you can snatch it.

												I like this game. It's so fiendishly clever. I admit that I had to use Gameboomer to get by certain spots but I enjoyed the game none the less. I bought the whole Deponia pack for $16 on the Steam special, so that's 11 games on the backlog.PROS1. StoryThe movie, Elysium, is like Deponia. The story of a Greek paradise in the afterlife. I was half-expecting Deponia to have a location called Tartarus.2. Tricky PuzzlesSolvable but you need to be extremely observant. Sometimes, some of the puzzles are very misleading. E.g. The meditation puzzle in the crane, who would know that putting a skeleton leg in the back of the seat would suffice for a yoga pose?3. ArtI like the simple art too.CONS1. Too ToughI have never seen a game that can get you stuck in for such a long time at a single point. The game doesn't give you good in-game hints to form items. Certain items like the Embellishment are so tiny that you can't even see them.2. Useless PuzzlesLike the levers next to the cotton candy machine. It's not fun to create portions of the game that do nothing but seem to be useful.			"

												I absolutely didn't imagine this game would interest and entertain as much as it did by the time I finished it. Deponia is a point-and-click adventure game with an interesting story and very diverse and likable characters. The puzzles are not that challenging if you've been keeping up with the genre but could get confusing for beginners (you can skip some of the puzzles but you'll lose their achievements!) I really can't find Rufus (the protagonist) unlikable like so many have stated. I actually really liked his character and the awesome writing helped a lot with making me feel at home with the wacky world. The entire game is nicely paced and feels really entertaining to play. Too bad there's not a whole lot of animation for all the characters or environments even though they all look like beautiful  paintings. All in all, This first game in the series was so interesting that I immediately purchased the remaining two titles from the trilogy in order to find out what happens next in this alluring series. Anybody with interest in the adventure genre or a vibrant world filled with humor owes it to themselves to at least try this one out.			"

												This is a very hesitant recommendation. For adventure game fans, Deponia has a lot to like: it's a beautiful game, for one. The artwork, animation and overall style is incredibly well done. The interface is also intuitive, utilizing the mouse wheel to quickly show and hide the inventory, and keeping interaction choices to either a left or right click (as opposed to early SCUMM games that would give you a load of often pointless ways with which to interact with objects).The puzzles are decent, although they'll occasionally have you doing things that don't make complete sense (you'll sometimes feel like you're not trying to solve a particular puzzle as much as just trying to figure out a hazy order of operations). To be fair though, the sometimes ambiguous nature of the puzzles may have been in part due to my not listening to all the dialogue options, which brings me to my main criticism of the game: the writing. Most of the characters are either irritating or generally unlikable, with a few who're downright obnoxious. The main character, Rufus, being the chief offender. I get that he's supposed to be an anti-hero who (presumably) finds his way over the course of the trilogy. However, after spending a few hours with him in the first game, I'm unsure I want to put myself through having to listen to his irritating whining and dopey commentary in the remaining two. It got to a point near the end of the game where I wanted to skip through every line of dialogue because I couldn't be bothered to listen to his idiotic responses. I sincerely hope he becomes more likable in the remaining two games.In conclusion, if you're a huge fan of adventure games, I'd say give Deponia a shot. If you're just mildly curious about the genre, give it a pass.			"

												A seriously entertaining point-and-click adventure game that is quite reminiscent of the Monkey Island series. Deponia features brilliant art direction, solid voice acting, and awesome soundtrack (Huzzah!). On the downside, like stated by many, the game is ridiculously short – I think it took like 5 hours in my first playthrough (apparently, this is the first installation of a trilogy, so fingers crossed for the next games). Even though the puzzles (which you can skip) are mostly fun, sometimes it gets quite tricky to find the right combination of items when you have to improvise – there were couple of instances where I gave up logic and instead tried every possible combination with the interactive objects. And when I finally figured them out, I was like “Seriously? Really?” But such instances were admittedly rare and definitely not the norm. On a somewhat surprising note, when I checked the texture compression option (which enables real-time compression), I started noticing a slight mouse lag and longer black screens during area transitions. Although it says that enabling that feature demands “high processing power”,  it’s funny to have a point-and-click game lag on a machine that runs the likes of the Witcher 2 or Crysis 3 with high/ultra settings (then again, it could be Windows 8.1 acting up as usual). Overall, highly recommended.			"

												A humorous 2D point & click adventure in which you play as Rufus, an inhabitant of the low-tech, junkyard city of Deponia who dreams of escaping to the advanced city of Elysium in the sky.  Early on an Elysian girl falls to Deponia and he sees this as his opportunity.  The game suffers from a slow start, but the story picks up later with some suspense & a satisfying ending. Progression is based on multi-screen environments and an inventory system, including combining/McGyvering items. It's a mix of common sense, critical thinking and trial and error. There is occasional frustration with sequence or dialogue, but you can click for audio commentary/hints on most things and press a key to see all the hotspots on screen.Beautiful, hand drawn art at 1080p with a minimalist interface that never feels cumbersome or gets in the way of the art, has Steam achievements and is fully voiced.

												I recommend playing this game to everyone who has fun with riddles. Not only are these riddle (in my opinion) made in a perfect balance between solvable and hard, but the whole story is filled with jokes and hilarious dialogues. Compared to similar games, such as 'Edna: the breakout', this one has got slightly better graphics, but about the same gameplay: you can look at objects, pick them up, combine them etc. -sometimes all of these options are possible, sometimes they are not (yet). It still took me some time to realize that you do not have to watch Rufus loaf around the scene and can just double click to an exit to skip the walking.Gameplay hints or anything like that would have been very nice, but after a while, every ADHD-player figures it out by wildly clicking everywhere, so it's only a small drawback.Have lots of fun playing the game (and its sequels!)

												""Deponia"" is a pretty good point-and-click game.  The art work is very good, the humor tongue-in-cheek, and the voice-acting good.  Best of all, the puzzles are neither too hard (mostly - there were a few I needed guides for) nor too easy.  My only real gripe with the game is the protagonist, Rufus:  he's a jerk of the first order.  If there were more character growth in him as the game progressed, I'd have been happier.  But, it's just sort of irritating to have him constantly do really wrong things at every turn.  As for the value of the game, I spent about 17.5 hours on it (100% Achievements).  So, the current list price (about $20) might be considered a tad high.  If you find it on sale, I'd say go for it.			"

												The main character is an unlovable piece of work. I get irritated just launching the game and looking at him, and so I can't find the motivation to finish the game. Perhaps he turns out to be some hero sort, but his current whiny, pompous self makes me feel so annoyed I can't ever see him being one short of being an ""accidental hero"" (at this point I hate him so much that that thought also annoys me). He is unsympathisable.In addition, I enjoy point-and-click puzzles when the puzzles are canon to the story and make sense (e.g. find the key, the key is with the guard, find a way to distract the guard). Puzzles in Deponia are more of those logic-puzzle based sort – whole lot of pattern recognition, switch flipping, make all the dots on the board green from red sort, which means sometimes the object you need isn't logically related to the task. It is overwhelmingly repetitive and feels pointless.If you're looking for a good adventure point-and-click, try Chains of Satinav instead, from the same developers. Superb artwork, top-notch voice acting, enthralling storytelling and most importantly puzzles that are innovative and logical to the storyline.			"

												If you were stuck on a planet filled with nothing but junk and surrounded by idiots you’d want to escape right? Well if so then this is the game for you.Help poor Rufus make his dream a reality and escape the junk ridden world of Deponia and make it all the way to the lofty heights of Elysium a floating city high above. And along the way meet a few new friends and enemies to boot. The story is pretty good and full of jokes and gags. I loved the writing and thought it was very well done. The characters are great too, each adding to the overall zaniness. Deponia is a point a click game and as such the gameplay is pretty standard for the genre. The puzzles are not overly challenging but you may well be stumped a few times on the journey but each and every time you figure it out you feel pretty darn good. Clicking on everything that seems interesting to find all the needed objects and combining items together to overcome every obstacle can be very satisfying.  The game looks great; the art style is very unique and cartoony. Every set piece, character and item all fits nicely into the decaying world in which the game takes place. I loved exploring people’s homes and seeing what was used to build such wacky places. The game runs great, but as mentioned it’s a cartoon so there isn’t much the computer needs to generate. The game sounds great too; the music is fun and catchy. The sound effects are pretty comical and fit well in the title and every character is very well acted. I thought they all worked well together.Although not ground breaking or particularly long it is a thoroughly enjoyable title from start to finish. I had great fun with it. At full price it’s a little steep but that being said if you like point and click or love the way the game looks or the comedy then go ahead and dive in. For the rest of us I’d wait for a sale, but it’s worth a look and will give you a few laughs.Have fun ^_^			"

												I'm not a fan of point-and-click adventures and i'm not quite good at them, honestly, but i liked the game's art and aesthetics and the fact that it was fully translated to my native language, so i bought it.Playing the first chapter i was enjoing the game so much, then i found out by myself what people were talking about in their reviews: there's not a clear logic behind puzzles (why should i use a parrot with an emergency phone after i gave it coffee?) and i had to use several hints till i decided to give up.Translations are good and voice acting too: anyhow i found it hard to follow Rufus' story where everyone is complaining about the main character even though he may be a complete a-hole; in addition to that, i wouldn't say humor is a merit at all, on the contrary i found dialogs quite frustrating. Goodby Deponia.EDIT: people are complaining that some achievements won't unlock and that's true. I have finished the game but its achievement didn't trigger.			"

Great artstyle, great puzzles, great voice acting, great setting. Truely, a fantastic Point 'N' Click.However, although the puzzles padded out the game, the plot didn't catch up. Not too much happens. Well...NPCs give bits of lore, but the dialogue is unfortunately just repetetive banter with the protagonist. Although well written/translated, hearing the NPCs scold or embarrass the self-absorbed protagonist is just dull.The mosaic minigame was bugged and impossible to complete. Luckily, there was a skip option. Which, to be honest, makes all of the (few) minigames fruitless.If you've read all the above, it may seem like I am bashing the game. I'm not. Deponia, and its sequels, are a must-have for any patient gamer. And even Rufus manages to grow on you. "

												Alot of the time the combinations of items and what to do where feels more like trial and error than being nifty and smart. Also, for me, the humor is not really entertaining and is pretty immature. This is only a personal preference of course but much of the story is based around the main character's immature goofiness.			"

Perhaps most importantly, though, the puzzles are expertly crafted--they're not only solveable, but wonderfully absurd.  Deponia oozes charm.  It's an absolute winner.			"

												Know what you are getting into.I bought this game at a large discount as part of a bundle of similar games by the same people.I have no doubt that this game is well-made - the characters are quirky, the dialogue is (somewhat) witty, and the story is, well... odd - which is part of what interested me in it.However, it is, at times, slow and frustrating. To being with, the path forward required a little thinking (try this, try that, combine some items to see what they do). Now, however, I'm at the point where I am literally talking to every character and exploring every room to see if I have missed something.While I enjoyed this game for a while, overall I found the puzzles obtuse. If that's the kind of thing you like, then great! But if you are more interested in the characters or the story, then I would suggest you try something else.Every time I play this game, I make a *little* more progress. I find an item combination that unlocks another line of dialogue - the next step in the puzzle. But it takes 10 to 20 minutes or random trial and error, and for me that's just not fun.Of course, the other option is to look up solutions online... but if that's the approach I was looking for I would have just bought a visual novel instead. Perhaps the game is simply more suited to experienced puzzle-gamers?Overall: 7/10Much of the game is great. However, some of the puzzles are very non-intuitive, and until you figure them out, the story cannot progress. Buy this only if you are willing to be patient and persistent.			"

Press Spacebar or Middle-Click to Show Item Hotspots!I was pixel-hunting for hours until I found this out accidentally. The screen tips actually mention this, but they load and flash too fast.Good Stuff- One of the best looking point-and-click adventure games out there.- Decent story, although nothing mind-blowing.- Some really funny moments and characters.Bad Stuff- A few puzzles  aren't really intuitive and I only managed to solve them via trial and error.- Sometimes when trying one item with others, Rufus makes a long  comment everytime it fails.- For some reason enabling HD Video for the cutscenes caused my game to crash during the cutscenes. I had to disable them.Anyway I think the good stuff outweighs the bad, and I enjoyed the game overall.			"

												When i played this game for the first time I lost interest quickly. A while back I decided to give it another shot, but it was just as boring as i remembered it.I see a lot of comments about the quality of humor this game has to offer. Personally i don't get it; the jokes are predictable, drawn out, and cheesy. The voice acting's pretty good, but it doesn't compensate for the poor dialogue.The puzzles didn't make any sense to me. Hardly any clues are given for the solutions, which are abstract enough to require them. Usually it requires digging through every piece of (bad) dialogue of each character. Thank god for steam guides.I guess I'm in the minority of negative review, but that's exactly why i felt i had to write one. Be warned that this game isn't fun for everyone			"

												Played through the opening thus far, and I had to go check out some other reviews of this and the later games.  I needed to know if things were going to get better.  The things that had attracted me to the purchase hadn't changed; beautiful art, great voicework, that old adventure touch.  But on playing the game, I found that, well, the protaganist is completely unlikable.He's essentially a sociopath, and much of the humor is trying to play off of that.  From relentless abuse (from verbal to theft) of his Ex-Girlfriend to just blowing some people's houses up so you can take their place in a line, the Protaganist treats everything with egomanical contempt.  You're genuinely meant to find this behavior funny, but this game just doesn't work without something redeeming to latch onto.  At the end of the day, you're assisting a throughly unlikable person do generally unpleasent things, for 'humor'.  As to those reviews, I was hoping to find that he'd build towards that epifany moment and start to show some undercurrent of a likable person.  The counterpoint that makes putting up the rest funny, or at least bearable.Unfortuantly, that doesn't ever seem to happen.  Rather, the game and particularly its sequals simply ramp up the acrimony.  Sale purchase so I can't complain too harshly, but this is one of the few games I've ever ran across that I genuinely regret purchasing.			"

Insane Adventure Game Logic: now with weird European humor!The characters and setting are interesting enough that I'll probably watch a playthrough video, but having to check a walkthrough every few minutes to figure out what insane thing you have to do gets old FAST.For example, before you're allowed to leave the first area, Rufus has to collect four items to pack into his suitcase. Bringing a clean pair of socks seems easy - I found a blue and a yellow sock, but Rufus wanted a matching pair. Okay... Rufus says they're dirty, so let's try washing them in boiling water, which results in the two socks coming out as ONE green sock. I had to check a walkthrough to find out that there's another green sock completely hidden under Rufus' pillow... did I mention that the game is set on a garbage planet, but the few items that you can actually interact with aren't highlighted? (edit: apparently there's a button you can press to highlight items you can interact with... quality UI design!)One of the other four items you need to pack is Rufus' toothbrush, which comes alive and runs and hides because of how filthy Rufus' teeth have been on the rare times he's brushed them. Okay, I can live with the idea of a sentient toothbrush, heck as a kid I even used to watch a cartoon with that exact premise. So how would you think that an adventure game would have you lure out an abused toothbrush? Maybe by tempting it with nice teeth to brush, such as by somehow convincing another character (with superior dental hygiene) to smile near the toothbrush? Nope, you catch it with a mousetrap... with a pea for bait. What?! And you find that mousetrap in a ""closet"" which just looks like part of the wall (did I mention how visually messy the garbage planet setting is?). The game implies that you need something to pry the closet door open, and the required tool turns out to be a TOILET PLUNGER.I think that was when I gave up on the game.			"

												I thought I would like this game because it had good reviews and was compared to the Monkey Island series. Instead we have a game that's misogynist, transphobic and obtuse with a main character so unlikeable that I just gave up on the game. I didn't care about the fact that it had hard puzzles or ones that made no sense. I was expecting that, but Rufus is such a♥♥♥♥♥♥that I'm sad I even spent two bucks on this game. You can tell that they put a lot of work into it. I love the art in the game, I like the way that it looks and it sounds (voice acting aside), but... I just can't get past how juvenile and bigoted the humour is. Maybe that's the point. Maybe it's trying to be ironic in the way of South Park by being absolutely horrible for comedic effect and to draw attention to how stupid these tropes/stereotypes/etc sound. But the problem with Deponia trying to do that? It's not funny. The jokes fall flat, the dialogue gets painful to listen to and I have never wished so much that there was a big cliff that I could just throw Rufus off over and over again.			"

												Disclaimer: This is just for people who don't play Adventure games and are trying to get into them.I don't think this one will help you. It didn't help me. I don't usually play adventure games but when I do ... I don't.I was really looking forward to Deponia. Because of the graphic style and because of the humor. And it was fun at first.BUT: Then came the Adventuring part. Taking everything you see, trying to combine it and somehow figure out how to use something on something else. At first I've tried to figure everything by myself. Later I've started to look at the guide, here and there. And after a while I've found myself looking at it more or less constantly. Those things just don't make any sense to me. I don't know why would I knock out a parrot with laughing gas and I don't know what I would do with him afterwards.I don't doubt that Deponia is a great game. For people who like adventure games. But if you don't like adventure games, Deponia isn't for you despite how gorgeous it looks, how funny it can be, and how great the voice acting is.I'm really sad that I couldn't enjoy it. But I won't play game by reading a guide.			"

												While the art is cool, and the world concept is a fun one, the gross sexism in this game made it completely horrible to play.  Female characters are only there as a joke or a quest, and the writing continually enforces this attitude.   Hell, the main female character is CALLED Goal.  *eyeroll*  And the driving force for Rufus is to win her.   As well as this, Rufus constantly tells us that cleaning is a woman's role (specifically his ex Toni) and that ""girly things"" are beneath  him.  There's also a trans woman played as a joke (""ha ha look at the big man in a dress""  Yeah, no, not actually funny.)Clearly this is all meant to be funny, and to endear Rufus to us as a ""charming rogue"".  A clue, it doesn't, he isn't.  He's a creeper, and the way he acts towards the unconcious/brain damaged Goal is creepy, gross, bordering on rapey.  His friend Wendel is also nasty.    The whole game has a greasy vibe.  It's a real shame, because technically it's not a bad game.  The movement is a bit slow and clunky, and it can be frustrating to get from one point to another,  but otherwise it does okay.  I would have been interested to play similar games if the whole thing didn't leave me feeling like I needed a shower.  As it is, don't bother.  Spend your money on a game that gives its female characters some agency, and its male characters some redeeming character traits.So very glad I got this on sale, not worth it.			"

												Deponia is a point-and-click adventure reminiscent of the infamous Monkey Island series. The game is part of a trilogy (Deponia -> Chaos On Deponia -> Goodbye Deponia). You play Rufus, the archetypical anti-hero whose bad jokes are only matched by his failed attempts to leave his junk covered planet Deponia. While the story unfolds you will be busy searching that single missing item to progress, creating thought provoking item combinations and solving mind boggling puzzles. All-in-all an entertaining game, but certainly not up to par with Monkey Island. Good enough to start playing Chaos On Deponia. :)Score: 7/10Pro:+ nice cartoonish look & feel+ entertaining story+ decent voice acting+ absurd humourContra:- bad humour- clicking feels so 1990... ;)			"

												Awesome point'n'click adventure looking to be compared to the old 2D classics such as the Monkey Island series (1-3) and the Lucas Arts ones. Doesn't even hide their influence, which is good, for the puzzles are good, the humor involved is hilarious (well... if you're not very sensitive) and the graphics... Oh, the graphics! Beautiful hand drawn backgrounds, fitting colours and the funky animation just takes me back 20 years, when these games were thriving. Also the songs are fantastic.Aside from a couple bugs (which have been all but fixed) I recommend it 100 %. If you like adventure games, you won't be disappointed. Parts 2 and 3 (Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia) follow in it's steps too.			"

												BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: IF YOU DOUBLE CLICK ON THE EXITS, YOU WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT SCREEN IMMEDIATELY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR RUFUS TO WALK ALL THE WAY!Hopefully this will get a chance to help people, I had the hardest time watching Rufus all the way across the center of the town.I think this is another great piece of work from Daedalic Entertainment. Wonderful artwork and music as always. Difficult puzzles but nothing out of the unexpected if you have played any games from Daedalic.At the beginning, the plot may seem a bit confusing since the setting does not get explained further on into the story. It's kind of hard to grasp the concept of Deponia and Elysium until later of the story. The first half of the game may seem a bit boring but the story is amazing if you could hold onto it until the very end.What I do find interesting is that the protagonist is not your usual all-mighty or pure-hearted wonderful person. Rufus is an a-hole that does not have a job and nor does he appreciate his ex's help. Unfortunately the story does not tell into too much of Rufus past and explain why he may have became like that. Hopefully I will have time to play Chaos in Deponia very soon to find out more.			"

												BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: IF YOU DOUBLE CLICK ON THE EXITS, YOU WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT SCREEN IMMEDIATELY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR RUFUS TO WALK ALL THE WAY!Hopefully this will get a chance to help people, I had the hardest time watching Rufus all the way across the center of the town.I think this is another great piece of work from Daedalic Entertainment. Wonderful artwork and music as always. Difficult puzzles but nothing out of the unexpected if you have played any games from Daedalic.At the beginning, the plot may seem a bit confusing since the setting does not get explained further on into the story. It's kind of hard to grasp the concept of Deponia and Elysium until later of the story. The first half of the game may seem a bit boring but the story is amazing if you could hold onto it until the very end.What I do find interesting is that the protagonist is not your usual all-mighty or pure-hearted wonderful person. Rufus is an a-hole that does not have a job and nor does he appreciate his ex's help. Unfortunately the story does not tell into too much of Rufus past and explain why he may have became like that. Hopefully I will have time to play Chaos in Deponia very soon to find out more.			"

												Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, and Goodbye Deponia are point and click adventure games of old with a set of truly beautiful scenes and music.  The game and its series aims for classless humor and heavy amounts of schadenfreude.   If you're sensitive to any civil rights, human rights, animal rights, rights for the infirm, and rights of the wrongly convicted, you're likely to get offended at some point in this series.  You play as Rufus, a perpetual underdog that doesn't really seem to grasp that he's the underdog.  While he can be hard to relate to at times, especially in his moments of abscent minded cruelty, he has his good moments.   The female lead character is cheekedly called 'Goal,' which an obvious jab at other games where the female lead characters are often 'finish lines' rather than anything meaningful.  She stays true to her name throughout a fair bit of the first game, but becomes a living character towards the end of the first, and throughout the second and third games.Deponia itself is a giant junkyard underneath a utopia-like society, not unlike worlds of Astroboy, and Battle Angel Alita, and Rufus is absolutely a man of his world.  The series is a long stream of ""connect the odds and ends to make things work"" like many other games in the genre, and the theme of the game fits perfectly in the genre.Ultimately, it's a fun ride.  The story and the humor, much like the ""water"" in Deponia, might leave a strange taste in your mouth, but its worth investing your time in.			"

												Deponia is a strong game in terms of point and click mechanics. It's that sweet spot between when puzzles are obvious and impossibly mind numbingly hard. But Deponia is a game I can recommend to certain people but not a game I can recommend to everyone. The puzzles aren't so clever that you would be playing the game for them. It's driven by its story which is dominated by European style humour. Every review I've seen for it has been bimodal from, ""Hilarious game"" to ""bad joke after bad joke"". It's a game that really should have a demo so that people can see whether the story has a draw for them. Since that doesn't really exist, I'd recommend check out a part 1 walkthrough of some sort since its price is pretty steep. I'd also recommend waiting for the whole pack of Deponia's to go on sale because it does end with a cliffhanger and if you enjoy it, you're going to want to follow it through.			"

												This game was a lot of fun.  I played this with my kids and we had a blast.  It was humourous (a little tacky at times) and reminded me of earlier games in this genre.  Most of the time it was clear what we needed to do to progress, but in some cases the puzzles are a bit obscure (this seemed to occur more in the sequels in this series).The main character, Rufus is an arrogant resident of Deponia trying to leave for a better life.  Although it can be sometimes hard to truly cheer on this idiot, the quirkiness of the story and the game's puzzles keep you interested just to see what kind of trouble this guy is going to get into next.

												No. 1 Priority:  Before you complete the game, save a version before you reach the end.  It will make getting the DROGGELJUG achievement a lot easier. Once you select the Droggeljug option, EVERYTHING changes to the word DROGGELJUG -- the words, the questions, the entire conversation.  This becomes a problem when you need to select appropriate responses to certain questions.  I'm still working on this and to be honest, it makes me dislike the game considerably.  It's an OK game, but it has a few glitches, but you can play it.  Preferably with a guide to make it pass more quickly.Don't know if I would recommend it or not.

Definetely recommended - playthrough took me about 8 hours.  I only used a guide once or twice to find a missing item or missing solution.Edit:  I also want to confirm that I also used an achievement guide - purely because I dont want to play adventure games twice and I hate missable achievements.

One of the better point and click adventures to come out in a while and absolutely should not by missed by fans of the genre.			"

Please don't buy it if you're at all concerned about what kind of media you spend your time on. The protagonist of this game is horrible. The puzzle logic is horrible. The plot is flat. The worst part of this all is that the game is concious of all of the above but either chooses to ignore it, or critiques it in such a way that it's not a critique anymore but a mockery. Theft, absurd sexism, transphobia, animal abuse, abuse of persons and tools, ignorance, shallow remarks and little to no actual substance or even sparks of intelligence are present, all wrapped in a neat, attractive bundle of vague definition of what the devs concidered ""fun"". Non of this is particularly visual (except animal abuse), but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for quite a while. It's hard to believe that someone could talk proudly about this game as their work. After stong references to Machinarium I am nothing but disappointed. This kind of animation, voice acting and soundtrack deserved better imho.			"

												The game play wasn't horrible, the comments were a bit witty, but I just can't get into a game where the main character is not just an idoit, but also a jerk. He is self aborbed, self centered, and doesn't even have the redeeming quality of being intellegent. He is rude for the simple sake of rudeness. On top of that the puzzles are more tedious then puzzling. If you want to play something just to kill time, it will work, but I would still just choose something else.			"

												A much better visual than Primordia, the first thought that sprung in my mind when I first played the game. Excuse me but I need to save my eyes from getting more damage from broken visuals. Graphic looks like to be a hand drawn - my preference really. Sometimes comical style game is alot better than advanced looking AAAs.Game is a point and click genre - one of my favorite type to do casually in between dota matches or doing serious AAA titles like jumpscare Dead Space series. Game's full with satirical humor that brings lots of facepalm moment. It's not bad, though, in fact I quite enjoy the story and the humor. Being a point and click, gameplay isn't that complicated. Although yes, this is more expansive than The Walking Dead - despite some elements are the same - but the 'puzzles' are a bit more tedious and ridiculous (helloooooooooo why do I have to capture a hiding fork????). And somewhat frustrating if you're really clueless on what to do. But eh, again, it's pretty much fine since we have walkthrough or videos in all around internet. No big deal.Overall, to my surprise and initial negative view on the game, this is a pretty much ok title. Too bad this isn't a type that allows you to sit back and enjoy with the controller - the game's much easier to play with MK/B than a gamepad.			"

												The game is ___very___ offensive.  Saying that the protagonist is a jerk would be a serious ___understatement___.  The entire game and everything therein revolves around the idea that women should be treated as sex object no better than perosnal property: it's disgusting! It's degrading to __both__ men and women.  Men are not _necessarily_ slobs or jerks, and women do _not_ exist just so that men can dehumanize, exploit, abuse, or treat them like objects existing only to provide labor/pleasure for men.  I read a few blogs, some of which were written by feminists, and (while I do not condone the idea of either sex being superior in anyway to the other) I heartily and thoroughly agree with what I read.

Please don't buy it if you're at all concerned about what kind of media you spend your time on. The protagonist of this game is horrible. The puzzle logic is horrible. The plot is flat. The worst part of this all is that the game is concious of all of the above but either chooses to ignore it, or critiques it in such a way that it's not a critique anymore but a mockery. Theft, absurd sexism, transphobia, animal abuse, abuse of persons and tools, ignorance, shallow remarks and little to no actual substance or even sparks of intelligence are present, all wrapped in a neat, attractive bundle of vague definition of what the devs concidered ""fun"". Non of this is particularly visual (except animal abuse), but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for quite a while. It's hard to believe that someone could talk proudly about this game as their work. After stong references to Machinarium I am nothing but disappointed. This kind of animation, voice acting and soundtrack deserved better imho.			"

												This is a fun adventure. You play Rufus who just want to get to Elysium and off Deponia, a planet full of dump and waste. The planet is thought to be uninhabited and ought to be destroyed by the Organon. But as it happens one of your tries to escape the planet had actually succeed in landing on an Organon cruiser. You and accidentally also the girl Goal from Elysium are dropped again on the planet’s surface. Your task is to a) save Goal, b) get Goal to Elysium to report that there is still life on Doponia and c) get yourself off the planet.This can’t be hard, could it? Well it is. Since Rufus, your character, is a blighter, boaster, a loafer, which always exaggerated the opinion of himself. He can’t do nothing good and his tries to get off the planet as well as his inventions usually end up in total catastrophes. This is stuff for a lot of funny conversations and hilarious dialogues. The (german) voice acting is brilliant.The planet, its people and also Rufus do entertain and are not without sympathy. The riddles are sometimes quite hard to solve and I did some by pure trial & error (which is no good).Controlling the game is clever made, the scenarios are nice drawn and there is no room for a technical reproach.8/10.

												What is this game? It's a Point & Click. That's all there is to it.The beauty of the game is the art style and the comedy that had me laughing loads despite it being cheesy, and oh boy, Rufus! Rufus! What a guy! He had me laughing loads at his cheesy remarks and jokes. He's become on of my favourite characters from a game already. ""They call him Rufus! Ruuuufus!""The music isn't anything majorly special but there are a few songs I enjoyed like the one that usually plays all the time with the mechanical noises etc. The game can be a bit difficult without a guide or anything though.The comedy in this game is brilliant.

												Difficult to find the words to express how this game is unsatisfying. It pretends to be brilliant as a monkey island, but is flat, with a few weak jokes and the puzzles are totally non-sense. Really a product which appears appealing, clever and exciting, but is a fraud. I could not expect such a bad game. Even the soundtrack is annoying. So, in a nutshell, my feedback is: WESTED MONEY! "

												Although I can't say I'm a fan of point and click, I can still appreciate the effort and artistry that went into this project.  It's good for those who enjoy the genre but for people expanding their library I wouldn't recommend it unless it's on sale.  Story rich and nice designs for art/sound but feels like a childrens game at times due to the simplistic nature and cartoony vibes.  Again if you like point and click then you will probably enjoy this but just not my cup of tea.			"

												A much better visual than Primordia, the first thought that sprung in my mind when I first played the game. Excuse me but I need to save my eyes from getting more damage from broken visuals. Graphic looks like to be a hand drawn - my preference really. Sometimes comical style game is alot better than advanced looking AAAs.Game is a point and click genre - one of my favorite type to do casually in between dota matches or doing serious AAA titles like jumpscare Dead Space series. Game's full with satirical humor that brings lots of facepalm moment. It's not bad, though, in fact I quite enjoy the story and the humor. Being a point and click, gameplay isn't that complicated. Although yes, this is more expansive than The Walking Dead - despite some elements are the same - but the 'puzzles' are a bit more tedious and ridiculous (helloooooooooo why do I have to capture a hiding fork????). And somewhat frustrating if you're really clueless on what to do. But eh, again, it's pretty much fine since we have walkthrough or videos in all around internet. No big deal.Overall, to my surprise and initial negative view on the game, this is a pretty much ok title. Too bad this isn't a type that allows you to sit back and enjoy with the controller - the game's much easier to play with MK/B than a gamepad.			"

												The music in this game is really well done, and the puzzles are generally funny and well thought out. My biggest issue with the entire series is the underlying racism and sexism that it presents throughout the three Deponia games. It is fairly disturbing encountering a puzzle where you need to sell the only black character in the series into slavery, because she could best mimic an organ grinder's monkey, for instance. More disturbing is that the designers saw this as the ""out of the box, yet still obvious solution"". Similarly, the whole mechanic in the second game where the female protagonist's personality is split into its three core components of ""sporty"" ""baby"" and ""stuck up"" is emblematic of the kinds of criticisms for the endemic sexism that the gaming community has been receiving in the media of late.

												I tend to like these types of games, and usually can get an easy recommendation from me.  Deponia has some decent humor to it, but will constantly do little things to annoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.  Many of the puzzles just simply don't make sense.  It may seem completely obvious that doing something you have in mind should work, but the writers would rather you do it their way, which makes less sense.  This is a minor flaw, though.  The bigger flaw is that the game is downright buggy.  If you skim through the discussion forums you'll see a lot of problems the game has, and the devs only solution is to download a new save file.  Even with known issues, the game doesn't seem to get patched, and you're simply stuck with downloading a different save file, which could throw your own game out of sequence.  I usually want to complete games like this, but this has made me lose my motivation to finish it, even as I have the sequels in my library waiting to be played, but will now likely never be installed.

												As fan of adventure games, and one who has grown up on Monkey Island series and later games like Full throttle and Sanitarium, I was excited about playing this game... until 5 minutes in, when I got stuck first time. Ok, I google-it, found solution and continue on... for next 5 min, until I got stuck AGAIN! And after looking up on google for solution once more, I figured out system how this game works; enter area, play pixel hunting to find all clickable items so that you can collect them, then try out all items from inventory on all noncollectable items in that room, and if that doesn't work, then try to combine all items in your inventory one with another till you get new item. When you craft new item, try him out with everything in room, and then with everything in your inventory (because sometimes you have to combine more items to get something useful)... And if after all of that, you didn't do anything that will progress story further on, go to next area and repeat procedure. And you have to do all of that due to twisted and borderline insane logic behind all puzzles in this game, so there is very little things that will be logical at first (or ever).So, does that sound like fun? For me it didn't... So I grabbed first walk-trough I found online, and finished game with it, and that makes me sad because characters (except main character), visuals, humor, animation and atmosphere are wonderful... Shame.And I really can't say that I liked main character in this game (he is borderline sociopath); maybe they intended to do that, but It just make me dislike him in general, and If I don't like main character, I tend to like game less (this is personal preference, so take that that in consideration). And there are some questionable moral agendas in this game regarding females....Overall, I don't recommend this game, due to insane puzzles that barely make any sense, and they reduce game to tedious clicking and trying out everything on everything until you make something new.Score: 4/10			"

												I'll fully admit I bought this for the art style. In that regard, Deponia is exactly what it advertises. The chunky, eccentric designs of characters and backgrounds really brings this game to life.And that's where the praise ends.The big issue here is the writing, and it commits what is, to me, the greatest sin. It's trying to be funny. The jokes come at you on a regular basis. But I did not laugh once in my entire playthrough. Perhaps it's because of the mean nature of much of the humor, or it's a style that just doesn't carry over in translation, but most of the time the characters just seemed unlikable and mean-spirited.My thought is that if you don't get laughs, stop it. Just stop it. Tell a story, be earnest in your delivery, drop all the affected attempts at hilarity. Maybe then they could have spent more time on the puzzles, which range from arbitrary to insulting.There's a puzzle where you literally have to make an association between the house a person lives in and what their hat is, because three people all have headgear that looks like their occupation. It's that sort of backwards engineered idiot puzzle that makes people give up on adventure games. It has to be logical, sensible but not obvious, or the player will just give up.This is the sort of series I'd rather view through one of those ""Let's Play"" Youtube series, but preferrably with the sound off.

												I gave this game a shot because it was only 2 dollars and I figured I could get a feel for the companies games. I only played it for a little over an hour and I have to say I did not like this game at all and doubt I'll ever play it again. The game has good humor and nice graphics but the puzzles are completely illogical most of the time and the protagonist is annoying as hell. All I thought was why would they make such an unlikeable person the main character? Despite all of this I could have still managed to play it if it wasnt for the repetition. Try something to solve the puzzle - main character says 3 lines of dialogue... over and over and over and over again. So annoying that it was what finally made me quit.			"

												My oh my... I mean, this game does have neat visuals. And sometimes it is funny. The puzzles are moderate in obscurity and difficulty.On the other hand the main character (Rufus) is the most obnoxious, arrogant, sexist and stubborn main character I have ever seen. It was very hard playing as him and hear him make simple, often unfunny and unnecessary comments. And the way he talks about women... He despises the first one even though she (god knows why) literally provides the roof above his head, and the other one he treats as if she were his property. Besides that, the game is riddled with dirty humour and a story that really makes no sense and gives no explanation.I would have loved it if as the game progressed, Rufus evolved and became humbler and reasonable. But no. And thus, I would not recommend, unless you really only care about the puzzles or do not care about depth of character.			"

												The protagonist will steal everything he sees, flood his friend's house, poison his former girlfriend with dart(who is supporting him economically), frame a mayor, and abuse animals. Also, the post office of this town makes cats work by literally shocking them with electricity. Yes, really.All these small details might be funny to some people, but it was very bizarre to me, even unpleasant. Not only Rufus, the protagonist(I would never use a word 'hero' on this guy), but the atmosphere of this game also doesn't give a shxt about all these madness he's making everywhere, as if it's just some kind of a joke.To me, it was a very ill-humored joke. Giving it red for that reason.p.s.Surprisingly, there's a good reason for his attitude, which is revealed at Deponia 3. Well, it's a review for Deponia 1 though. If you are going to play all Deponia titles, ignore this review. If you are not, beware that the main charater might let you down.			"

												I've seen what this game has to offer, though not on Steam. Trust me: Deponia is the Adam Sandler of adventure games. Sometimes, it creeps up to being the Will Farrell of adventure games. More often, it's somewhere in the middle, like Ben Stiller. At no point is it really all that fun for any length of time. Graphics aren't everything, but they're everything to Deponia.  Once you get past the screenshots, there are no redeeming qualities to the game. Generally, Deponia involves a clunky, unattractive interface, stupid amounts of not-just-difficult-but-illogical puzzles, a plot that creeps forward like molasses in January, an unattractive protragonist and an unfunny script. Go play a fun adventure game, like Broken Age, or Full Throttle, or the Monkey Island games. Stay away from Deponia. At best, buy it and watch a Let's Play.			"

												I thought that most of the puzzles didn't make sense and it wasn't very memorable (some people may like this game but I didn't)edit: My first bit of advice if you want this game is to wait for a sale (they happen at least every other month for about 75-90% off)After playing many point a click games I've come to the conclusion that I usually like the premise of the idea of point and click more than the execution of them IE I haven't fully enjoyed most of the point and click games I've played as of late because so many times the way things interact with each other I think doesnt' use common sensethe humor was nice, visually I would say its ok with decent art in some areas and bad art many times featuring your items and making it even harder to think that an item would apply to a puzzle because of the way it looks in your inventory.Basically this is a game I wont be coming back to so I don't reccommend it			"

												Fairly tedious, obnoxious characters, puzzles aren't all logical enough to actually be puzzles (just try combining everything until something works is not the same thing as figuring something out), dialog takes forever, offensive depiction of a transgendered person for humor.

												Unfortunately the game is broken to the point that it became unplayable. Graphics textures are all mixed up and misplaced, so try and play a point and click with broken graphics. :(Bought it like 2 years ago and only have played it for an hour, only to come back now and realize that my savegame does not load anymore. Starting a new game results in broken graphics. Do yourself a favor and check the community and bug report forum to see if there is a fix some time in the future.			"

												Beautiful art style and an interesting world, but the story was decidely dissapointing – outright misogynistic and transphobic writing really put me off. the main character is unbelieveably frustrating. the puzzles are okay, but as a number of previous reviewers have noted, it feels needlesly obscure at times. it's a real shame considering how much i've enjoyed some other Daedalic point and click games.

												I recommend starting the Deponia adventure and purchasing this game. It is a funny point and click puzzle adventure game with lovable and memorable characters. The guy you play Rufus is awesome and such a failure in everything he does, its funny! I guarantee you will enjoy the game and the 2 sequels.			"

												This is a weird game because I didn't really like it at all until the very end.  I enjoyed the ending a lot, and I liked the characters that were only there for the ending.  That said, the rest of it wasn't that great so I can't recommend it just to get to the good part (at the very end).The puzzles are decent enough but Rufus is an idiot beyond measure and if he weren't the main and in some parts only character around (keep in mind he comments on EVERYTHING you do, look at, attempt, etc) it wouldn't have been as awful working through the puzzles or doing dialogue.The aesthetic is cool, but if you really want to play this, get it on sale.  There are better point-and-click adventures out there.			"

												The Deponia series is very eccentric and not for anyone in my opinion. It feels reminiscent to that of old point and click adventure games. It has a lot of good jokes and a lot of bad ones too. It was the kind of comedy that I am not used to. It was definitely worth the experience for me but not worth the money. Deponia also exploits how some adventure games are ridiculous with their puzzles and plots and quadruples that. Would I recommend it to any player? No. Would I recommend it to hardcore adventure gamers? Maybe. Tread at your own risk and preference to comedy.			"

												What I liked about it:- funny graphics- quirky musicWhat put me off by a mile:- the cruel humour of the whole story: basically, you advance the storyline by hurting others, causing damage and being obnoxious or ignorant- the protagonist... I could have strangled him- had a few pretty annoying puzzles- the plot itself seemed flat to meI only played this game to the end because it came in a game bundle, cheap.2/10, left a bad taste in my mouth. Definitely not my kind of game.			"

Really? Really?This could have been a really fun game if the main character wasn't a complete and utter waste of space who learns nothing. I hear it's much worse in the other games too. It's a no from me. Seriously - keep the art department from this, mix with writers who have a sense of humour that doesn't feel like it came out of a seedy frat house and you'd have a winning title.			"

												This is a fantastic point-n-click adventure game. If you've played any of the old LucasArts or Sierra adventure games from the 90's, you'll feel right at home with Deponia. It's art style and sense of humor is reminiscient of Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle, and its puzzles are definitely challenging without being outlandishly obscure. It's a perfect balance of logic and wackiness. The story and characters are also well done, though it took a little bit for the main character, Rufus, to grow on me (he's obnoxious and grating at first). Since this is part 1 of a trilogy, the ending will leave you hanging and wanting more. However, don't let that fool you into thinking it cuts short. I finished this in 12 hours, which is unheard of for point-n-click games in this day and age. If you loved the adventure games in the 90's from LucasArts or Sierra, this is definitely worth your time and money, and I can't wait to play the sequels.			"

												Three minutes into the game, tears man; tears!!! I was laughing so hard I couldn't catch my breath. The game takes me back to my childhood. Similar to Monkeys Island the game has a funny story that keeps you going throughout the GamePlay. Main character of the game Ruffes is a story of its own. Clumsy, maniacal, stubborn guy that has a neck for getting in to trouble yet he desperately tries to ""save"" the love of his life and get his happy ending. Mini games are also something worth mentioning. They are fun to play and give you a little brainless break from your main adventure. Last but not least is the music that follows you into every chapter of the game and stays in your head for days after ending this game. Deponia is a great game and I can't wait to finish the whole trilogy. The game still has a lot of room for improvement so I'm going to give it 6/10.			"

												Be warned that this game is only a small part of the whole story, if you buy this game and want to see anything resembaling a propper endeing you must buy the sequals aswell. the Deponia game ends on an unfulfulled plot that in no way gives any closure what-so-ever and in my opinian feels like a half of a game (or less). the time that you see as my total play time on record is the entire game, 9 hours, and there is no replay value. if you have time, money to burn, and there is a sale you might pick them up otherwise i recomend skipping this game.

												A great Monkey Island-esque game, that while a bit clunky in interaction makes it up with great humor. I did not like it at the very beginning but it quickly grew on me. I did have to use a walkthrough a couple of times - even though I had figured out the solution I could not move on because of poor game design, but that was negligeble. Definitely worth the time and money!			"

Cheeky character getting himself into trouble constantly? Check. Inventory of whacky items? Check. Recipe for fun? Must have left that on the wall of another bathroom. Oh well. Might as well combine the pot with the stove and cook my socks. Wait, that worked?! AWESOME!(Several hours later)Dammit!

												This game has the potential to be fun.  It is has some crude humor and irony that give a good laugh.  On sale, it is a nice pick-up game.The reason this review has received a negative from me is the fact that it has game-breaking bugs in it.  These are things the developers should absolutely have ironed out prior to release.  Although the game itself is not too long, wasting hours to get all the way back to the point the game broke only to progress does NOT make one want to continueEDIT: After the 11/17/14 patch, validated steam files, and with a fresh game as suggested by the developers, this game continues to not work properly.

												I like Point & Click Adventures. I love how they tell their stories and create their worlds. But I must make an admission about me and this genre.I cheat profusely at Adventure games...To me its the destination thats more crucial to Adventure games than the journey. It takes away from the overall experience if I have to try every item on my inventory on everything in the environment. so apologies to those who object me to using walkthroughs. Moving on....Deponia's story is an interesting one. Rufus, a do nothing, egotistical and self-involved young man who desperately wants to leave his stinking junkyard homeworld Deponia for the utopian floating city of Elysium. His latest hair brained plan to escape almost succeeded had he gets involved in an incident and rescues a mysterious girl, knocking her into a coma in the process. Its a funny and light hearted story with a touching cast that still delivers some swift plot twists and one liners (all voiced as well). All of which is pleasingly punctuated by the games detailed, cartoon art style that takes you in (with some help from the music....).Gameplay is as it has always been for Point & Clicks; you study the scene, collect everything and solve esoteric puzzles that put the Gordian Knot to shame. I'm not gonna delve too much into it since I use walkthroughs. But I will say its a fair bit better controls than other adventure games I've played.Deponia is a fun game, but like all Point & Click adventures its not for everyone. More for the inquisitive type in it for the story than the action. I'm already ready too dive into the sequel.As well as finish The Secret of Monkey Island...			"

I had high hopes for this - the production values are great, but the writers absolutely kill the opportunity by just having bad puzzle after bad puzzle - go back to Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle and work out why the puzzles are good and fun. I've got the other Deponia games in a deal, and they've gone in the Meh category never to be played.			"

												Really adorable character designs, interesting storyline peppered with silly one-liners... I really wanted to like this game, I wanted to be so into it that I bought the sequels. The puzzles were appropriate at progressing the plot, not too easy nor complex... then the emergency phone in the centre of town didn't have a click option so I had to reload saves then replay from the start to find it had ironed out. Then I was condemned to a replaying cutscene before reaching the station that made my character return to the control room like I had completed a puzzle incorrectly when I hadn't. Over and over I had to try to push past it. I don't mind a few bugs but then I uninstalled when I reached the whale. Why? Because the puzzle seemed forced like someone just wanted to extend the gameplay and I realised, so close to the end, the game had lost it's spark. Inventive and sweet to look at, I want to recommend it but cannot as it hooked me in and just completely dulled me out.			"

												Deponia is a standard point and click adventure with a lot of witty humor. It’s not a very long game but it has an interesting story and it will give you a few laughs. You play as Rufus, who is a self-centered lowlife and his main goal is to get out of the dump Deponia to live in Elysium. Somehow along the way things go wrong of course. The puzzles aren’t too hard to understand and some puzzles even have an option to skip them. I thought the voice acting was pretty good and the game has some clever cartoony visuals. If you like point and click adventures games you definitely should play Deponia.			"

												Unique characters you grow to love, good puzzles, and pieces of hilarious writing and events sprinkled throughout the whole game. Good progression, though some puzzles were more bizarre than others and therefore needed a few hints here and there from a guide, but I still found myself plowing through just to see what would happen next. Rufus earned a special place in my heart alongside iconic characters like Guybrush Threepwood, and for good reason. This is a must-have for point-and-click lovers everywhere.			"

												Deponia has a great story and really humorous characters. This is the first point and click adventure game I've played in a long time, and while the genre is not my favorite, it was a very enjoyable experience. One of my favorite aspects about the game was the mystery which surrounded Elysium and the futuristic, upper class society which runs it. The majority of the puzzles can be figured out in a mostly straight forward manner, I only had to cheat by looking at a walkthrough a few times. The main character, Rufus, reminded me of a more egocentric Fry from Futurama and I suppose the art style also reminded me of the TV series. The game made me laugh out loud a handful of times and often put a smile on my face, it was perfect, just like me.			"

												Don't play if you're very sensitive to the stingier kinds of humor!Other than that, definitely try it if you can, you'll probably get many laughs out of it. Some parts are tricky to do, so either it's a challenge or a search for a guide by that point. The end was a little disappointing for me, but not bad overall.

												It's quite simple, you know. Deponia is a difficult 2D story-based puzzle with sweet cartoon animation. That's all it needs so you can buy!Gameplay is just point-click with 'minigames', or I should say small puzzles, but in general puzzles are realy difficult and take a lot of time to solve. Talking about story, that's why Deponia is a brilliant game to me. Characters' development is great and emotional, you just have to love main fella Rufus, an absolute god of this game. I just can't wait to get my hands on the sequels.Like I said, it's simple, buy this game and you won't regret!			"

												When this game showed up on my radar, it had *sooo* much potential to be the next Monkey Island. While it doesn't completely fall short, it does enough wrong to not get my vote.Pros:-Art style is really polished. -Music (especially intro) is surprisingly good.-Length is about what point-and-click adventures should be.-The idea of calling a trilogy from the begining is a great idea.Cons:-I need my point-and-click adventures to be more or less logic driven. What I mean is that the items I try to use to solve the problem should make some sort of sense (even if it is quite tangential). This game suffers very badly from matching up logic to solve problems. Alot of the time it ends up being random clicking that gets you through. This is not very satisfying.-There is some sort of language barrier as some of the jokes are questionable lol. I find it funny but I would be willing to bet that the humor/script was written for another culture (I am located in North America).I also played the second game in the trilogy, and will not be visiting the third. Not a complete waste of time, but there are better games out there (plus I payed the full 20$ asking price).			"

												A surprisingly good adventure game. If you're already an adventure game fan, this is definitely one to pick up. The story is good enough, the comedy is there, the voice acting is, for the most part good, barring a couple of characters and most importantly, the puzzles are logical. Chances are, if you get stuck, you'll find out the answer and be slapping your own forehead, than throwing the game out the window. This is a game, however, where pressing spacebar to reveal hotspots could save a few of those head slapping moments. I'll be waiting to pick up Chaos on Deponia.			"

												Short version: This is a good game, but if you don't have any of them, the Complete Journey is a much better investment. The games integrate well together, there are more achievements, and it's available on more platforms.This is just a cut down version of my review for the Complete Journey.By now you've probably heard some things about these games and about how the creators are the ""German Lucasarts"" [which seems a bit unfair given there isn't an American Lucasarts any more].Well, I for one really enjoyed these games. There was a good balance between outright comedy and drama and the design and animation is top-notch, and it seems to be impossible to get stuck or killed.The first game is not as good as the second and third though. I found Rufus to be a bit of a jerk and rather unlikeable, the backgrounds pretty though mostly static, and the puzzles largely illogical. Oh, and the game seemed to suffer from the same problem that Simon the Sorcerer did. It thinks it's funnier than it is.The creators do seem to have made point-and-click adventures their ""thing"", and rather than Telltale who seem to have rounded all the corners off and made their games simpler for a new generation, Deponia is aimed squarely at people who enjoyed these games when they were in their heyday. That doesn't mean they're old-fashioned though. The control interface is reasonably straight forward, the games are gorgeous (did I mention that?), the voice acting is excellent and the music is..well, it's alright. You can switch it off if it gets on your nerves.I'm not going to compare the game to Monkey Island. Just because it's a point-and-click game doesn't mean it has to be like a Lucasarts game. It's not as wacky as Cokel's Gobliiins series, nor is it as serious as The Dig. Perhaps it's more like Sam and Max, with the gleefully anti-social protagonist. Regardless, if you like point-and-click games and want something with a good storyline and hours of gameplay, it's difficult to go wrong with this.			"

Bottom line up-front:Should you buy this game: If you enjoy point-and-click adventures, YesPro's:+ Great art syle+ Memorable, but brief characters+ Funny story with a likable protagonist.+ Good music with original songsCon's+ Obstuse puzzle solutions+ Short story legnth+ Not enough interation with many unique charactersReviewDeponia (first in a series of four games) is at its heart, a throw-back to the early point and click adventure games first popularized by Sierra-Online in the 80's and early 90s'. It follows the misadventures of Rufus, a self-centered, self-aggrandizing, self-destructive, yet lovable transient bum, who is trying desperately to escape the perpetual junk filled planet of Deponia for the floating paradise in the sky known as Elysium. As the opening exposition tells us on the outset of the game, he will concoct any manner of schemes or contraptions in order to achieve his goal, and Lord help anyone, or anything that stands in his way.  I just wish I had a chance to interact with them more and see them fleshed out more fully.And speaking of goals, Rufus quickly crosses paths with Goal, a beautiful Elysium woman who is, shall we say...not right in the head.  Which as Rufus will attest, that her condition had absolutely nothing to do with knocking her off the unprotected deck of a passing cruiser deck, plummeting to the ground and damaging her brain's hardware, rendering her unconscious. Goal represents the more cultured and educated foil to Rufus's blunt and unrefined nature, but the revelation later that her memories and personality can be changed via data cartriges placed in her brain implant, seemed a little off-putting.  I realize that it was written that way for comedic effect, but it still created a few cringeworthy moments.What follows is Rufus' travels to return Goal to Elysium and ""unselfishly"" earning him a complimentary admission ticket to the golden city (my words).Deponia has a lot to like. The first thing that is apparent about Deponia, is the cartoonish art-style.  Deponia is a literal world of junk, and everything in their society is constructed out what looks like the largest garbage dump known to man. Houses, buildings, everyday objects look like they were cobbled together out of repurposed items that were thrown away.The cartoon style also gives life to all of the characters.  Even the bit-part characters are uniquely designed and animated. Each one has their own personality, and backstory, which isn't told through a lot of needless and awkward exposition.  This also highlights the smart and clever writing. Through a few well-placed sentences, you can already grasp who the individual characters are.  I truly got the sense that this game could have been its own animated comedy series on television, and it would have held up.  While the cartoon comedy provides a lot of this games positives, there are a few downsides to this game.  Let's start with the puzzles.  The cartoonish nature of the game requires you to think as if you were in a cartoon environment. Which means that puzzles are deceptively easy, in that you have to think in very sideways terms, where most people will take a more literal approach.  For example, you are given instructions on how to assume a certain sitting pose to go into a meditative trance.  One of those instructions is to sit and place your left leg behind your head. When you get the place where you have to meditate, there is no place, or option to manipulate the character into the proper position. That is, until you take the leg from a skeleton, and place it behind you.  Many of the solutions will leave you groaning in both laughter, and frustration.Next are the mini-games.  There are a few of these sprinkled about in the game, but they have little to no explanation as to how they work, or how to achieve a solvable state. This will leave you scratching your head for hours, while you struggle to derive some kind of meaning of the game from the few, or lack or clues as to how they work.  Fortunately, the developers left an option to skip these mini-games, if you wish.Despite these flaws, I still think Deponia is worth its price-point.  It is funny, well-written, leaves room open for its sequels.  If you like these kinds of games, definitely give it a try. However, buy the bundle pack and stretch your money a little further.			"

												An old skool adventure game (not always in the good ways either).  Casual sexism is annoying. All the characters are detestable. Cartoon graphics  I like. Background art is amazing. Voice Over quality is good. Story is not bad. Puzzle are not intuitive and are complicated. Warning: There are some game breaking puzzle-logic bugs. I got hit by the the postoffice-pigeon-voucher bug, use a walkthrough once you get into the postoffice QQ. Also, Slave kitties... really?A rare meal for the die-hard adventure gamer.			"

												Long, uninteresting, unintelligent dialogs, confusing and illogical puzzles, and a boring set of characters makes me never want to finish this game.Spoiler alert! The solution to one of the puzzles is to put two socks in a pot of boiling water. You use a fork to get them out, the fork disappears and you are left with only one sock. What!? I just put two socks in the pot and one of them disappears. I thought there was a bug in the game so I restarted and replayed everything up to the boiling water puzzle. Looking at the walkthrough revealed that there is a third sock under the pillow in the bed. Sigh!Oh, and the tutorial is the longest, most annoying, over explained, not funny at all tutorial for a game that doesn't need a tutorial.Deponia tries very hard to be Monkey Island. Even the voice of the protagonist sounds like Guybrush. Compared to Monkey Island, Deponia does not have the same finesse. You will never laugh out loud, or be surprised by the puzzles or enjoy the dialogue. The characters you meet feel very one dimensional and unintelligent. They lack the depth the characters of Monkey Island have. In my eyes, this game doesn't add anything new to the adventure genre, and it certainly isn't Monkey Island.			"

												It is a nice game with decent graphics and funny story, and I have even played and finished it at my friends computer when it was originally released, but sadly there there are some (randomly appearing) blocking bugs which makes the game unfinishable (from time to time). And as I rememeber, some of these bugs were there even when the game was originaly released, which was more than year ago. And gues what - they are still there (and if somebody is interested what is the problem is /this time/: there is no way to leave radio operator tower when he is overwhelmed by all the incomming comunications).So if you are willing to try to avoid these bugs (and possibly (re)play the game from the beginning for several times during the process), then go ahead and buy it, it is a GREAT funny game. You may even be so lucky that you will not encounter any of the bugs :)For everyone else - stay clear of it, you will get frustrated from triing to avoid these bugs...			"

												I LOVE games with stories like this, I really do. But I always get stuck for the silliest things. Like in order to progress you need certain items to unlock certain puzzles, even though in reality it's more then likely you could do without those items. But NO, the puzzle requires you to have it or you can't continue onwards... I dont know man, I've outgrown point & click games I think. Just too many times it stops your progress for some arbitrary puzzle and just too many times I'm stuck for hours at it. You can consider this review as ""Yes, I recommend this game"" if you actually really enjoy point&click games, otherwise, skip it.			"

												An interesting little game that is let down by serious performance issues.While the art style and story were interesting enough to keep me playing, more than once I hit game-stopping bugs that forced me to kill the game from the task manager. The worst one halted progress during the final moments of the game, and when the game re-booted and allowed me to proceed all audio was cut out, leaving the closing scenes of the game to play out in silence.All of that could have been forgiven if the game wasn't so incredibly sluggish. When changing between areas it takes a few more seconds for anything to be able to intractable. So skipping around the town goes from being quick and painless to forehead vs. keyboard frustrating.If they can fix the loading and the bugs it'd be worth a look at, but in its current state your time would be better spent elsewhere.

												the main drive to games like this is it's story, the characters, unfortunately the game fails at that, the closest people to the character you play are complete d*cks to you but for good reason, the main character is the most unlikable c*nt i've seen in a long time, even towards people who manage to have the patience to not want to kill him on sight, and thats what annoyed me the most, gorgeous visuals good sound design but the characters and story that are supposed to be the reward after completing the puzzles completely sucks.I don't usually mind cocky characters, but ""Rufus"" just goes full ret4rd, and you should never go full ret4rd.

												The puzzles are made so open endedly that the game feels long and you don't know what steps you are supposed to take when trying to progress. It is a kind of game where you will be checking every single edge of the region and it feels like nothing you are trying is working. This game is almost impossible to completee if you do not have a walkthrough guiding you through some puzzles that just don't make logical sence.The most fatal problem is how badly the puzzles are placed through regions. When you are doing one of the puzzles you have to remember every detail or every screen you've been on previously or you won't know that you are supposed to back track and pick something up that you didn't even know was there. This reason to me is because all the items that you can interact ith are just blended into all the other eye junk. Trust me when I say this game has a lot of eye junk that will make the thing that will solve you puzzle almost invisible. There are no clues what so ever through the game the tell you how you are supposed to complete a puzzle, or how you are supposed to even go about completeing that puzzle.Bad puzzle design, if you do play you need a walkthrough open all the time. Puzzle games that REQUIRE walkthroughs for a player to feel like that are progressing are bad puzzle games.			"

												To capture a runaway toothbrush you need a mousetrap baited with wasabit peas. To get 2 of the same colored socks you need to mix 3 random colored socks into a pot of boiling water, add soap and stir with a fork. Randumb game. Puzzles make zero sense with solutions being found by endless trial and error or referencing a walkthrough, over and over and over again. Main character is whiny and obnoxious. Scenery is decent but character animations look poor and dated. Humor is flat and obnoxious. They occasionally try to get people into the series by dropping this title as low as $0.99, so if you want to try it wait for the deep discount, but dont expect much.			"

												The game mechanics are solid, the animation is good. Music and sound is nice at first but gets boring and repetitive, outright annoying pretty quick. But that's all forvigabe.What this game really sucks at is selling a story. Pretty much all characters are forking aceholes, the protagonist most of them all. And I do get the whole anti-hero notion, yeah. This is not the ""bad"" character (with a twinkle in his eye), who has this mean bad shell, but ultimately is kindof likable. Not at all. This is the kind of character who is proud of being an alcoholic ropist racist who sells Heroin to children (dramatization, only part of this is in the actual game, namely the rope and racism). Hey and I'm not one of these forking annoying SJWs either. Not all all, bro. This game just made me cringe and cringe and cringe and cringe and cringe so many times that I couldn't bring myself to start it up again.			"

												This game is very artisically beautiful with a wonderful story with great puzzles to boot. The characters are lovable and hilarious and Rufus's antics are the best. The game can be challenging at times but its always so fun to figure things out. The Deponia series have got to be my favorite games and I suggest you play all three--it's the ride of your life.			"

												""Blech, Gnats♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; - RufusI got Deponia in a bundle including 4 other games, so I got my moneys worth out of it. That said, $1 isn't a lot to throw away. Deponia is NOT worth $20.It's a short, shallow post-apocalyptic world with no real attempt at world building (which is sad as the espresso machine showed that it could have had potential), with an unlikable main character (Being by design doesn't make it any better), puzzles that require out of game knowledge (Not everyone has heard of phosphorescence), and a pretentious end of act cutscenes that aren't adding anything to the narrative. Since they've been compared to LucasArts in the description, I feel I should say that this wouldn't even be Act 1 of a Monkey Island game.Rufus is the perfect mascot for this franchise - A self centered egotist who thinks they're a lot cleverer than they are.

												honestly, i could never recommend this game. i understand what they were going for with rufus: an honest appearance of a rpg character, how others would see that person. but he is beyond unlikeable; he has no redeeming qualities and nothing that stops me from wishing he was dead (my only brief period of enjoyment was, in fact, watching him be in pain). the transmisogynistic trope of the town hall clerk being A Man In A Dress, replete with an annoyingly high falsetto and i cannot bother with this game anymore.someone call me back once this game erases rufus and instead it focuses on toni and ms. goal doing something instead of toni existing as a Nagging ♥♥♥♥♥y Ex even though he's lucky as♥♥♥♥♥♥to have her.

												I have a very, very, very difficult time understanding the appeal of this game. I adore point and click adventures, but Jesus Christ, I couldn't even play this.I had to turn off the speech volume within a few minutes because I found the voice acting so utterly abrasive and obnoxious.Half of the humor seems like it was written by a six-year old. I don't recall the lines exactly, but things like ""The clown of anaesthetics. Heh heh. Clowns!"" and ""You've never been a big help. You know, a big help. A BIG HELP. Heh heh. Because you're small."" Honestly? Does the writer work at Hot Topic making buttons and t-shirts as their other job?Everyone despises the main character, Rufus, and for good reason. He's a complete tool and just irritating to play as.Usually I can get past things like that if the game itself is enjoyable, but it's ALSO disappointing. I can't believe this game has such positive feedback.I enjoy ridiculous and quirky, not asinine and witless. I can guarantee whoever wrote this, did so while wearing a fedora.			"

												Deponia is a point and click adventure, but without having hints on what to do next, that wouldn't be so bad if the puzzles were logical.  The biggest mistake of the game is Rufus, he's so unlikeable.  Most of the humour isn't funny. It's mostly about how big a jerk Rufus is or what Rufus thinks of other people in the city. Also Rufus voice is not good at all, everyone else had decent voices, but Rufus no and sadly he has the most dialogue in the game. THe game has good sound and art though.			"

												Pros:+Light-hearted game that makes lots of attempts at humor (some of them successful), especially in the dialog+Interesting setting and a likable main characterCons:-Pacing of the story is very poor. The story moves forward in a very jerky way with 30 second cutscenes of story followed by long, tedious bouts of point-and-click puzzle solving full of very contrived quests which are barely related to the story. (For example: To advance the story by one small increment, you've got to collect these six things. Oh, and each one will have some asinine obstacle blocking your ability to get it.) By the end of each of these game segments I was positively starved for some kind of progress in the story and on the verge of quitting. The story is interesting, but it moves at a snail's pace. It's super-annoying to play for an hour without getting so much as a crumb of story progress. This made the game feel long and dull to me.-I found several of the puzzles to be confusing rather than challenging. In a couple of cases I got the solution through random trial and error before actually understanding what the puzzle was I was supposed to be solving.-The story is completely unresolved, and all you get in the end is a ""to be continued"" ending.

Like the worst point and click adventures of old, where you had to combine stuff in ways, which NEVER any sane person would come to think of it. Just combine random stuff from an overflowing inventory until something happens. No thanks. The puzzles are entirely irrational and hardly can be deduced by logic.			"

												OK.... this is a NO review...I always try to be supportive of even the crappiest game, but this.... is... a bit too much crap for my taste.Before reading, please, if you are a huge fan of Daedalic games, you might find this review offensive.Actually, you WILL find this offensive.Do not read.I warned you.First of all, the MC.GAWD the only reason I ended this game was because I was too anal not to finish. I had lots and LOTS of AFK moments to cool down JUST BECAUSE of the MC. I'd rather play a total villain than this sad excuse for an anti-hero.I even turned off the audio because I hated listening to his dialogues, and yes, I also skipped through all.Next, the NPCs.Seriously, they are just as bad... except for 2 who were ridiculously harassed by the MC. I actually like these 2 and wonder, if the character designers are actually capable of creating these 2 great characters, then why is the MC such a crap??????You have anti-heroes, and you have jerks. I don't see any of the first in this game.Plot was OK. The world setting reminded me of the Japanese manga GUNM : Battle Angel Alita.Graphics are good. A good reminiscence of Monkey Island and Gabriel Knight (the 2D animation versions).Soundtrack.... no idea. I was so irritated by the MC's dialogue etc then I turned off the audio completely except when I needed it to solve puzzles. Even then I didn't register it into mind.Puzzle.The puzzles are FRUSTRATING and does not make sense. Yes, it's a fantasy world which isn't logical in the first place, but  unfortunately for puzzles, you do need logic. Fantasy world or not.The order does not make sense. I know what to do, and IMO it doesn't effect the game whatsoever if we mix up the orders anyway. But nooooooo..... we miss a step, we can't move on.I purchased a LOT of Daedalic games in a shopping binge because I was desperate for a good point-click game.Played 3, finished 2, and not even thinking about finishing the 3rd despite my anal-ness.Not even thinking about starting the other ones, and will re-fund if possible.If re-fund not possible, I might play the remaining games just to humor the money I spent, which is NOT happening anytime soon.If you're an avid collector of point-click games no matter what review, then go ahead and give this a try, though I do recommend... HIGHLY recommend that you purchase this only on a big sale.If you're looking for a good gaming time, move along. This is one game you can totally live without.			"

												A few glitches here and there, such as doing things well traveling causing Rufus to talk to people who are not on the same screen or do things from a different place. For some reason when I start a new area and it cleans my inventory the icon would be missing, and the only way I could open it again would be to quit and rejoin. You can double click to fast travel and click to skip what people are saying+When you skip the story sometimes, it will skip two chunk instead of the one you just read.-The game has weird logic-No replayability what so ever, unless your one of those achievement nuts-Rufus is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-A kind of interesting story+ "

I feel bad for any women in his life. The constant stereotyping and disdain for women is forced down your throat at every turn. After a few hours I just couldn't play it any more, it was vile.

												It's quite surprising for me that there will be 4th part of Deponia soon, it shows that title is most successful one in Daedalic portfolio. To be honest, I have no idea why.Still Daedalic is very productive company and while some teams like Pendulo are just vanished in time and others like WadjetEye are just too old-school for modern common player there are plenty of adventure games from german devs.But Deponia definitely isn't one of the best.And it is not becase of many reasons:* you know, when you put your game into some irrational setting (just like scrapyard-city in the middle of the nowhere), you can afford any kind of ""logic"" you even may come up with. So you can force players to be wounded by chile pepper or hold with you unconsious parrot almost all the time and tell them that, guys, we are in the cartoon after all, but it is not something of a good taste and it is not mark of good game designer work* another problem is that game breaks its own rules. You need to use fork to take out socks from boiled water but you don't haveto have one to obtain sponge from same place* humor is german-specific and here it is SO german-specific* main character deserves terrible death - he is ugliest main persona since... I don't know. Since original sin* there are plenty of recorded phrases but quantity definitely does not transform into quality. Different interactions can have same reaction from protagonist. Rufus is very talkable one, but his blabla-ing is as annoying as he is. Prepare to listen silly stories about every your hot-spot click. Unfortunately there is no much useful information in themSo I'd like to recommend to play any other adventure, even from Daedalic. Why don't you choose A New Beginning for example?And, dear Daedalic, could you please deal with animation? While overall graphic style is just great characters' speech with 2 drawn frames per sentence can frighten expierenced screamer-lovers. "

Rufus is very talkable one, but his blabla-ing is as annoying as he is. Prepare to listen silly stories about every your hot-spot click. Unfortunately there is no much useful information in themSo I'd like to recommend to play any other adventure, even from Daedalic. Why don't you choose A New Beginning for example?And, dear Daedalic, could you please deal with animation? While overall graphic style is just great characters' speech with 2 drawn frames per sentence can frighten expierenced screamer-lovers. "

												This game is so ""funny"" I can't stand it.  Not quite ""ha ha"" or ""heh"" funny ... more like ""your screaming 9 year old nephew wrote the dialog while eating a 50 lb bag of cotton candy and leaving sticky fingerprints all over your screen and spilling soda in your keyboard, and maybe someday we'll look back at this and laugh"".I was excited for this game given the obviously high art quality and ratings, but I made it through the tutorial and first scene and could stomach no more.  As some people have mentioned, the puzzles were harder than many other contemporary adventure games, but they were far from impossible and roughly on-par with the old classics.  The only positive thing I can say about the gameplay is that the solutions to the puzzles were actually amusing, and require you to behave like the horrible person the protagonist is trying to be.Maybe I'll take a deep breath and try again soon.

												Storyline moves very VERY slow because of the puzzles, which give you almost no clues or help, and many were solved by sheer luck. (though the game DOES allow you to skip the puzzles if they are too hard, which is nice, i guess?) Came to find that the story is very unfinished, and there are four games, rnaging from twenty to thirty bucks each, and it's definitely not worth ~$90 to find out the ending. I would also not recommend the trilogy pack, as it is still missing the last part of the game, which costs another $30. Pros:- Game was very interesting visually- Occasionally humorous- Puzzles were challenging, and when done right were enjoyable- Story is very interesting and makes you want to know more about the world of the game, and its historyCons:- You never get answers to half the questions you have about the game or its characters- Main character is dislikable as hell, making you wonder why you're even bothering to assist him- Most parts of the game give you NO clue how to progress, (minigames aside, spending 15 minutes trying to figure out where to click is irritating enough) - Story was very short, when all's said and done, but moves extremely slowly, so what would take 1hr to replay takes 6 or 7 the first time around "

												This game isn't garbage, but I still felt the need to get my $3 refund for it. I thought I'd grab it on sale because the story and gameplay looked lighthearted and funny, but I really just found it to be waste of my time that didn't even make me smile once. It is definitely quirky and the characters have an overly sarcastic sense of humor, so I can see how some people may find it funny (I guess). The gameplay is absurd and you'll find yourself just clicking everywhere on the screen to try and figure out what the hell you're supposed to do next. A lot of what you have to do to progress makes no sense because of how whacky the game is as a whole. You'll have about as much luck as a 6 year old when trying to figure it out. Bottom line is, don't buy this game if you won't be satisfied with a very simple point & click adventure. The gameplay is definitely lacking and the story really isn't that good by any means either imo. If you do like basic point & click games, maybe you'll like it. But I still can't see how anyone finds this game that great. It's not terrible, but who wants to waste their time with that?			"

												I see a lot of people seem to like this game, but I'm kinda starting to hate it. I'd say this is one of the worst quests I've ever played. Although the design is pretty nice, I particularly love the soundtrack and the way the characters are drawn but...1. The protagonist himself is DISUGSTING. He's a typical loser with stupid jokes and no interests at all except for getting stuff for free and without any effort. Why would anyone ever want to live his life? 2. The quests. They don't have any logic and you have to do ugly things too often. But that could have been okay if... there was any logic. It's close to impossible to crack some puzzles. I failed to solve the puzzle with the pigeons simply because I guess I clicked on the wrong button and I can't access the puzzle anymore. I read 3 or 4 walkthroughs and none of them helped. This is the first time a quest made me so frustrated. I'll give the game 2/10. It's really not worth trying. The night of the rabbit that I bought the same day is much much better.			"

												You want a nice, logical, point and click adventure game where you don't need a guide to finish it?Then look elsewhere.If you're a masochist who loves clicking everything on everything else and can stand long periods of boredom and doing nothing productive, then by all means, get this game.  It's the same problem that plagued the genre in the 1980's and 90's, and still found it's way into this game in 2012.  It's ridiculous.  I thought we were past crap like this these days.I got this game for dirt cheap as part of some Humble Bundle.  And I still feel like I was cheated.  Old school traditional style point and click adventure games like this, with maybe one or two exceptions, need to freaking die as a genre.			"

												One of the Best game Series I've played from Daedalic Entertainment (LucasArts Germany). It's 30x Better than James Cameron's Elysium. And by 30x, I mean the Entire Deponia Trilogy (Deponia, Chaos on Deponia & Goodbye Deponia). In fact, I'll sing about it.

But I will never recommend this game.

												Personally i really like Point and Click adventures since Monkey Island and especially since ""Broken Sword"" (Baphomets Fluch) so if you don't like P&C games at all this recommendation could be wrong for you.Deponia (1st of 3 planned parts) is a game where you play as Rufus, a outsider who still lives at his ex-girlfriend in Deponia (a planet full of garbage which seems to be our earth in future) and dreams about a (flying city) called Elysium which (indeed exist) but not everyone has acces to it. His life goal is to escape from Deponia so the first what you do is another attempt to get there which goes not totally wrong. Instead, you bring ""Goal"" (a girl from Elysium) to Deponia and totally fall in love with her. But... she's unconscious. In Part 1 you mostly try to awake her which seems not that easy.The jokes and situations in which Rufus gets are really funny and very strange.Open End cause of part 2 ofc. 8/10			"

												Daedalic Entertainment, once called “Lucasarts from Germany“ by the GameStar magazine, invites the players into a fantastic comedy adventure that revolves around a crazy love story of Rufus and Goal. In Deponia, the world has degenerated into a vast garbage dump, in which the crotchety Rufus ekes out his sorry existence. He is part of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal mountains of trash. He hopes for an opportunity to get into the world of the rich, who live in a floating city high above the clouds. Fate seems to smile on the snotty good-for-nothing when one day the attractive lady named Goal from the higher sector plummets into one of the trash heaps. Rufus decides to help the young woman out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty which limits his usual unscrupulousness. Help Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl from heaven. Only with this rich girl from his dreams he might be able to escape Deponia and, unexpectedly, to save the planet.			"

												I guess this game is very good for the people who like point and click games, I personally don't think its worth the 20 dollars it costs. I bought it with the deadalic bundle which includes a bunch of other games that also are point and click. The story seems pretty good but I do not like this game at all and I do not like the other games the deadalic bundle had. Again I do not think this is a bad game, its just the type of game the thing I don't like. And why don't I like this game genre, well it's because it gets kind of boring when the game gets challenging. So I do not recommend this for people that have never tried point and clicks or for people that want the game to go by fast and not be that challenging. Thanks for reading.			"

A woman from another planet falls from the sky and the town hall is filled with the town's men negotiating who gets to 'keep' her. Not to mention such hilarious jokes as a non-passing trans-woman secretary; the main character's irritation at being misidentified as 'Sugarpuff;' and the ex-girlfriend snapping at the main character that she's not going to let him spike her drink with a tranquilizer again.

												While the game itself is pretty decent as an adventure game, the way this game treats female or transgender characters... it is uncomfortable. I'm sure there must have been ways to be fun other than being biased and making fun of a sexual minority. I feel like I approved, and even ecouraged, of their immaturity by buying their games...			"

												The constant sexism (starting with the notes that let the protagonist's room mate look like a maniac because she doesn't except the chaos he leaves in the house) and the bad jokes about the transgender woman in the town hall killed the game for me.Daedalic is definitely not the modern ""Lucas Arts"".  ""Lucas Arts"" had a higher standard and jokes that didn't throw minorities or women under the bus.			"

												Right, forgot to leave a review after first playing it.It was a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sure, it seems like it would be great fun when you read the description and see the video and whatnots. Then you install it and try to play it.I don't even know if the story or gameplay is any good because (despite my pc exceeding the requirements), the game was too laggy for me to play. IN A POINT AND CLICK GAME.At the time, there was no response in the thread with this issue and the devs didn't seem to be doing anything to fix it. Got mad, uninstalled it and would have asked for a refund had the system been implemented back then.I regret having bought this game and am not even going to bother checking if it actually works now.If it does the great, someone that didn't have to put up with this problem might actually get to enjoy it.As for me, screw this game. Terrible first impression.			"

												With a unique world setting, and a well-drawn cartoon-style art direction, Deponia brings back a traditional style point-and-click game for the modern age.This naturally means it will feel a bit slow compared to todays games, but it's about using the mind... even if some of the solutions to the problems seem a little far-fetched. The story itself is actually not that long nor does much really happen. Most of your time is spent trying to figure out how to do the smallest of tasks. Regardless, it's still a decent story and worth a playthrough, especially if you like point-and-click adventures.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												Enjoyed it!, Styling was consistent and over the top :). The voice acting was pretty decent and the puzzles were sufficiently hard.Some downsides to it was the unintuitive nature of some puzzles and the slight annoying nature of the main character. Another issue... now this one is probably just me... is how I didn't fully understand the ending...Anyways, I'd say try out this game... you might enjoy the quirkiness of the main character. 9/10.

												Great game with lives the tradition of fun point & click adeventures (Monkey Island ...).Some parts of the puzzles are misleading. Sometimes I know what to do to solve the puzzle but the game forces me to do it in a certain illogical way. F.e. when gathering ingredients for a drink that is to be mixed in a machine it forces me to mingle them in a separate container first. Or sometimes there is not enough feedback what a certain action does.Also big parts of the game play in the same village. Finally the game ends too much with a hint for a sequel, which I do not appreciate as a serious business model that respects gamers (at least adventures aren't too expensive these days).That and the above puzzle flaws give the game an unpolished character. But that 's all I want to criticize here.Really good game overall, had a lot of laughs.8/10			"

												Deponia is one of the best point and click adventure games I have ever played.  Rufus the main character is a complete jerk that thinks nothing of himself. That is until he meets Goal.  The humor was excellent and gets better through out the game. A few puzzles were difficult, but not impossible. If they are too hard sometimes, you may have the opption to skip it. over all I'd give it an 8.5/10 . The game also has quite a high replay play value becuase you'll always find more to click on.

												This won't be a glowing review. I'll recommend it, but with reservations. If it's on sale for $3.50 or less and you want an interesting, fairly unique story, along with some good adventure game puzzles, then it's a good buy. For any more than that, don't waste your time.So, I'm not an adventure game kinda guy. I didn't like Myst at all, and never got around to many other point-and-click's. A lot felt like pixel hunting and didn't have very logical puzzle solutions. There's very few of those moments in Deponia. Holding the spacebar will reveal all the available hotspots, and many of the solutions make sense. Naturally some seem a little over-complicated, but given the items you're allowed to use they make more sense.The story is interesting, and I found it quite unique. It doesn't give you any agency to change outcomes, but the dialogue driving it is, for the most part, witty and funny.The music is awesome and indeed, the chorus guys rule.Now the bad.This game is horribly, horribly unoptimized. I understand that a few players haven't had any issues, but I spent a lot of time reading the forums and I'm certain that I had every issue mentioned by anyone, and at least one that I didn't see mentioned.The game chugs. I'm not certain why it drops performance so bad, but it does. At first, I thought the animations just had low framerates (The walking animations are fine, as well as the movies by the way. I'm talking about the mouse cursor and inventory screen animations), but at one point there was a sound effect happening in the background at a regular interval. When I pulled up my inventory, or when I pressed spacebar to reveal the hot-spots, the sound effect slowed down by at least half. The game seems to run at around 30fps normally, but was dropping to as low as 5fps during these particular times. I really don't know why a point-and-click should be so resource intensive on a machine that can comfortably run AAA games at high settings.Also, there are a few bugs with not being able to hit certain hotspots at certain times. Trying to exit the listening post is an example. There are workarounds such as talking to the guy who's up there first, but pressing spacebar reveals the exit arrow as an option, so I see no reason it shouldn't be one immediately.The minecart minigame with the correct solution would not allow me to progress. Thankfully they allow you to skip it. Still, that seems like an awful cop-out.One more, that I didn't see anyone ask about, is that the dialogue options would occasionally appear partially above the frame they're enclosed in, thereby obscuring some of the options. Or the options would appear partially below the frame, and therefore partially off-screen thereby rendering some options un-clickable. Cycling through the dialogue options usually fixed the problem. Again, the problem should not exist in the first place.Don't be fooled by the settings, changing them changed nothing about how the game reacted on my machine. Texture compression, weather effects, anything, they all ran exactly the same.Don't be fooled by the demo. The demo ran fine on my machine, full framerates and no dialogue, hotspot, or puzzle issues at all. These were definitely not indicative of the state of the full game.To wrap things up, the game has an interesting story, I like the art style, and it's mostly funny. But, those developers did a terrible job with their QA. Don't buy the game if it's not on sale.			"

												I've always enjoyed adventure puzzles game since I was younger. This is my grown up version of Freddi Fish or Spy Fox. That being said this is the first Daedalic Entertainment game I've played. And from other reviews... I hope the others are better. I was disappointed with couple things. The biggest being the bugs surrounding important plot actions. If certain actions are not taken appropriately (i.e. a conversation option is skipped) it may have an impact on continuing in game. Also the story was a little lacking... I'm in for not everything having a happy ending but... you always hope the time you put into a game rewards you with some fulfillment. Overall, I enjoyed this game. I wouldn't necessarily recommend to a friend. But I loved the witty humor and the artistic direction. Despite the bugs, it worked for me. Hopefully Daedalic releases some patches in the future to improve the gameplay.			"

												This game has by far one of the best stories I've ever seen in a game. Not only is it comical and puzzling at the same time, but Rufus is so relatable (To me anyway). With all of his escapades, and disasters associated with him the community doesn't take a liking to him... well, nobody really takes a liking to him. But! He loves himself and I do think that is actually a really good and strong message, even though that it is pretty vague and probably not intentional by any means. It teaches people that it doesn't matter what other people think of you, if you believe in yourself and put all the nessicary work in you can accomplish anything. 10/10			"

												What can I say? My first adventure game I completed was Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of Lounge Lizards in late 80's, and I have been fan of adventure game genre ever since. I had quite high expectations of this game. It looks nice, and the setting is interesting. However, the puzzles... They are not puzzles. They are tedious combinatorial work with little or no logic. A review in Metacritic pointed to walkthrough to see what is wrong with this game and now I do the same. See how to make espresso! The solution to this single operation... it's 6 freaking pages long, containing about 200 steps, and there are literally tens of steps that do not make sense in any way. The puzzles really get in the way of the story. That's it. I feel like a monkey who is supposed to guess what the designers had in mind. I don't think it's fun at all.			"

												Deponia isn't a perfect point and click adventure. The protagonist isn't the most likable character, and it's easy to get very stuck. But it's still worth playing and provides a good introduction to Deponia's two sequels, which are both much better games.

												While I did enjoy this game for its lovely art style and its classic 90s era take on the adventure genre, I can only recommend this first entry in the series with some reservations.  The dystopian setting of the titular Deponia is a literal trash heap orbited by the idyllic Elysium (not to be confused with the blockbuster movie of the same name, with the same plot).  The cartooniness dulls the edge of the grim setting, but there's still some hearty meat to it.  This first entry explores much of what there is worth exploring, and the ending feels solid enough that you can easily leave it there without further sequels.However, throughout the game the central character Rufus becomes more and more insufferable.  He's endearing at first, but near the end of the game it starts to become exhausting.  For this first entry, it's not quite a deal breaker.  But by the start of the sequel, he gets to the point of being completely intolerable.  While it's obvious they're trying to channel Guybrush Threepwood, it crosses some hard to define line at some point and he becomes so grating you just can't help but turn it off.			"

The atmosphere and environments are actually quite nice. The animation quality is great, but I am sorry to say that I would have to give this one a pass. I played a couple hours in, and hey maybe it gets better. I really wanted to love this game, but seriously, the solutions are so ridiculous. My best way to describe it would be the whole duck and rope solution in the train station from the game ""The Longest Journey"", except that almost every one you do will feel like that.			"

												I shall keep this one simple.PROS:- Beautiful art style. Great backgrounds and character design- Entertaining music- Good humor- Decent lengthCons:- Some areas are very difficult to figure out due to hints that are very vague.- Rufus's walking speed is very slow and irritating. I had no clue either that you can jump straight to the location by double clicking to bypass the walking until 3/4 into the game.- Storyline is decent but is over-all forgettable.The game is a good point and click. Nothing really screams BAD game to me nor does nothing scream AWESOME EXPERIENCE. It was worth the discounted price I paid and it was mildly amusing as I played.

												I've always enjoyed adventure puzzles game since I was younger. This is my grown up version of Freddi Fish or Spy Fox. That being said this is the first Daedalic Entertainment game I've played. And from other reviews... I hope the others are better. I was disappointed with couple things. The biggest being the bugs surrounding important plot actions. If certain actions are not taken appropriately (i.e. a conversation option is skipped) it may have an impact on continuing in game. Also the story was a little lacking... I'm in for not everything having a happy ending but... you always hope the time you put into a game rewards you with some fulfillment. Overall, I enjoyed this game. I wouldn't necessarily recommend to a friend. But I loved the witty humor and the artistic direction. Despite the bugs, it worked for me. Hopefully Daedalic releases some patches in the future to improve the gameplay.			"

												A callback to classic adventure games, with a wonderful cartoony style. The word 'egostystical maniac' is thrown about a lot for the protagonist (Made worse because its true) but its amusing watching him mess everything up and stumbling on solutions accidentily. With a cast of wacky characters, an intruiging story and puzzles that will make you run screaming for a walkthrough, I'd recommend it if you want Monkey Island except with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for a main character. Also, the love interest is called 'Goal' so its deliciously self-aware.			"

												I find this game very charming. Beautiful enviorements and unique characters with very amusing personalities. A must have for the point-and-click-lover. I've not finished the game yet but as far as I've gotten I think it is a well made game and I enjoy it! _Pros_  - nice looking enviroments  - Interesting characters   - Not to easy  - funny now and then  - Good Voice acting _Cons_  - Cliche stoyline  - poorly made lip sync7/10			"

												If you grew up you games like Grim fandango, Monkey Island or Day of the tentacle you will adore this game! It has the charm and the comedy you want from a Point and Click adventure game! Even down to the jokes about not all your items will work together in your inventory. The plot is fresh and well written and spread out over 3 full length games not just 3 episodic releases.Well worth trying out if u wanna enjoy a few puzzles, great and silly humour and new adventure game!

												I'm a big sucker  for adventure games and this one really hit the spot.The humour reminded me of Monkey Island series and for me this is always a good thing.There are always things that could be better. For example the story could use a little depth, some of the puzzles did not make too much (any?) sense and worst of all, a reaction speed challenge. I am the kind of player that sits back and takes his time when playing, ask me for quick reactions and i'm dead.But with all it's flaws, it was a trully enjoyable game. I would clearly recommend this.			"

												Deponia is a Point & Click game and the first part of a trilogy, preceding Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.The game takes place on the planet Deponia, a real discharge on a large scale. At a distance floats a paradisiac platform, Elysium, reserved for rich people and inaccessible for the inhabitants of Deponia. We control Rufus, a clumsy character with an outsize ego, which loathes the household and working, and wishes only a thing: leave Deponia for Elysium. During an attempt to leave Deponia, Rufus meets Goal, a young inhabitant of Elysium who's here by mistake. He thus decides to return her at home, while hoping to be able to take advantage of it to join Elysium.All right, the scenario is not very original, we stay in the classic pattern of a prince who has to save the princess. But the universe is very nice, rather funny, both by the mind of the characters and by the nonsense of some situations. The gameplay is simple, we collect objects, then we combine them with other objects in the inventory to interact with the elements of the screen. Furthermore, by pressing on the space bar, we can locate at once the elements which we can interact, even if it is never very complicated to find them.Deponia is reminiscent of one of the pillars of the Point and Click, one of my favorite games: Monkey Island. Even if this latter remains much better, we do not remain indifferent to Deponia, to its cartoon animations, its colored universe, its musics and sound effects. Deponia should take you till 10 hours of game to end it. At the end of the game, you unlock the mode Droggeljug, completely useless, which replace all the names and conversations by the word ""Droggeljug"". But it's fun! :)			"

												It was an okay game. Some parts were difficult to get through as this game was sexist, homophobic, and transphobic. The main character is the ""typical"" egotistic, lazy, and dirty minded male. The plot is focus on Rufus attempting to leave Deponia, lugging around an unconscious damsel in distress, and then switching out her BRAIN IMPLANT for his benefit. Worst of all her name is GOAL! Really, that is her name!  Point and click adventures are a genre I enjoy, and it was sad to see such a difference in gaming experience between this and Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. The puzzles themselves were enjoyable and there were moments of humor in good taste. Overall, I would not have bought this game knowing what it truly was, and ignored the very positive reviews. If you like a game that has sexism woven throughout, then this is a game you most likely will enjoy!			"

One of the best point and click games I have played so far.Story - Some people may get annoyed by the attitude of the main character but just bear with the first parts of the story and see how everything turns out. It's totally worth it. The pacing of the development of the story and the main character is just right. From someone who's so egotistic to someone heroic.Visuals - I can say that the artstyle used is quite relaxing, at least for me.Gameplay - The usual point and click game. Find some objects, solve puzzles, engage in conversations to get some clues. Beware of the WTF-ish solutions the main character has for some problems, though. I don't usually check Google for walkthroughs but there are just some parts in this game that left me no choice. Haha.Music - Nothing worth remem.... WAIT. There is. The Chorus guy! "

												Deponia is a point and click adventure puzzle game about a man named Rufus who lives on a ""Planet"" entirely covered in garbage. (I say Planet with quotations simply because the characters state it's on a planet different form a city called Elysium, located high in the sky, presumably in orbit, even if that doesn't work at all). It's set in the future of our time so you could say it fits into Sci-Fi aswell.Either way, Rufus wants to get to Elysium and he's... well he's rather mad, but he has the brains to get out of any situation, including the situation where he's on Deponia, a place he hates more than anybody else.The game takes... well about as long as it's taken to beat it, but unfortunately like all games in the same genre, once you play it, it takes basically 30 minutes tops to beat it again, knowing all the information, even if that's good for a few laughs.When you play this game, in order to beat some part you REALLY gotta think with conventional logic or even like a smart person and I sometimes fail at that, requiring a walkthrough to figure out what to do with some things.The game has alot of tongue-in-cheek humor bits, and even some normal bits of humor. The art style is very nice with great animations, although unfortunately the lip-syncing is sometimes a bit off, like in the start of the game, it's not too big of a deal.The music is also great but if you get stuck, turn it off or you'll hear it again and again. There's not really too much music, variation for music would've helped somewhat. The game has cats at one point and they're miserably adorable.The puzzles are challenging, but ofcourse it's the main reason as to why it takes 30-40 minutes to beat it given all the puzzle answers are given to you.The story is very engaging though, it's easily the best part of this game. I love Rufus' character, the other characters are just as great, all of them very well voiced and even to say the least, they are even interesting people... when looking at main character such as Gizmo, Rufus, Wenzel, etc.I personally loved playing this game start to finished and even after all this time, I still have the puzzles all memorized to heart... mostly.Droggeljug mode is a special mode that makes it extremely difficult if you don't remember dialogue options, or even know how to skip things as literally every word of text and even dialogue is replaced with the word Droggeljug. Just one of them for text, however this would've been nice for dialogue too as it doesn't follow the same thing, causing Droggeljug mode to be deeply irritating. It could be changed by simply having one word per dialogue option instead of it being word for word replacement.Altogether, the game gets an 8/10. It's great fun, has a splendid atmoshpere, world and story, and the characters are nice too.It would score a 10/10 but Droggeljug mode being really annoying as the word that characters say have no variation, it's just one sound clip looped over and over per character, it detracts from it a fair amount in addition to the fact that many items used on something results in the exact same reaction from Rufus in contexts that don't really make any sense for it, and also if the music had some variation, as it will eventually lose it's value as you get stuck (if you're like me, you WILL get stuck at least once) and hear it for many loops of it.

I am excited to play the rest of the trilogy, as well as the rest of the games from this bundle.			"

												Most gamers would probably not be bothered by the content but I can't recommend this game to anyone that's sensitive to oppressive themes. Outside of the offensive content, the game is mediocre overall but possibly worth playing for fans of the genre.The good: The art is beautiful, the animation is great, the music is apt, and the voice acting is solid. These things are so good that I continued to play it despite feeling completely alienated by the story. The puzzles are thoroughly uninspired and lacking logical progression. I found myself just trying random things on many occasions.The mediocre: It doesn't bring anything new to the genre in terms of mechanics. The few non-offensive jokes and cultural references fell flat for me. The original german language is occasionally conspicuous in the voiceovers and subtitles.The bad: The writing was absolutely offensive to me from the outset. The main character, Rufus, is deeply misogynistic, disrespectful, and downright unlikable. But the offensiveness goes beyond rufus being a repulsive character, it's pervasive to almost every element of the game and betrays a deep bias in the writers and creators. The characters are almost entirely men, and the few that aren't are subject to intense scrutiny or objectification. Femininity is downright mocked. There is overt transmisogyny. There aren't any characters of color. Oppressive themes are used throughout as a crutch for weak and unoriginal writing. I certainly don't expect every game to be a paragon of feminism but this game is embarrasing.			"

												Deponia is a adventure game of the type I like the most. Challenging puzzles, cartoony 2D-graphics, no action elemements and a good humorous story.The best aspect of the game is probably the creative andsometimes quite challenging puzzles. In some adventure games the solution to a puzzle is almost immediately obvious because there are so few possible things to try. In Deponia trial and error is not a quick and easy approach, since there are many objects and lots of things to interact with. In particular in the first part of the game the puzzles require a bit of out of the box thinking without being unfair. Puzzles are also fairly varied and always feel like a natural part of the game rather than tacked on. My only complaint in this department is that the very end of the game is a bit anticlimactic in terms of puzzle difficulty.The story is humorous and entertaining with unique character. The humour doesn't always work, but there are moments of brilliance, and it worked often enough to keep me entertained throughout. The ending is a bit disappointing but it does leave things at an appropriate starting point for the sequel.The cartoony graphics are entirely appropriate given the general tone of the game and are high quality and quite distinctive. Characters each have their own unique appearance and do not look generic at all like they do in too many games.Voice acting is above average but not exceeptional. The music has a unique style that is very appropriate given the particular setting and is quite appealing too.All in all this is a highly recommended adventure game if you like pure point and click adventures with challenging puzzles and a healthy dose of humour.

												Review time for Deponia.Story- Deponia is a world of trash... literally. The people live in trash on top of mountains of trash making a living from trash. But for a brash, lazy, young Rufus, he wanted more. So in his latest hair-brained scheme to escape to Elesium, he saves a a damsel in distress from a militant group and finds himself mixed in a conspiracy that will affect everyone on Deponia. The story is a good bit of comedy in the vein of Lucas Arts ""The Curse of Monkey Island"" with memorable characters and involving plot twists. The world in the story is also very imaginative and filled with a lot of potetial for exploration. A+Graphics- Those who are familiar with ""The Curse of Monkey Island"" may see a lot of similarities in art style. It does show that many of the developers and artist were fans of Lucas Arts. But dispite similarities, this game is a whole new beast and completely original in character design and world creation and is every well done. The cutscenes are also very well done and is like looking at a cartoon television show. ASound- The voice acting in this game is spot on in terms of delivery, though the lip-sync can be terribly off which was a little bit destracting, but not unforgivable. As for the music... I LOVE THE MUSIC! There is a very good mix of ballads, a touch of hip-hop and just fun altogether. A+Gameplay- Simple, straight forward point and click interface with combining items for more items. If you've played old school adventure games before then it is very familiar territory. There is also a fair amount of challenges and puzzles that will keep you puzzled but if your stuck, there is an option to skip it. BOverall- A fantasic throw back for fans of old style P.O.C. games with a fantastic story, great characters and music that should not be missed. Highly recomended. A			"

												The puzzles are challenging, forcing you to adopt a non-traditional form of logic to solve them. The main character is so self-centered, he's delusional. Most importantly, the story is quite amusing and well written. The jokes range from cartoon slapstick to innuendo to bizzarre WTF situations. But the story, despite the juvenile humour, creates a full character arc. If you decide to play all the way to ""Goodbye Deponia"" you will be surprised by a beautiful and touching ending. I highly recommend this game if you want something that makes you think and experiment or a fun interactive story.			"

												(TL;DR: Don't buy it for more than 2€.) I'm an optimistic man that wants to like a game even if it has great weaknesses. I bought this one when it was like -90% on Steam holiday sale. The graphics and voices are excellent, also the music is great. But that's about it. I did want to finish it after I had been playing it for a while, but then after a while I was already waiting for the game to end as quickly as possible (sadly it didn't). I would never play it again and for the most part it is a waste of time. I am however still eager enough to quickly google the plot lines of the other 2 parts, so I guess the plot isn't that horrible. But I also would never buy it again, 2€ was the biggest price for the enjoyment that I got out of it, no disrespect. Every review I've read about it also agrees with me on this: the game isn't funny. It must've been only 1 or 2 times that I laughed during the whole game, and even then I wasn't rolling on the floor unable to breathe. I'm sorry to inform you, this one isn't worth your time or money.			"

Rufus brings chaos and ill-crafted plans with him everywhere he goes, wreaking havoc on the lives of all those around him. This point & click puzzle game was challenging at points, while most solutions were pretty straightforward if given enough thought to them.

												Deponia is a point-and-click adventure game reminiscent of the Lucasarts classics. It tells the story of eternal screwup and egomaniac Rufus and his efforts to escape the garbage-filled planet he lives on to reach a floating city, Elysium.All in all, the game is well paced, funny, and the right mix of challenging and logical. There was no singular moment where I was just baffled over an answer, though the game does offer large enviroments that can sometimes be overwhelming.If you are a fan of the genre, this game (and it's sequels) should definitely be in your collection, but it certainly won't be worth it to those who are not.

												★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Well, it's not so bad and may be even worth playing if you have some time to spend and if you like point and click adventure games with classical 2D graphics.Unfortunatelly there is a few puzzles, which are simply illogical and frustrating (e.g. you need to perform quite lond sequence of proper actions to move the story forward or you need to repeat some action a few times with literally no clue that it makes sense to try once again). The story is fine and finishing the game gives a great satisfaction, but using obligatory walthrough (due to aforementioned blockers) make it less enjoyable.I'm goint to buy next two chapters. As far as I know the second and the third part of the game is much better, with well balanced puzzles and equaly good story.			"

												Daedelic adventure graphics at its best, even though Deponia is garbage planet full of trash, it look great. The main protagonist is selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you cannot help it but to really like him. Deponia has enough humor and great characters to keep you interested in playing until the end.			"

												I cannot praise this game enough. It is worth every single penny. It is smart and an unreasonable amount of fun.I don't like Point&Click games - at least that's what I thought Deponia blew my mind.The character you play, Rufus, is a constant thief, tries out everything no matter how much harm it does and generally is an egocentric who doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about other people's feelings... Which, actually is the incarnation of how you automatically act when playing an Point&Click adventure.I love Deponia for this kind of subtle, intelligent humor. I love Rufus. And I love Daedalic for developing another sequel, Deponia: Doomsday. The adventure isn't over yet! Hurray!			"

												Deponia is literally a dump that Rufus is desperate to leave at the expensive of his friends and his ex, for reasons that are not immediatley apparent. This pretty much makes him a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, but once past this initial premise, Deponia provides a fun point and click ride.Its full of humour aimed in all directions, jibes at characters, adventure game tropes and even at the player trying all combos to progress, it genuinely puts a smile on your face.The puzzles are well paced, starting in confined areas and expanding the world as you go. The story might not be that deep and certain characters don't always work, but the dialogue is strong, the scenery is lovely and the situations the characters end up in keep you invested. Two thumbs up from me..			"

Overall:  It's a good point and click adventure.  I absolutely recommend if it's on sale.  Whether you want to pay full price is up to how much of a point and click enthusiast you are.Story: Slow start, but I was hooked the moment Rufus tormented Toni in her shop.  Many point and click adventures have degrees of moon logic where a nonsensical combination of items and actions somehow solves the problem, but Deponia makes it somehow seem almost rational in hindsight.  Rufus often made me simultaneously gasp in horror and laugh at some of the stunts he pulled on his fellow Deponians.Gameplay:  It has a moderate amount of pixel hunting.  Some of the scenes are extremely cluttered and can make finding the one thing needed difficult.  The majority of puzzles aren't terribly hard to figure out, though some of them require patient trial and error or a quick google search.			"

												Pros:-Great humor ( a little dark, so keep that in mind ) -Awesome animation-Storyline was inventive and easy to fall in love with-Rufus is now my bf.

												Buyer beware, this game might not work on your computer. I have a very up to date desktop system and the game still refused to start. It kept having errors either saying the file was corrupted or didn't exist no matter how many times I installed it. I read somewhere that changes to the visual settings help... Still said corrupted. I read that it only works on older systems for some reason, tried it on an old laptop, still didn't work. Did more research which said the game needed a missing DLL file. Another source said it was an error in DirectX....After many unsuccessful attempts to get the game just to start, I asked for a refund which was granted almost immediately by steam. I think Daedalic recently released a patch for Deponia, but I don't believe it resolves any startup issues. Sadly, I can't say how the actual game is because I never got to play it. That's way more effort than anyone should ever have to put into installing a simple point & click game.  This was my experience, you might not have any problems. I have friends with older systems who have played Deponia without issue. I'm leaving a negative review so that other people will be aware that Deponia has this game-breaking glitch upon startup. I recommend testing the game out as soon as possible after purchase so if you have similar problems, you'll still be in Steam's timeframe for a refund.			"

												Well, I'm a bit on the fence on this one. I'll lean slightly towards recommending it. I have played many point and click games in my life and feel like I'm pretty good at figuring out some of the more interesting clues, but with Deponia I found some of them rather confusing. I ended up looking through a walkthrough more with this game that any other I've played.Sure, it has humour and an amusing story, but it was more annoying that anything. While I'd be interested to find out where the story goes with the other three, I'm kinda glad I didn't buy them all at once.While the voice acting was good, the sound was often a little all over the place. Sometimes the voices were loud, other times they seemed almost background. There were bugs in some levels and the puzzles were not always intuative.  And writing this review has actually pushed me back over the line, so I am not recommending this game.			"

												While Telltale have, to much acclaim, been moving the adventure genre in a new, more serious, direction, Daedalic have been working away at old school point and click games, focusing on visual style, witty writing and great characterisation. Deponia places you in the shoes of Rufus, a rather arrogant, unlikable and hilariously callous protagonist, as he attempts to escape his dull life on the titular garbage planet. Along the way players will take blood from a mechanical bull, gas a parrot, contend with cross dressing receptionists and participate in the ancient and arcane ritual of espresso-making. Deponia is clearly a game in the tradition of Monkey Island series, with a manic and  oddball approach to its world building. It's also a worthy sucessor to those games, and well worth a look.			"

												Welcome to one of the silliest-and funniest-point-and-clicks you will ever play, right next to old standby classics such as Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Deponia is a wonderfully constructed game, following our overly-sure-of-himself, arrogant, egotistical and occasionally adorkable main character through a world constructed of garbage... That's actually attractive. Far from being a dystopia, life seems particularly pleasant in the world of Deponia, relfected in the interesting places and characters you see along your journey.Beautiful environents, laugh-out-loud humor and intruiging plot and characters will keep you entertained, and encourage you to buy the sequels, which are every bit what this one is.Hurrah, he's off now goodbye!-Camolot			"

Many parts of the puzzles make no sense, and I could think of many easier ways to do them. The fact that the game gives you no tips or guidance what so ever doesn't help matters.    However, the concept and atmosphere are very captivating. The characters are believable, the artwork is pretty, the music is great, the world is intrigueing and I found myself wanting to know more about how it came to be.   There is fun to be had here, and it was worth the €2 I payed for it. I will not be buying the sequels however, and I will only recommend buying this game if it is at a heavily discounted price.			"

												It was an okay game. Some parts were difficult to get through as this game was sexist, homophobic, and transphobic. The main character is the ""typical"" egotistic, lazy, and dirty minded male. The plot is focus on Rufus attempting to leave Deponia, lugging around an unconscious damsel in distress, and then switching out her BRAIN IMPLANT for his benefit. Worst of all her name is GOAL! Really, that is her name!  Point and click adventures are a genre I enjoy, and it was sad to see such a difference in gaming experience between this and Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. The puzzles themselves were enjoyable and there were moments of humor in good taste. Overall, I would not have bought this game knowing what it truly was, and ignored the very positive reviews. If you like a game that has sexism woven throughout, then this is a game you most likely will enjoy!			"

One of the best point and click games I have played so far.Story - Some people may get annoyed by the attitude of the main character but just bear with the first parts of the story and see how everything turns out. It's totally worth it. The pacing of the development of the story and the main character is just right. From someone who's so egotistic to someone heroic.Visuals - I can say that the artstyle used is quite relaxing, at least for me.Gameplay - The usual point and click game. Find some objects, solve puzzles, engage in conversations to get some clues. Beware of the WTF-ish solutions the main character has for some problems, though. I don't usually check Google for walkthroughs but there are just some parts in this game that left me no choice. Haha.Music - Nothing worth remem.... WAIT. There is. The Chorus guy! "

												Deponia is a Point & Click game and the first part of a trilogy, preceding Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.The game takes place on the planet Deponia, a real discharge on a large scale. At a distance floats a paradisiac platform, Elysium, reserved for rich people and inaccessible for the inhabitants of Deponia. We control Rufus, a clumsy character with an outsize ego, which loathes the household and working, and wishes only a thing: leave Deponia for Elysium. During an attempt to leave Deponia, Rufus meets Goal, a young inhabitant of Elysium who's here by mistake. He thus decides to return her at home, while hoping to be able to take advantage of it to join Elysium.All right, the scenario is not very original, we stay in the classic pattern of a prince who has to save the princess. But the universe is very nice, rather funny, both by the mind of the characters and by the nonsense of some situations. The gameplay is simple, we collect objects, then we combine them with other objects in the inventory to interact with the elements of the screen. Furthermore, by pressing on the space bar, we can locate at once the elements which we can interact, even if it is never very complicated to find them.Deponia is reminiscent of one of the pillars of the Point and Click, one of my favorite games: Monkey Island. Even if this latter remains much better, we do not remain indifferent to Deponia, to its cartoon animations, its colored universe, its musics and sound effects. Deponia should take you till 10 hours of game to end it. At the end of the game, you unlock the mode Droggeljug, completely useless, which replace all the names and conversations by the word ""Droggeljug"". But it's fun! :)			"

												The game is great after you learn the shortcuts, such as double clicking on doorways and arches automatically take you through them (very helpful in the town). Left clicking skips dialogue that appears in the speech bubbles, which is helpful if you're a fast reader.I really like point and click adventures, and I do reccomend the game, but the main character is such an annoying scumbag. In the beginning I thought he was funny with a sarcastic side. However, he only cares about himself, as the other characters with remind you constantly, and what was once humorous about him gets annoying after a short a while.The game felt rather short though, and due to the main character, I can't say I would want to play the other Deponia games because he's just too much to sit through.

												First of all, if you are point & click game fan you probably have this game and just visited a store page for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason.However, most people do not have that much experience with this genre, and I'm one of them. For this kind of people this game is not must-have, but I bet they would love the dialogues and the story. It's brilliant. The writers did really good job creating unique characters with great voice actors, I love each and every of them. The graphics are nice and quite detailed with some steam-punk elements.So if you are not into point & click games and still doubt whether this game is for you, wait for the sales and buy it, it's definitely worth it.Droggeljug/Droggeljug "

												Personally, I have never been a fan of point and click games, however, Deponia has entirely changed that. I originally batted about the idea of purchasing Deponia because the art style really appealed to me, but I was put off by the play style and the price. However, when it came on sale for £0.79 I snapped it up without a second thought, as, even if I were only to use it for artistic reference, I knew I wouldn’t regret spending that on it. It is probably the best thing I’ve ever bought for under a pound. Immediately, I was hooked. It is fun and immersive, and, though it appears to have some childish tones, the dialogue and extremely well-developed characters provide many humorous moments and you start to see that it is rather adult in its comedic value. Then there’s the difficulty. I never imagined that a point and click adventure would prove so taxing! The hidden objects, the combinations required, the little puzzles and the specific orders required for the completion of tasks often left me scratching my head and, I will admit, if I hadn’t had the opportunity to glance at a walk through on the odd occasion, I doubt I would be anywhere near completing it right now (though I avoided using the guide as much as possible, of course). I’ve still not unlocked all of the achievements! I am not entirely sure whether it has a lot of replay value, but I know I will be coming back to it simply because I will miss the atmosphere and the quirky characters! And I will admit, though Rufus is an egocentric jerk and possibly one of the worst boyfriends in gaming history, he is very loveable and under it all, a real sweetheart.The only thing I can complain about with Deponia is the fact that it is too short, and the prices on the series are a bit high for my liking, but the moment the sequels come on sale I will be snapping them up! So yes, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. It is beautiful, the sound track is super funky, the characters are funny and unique and it does supply a good challenge to keep your mind occupied. Plus, my toothbrush ran away and hid in a dark corner, mocking me from the shadows, and I made coffee out of battery acid and gave it to a cat who licked stamps… What’s not to love? 10/10 "

												Click everything you seeDeponia is your standard point and click adventure game that lacks a soul just like German knock knock jokes. Fortunately, it's just funny and pretty enough to keep playing.STORY- Typical anti-hero doing typical anti-hero things on a garbage planet.GRAPHICS- The art style and animation is actually very appealing, one thing Daedalic Entertainment has had a strong point in.SOUNDTRACK- Something Daedalic Entertainment does not have a strong point in. (Except the intro, the intro is awesome)GAMEPLAY-    Pros-   You click stuff   The dialogue can be amusing   Deponia is a planet overflown with trash   Cons-   You click stuff. Like you literally end up clicking everything because you have no idea how you're supposed to get a certain task done. Then when you find the solution, you rage at the randomness of the solution.   The dialogue can be the opposite of amusing (Gotta love cultural barriers)   Everyone is an♥♥♥♥♥ Even you (Especially you). Almost all your conversations are with asses.   Late game puzzles are confusing as hell (well for me)   There is no replay value. (There is a mode post game where it changes all dialogue to druggelburg or something. Is that supposed to be funny?)CONCLUSION-It's an average point and click adventure game with an appealing art style as its main saving grace. Daedalic really had a chance to make this a great game due to such a unique world setting, but looks like they're all talk. Get it on sale if you have the urge for point and click adventures. However be warned, the sequels in this trilogy are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. TL; DR If you like mindles click spam puzzle games that require zero logic, then I guess you should get it.The story is not too bad and the graphics are really nice.  .......but.What made me give a negative review is the puzzle solving mechanism which is just..horrible. 95% of the time there are absolutely no hints or clues about what you have to do next. You picked up some items because you cliked on everything that was clickable; tho using this items requires multiple spamming, usually just trying to use every item from your inventory on an object (only to find out neither of those are meant to be used and then doing the same on next object, etc.), or trying to connect all the items in your inventory together in hope you're going to craft something useful. And sometimes these crafted objects made absolutely zero sense.The walking and overall moving was very badly done and often very very annoying, and the jokes are just.. Not funny. I can see it tries hard to be funny but it's just not. Also the characters are one of the most annoying I have ever met in the game.I finished the game, but I had to keep the walktrough opened at all times because at most times I had zero idea about what to do next since there is absolutely no hints.I hope the other sequels are done better on this point.

												Deponia is a great point-and-click adventure game with really well-implemented puzzle mechanics. As you progress through the game, you will encounter puzzle-like situations that is so well-blended with the story it makes you feel like you're creating the next scenes, or like you're leading the story by solving these puzzles. The game's difficulty is also definitely fair, as you're often given clues on how to solve difficult puzzles if you look around the environment. Not to mention that the following results of your actions in the game are, more often than not, hilarious as hell (or at least I find wreaking havoc, destroying things and ruining people's day pretty damn comedic). But if not for the puzzles or comedy, I at least found the story very compelling (made me sat through the whole game in one day).Definitely would recommend this game, or even the whole trilogy, to anyone who wants a giggle or those who simply enjoy good puzzles and good story.

												One of the better adventure game series to come along in quite a while.  This series of games is basically the offspring of the old Lucasarts and Sierra adventure games (more the former than the latter).  It features slightly warped humor, interesting multi-step puzzles that [mostly] make sense once you put the pieces together, with cool cut scenes and an ongoing story line that will actually make you want to play the sequels.  As of this writing, it's part of a completely nutty sale (for like a buck)...at that price, you'd be insane not to buy it.			"

												I am not a fan of point-and-click games, but Deponia makes it just a an easy stress-free medium by being a point-and-click release. You hardly seem to notice that after you play the game for a while, because the flow of it is that smooth. The story itself isn't anything mind blowing, but it is captivating to make you go back until you find out what the future holds for Rufus. As for Rufus himself, there were times when I would get just downright annoyed by how much of an egocentric egomaniac he truly was, but he had me back on his side with his goofy humor. The rest of Deponia's inhabitants have their undoubtful charm, Lottie in particular. The cut-scenes are hilarious at times, the whole ""science"" and ""philosophy"" in game are completely absurd (along with their love counsel) and thus gut-busting. The graphics themselves are pleasant to the eye, even though most of them depict what essentially is a junkyard. They add to the absurdity of the game. In general, great game if you just want to relax and laugh a lot, without playing games that all give you the same feel of over-chewed gum. In terms of being a point-and-click game it convinced me to look more into these, maybe I'll find more of such gems.			"

												From the makers of ''The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav''. ''Deponia'' is a game developed and pubished by Daedalic Entertainment.Preface!Due to this game being ''story driven'', I am not going to go into mush detail or spoil anything major of the Story. The story centers around Rufus: a young, sarcastic, bold, lying, selfish man who wants to leave the junk town of Kovaq - a town Rufus has known for so long - and look for his, not-so known, father. Rufus believes his father abandoned him for the floating city of Elysium when Rufus was very young.And so, Rufus makes it his ultimate destiny to go to Elysium; to prove his own father that Rufus can go to Elysium.During Rufus Journey, he ends up meeting people and they end up helping him on his travel.The tone of the story is comedy mixed with seriousness. About 95% of the game is comedy while the small 5% is seriousness. I can't say in which part the game gets serious.The ending of the game, in a way, touched my heart. I can't say  in detail of what happened in the ending, but it got to do with all Rufus had done during his Jouney.I like Deponias' animation. The animation is hand drawn. The animation suits well with the comedic tone of the game.Deponia is a hard point-and-click game and is a lot more harder than ''The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav''.Items do not ''highlight'' when you hover over them with something else.There is no quest log... so... you are probably going to wander aimlessly around in the game and be like ''uhmm... what am I suppose do again?''.I recommend this game to people who wants a challengine Point-and-click game.Deponia gets an 8/10.

												Loved it! Funny, I had to stop playing for a while, because I could'nt stop laughing.Best Trilogie puzzle game.The three games are as good as the other, and it is not repetitive.The main caracter is stupiddly funny and genius at the same time.Good story, fun puzzles, some more chalenging then others. Very fun, I recommand all three.Love that at some point in the trilogie you get to play multiple characters at the same time, and your actions have a repercautions on you other parts. Loved it!!!At some point you really have to think hard, but it's worth every minute of play time. And I will play them again, because the story is so fun. ** The trilogie is composed of : Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia			"

												I love Point & Click Adventure games, so my opinion may be a little biased.  The humor in this series is great, and the original quirky story concept is quite amusing.  I enjoy having a protagonist that's a bird-brain, so this series is a good fit for me.  The love all the vivid colors, and all the original music tracks.			"

												This is a hard game to review.   It's a game with a strong storyline and some genuinely funny dialogue.  The puzzles occasionally lack much logic and can sometimes only be solved through guesswork (or by referring to a walkthrough) but this is a common problem with point-and-click adventure games and I would say that it's no worse than its peers in that regard.However, it's not a game that everyone will enjoy.    Whereas other adventure game characters like Guybrush Threepwood are hapless and inept, the protagonist of this game, Rufus, is rude, selfish, callous, sexist and egocentric.   This is a protagonist who you should probably not identify with or even sympathise with (although you probably will as you get drawn into the narrative)The humour is mostly derived from Rufus creating plans that go wrong and behaving in such a way as to cause misery and misfortune to those around them.   This is of course a well-established form of black comedy and I think that most people will be able to take it as it was intended.However, there are a number of jokes that contain elements that are as likely to cause offence and upset rather than amusement.   There are three main instances of this (from the entire trilogy):- One character is depicted in a very transphobic light- One character suffers through a racially demeaning situation (due to the protagonist)- One character is a paedophileThese are all intended as jokes and the author of the game has clarified that racially charged scene was not meant to convey a positive message about racism (the humour is derived from how awful the situation is) but it may still limit the ability of some people to enjoy the game.If you particularly enjoy point-and-click games and can tolerate the occasionally moment of humour in bad taste then you will enjoy this game.   If you are sensitive about racism, transphobia or sex crime then you may find that some jokes spoil your ability to enjoy the rest of the game. "

												Deponia is a fun 2D puzzle game, and is a throwback to some of the 90's childhood games I first owned on a PC. The game includes an entertaining story, as well as a variety of challenging puzzles. I have a love-hate relation with the story, but in the end I'd recommend this game to anyone interested in the Puzzle genre.			"

												A fantastic adventure game, featuring some extremely intelligent riddles that require deep thinking. At the same time, it narrates a beautiful story, one that takes place in a setting very different than those of most adventure games. Recommended for everyone interested in the genre, It offers a classic, challenging gameplay, which should be enough to keep fans of the adventures games playing till they finish it. The controls and voice acting is top notch. The storyline is humerous and fun. However, the ending was a total buildup for the second installment. A tad dissapointing. There is about 8 - 15 hours of gameplay, depending how long it takes you to do the puzzles. At best the game is worth only $15. Seeing how you will most likely need all three installments for some closer, the total package could be worth $30 if you get about 10 hours of gameplay out of each installment. I will get the other installments when they go on sale.			"

												With a unique world setting, and a well-drawn cartoon-style art direction, Deponia brings back a traditional style point-and-click game for the modern age.This naturally means it will feel a bit slow compared to todays games, but it's about using the mind... even if some of the solutions to the problems seem a little far-fetched. The story itself is actually not that long nor does much really happen. Most of your time is spent trying to figure out how to do the smallest of tasks. Regardless, it's still a decent story and worth a playthrough, especially if you like point-and-click adventures.6/10 ""Okay""			"

If you kind of miss the old Lucas Arts adventure games, this will be an adequate (if imperfect) addition to your collection.  The game pads a bit with dialogue, but they make up for it with decent art style.			"

Deponia is the best point n' click game I've played since the genre died out around ten years ago. Most of the puzzles are fresh, the setting is on par with Lucasarts classics and the music made it enjoyable to stay on the same screens for hours trying to figure out the more difficult parts. And the humor hits the spot. And the voice overs are great. And the story is cool. I'm running out of adjectives, just play it already!			"

The only plot part I didn't really like was the ending, either I didn't understand something or there was a plot hole involved.All in all still a very fun game to play, with a nice story and ambientation, I recommend it.p.s. DURATION: 9 hours. That's the time it took me on the first playthrough, with few small aids from a walkthrough, but listening to all dialogues, and trying every dialogue option (as much as I could).

												[Edit: The standalone game has now been patched as well. This means I can recommend the game, with the caveat of checking current special offers (vs The Complete Journey). Leaving the original review below since the bait-and-switch still DID occur.]Good game BUT a word of warning:Deponia and it's sequels are since september 2014 presumably abandonware. Instead of patching the remaining bugs of the separate games the developer/publisher Daedalic decided to release an all-in-one title called Deponia: The Complete Journey. It's a completely new separate title, not a 'pack' containing the previous games, so there is no way to upgrade from the standalone titles. It also does not create giftable versions of the titles you already own.If you are new to the game and want to buy and play Deponia (which is a terrific and fun Point-and-Click) get The Complete Journey.Personally I think this move is blatantly unfriendly to early adopters and existing customers and would probably not buy anything from Daedalic again, let alone this new all-in-one version.

												Well, I'm a bit on the fence on this one. I'll lean slightly towards recommending it. I have played many point and click games in my life and feel like I'm pretty good at figuring out some of the more interesting clues, but with Deponia I found some of them rather confusing. I ended up looking through a walkthrough more with this game that any other I've played.Sure, it has humour and an amusing story, but it was more annoying that anything. While I'd be interested to find out where the story goes with the other three, I'm kinda glad I didn't buy them all at once.While the voice acting was good, the sound was often a little all over the place. Sometimes the voices were loud, other times they seemed almost background. There were bugs in some levels and the puzzles were not always intuative.  And writing this review has actually pushed me back over the line, so I am not recommending this game.			"

												Buyer beware, this game might not work on your computer. I have a very up to date desktop system and the game still refused to start. It kept having errors either saying the file was corrupted or didn't exist no matter how many times I installed it. I read somewhere that changes to the visual settings help... Still said corrupted. I read that it only works on older systems for some reason, tried it on an old laptop, still didn't work. Did more research which said the game needed a missing DLL file. Another source said it was an error in DirectX....After many unsuccessful attempts to get the game just to start, I asked for a refund which was granted almost immediately by steam. I think Daedalic recently released a patch for Deponia, but I don't believe it resolves any startup issues. Sadly, I can't say how the actual game is because I never got to play it. That's way more effort than anyone should ever have to put into installing a simple point & click game.  This was my experience, you might not have any problems. I have friends with older systems who have played Deponia without issue. I'm leaving a negative review so that other people will be aware that Deponia has this game-breaking glitch upon startup. I recommend testing the game out as soon as possible after purchase so if you have similar problems, you'll still be in Steam's timeframe for a refund.			"

												You play as Rufus, who aspires to escape the junk world of Deponia to the utopia of Elysium. But his biggest obstacle? Himself. Rufus is an anti-hero. He is incompetent and somewhat of a scoundral (the latter becomes more apparent in the sequels). This differentiates Deponia from other adventure games. The player is not just overcoming external forces, but also rectifying Rufus's mishaps.  Deponia is a comedy. And it plays that part pretty well. As a puzzler, it does okay. Many of the puzzles are quite mathematical and would therefore force the player to seek brute force solutions. Other puzzles require the player to formulate outlandishly complicated solutions to simple problems. Hints are sparse and unhelpful.There is a lot of love that went into this game. The artwork, music, voice acting and scripting are very well done. And for an adventure game, there is a lot of material. The game should last about 10 hours on average.			"

He wants to leave Deponia, but he can't just let people call Deponians trash. The planet? Yeah it's trash, but the people mean well and are just trying to get by, and are in no way trash.

												Score: 8/10The first installment of a three part series went better then expected. I've heard mostly that it is a mediocre adventure game. I personally like the way the humor plays out in the game. You're a selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has occasional moments of heroism which almost always get sidetracked by being selfish again. The planet full of junk and the steam punk vibe works well especially with the chorus yelling hazzah hazzah all the time during new chapters. The actual gameplay puzzles are ok, but nothing remarkable as they suffer from typical adventure game issues. As an example you sometimes just don't realize that two things which don't seem related create a blow gun for instance.			"

												Deponia is a comedic point & click adventure game very similar to the Lucas Arts classics Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle.I'm assuming that you are already familiar with the genre, so I'll keep this short and sweet.Pros:  Fluid animation, high resolution graphics, good soundtrack, interesting plot, funny dialog.Cons:  Puzzles are thrown in with arbitrary handicaps and do not contribute to the plot or integrate well.  The writers got lazy a few times and used the item descriptions from looking at an object as the narration when using the item as well.  It gets annoying hearing the same line multiple times when exploring or experimenting.Recommendation: If you like this sort of game, get it.  You can always look up a walkthrough to deal with the puzzles.  Warning: This comedy in a later episode gets quite dark.  If you cannot stomach Southpark type humor, then you're better off skipping this trilogy.			"

												This game was decently fun. I don't usually play point and click adventure puzzle games but this one is a lot of fun. I wasn't crazy about the cliffhanger ending and I think they should have just combined both deponia games into one. It's very much like the monkey Island games albeit a bit short. Some of the time I could get through the puzzles on my own while other times I used a walkthrough. Still it is good fun though I wouldn't spend much more then a buck or two on it.			"

												It's alright. Deponia is a point-and-click adventure with at least some of the obtuse and convoluted puzzle solving that genre entails. I liked the story as it was certainly interesting, but the character you control is entirely without depth or real personality. Technically speaking, it's an unoptomized mess that runs very poorly and is riddled with bugs.Thankfully, the game allows skipping puzzles because there exists a bug that not only makes one of the puzzles incoherent and unsolvable through normal means, but, even given a working solution, it will not allow progress beyond the puzzle.It's short, but fun. Get it when it's cheap.			"

												""It's kind of pathetic: you get all erratic, about dirty dishes congesting the sink.I'm tired of your bothers; remember our fathers, who dwelled in a world filled with rubbish and stink...""And so the story begins. Deponia is the tale of Rufus, the son of the man who founded Rufus's hometown of Kuvaq and subsequently disappeared, and his attempts to escape the junk-strewn planet of Deponia. During one of his infamous ""perfect"" plans, he runs into a girl from the romanticized, junk-free world of Elysium, nearby.The two become wrapped in each other's quests, for better or for worse. Rufus is stuck with Goal, because she's his only ticket out of this dump, and Goal is stuck with Rufus because, well, she's unconscious, and she doesn't really have any say in the matter. Plus he's the person with the closest thing to her best interests at heart, between the town of Kuvaq, who wish to keep her as a trophy resident, and the Organon who seemingly have their own agenda.Rufus is not the most selfless hero. In fact, he's rather vain and self-centered. He manages to pull it off and remain endearing, however - at least to the audience. His neighbors in Kuvaq are painfully tired of his absent-minded and often quite dangerous (to Rufus, and everyone else in a several mile radius) plans and experiments. In a way, maybe I find Rufus endearing because he reminds me so much of, well, me. He's lazy, but dreams big, and feels he deserves to be the one to make it simply because he wants it more.Deponia's a silly game, the kind where great bodily harm is often cartoonishly shrugged off when it's not important to the plot. It made me laugh quite a few times, and most of the characters are well-written and well-voiced. The Organon bug me, with their loud, crackly, sort-of-digitized voices, but most of the others sound alright to downright enjoyable. The music is a perfect fit, evoking the rattling and banging of garbage, while still remaining pleasant to listen to. I'm quite fond of the bar theme in particular, to the point where I would sometimes stop in at the place even after I had no business left there, simply to listen for awhile. The world is beautifully drawn, and most importantly, interesting. There are surprises everywhere, and the world itself is rather unusual, and nicely characterized as you go about your journey.The puzzles are challenging, without ever seeming unfair. You do have kind of an unusual amount of ""gather cleaning supplies and clean this thing off"" puzzles, but then this IS a planet covered in discarded scrap and refuse, so it's at least justified. On the whole, Deponia's puzzles and style feel to me like a proper evolution of the classic Lucasarts SCUMM adventures. The sense of humor, however, is unique, and I love it. It really feels like Daedalic had fun writing and designing this game, and I'm glad, because I had fun playing it.It's not the longest adventure game, but it's long enough (I clocked about 11 hours of quality adventuring on my playthrough), and I absolutely cannot wait to play the next installment in the Deponia trilogy.And that folk-singer narrator guy ruled!""HUZZAH, HE'S OFF NOW, GOODBYE!""

												I really like this game a lot. While not 100% up to par with a great Lucasarts Point and Click, this gets the job done and scratches that itch quite well.  The artwork is beautiful.  The music is great.  The only thing is that the game can have some weird responsiveness from time to time and it's not always as smooth as you'd like.  I have the second one, but haven't played it yet.  I plan on buying the third.  Great story... a fun play, for sure.			"

												Point and click adventure. It's pretty funny and really well put together. These things can be rather dialogue heavy but this one seems at a good level for my liking.Puzzles are good from what I've seen so far. Difficult but logical and satisfying.Full price is £16 atm which seems a bit ott for my money. If you like this kind of thing, it's well worth picking up on a 75% off deal though.			"

												To be fair, I started this game because it had a great art style and was a point-and-click adventure (a genre I never really got into). The story ended up being more expansive than I expected at the start, and the quirky character Rufus was really relatable as I helped him towards the goal of Elysium.This game can get really frustrating, because after you figure out most puzzles it doesn't end well for Rufus. After I'd made Rufus' rocket and hit the ship from Elysium, I had to watch him simply fall back to Deponia and continue droning on about escaping with Goal (enough to nearly make me quit the game).Overall, Rufus is a good character with a bunch of puns and a snappy attitude. He doesn't appreciate his friends as much as he should, so most of what happens really seems to be up to his karma. I love the art style and puzzles (although they can be terribly hard), and the music is impossible to get out of your head.			"

												Deponia, in old school terms is an excellent adventure game. The controls are smooth, graphics are simply awesome. Dialogues and scenario are very well thought. The character (while some may not like him) is so well developed that you can build a link with him. Even the 1st episode of this game is quite long. And with the second and final episodes out it's as long as you want it to be (let me put it this way, without a walkthrough it'll take 60+ hours to finish all 3, not to mention walkthroughs spoil adventure games). The downsides are, the puzzles are a little too obvious some times, and it's a little expensive in total, so try to buy them on sale.			"

Sure, not every joke hits it's mark (three of which in particular in Goodbye Deponia are seriously in bad taste), but any missteps aside it still reaches it's Goal.Concering all three games:I don't think it would be fair to just say it has good writing and leave it at that. It's incredibly unqiue in what it does and how it aims to achieve it. The main character and many of the puzzles, and the plot that unfolds as a result of the puzzles is an interesting deconstruction of the genre. The story is often cheesy at times, but by the end it will blindslide you with the message it's trying to send. That message is powerful, and isn't one you see every day. It's ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.			"

Deponia is the best point n' click game I've played since the genre died out around ten years ago. Most of the puzzles are fresh, the setting is on par with Lucasarts classics and the music made it enjoyable to stay on the same screens for hours trying to figure out the more difficult parts. And the humor hits the spot. And the voice overs are great. And the story is cool. I'm running out of adjectives, just play it already!			"

												Highly amusing. Storyline is delicious. Puzzles mostly play out in a sort of absurd intuitive way, like the punchline to a joke (sometimes they're hard to get, but seem obvious once you do).Though I've found that point-and-click games can be frustrating, this one has helpful features like skippable minigames and showing what's actually click-able.I've also found myself humming the music several times.If it even slightly interests you, try the demo out.

												This is a funny point 'n click game. I like the fact that you are not obligated to do the mini puzzles to get on with the story. The main character Rufus is an annoying, but somehow likeable character. The story is well constructed, it even made me buy the second game Chaos on DeponiaI bought this with a discount. Even though I really like this game, I would not spend the full price on this. 20 euros is too much, but if you can get it for 5 euros or less, don't hesitate to buy.			"

												I have played many adventure games before, ranging from the old Lucas Arts games to the newer adventure games like The Wolf Among Us and I have to say Deponia is an amazing game. Every inch of this game is as great as its predecessors.The artwork is nicely done, the music fits every scene greatly and the story along with the characters is funny and lovable.I would rate this game a 10/10 in my book, as it is a nice throwback to old adventure games and I enjoyed every minute I played of it. Trust me, buy this game. You won't be disappointed.			"

												This won't be a glowing review. I'll recommend it, but with reservations. If it's on sale for $3.50 or less and you want an interesting, fairly unique story, along with some good adventure game puzzles, then it's a good buy. For any more than that, don't waste your time.So, I'm not an adventure game kinda guy. I didn't like Myst at all, and never got around to many other point-and-click's. A lot felt like pixel hunting and didn't have very logical puzzle solutions. There's very few of those moments in Deponia. Holding the spacebar will reveal all the available hotspots, and many of the solutions make sense. Naturally some seem a little over-complicated, but given the items you're allowed to use they make more sense.The story is interesting, and I found it quite unique. It doesn't give you any agency to change outcomes, but the dialogue driving it is, for the most part, witty and funny.The music is awesome and indeed, the chorus guys rule.Now the bad.This game is horribly, horribly unoptimized. I understand that a few players haven't had any issues, but I spent a lot of time reading the forums and I'm certain that I had every issue mentioned by anyone, and at least one that I didn't see mentioned.The game chugs. I'm not certain why it drops performance so bad, but it does. At first, I thought the animations just had low framerates (The walking animations are fine, as well as the movies by the way. I'm talking about the mouse cursor and inventory screen animations), but at one point there was a sound effect happening in the background at a regular interval. When I pulled up my inventory, or when I pressed spacebar to reveal the hot-spots, the sound effect slowed down by at least half. The game seems to run at around 30fps normally, but was dropping to as low as 5fps during these particular times. I really don't know why a point-and-click should be so resource intensive on a machine that can comfortably run AAA games at high settings.Also, there are a few bugs with not being able to hit certain hotspots at certain times. Trying to exit the listening post is an example. There are workarounds such as talking to the guy who's up there first, but pressing spacebar reveals the exit arrow as an option, so I see no reason it shouldn't be one immediately.The minecart minigame with the correct solution would not allow me to progress. Thankfully they allow you to skip it. Still, that seems like an awful cop-out.One more, that I didn't see anyone ask about, is that the dialogue options would occasionally appear partially above the frame they're enclosed in, thereby obscuring some of the options. Or the options would appear partially below the frame, and therefore partially off-screen thereby rendering some options un-clickable. Cycling through the dialogue options usually fixed the problem. Again, the problem should not exist in the first place.Don't be fooled by the settings, changing them changed nothing about how the game reacted on my machine. Texture compression, weather effects, anything, they all ran exactly the same.Don't be fooled by the demo. The demo ran fine on my machine, full framerates and no dialogue, hotspot, or puzzle issues at all. These were definitely not indicative of the state of the full game.To wrap things up, the game has an interesting story, I like the art style, and it's mostly funny. But, those developers did a terrible job with their QA. Don't buy the game if it's not on sale.			"

												Well what can I say?  If you're looking for a frustration free game, this isn't the one!  Even with a walkthrough, if you don't do certain things in a certain order, then you have to go back to hopefully an earlier save point and try again.  The only thing is you don't know where that certain spot in the game is at, so you don't know when to save it.  I finished the game but I had to go back quite a few times until I got each part right.So you might want to pass on this one.			"

The game really shines with its beautiful enviornments, memorable characters(especially the main character, Rufus), entertaining story, and overall good sense of humor.  However, just like a lot of other point and click adventures it suffers from a lack of conveyance.  The puzzles can be vague and even downright nonsensical at times, while others can be somewhat rewarding.  If you're not sure about it try the demo, it gives you a good sense of what the game and it's puzzles are like.			"

												The puzzles are challenging, forcing you to adopt a non-traditional form of logic to solve them. The main character is so self-centered, he's delusional. Most importantly, the story is quite amusing and well written. The jokes range from cartoon slapstick to innuendo to bizzarre WTF situations. But the story, despite the juvenile humour, creates a full character arc. If you decide to play all the way to ""Goodbye Deponia"" you will be surprised by a beautiful and touching ending. I highly recommend this game if you want something that makes you think and experiment or a fun interactive story.			"

I personally like the way the humor plays out in the game. You're a selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has occasional moments of heroism which almost always get sidetracked by being selfish again. The planet full of junk and the steam punk vibe works well especially with the chorus yelling hazzah hazzah all the time during new chapters. The actual gameplay puzzles are ok, but nothing remarkable as they suffer from typical adventure game issues. As an example you sometimes just don't realize that two things which don't seem related create a blow gun for instance.			"

												Deponia is a comedic point & click adventure game very similar to the Lucas Arts classics Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle.I'm assuming that you are already familiar with the genre, so I'll keep this short and sweet.Pros:  Fluid animation, high resolution graphics, good soundtrack, interesting plot, funny dialog.Cons:  Puzzles are thrown in with arbitrary handicaps and do not contribute to the plot or integrate well.  The writers got lazy a few times and used the item descriptions from looking at an object as the narration when using the item as well.  It gets annoying hearing the same line multiple times when exploring or experimenting.Recommendation: If you like this sort of game, get it.  You can always look up a walkthrough to deal with the puzzles.  Warning: This comedy in a later episode gets quite dark.  If you cannot stomach Southpark type humor, then you're better off skipping this trilogy.			"

												This is a hard game to review.   It's a game with a strong storyline and some genuinely funny dialogue.  The puzzles occasionally lack much logic and can sometimes only be solved through guesswork (or by referring to a walkthrough) but this is a common problem with point-and-click adventure games and I would say that it's no worse than its peers in that regard.However, it's not a game that everyone will enjoy.    Whereas other adventure game characters like Guybrush Threepwood are hapless and inept, the protagonist of this game, Rufus, is rude, selfish, callous, sexist and egocentric.   This is a protagonist who you should probably not identify with or even sympathise with (although you probably will as you get drawn into the narrative)The humour is mostly derived from Rufus creating plans that go wrong and behaving in such a way as to cause misery and misfortune to those around them.   This is of course a well-established form of black comedy and I think that most people will be able to take it as it was intended.However, there are a number of jokes that contain elements that are as likely to cause offence and upset rather than amusement.   There are three main instances of this (from the entire trilogy):- One character is depicted in a very transphobic light- One character suffers through a racially demeaning situation (due to the protagonist)- One character is a paedophileThese are all intended as jokes and the author of the game has clarified that racially charged scene was not meant to convey a positive message about racism (the humour is derived from how awful the situation is) but it may still limit the ability of some people to enjoy the game.If you particularly enjoy point-and-click games and can tolerate the occasionally moment of humour in bad taste then you will enjoy this game.   If you are sensitive about racism, transphobia or sex crime then you may find that some jokes spoil your ability to enjoy the rest of the game. "

												Oh dear.  Whispering World was awesome and I love PnC but this felt like it was written and designed by 12 year old boys with a chip on their shoulder.  It's like they were going for South Park and failed miserably.  The characters are terrible tropes and so horribly annoying I cannot bring myself to play the second one - and it's such a shame as the art style and animation is great.  It's so rare to find nicely done point n clicks that this seems such a waste.I'm putting this down as a non recommend - my first (and I hope only) PnC negative review.			"

												In an attempt to find another such point-and-click adventure in the stylings of Monkey Island I managed to find just that. But it wasn't just in the stylings, it was almost as if the creators of Curse of Monkey Island decided to use their talents to make another story. The humor was clever, the music was catchy, and although the puzzles had me on occasion searching for a walkthrough I found them demanding enough to keep me searching for the answers. 10/10 would play again.

												Deponia was something I picked up on a whim during the Steam flash sale, I've been a fan of point & clicks in the past (such as Monkey Island games) and had seen mixed reviews about Deponia; but thought at that price it was worth the risk.I suspect Deponia is one of those games that you'll either love or absolutely hate - many reviews I saw complained about the ""annoying main character"", personally, I actually quite liked him and thought the dialogue was very fitting for the game.I am extremely glad that I picked this up, the game was fun, interesting and I even liked the art style.Deponia has manageable achievements - it's the first Steam game I've actually gotten round to getting all the achievements for. The vast majority of them you will pick up from just playing the game (provided you don't skip the puzzles) though some you may end up missing if you don't explore every possibility.The one disappointment was that I did experience two bugs where I was unable to proceed and had to go back to earlier saves (thankfully I saved plenty of times so only had to replay 15 minutes or so of the game) and for that I am gong to take a couple of points off my final score.Overall, Deponia provided everything I wanted from a point & click, it has a decent story and kept my attention throughout the game.My rating: 8/10 - A good fun way to spend a few hours, in an interesting world with a lovely art style.The game's bugs were a minor annoyance, but I found solutions to both with a quick Google.Looking for an interesting point & click to spend a few hours on? Deponia's your game. Recommended - I'll be playing the next one very soon!			"

This game works a bit glitchy for me, for instance, the dialogs turn from English to German somehow and protagonist glitches out at some point. The dialogs of the game are not quite funny and the story quite isn't complete, it's better off to buy Deponia: The Complete Journey than this mere game. Puzzles are quite challenging but some of them are making me clueless/ no idea what I'm doing.

I really enjoyed the steam punky - or in this case steam junky - atmosphere. Some puzzles are challenging but never too crazy to solve. The voice acting is all right, but it's mostly the crazyness of the characters that does it.As for the minor bugs, they included one or two super toll German subtitles, some misaligned text boxes and no voice-over when trying to combine certain items. So nothing serious really. I can't wait to start on part two.			"

												This particular game has caught me in between liking it and disliking it.Let me go through the things I liked about this game, I enjoyed the humor it contained. It's something fresh to me since I've hardly play games which contain much humor in it as this one does have. The artwork through the game also was appealing to me since I am a fan of good ingame art and graphics. What I disliked about it was how some of the puzzles were a bit funky and you pretty much had to think outside the box just to solve it. The main character annoyed the fricks out of me. His personality during the first part of the game was fine at first, it was easy to handle. But as the game progresses you either grow to hate it or become immune to it. I personally started to get annoyed with his dialogue and ended up skipping parts because of it. Overall, I'd say if you have the biggest patience with puzzle games especially weird once then this is the game for you. I wish there was an in between recommendation in steam for this.			"

The humor was excellent and gets better through out the game. A few puzzles were difficult, but not impossible. If they are too hard sometimes, you may have the opption to skip it. over all I'd give it an 8.5/10 . The game also has quite a high replay play value becuase you'll always find more to click on.

												(TL;DR: Don't buy it for more than 2€.) I'm an optimistic man that wants to like a game even if it has great weaknesses. I bought this one when it was like -90% on Steam holiday sale. The graphics and voices are excellent, also the music is great. But that's about it. I did want to finish it after I had been playing it for a while, but then after a while I was already waiting for the game to end as quickly as possible (sadly it didn't). I would never play it again and for the most part it is a waste of time. I am however still eager enough to quickly google the plot lines of the other 2 parts, so I guess the plot isn't that horrible. But I also would never buy it again, 2€ was the biggest price for the enjoyment that I got out of it, no disrespect. Every review I've read about it also agrees with me on this: the game isn't funny. It must've been only 1 or 2 times that I laughed during the whole game, and even then I wasn't rolling on the floor unable to breathe. I'm sorry to inform you, this one isn't worth your time or money.			"

												Just finished part 3 of this trilogy (Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia) and decided to write a review for the whole series. Of course it's only right to place it here, where the story starts.At heart this is a classic point and click adventure. A genre claimed to be dead, but getting ""ressurected"" from now and then by talanted indi-storytellers. This time it's Daedalic, a company of which I've never heard before (though they do seem to have several pretty critically acclaimed games out at this point, so it might be just my ignorance) with their take on humour, creativity and random fun. =)This game reminds me of the Runaway series, witty and charming main protagonist goes through unlikely events during a trilogy growing up and becoming a bit better.Actually, just play this game if you miss the point&click fun, you won't regret.PS. The ending somewhat... left me hanging. >_<			"

												If you like point and click adventure gameplay, then you will probably like this game. There really aren't any new mechanics. The player can double click on any transition point leading to another area in order to quick travel to that area, and the play can also middle click to show points of interest in the current area. These are very nice convenience features which help to stave off frustration.If you play games for storytelling, then you might like this game. The voice acting is pretty good in my opinion. I thought that the dialog was witty for the most part, but the main character is a self-centered jerk. I'm hoping that he becomes more selfless in the second and third Deponia games. The heroine is likable.The art style is very good in my opinion. It vaguely reminds me of the aesthetic of World of Goo.			"

												Deponia is a adventure game of the type I like the most. Challenging puzzles, cartoony 2D-graphics, no action elemements and a good humorous story.The best aspect of the game is probably the creative andsometimes quite challenging puzzles. In some adventure games the solution to a puzzle is almost immediately obvious because there are so few possible things to try. In Deponia trial and error is not a quick and easy approach, since there are many objects and lots of things to interact with. In particular in the first part of the game the puzzles require a bit of out of the box thinking without being unfair. Puzzles are also fairly varied and always feel like a natural part of the game rather than tacked on. My only complaint in this department is that the very end of the game is a bit anticlimactic in terms of puzzle difficulty.The story is humorous and entertaining with unique character. The humour doesn't always work, but there are moments of brilliance, and it worked often enough to keep me entertained throughout. The ending is a bit disappointing but it does leave things at an appropriate starting point for the sequel.The cartoony graphics are entirely appropriate given the general tone of the game and are high quality and quite distinctive. Characters each have their own unique appearance and do not look generic at all like they do in too many games.Voice acting is above average but not exceeptional. The music has a unique style that is very appropriate given the particular setting and is quite appealing too.All in all this is a highly recommended adventure game if you like pure point and click adventures with challenging puzzles and a healthy dose of humour.

												A point and click adventure game. If you don't know what that is, go check some flash games. The rest can continue to read - Rather interesting story, which is the mayor goal for adventure games like these. A strong character as well. As I read other reviews, many people disliked Rufus for being arrogant and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Well, that's how the creators wanted him to be. Not all games are made how you want them to be. Especially in adventure games, you are playing the story, that creators want to tell you, and I respect that. Visual effects could be better, but they are no reason to not enjoy this game. The setting in this game will be appreciated by people who are into steampunk stuff. And the soundtrack (especially the chorus guy) was fascinating! This game also contains some puzzles (I found myself checking walktrough after 4 hours :D) and hard to find achievements!			"

												If you grew up you games like Grim fandango, Monkey Island or Day of the tentacle you will adore this game! It has the charm and the comedy you want from a Point and Click adventure game! Even down to the jokes about not all your items will work together in your inventory. The plot is fresh and well written and spread out over 3 full length games not just 3 episodic releases.Well worth trying out if u wanna enjoy a few puzzles, great and silly humour and new adventure game!

												The puzzles are challenging, forcing you to adopt a non-traditional form of logic to solve them. The main character is so self-centered, he's delusional. Most importantly, the story is quite amusing and well written. The jokes range from cartoon slapstick to innuendo to bizzarre WTF situations. But the story, despite the juvenile humour, creates a full character arc. If you decide to play all the way to ""Goodbye Deponia"" you will be surprised by a beautiful and touching ending. I highly recommend this game if you want something that makes you think and experiment or a fun interactive story.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game. There were some parts of the game that were genuinely funny, which was the goal of the developer of this comedy-based adventure game. There were some puzzles that were really fun and challenging. Unfortunately, there are some major problems in this game that made me consider abandoning it at several points. Some of the puzzles try to be cute and absurd rather than logical, which make them hard to solve other than trial and error. There are some puzzles where the cue to the player is not obvious enough. There are also parts of the game where it is not clear what you are supposed to do next. For example, in many adventure games if you talk to characters in the game, they will tend to point you toward your next task. The characters in Deponia will tell you tons of jokes and wierd stories (I clicked through a lot of it), but 90% of the dialog has nothing to do with helping you finish the game. There are some out-and-out bugs, including a minigame that was flat broken. I used a walk-through more for this game than any other I have ever played (that includes Myst, Riven, Siberia I/II, Machinarium, The Longest Journey, etc). The hero of the story was a little too detestable to be funny. The artwork, style, and creativity were all there for this to be an excellent game, but somehow the developers did not learn from other great games of this genre. The result is a disappointment.			"

												As a big fan of adventure point-and-click games, I jumped on this one as soon as I saw it. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to all the fans of games like this.The story isn't very exciting, but it is interesting. From time to time you will be frustrated because the things didn't go as planned even though you tried so hard with a puzzle or an annoying conversation. The main character, Rufus, will annoy you to no end with his ego tripping and, well, stupidity. You will find yourself yelling at him or mentally high-fiving him. Other characters are interesting and have stories to tell you and are very helpful. And of course, there's a love interest. The puzzles are mostly fun, although some of them you will gladly skip, which you can. If you are like me and don't have internet access often, you will be glad to know that your achievements will still be saved. Graphically-wise, the game is gorgeous, the comicbook-y style goes well with the humour-filled conversation. Voice acting is also very good. All in all, a very good point-and-click adventure that will make you happy and angry at the same time.			"

If you answered ""no"" to either of these questions, you're wrong.If, on the other hand, you are the sort of intelligent (and let's face it, probably good-looking) person that enjoyed LucasArts adventure games in years past, you will probably enjoy Deponia. The art style, humor, and even the characters are very reminiscent of CoMI, which is a good thing.The only downside: it's kind of short. The whole thing can be knocked out in a few hours of trial and error, but at least there are sequels, and it usually gets pretty cheap during sales.			"

												What can I say? My first adventure game I completed was Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of Lounge Lizards in late 80's, and I have been fan of adventure game genre ever since. I had quite high expectations of this game. It looks nice, and the setting is interesting. However, the puzzles... They are not puzzles. They are tedious combinatorial work with little or no logic. A review in Metacritic pointed to walkthrough to see what is wrong with this game and now I do the same. See how to make espresso! The solution to this single operation... it's 6 freaking pages long, containing about 200 steps, and there are literally tens of steps that do not make sense in any way. The puzzles really get in the way of the story. That's it. I feel like a monkey who is supposed to guess what the designers had in mind. I don't think it's fun at all.			"

												play hotheaded rufus, as he follows his goals to get goal's approval.I played this point and click game before any of the Telltale games. This is the game that got me into point and click games. The game starts off really quickly, and things are explained/taught to the audience really quickly. I liked the 2D animation of this game, as well as the horizontal AND vertical movement that existed.The humor in this game was really funny, and well done, and the cinematics were great. I found the length of this game to be just right, and the puzzles hard, but not hard enough that I had to resort to a guide.The only downfall to this game is the price. I have been waiting and eagerly watching the other 2 Deponia games to go on sale so I can continue my story. Buy at sale price only, $20 for a point and click (that's not telltale) is ridiculous.

												Deponia is an excellent adventure game that exudes charm and polish, even if that polish is spotty at times. I'd say this is a very approachable game that anyone can play and enjoy. The puzzles are tricky but fair, and require a lot of thinking outside the box, which is exactly what they should. I especially love how the dialogue gives hints towards what you need to do with a particular puzzle. Deponia is quirky and funny, and if you love Monkey Island you'll love this. The language is stronger than in LucasArts' adventure games, but infrequent and still on the mild side.A few bits where Deponia could use improvement: the subtitles are occasionally mispelled, the voice acting sounds forced or awkward occasionally, and I've run into a few glitches, although nothing game-breaking. 9/10, highly recommended.

												Deponia brings the classic point and click animated adventure games to a new level of quality. A modern series of games with a system and artwork that might bring Leisure Suit Larry to mind, packed with a lot of humor and abstract situations. There's a plethora of characters with their unique personalities and tons of interesting stuff happening in the plot.It certainly is one of the best games in the point and click genre, yet it's not flawless. One of the flaws is that there are moments where you're clueless as of what you're supposed to do. You're stuck, trying to figure out what to do/where to use an object.

												Droggeljug!! Run through of the first installment was awesome. I'm definitely in for this game for its interesting set of puzzles and problem solving. Some require logic while others require thinking outside the box or just random experimentation. The visual part of the game is intriguing, cartoon-style on a planet built like a giant junkyard. By all means though, I do highly recommend this game. A number of time I found myself in stitches almost laughing myself silly. I'm eager to test my paws out on the next installment.			"

												The game is amazing. The main character Rufus is an obnoxious jerk/idiot/egotistical maniac and the plot is ridiculous and the puzzles are sometimes stupid but that's the point! The whole idea is absurd from start to finish (junkyard planet) and the game knows it and makes fun of itself at every step (except at the very end, but that's actually when you start liking Rufus). Hilarious dialogues, cool characters, tons of sarcasm and weirdness - I had an amazing time with this game. Yet, the full price of 19.99 is a bit high for a short point-and-click game (I bought it on sale), but if you ever see it discounted - go for it!			"

												A fun, short indie point and click adventure game. I loved the art style, smooth animation, voice acting and the setting of the game.Regrettably the audio does suffer, with music often being quite annoying after the 10th loop. Sound effects were a bit overlooked (or at least were not budgeted for), so there are quite a few sounds that are very short yet are looped for a long time.I really struggled with some of the puzzles, although I would say that is pretty typical for these sorts of games. So you should be prepared to look at a walkthrough, if you're not great at these games.Recommended. Will be buying the rest soon.			"

												This was a fun point-and-click with enough challenging puzzles to keep me interested, but a bit lacklustre in other areas. I liked the premise - a world built on a junk yard - and I likedthat many of the puzzles required you to get creative and build things out of unconventional materials. I did get stuck a few times and had to look up prompts, which I hate doing, but it helped me think about future puzzles differently so I didn't need help towards the end. While the voice acting was decent enough, I found the characters to be quite generic, and I did not care for Rufus's weird creepy possessiveness of Goal as some kind of prize (even her name alludes to this). My main annoyance was that this game has way too much unnecessary dialogue; I put the subtitles on so I could quickly skip through the lines unless they had some useful information. The dialogue was often trying to be funny but much of it was fluff. I like this kind of Monkey Island style game with quirky humour, and there was some of that, but a lot of it could have been cut. The ending was a bit abrupt. I didn't really care for the storyline towards the end; it felt rushed and the puzzles became fewer and further between to make way for overindulgent cut scenes. Overall I enjoyed it, but I'm glad I got it at the sale price.			"

												Droggeljug. Droggeljug. Droggeljug. Bought it on sale. It was fun, I enjoyed it. Gameplay is simple. Tip: You can double click to go to places faster. I didn't realize that sooner and I had to walk for the character to walk very very slowly. My fault though, not the game's. Anyway, it's an amusing point and click puzzle adventure game. Funny and ridiculous. Story is okay. Immediately bought the sequel (luckily it was also on sale) because I'm looking forward to what happens next!			"

												Wonderfully adorable and insanely fun game. Very reminiscent of the Monkey Island games with their humor and obscure puzzles. And while sometimes the puzzles are a little on the obscure side, it's never anything that can't be figured out with a little bit of thinking. In all honesty, the puzzles were surprisingly easy. The plot is funny, and again, very reminiscent of Monkey Island. (As a side note, it's been mentioned that movement between scenes/maps is slow. You can double-click to skip the walking animations and go straight into the next scene. Be careful though, cause sometimes this can cause some cutscenes to skip as well.)			"

												My rate: 7/10This game...I would say it has good art work, musics, and funny jokes,but if you are a ""solve everything by myself"" person--this might be a very tough game for you.You have to be searching every map and talk to the NPCs VERY THOROUGHLY, remember what they said. Sometimes you have NO idea what to do or what items should be combined...and it sure is frustrating to go all over the maps again and combining items randomly.So, It's not like I'm saying you shouldn't buy this game--I'm saying if you want the best gaming experience, grab a guide and look at it whenever you feel lost. Don't waste too much time trying to figure things out. (Sometimes things are really out of your expectation)			"

												This game was decently fun. I don't usually play point and click adventure puzzle games but this one is a lot of fun. I wasn't crazy about the cliffhanger ending and I think they should have just combined both deponia games into one. It's very much like the monkey Island games albeit a bit short. Some of the time I could get through the puzzles on my own while other times I used a walkthrough. Still it is good fun though I wouldn't spend much more then a buck or two on it.			"

												Deponia is an excellent adventure game that exudes charm and polish, even if that polish is spotty at times. I'd say this is a very approachable game that anyone can play and enjoy. The puzzles are tricky but fair, and require a lot of thinking outside the box, which is exactly what they should. I especially love how the dialogue gives hints towards what you need to do with a particular puzzle. Deponia is quirky and funny, and if you love Monkey Island you'll love this. The language is stronger than in LucasArts' adventure games, but infrequent and still on the mild side.A few bits where Deponia could use improvement: the subtitles are occasionally mispelled, the voice acting sounds forced or awkward occasionally, and I've run into a few glitches, although nothing game-breaking. 9/10, highly recommended.

The puzzles, I think, are engaging, even if on the easy side (neither a good nor bad thing).The environment, characters, story, voice acting, and soundtrack are all entertaining and memorable.  The acting, artwork, and music are all AAA/world-class.  As with any play-once/interactive fiction game, I recommend it at deep (75%+) discount.			"

												Deponia, despite my original worries, surprised me in the most pleasant of ways, though in hindsight, maybe I'm just a sucker for point-and-click games.Much of the charm of this title is in the sense of humour, mostly presented through dialogue, though the puzzles are no slouches either. For the sake of brevity, I'll keep from gushing, but I put forward my personal recommendation on Deponia. To speak of it more, I imagine I would spend most of my time describing what can already be seen in screenshots, or butchering the punchlines of the dozens of jokes spread throughout the game.8/10			"

												Whimsical point and click adventure. It's a colorful little world and a nice addition to a faded genre, but it displays some telltale signs of why the genre has faded. You'll hit at least a handful of moments where the game becomes less about figuring out clever little puzzles and more about trying every different thing on every other thing until something works. Also, the voice acting is unfortunately pretty terrible. so much so, that you might even consider muting it so you don't have to hear the same lines repeated over and over again as you progress through dialogue trees. The game took me about 10 hours to complete, but I was ready for it to be over after about 6.This is first in a trilogy. If you like point-and-click, it will entertain. But I'd recommend trying this one out before pulling the trigger on the complete Deponia series.			"

If they are too hard sometimes, you may have the opption to skip it. over all I'd give it an 8.5/10 . The game also has quite a high replay play value becuase you'll always find more to click on.

												I'd recommend it on a sale anyday.For the full price however, no.It's good, not perfect. The humor is cringeworthy at times, which I won't hold against them, since it's hard to make good humor at times. It does however have that ""Saturday-morning cartoon"" wich I like. It doesn't work in all games, but Deponia managed to pull it off more or less. I really like the visuals, makes me think of ""The inner world"", which also delivers the sam feeling. However, that games has a very uniqe and intresting setting, which this game fell short with sometimes. The story was something that took time before it got interesting, but in the end I was satified. Up until the ending however it felt like I was taking baby steps, and that I was making slow progress all the time. This could also have had to do with the fact that your goal was always the same.  What I have specifically in mind was the fact that you always have oyur focus on waking up Goal, fixing her brain implant and what not. It felt att times that she was not a character, but an object that I had to fix. Not until the end did this change, when she revealed her persenality and emotions towards your actions (like wanting to get to Elyssium). From what I've seen from the later games, thsi should change and she will have a bigger impact on the story.  The puzzels were alright, not to farfetched, which might happen to games that involves puzzels and humor.In conclusion, if you have some time over (I was between assignments at uni) and if you find it on sale, then give it a go.

												Beautifully drawn, funny, with actually pretty good story (and world setting) masked by simple personal quest of an egocentric protagonist. But also Deponia is a time machine with a dial set to 90's which had twofold effect on me:First I remembered playing good old P&C adventures, warm and cosy feeling with occasional chuckle, and of course accompanied with frustrations because of illogical solutions and pixel hunting. But during those days we didn't have internet so you would be stuck on a certain puzzle for hours/days, repeating your steps making sure you didn't miss anything vital (did I mention illogical?) figuring out that you are dumb after all... Ahh *wipes the tear of reminiscence*Second thing is that I realized why this genre has died out. I can't imagine someone who grew up with today's games enjoying this kind of experience. Nothing here is on platter, you have to figure out on your own how to solve it. Or of course go and find a walk-through online, but they you would ask yourself are you enjoying this or even if is this is for you. So you would drop it and go play something in 3D with jumping and shooting with immediate satisfaction.If this came out in previous century it would be masterpiece worth remembering.			"

												I wasn't a huge fan of Point and Click games, until this came out.Deponia has good gameplay mechanics, which only take a minute to learn. The way you solve puzzle in this game, and progress the story is by actually using your brain, instead of mashing buttons. I'm not saying you need an above average intelligence to complete it; but it will sometimes make you think.Now, with the gameplay mechanic out of the way - let's talk about the story. This has got to be one of the most fun stories out there for games, or at-least - the point and click genre. It has been a pretty solid base story, with some nice humour thrown in too. Although the humour could be seen as a bit low brow - but it goes well with the base story and the ""Hero"".If you like point and click games, I'm going to assume you have already bought this game within seconds of watching the intro. If you aren't a point and click fan - much like myself before this series - then there is always a first game to get you rolling, and this is it. I now love all of Daederic Entertainment' games. Thank you for porting Edna to IOS. please consider this in the future too.Thank you so much for such a great game.			"

												One of the best series of adventure games that I've ever played. I enjoyed the humour, the very interesting puzzles (you really have to think outside the box for some of them). The voice acting is probably one of the best I've seen in a long time and it comes along with a really good soundtrack. And these games also have the good looks going for them. There are some problems here and there with the German -> English translation but they didn't take away from all the fun. I strongly recommend this series of games. They don't have too much replay value unless you're going for all the achievements but I still had tons of fun playing all 3 of them.			"

												This particular game has caught me in between liking it and disliking it.Let me go through the things I liked about this game, I enjoyed the humor it contained. It's something fresh to me since I've hardly play games which contain much humor in it as this one does have. The artwork through the game also was appealing to me since I am a fan of good ingame art and graphics. What I disliked about it was how some of the puzzles were a bit funky and you pretty much had to think outside the box just to solve it. The main character annoyed the fricks out of me. His personality during the first part of the game was fine at first, it was easy to handle. But as the game progresses you either grow to hate it or become immune to it. I personally started to get annoyed with his dialogue and ended up skipping parts because of it. Overall, I'd say if you have the biggest patience with puzzle games especially weird once then this is the game for you. I wish there was an in between recommendation in steam for this.			"

The puzzles just have no logic. Trough the game I found myself trying every item on every clickable thing and that's when I turned the game off. The only way to solve puzzles seems like brute force but I don't want to act like I'm certain about that since I didn't finish the game.			"

A humorous (not nessisarily laugh out loud funny but it has its moments) point and click adventure game which has intuitive gameplay.One of the things I hate about point and click games is half of em require you to spend half your time in a walkthrough to figure out that your supposed to add a straw and a pickle to make a key or whatever.Deponia has puzzles which you can actually figure out and make sense conceptually. You can play thorugh the game without ever touching a walkthough which I liked.			"

												Fun to play, dialogues remind me of Monkey Island games. Puzzles are medium difficulty, love the middle mouse button feature (reveals interactive objects on screen in current location), as I find it boring to scan every screen with mouse for all possible interactions (but you don't have to use it if you prefere not to). Just bought 2nd a 3rd installments, hope they are just as great.			"

												Pros:+Some good lines.+Interesting universe.+No pixel hunt.Cons:-Simplistic animations.-Pathfinding (got me stuck because Rufus couldn't enter the mayor's room while Wenzel was still standing in front of the dorr, i.e. until you get in... Got stuck until I accidentally quick-move in the room).-Hateful main character, get boring quicly.-Some weird mechanics (20 years of point&click, it's the first time where you must try to take something even when you've been told ""no"" instead of finding a way around, got me stuck for hours!).-Broken puzzle (the french answer for the crane  puzzle doesn't match either the english voiced instructions nor the written translated instructions).Don't expect too much of it. It's a fairly decent point&click, though a bit weak on the graphic side (can't believe I of all people am saying that).			"

												$20 for this ?  Fortunately I got the game for only $2 on sale, but I can't help imagining how disappointed I would have been if I had paid full price for it.  10 hours is no small amount of game time but the plot barely advances at all over the course of the game.  Half of my time playing was spent making a cup of espresso, and the rest of the game just rushes by without anything actually happening.  The game ended right when I thought it was getting started.  None of the questions that were introduced in the exposition of the game were resolved at the end, and instead it only made the story even more ambiguous without any closure.  This game is completely useless without owning the sequels, which only seems like a way of cheaply breaking up the story for more money, when this one is being sold at twice the price that it should be.This game showed a lot of promise at the start.  It's set in a unique and interesting world that I had no problem getting into (in no small part due to the phenomenal art direction), the protagonist is a relatably uncharismatic outcast who became increasingly likable as his surroundings (namely his disdainful and unsympathetic neighbors) became more developed, the hero's actions and motives are clear and understandable despite his overt rudeness and dim-witted sense of grandiosity, it has an engaging sense of humor, and the good soundtrack and voice acting only added to the charm of the game.  With so much done right, it's incredible that anything could go wrong.Unfortunately the plot just becomes a mess once the final area is reached and the last chunk of story is delivered all at once just before it's abruptly ended.  The last area consists of a frustrating back and forth that ultimately brings the protagonist right back to the start just when it felt like the game was finally getting somewhere, that is Elysium, the place that the player and the character have both been trying to reach the whole time.  It gets so close to reaching this goal that it felt like the real plot was artificially snatched away at the last second simply so that a sequel could be made.My suggestion is that you should play this game if it looks appealing, but be prepared to get forced into a whole series and definitely do not buy it at full price.  I personally enjoyed Deponia and will probably be buying the game's sequels myself if they go on sale sometime, but I can't recommend playing it at the current price of $20.			"

Those were the days when you really had to think your way through things, you couldn't just mindlessly hack and slash. The humor is fantastic. I just want to absorb and look at everything because there's a joke almost everywhere.This is a fab game for old-school gamers looking for nostalgia and new-school gamers looking for a challenge and a laugh.

												I have never enjoyed a game so much while liking the main protagonist so little. Rufus brings chaos and ill-crafted plans with him everywhere he goes, wreaking havoc on the lives of all those around him. This point & click puzzle game was challenging at points, while most solutions were pretty straightforward if given enough thought to them. The comedy in this series can sometimes be a bit edgier, and maybe even a bit questionable in a few places, but the game play and storyline is overall highly entertaining and rewarding.			"

 Becomes Deadalic the new Lucas Arts ?I can't speak for the scoring of other languages, but as with most movies, books or even games, the highest enjoyment is the audio of the original cast. Only in the original language the atmosphere is transported best. Translations can come close, but in few cases are as perfect or even excel the original dubbing.Just everything about these Point-and-Click Adventures is great: The strange, but lovable characters, the contrarian solution processes of the quests, the mini-games, the gorgeous visuals, the story, the cast ! I may go on the edge here, but I think that the Deponia Triology ( See also Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia holds itself well against classics like Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion and the likes. Enjoy your dirt and don't forget to recite some platypus poetrty to your significant other or join the next laundry cult!HOSSA !!!			"

												Excellent adventure game -- a lot of humor.One interesting aspect of Deponia: You play Rufus, a protagonist whose character answers the question ""How would a real-life person who grabs everything that is not nailed down behave?"" You know the type [non-spoiler examples by the way]-- the one who insists that there is a perfectly viable reason to for example break into a museum at night to break a priceless ming vase because there might be something inside, and is sincerely apologetic he needed an amputee's prosthetic leg to knock a kite out of a tree instead of buying one from the store. One aspect: This is a game whose absurdity occasionally extends to puzzle design. So you will probably need either a walk-through or a large dose of experimentation to solve everything. Last comment: If you read the review and know you're going to love the game, go ahead and get the Complete Edition which bundles all three games. Just don't click on the commentary boxes until your second play-through.			"

												Daedalic's Deponia is easily recommended even though it has a few flaws and, for me, a challenging design decision, i.e. the b-a-stard main character. It is well crafted, so main aspects like story, style, user interface and voice acting are almost all of the time great - in that way where you don't have to think about them since you hardly stumble over anything to be irritated much less annoyed by.+ Beautiful comic style graphics+ Awesome intermission songs+ Very good voice acting - believable characters+ Good story+ Mostly very good game/puzzle logic, + Shortcuts to menus, quick-save and quick-load, fast access via inventory+ Drogglejug- Multi-minute bl(a/o)ckscreen when starting and quitting the game- Dislikeable main character that I want to slap in the face from time to time- Some graphical glitches- Some subtitle glitches- Sometimes unnecessarily loud sound pieces- Unnerving background music (at the start, see below)Hints:* F5: Save/load menu* F9 + F10: quick-save + quick-load* If your game starts with an inescapable black screen give it time, maybe 5 minutes. It resolved after 3-4 minutes by itself on my machine.Backgrounds, characters and items are with two exceptions beautiful and interesting and are probably what brought you to the store page. The two exceptions were the two states of a mousetrap in the inventory. By the looks of it the image was read out wrong and thus skewed. In some cases the background panel for dialogue choices was missing.The voice acting is superb and characters are portrayed with consistency thus contributing to mysterious, outlandish (in a good way) story.I do despise the main character and the way you have to go along with his egotistical and destructive reflections, disregard and actions - there is one decision forced on the player much alike ""Why use the door handle when you can break down the door?"" However, that character is also consistent and driving the story. Also, he makes practically every other character pretty likeable - his ex even before she enters the screen. I do hope the final scenes are supposed to indicate a change of character, i.e. a future moderation and an emergence of care for othersI can't say much about the background music of the game since it quickly became unnerving enough for me to mute it and so I don't know whether it improved later on. However, the intermission songs are despite there shortness awesome - think Bard's Tale songs. And they really cracked me up in Drogglejug mode.A few times some very loud sound pieces or music were played, e.g. when making ""the discovery"" coming back to the candy store. Also, Argus is too loud. I would have wished for those to be tuned down with the other volume settings.I really liked the interface, e.g. how the mousewheel seamlessly brings in and out the inventory. I think it an ingenious idea to have a shortcut to the save/load menu from the inventory and I applaud the employment of F-keys.The game logic is sound and puzzle threads are well graspable so that the player can follow the story without much stumbling.I really liked Drogglejug mode. It took me forever to get the reference even though multiple related hints appear throughout the game, e.g. the globe.Two more flaws:1. Sometimes the subtitles glitched from English to German.2. A major, almost off-putting, problem are the blocking black screens that happen when starting or quitting the game. With their three to five minute resolution time - all while catching any keyboard event, e.g. Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Del, Ctrl+Shift+Esc - I think a lot of people may have hard-reset their machines before realising the problem would resolve itself with time.I had the luxury of having another machine on my desk that I could use to search for the problem thus not experiencing the minutes as pure waiting time, otherwise I would have restarted machine 1 after less than 2 minutes. And I refrained from quitting the game in order to write this review without delay. So it's waiting time for me next.In case I didn't make it clear so far, I enjoyed Deponia :)I was looking forward to playing it and wasn't disappointed. And after my 3.5 play-throughs I'm looking forward to the sequel: Chaos on Deponia.Huzzah Drogglejug!			"

												Deponia is literally a dump that Rufus is desperate to leave at the expensive of his friends and his ex, for reasons that are not immediatley apparent. This pretty much makes him a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, but once past this initial premise, Deponia provides a fun point and click ride.Its full of humour aimed in all directions, jibes at characters, adventure game tropes and even at the player trying all combos to progress, it genuinely puts a smile on your face.The puzzles are well paced, starting in confined areas and expanding the world as you go. The story might not be that deep and certain characters don't always work, but the dialogue is strong, the scenery is lovely and the situations the characters end up in keep you invested.

												I have long since been a fan of adventure games ever since I traipsed around the disc as Rincewind the hopeless wizard and solving the ancient mystery of the Templars in Broken sword, feeling the itch for adventure once more I looked to cure the malady with the first Deponia an adventure game set in a world overflowing with garbage and rust.Amusingly enough I find myself following the antics of a young, optimistic if not misguided and cursed individual called Rufus who can't help but destroy nearly everything he comes into contact with, With my previous experience of the adventure genre it didnt take long to acclimate myself with the user interface and inventory systems even so a newcomer to the genre would find it easy to navigate the vibrant world around them and have help from the game itself with the press of a button.From start to finish I played through colourful environments with a smile on my face as I watched on at Rufus' attempts to converse with wacky characters and overcome the problems he was faced with often with disasterous results but still couldn't stop myself from laughing at his misfortune, the plot though simple was still absorbing enough to keep my interest and managed to throw plenty of curveballs so much so I can't wait to get to continue the advenuture and see what mischief Rufus manages to get himself into.

A modern series of games with a system and artwork that might bring Leisure Suit Larry to mind, packed with a lot of humor and abstract situations. There's a plethora of characters with their unique personalities and tons of interesting stuff happening in the plot.It certainly is one of the best games in the point and click genre, yet it's not flawless. One of the flaws is that there are moments where you're clueless as of what you're supposed to do. You're stuck, trying to figure out what to do/where to use an object. After consulting with a solution, it turns out that the thing you didn't know was so ridiculous that you'd probably spend hours on trying to figure it out, and still not get it. + amazing humor+ very long+ original story+ interesting characters- many spots that are easy to get stuck at			"

												I like this game for a few reasons: it has got the detailed cartoon graphics I happen to like, the main character is likable even if they try to tell you he isn't and I like the setting of the story. And boy, that's good enough for me!Great entertainment of which I would happily pay the full price, but didn't as I got it at a rediculously low price on a discounted bundle on a weekend sale. Can't wait to play the other Deponia games.ps. It was a little too short from awesome.			"

												Fun to play, dialogues remind me of Monkey Island games. Puzzles are medium difficulty, love the middle mouse button feature (reveals interactive objects on screen in current location), as I find it boring to scan every screen with mouse for all possible interactions (but you don't have to use it if you prefere not to). Just bought 2nd a 3rd installments, hope they are just as great.			"

												If you're looking for a point-and-click puzzle-solving adventure game, you found the right game. Gameplay is approximately 10 hours.PROS- Hilarious puzzles.- Good character building- Good plot, bitter sweet ending- Nice sound tracks.- Great concept art- And the CATS are so cute (awwwwwwwwwww)CONS- Some puzzles is kind of pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ ridiculously difficult. - Limited number of voice actors (Toni and Goal are the same person, Doc and Hannek are the same too)Overall, I'm highly recommended.

												As for me, I think that this game is something that could be called a good product. Passage does not take much time, and the gameplay, the plot and peculiar funny jokes are fascinating. This is not bad.The game is absolutely amazing. Of course, the very essence is not new: ""do it, bring it, take it"", but the authors are really masters of their craft, they know how to interest the player. It's a big plus that the game does not get boring during the storyline. Developers know how to make games and love this business - it feels for sure. This game is worth it to play in it. My Respect.			"

												Great first impression for a trilogy.Nice voice acting and story, as well as spunky characters.A lot less detective work for a normal RPG game as pressing the spacebar highlights all clickable areas in a location. It's helpful, but also hindering. It is a nice fail-safe option to have though.Made me want to get the sequel, and the one after. I highly recommend the bundle of 3.8/10 - Fun, memorable, but short.

												The whole Deponia series comprises some of my favourite point-and-click adventure games. They're fun, hilarious, and for the most part the puzzle solutions made sense but were still challenging. The story itself is fantastic, and full of laughs. The gameplay I never found tedious or boring, and there are no tiny hotspots that you just can't quite click that make some other point-and-click games so frustrating. The voice acting, music, and especially the art are all very well done. I highly recommend all the games in this series, but this first is my favourite of the four, and if you're only ever going to play one Daedalic Entertainment game, this should be it!			"

												I'm a fan of the old point and click games, I grew up with Monkey Island and Grim Fandango. I've yet to find something similar that captures the humour, atmosphere and style of those games. Deponia seemed like a good, recent take on the genre so I thought I'd give it a shot. If you're a fan of point and click adventure games, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I'd say try Monkey Island first (particularly the remastered versions if nostalgia alone isn't enough to see past the older graphics.)Deponia is ok all round, the art style is pretty cool and the environments are well drawn. The dialogue is pretty hit and miss though, and if I'm honest I didn't find it all that funny. One thing that really stood out to me as quite poor was the sound design. Some of the sound effects get really repetitive, to the point of being annoying in some scenes, and the robotic effect on the Organon voices were far too loud and irritating. The music isn't great, although the mechanical sounding elements lend themself well to the locations and world, they just lacked the charm that I've heard in other point & click adventure classics.The characters are ok, a little underdeveloped but the storyline is fairly decent. Doc and Bozo deserved more introduction in my opinion.The puzzles on the most part are logical, with enough hint in the dialogue frome looking at objects to help you along but there are the occasional frustrating puzzles that I admit I couldn't figure out on my own. Overall, it's worth getting this if you're a fan of the point & click genre, but I'd grab it while it's on sale.			"

												I wish I could give this game the rating it deserves, because it seems like a truly great game. I very much enjoyed the portion of the game that I got to play... it almost reminds me of old Sierra games like Space Quest.And then I made it to a certain recipe item that bugs out in your inventory and prevents you from furthering your progress in the game. Very, very disappointing... :(I will keep the game in my inventory in hopes that they get it patched, but I can not recommend it as-is. I really do hope the devs get it patched too, because I really want to recommend it to a couple of friends to play. If the devs read this review, do understand: your game is beautiful and very fun to play. The question asked was, ""Do you recommend the game?""... and in the current form, sadly, I can not.I played it on an i5 with windows 7.			"

												This was my second attempt to make it threw this game. I finally completed it and I enjoyed it. The main character Rufus doesn't really grow to much, you don't really make any connection with him because he repeatedly goes against his morals and you want the main character to be the one that defies all of the odds to stick to his guns. The jokes were good, I found the game quite amusing, it was light hearted and silly and I laughed out loud.The major problem with this game is the puzzle mechanics. The beginning is ok and the end makes sense but the middle part that takes place in the village has a lot of random trying everything in your inventory with everything else. They were grasping at straws and when I read a walkthrough to help me when I got stuck I realized I would NEVER have thought of the solution. I have played many adventure games but this one just got frustrating. I would still recommend it, I thought the artwork was great and the jokes were as well. Every single one of the characters are ignorant bums and when you find out what they want to do to Deponia you really don't care to much.			"

												May I present: Rufus. Our protagonist (technically true) and hero (not true even after three servings of cactus juice).He lives in Deponia. He hates Deponia. Deponia hates him.Now that you know the inter-relational dynamics of the situation, let me tell you something more about Rufus.He has flaws. And by that I mean he is a glib-tongued, self-absorbed, egotistical megalomaniac with inclinations for projects from the 'mad scientist' category. He might also be an arsonist. And he steals. Like, a lot. For example, if you have a firefly-powered miner's hat on you and Rufus is in the vicinity, chances are you don't really have it. Maybe you never even had it to start with? You just thought you had it? See...?Normally I try my best to avoid surrounding myself or even being associated with those kinds of people. But there's just something in him, you know? Not his brains, he has proven more than once that he is a little slow on the uptake, if you catch my drift. I have no idea how he does it but he makes me a worse person with each and every meeting we have. I admit, he got me so hooked that I took the bait (*hint*hint*), line and sinker and started playing Chaos on Deponia immediately after finishing this one.Rufus! Oh, the fun we've had! The only downside to it all is that I am afraid my moral compass isn't pointing north as much as it used to.			"

												Beautifully drawn, funny, with actually pretty good story (and world setting) masked by simple personal quest of an egocentric protagonist. But also Deponia is a time machine with a dial set to 90's which had twofold effect on me:First I remembered playing good old P&C adventures, warm and cosy feeling with occasional chuckle, and of course accompanied with frustrations because of illogical solutions and pixel hunting. But during those days we didn't have internet so you would be stuck on a certain puzzle for hours/days, repeating your steps making sure you didn't miss anything vital (did I mention illogical?) figuring out that you are dumb after all... Ahh *wipes the tear of reminiscence*Second thing is that I realized why this genre has died out. I can't imagine someone who grew up with today's games enjoying this kind of experience. Nothing here is on platter, you have to figure out on your own how to solve it. Or of course go and find a walk-through online, but they you would ask yourself are you enjoying this or even if is this is for you. So you would drop it and go play something in 3D with jumping and shooting with immediate satisfaction.If this came out in previous century it would be masterpiece worth remembering.			"

The first playthrough took a while stumbling through the traditional talk, look, and use commands, but on the second time through with every word replaced with ""Droggeljug"" it can be beat in just a few hours knowing what to do.

												Droggeljug!! Run through of the first installment was awesome. I'm definitely in for this game for its interesting set of puzzles and problem solving. Some require logic while others require thinking outside the box or just random experimentation. The visual part of the game is intriguing, cartoon-style on a planet built like a giant junkyard. By all means though, I do highly recommend this game. A number of time I found myself in stitches almost laughing myself silly. I'm eager to test my paws out on the next installment.			"

												Droggeljug. Droggeljug. Droggeljug. Bought it on sale. It was fun, I enjoyed it. Gameplay is simple. Tip: You can double click to go to places faster. I didn't realize that sooner and I had to walk for the character to walk very very slowly. My fault though, not the game's. Anyway, it's an amusing point and click puzzle adventure game. Funny and ridiculous. Story is okay. Immediately bought the sequel (luckily it was also on sale) because I'm looking forward to what happens next!			"

												Do I really need to write a review for this game? Probably not. But I enjoyed this and the following games in the series so much, I just feel I have to add my voice to all the other voices of praise for Deponia. This game really sparked my excitement for gaming again. I don't know how to write an organized review, so I'll just ramble off some points. :) The thing that makes this game gold is the writing. All of the characters are well developed and charming.  Even the hilariously self-absorbed Rufus. I feel like this is one of the more unique games I have played. If you want to figure out all of the puzzles on your own without a guide, you will spend hours at some points, wracking your brain, thinking creatively... The solutions you (Rufus) come up with to advance are not immediately obvious and are very clever. It can get frustrating, but it is very rewarding when you put things together. Such a smart and comedic game. The atmosphere is so unique and the artwork is fantastic. The experience only gets better in the next games as the story developes, so be prepared to spend some time in this universe. I'm so glad I did!			"

												Great game, I missed my old adventure games I played about 15 years ago, and this filled me completely with nostalgia. It's fun to play and the story is awesome, the story with the villain with which you share great physical similarities reminds me of what Simon The Sorcerer 3D set up to be the sequel, that was supposed to be great with the villain taking your place in the real world, but that it couldn't be done due to the studio selling the franchise to other developers that dropped the ball badly. I really enjoyed this part, is the more mature of the trilogy, while the second and third have somehow more childish quests. Great game!			"

												Deponia was an enjoyable game, both in story and gameplay. While classic point&click adventure game puzzles are not my favorite, and I admit to looking up some solutions so I could continue with the story, I would not personally knock the puzzle gameplay as it was very strong otherwise. Some glitches abound, mostly concerning movement and sometimes it confusing one cut-off space with another (IE you would have to go back and try again to walk to the right location) but otherwise I experienced no in-game problems.The main character IS maddening, but I am still hooked on continuing the deponia story.

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. TL; DR If you like mindles click spam puzzle games that require zero logic, then I guess you should get it.The story is not too bad and the graphics are really nice.  .......but.What made me give a negative review is the puzzle solving mechanism which is just..horrible. 95% of the time there are absolutely no hints or clues about what you have to do next. You picked up some items because you cliked on everything that was clickable; tho using this items requires multiple spamming, usually just trying to use every item from your inventory on an object (only to find out neither of those are meant to be used and then doing the same on next object, etc.), or trying to connect all the items in your inventory together in hope you're going to craft something useful. And sometimes these crafted objects made absolutely zero sense.The walking and overall moving was very badly done and often very very annoying, and the jokes are just.. Not funny. I can see it tries hard to be funny but it's just not. Also the characters are one of the most annoying I have ever met in the game.I finished the game, but I had to keep the walktrough opened at all times because at most times I had zero idea about what to do next since there is absolutely no hints.I hope the other sequels are done better on this point.

												A fantastic adventure game, featuring some extremely intelligent riddles that require deep thinking. At the same time, it narrates a beautiful story, one that takes place in a setting very different than those of most adventure games. Recommended for everyone interested in the genre, It offers a classic, challenging gameplay, which should be enough to keep fans of the adventures games playing till they finish it. The controls and voice acting is top notch. The storyline is humerous and fun. However, the ending was a total buildup for the second installment. A tad dissapointing. There is about 8 - 15 hours of gameplay, depending how long it takes you to do the puzzles. At best the game is worth only $15. Seeing how you will most likely need all three installments for some closer, the total package could be worth $30 if you get about 10 hours of gameplay out of each installment. I will get the other installments when they go on sale.			"

												★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Well, it's not so bad and may be even worth playing if you have some time to spend and if you like point and click adventure games with classical 2D graphics.Unfortunatelly there is a few puzzles, which are simply illogical and frustrating (e.g. you need to perform quite lond sequence of proper actions to move the story forward or you need to repeat some action a few times with literally no clue that it makes sense to try once again). The story is fine and finishing the game gives a great satisfaction, but using obligatory walthrough (due to aforementioned blockers) make it less enjoyable.I'm goint to buy next two chapters. As far as I know the second and the third part of the game is much better, with well balanced puzzles and equaly good story.			"

												I cannot praise this game enough. It is worth every single penny. It is smart and an unreasonable amount of fun.I don't like Point&Click games - at least that's what I thought Deponia blew my mind.The character you play, Rufus, is a constant thief, tries out everything no matter how much harm it does and generally is an egocentric who doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about other people's feelings... Which, actually is the incarnation of how you automatically act when playing an Point&Click adventure.I love Deponia for this kind of subtle, intelligent humor. I love Rufus. And I love Daedalic for developing another sequel, Deponia: Doomsday. The adventure isn't over yet! Hurray!			"

												Deponia is a point-and-click adventure game reminiscent of the Lucasarts classics. It tells the story of eternal screwup and egomaniac Rufus and his efforts to escape the garbage-filled planet he lives on to reach a floating city, Elysium.All in all, the game is well paced, funny, and the right mix of challenging and logical. There was no singular moment where I was just baffled over an answer, though the game does offer large enviroments that can sometimes be overwhelming.If you are a fan of the genre, this game (and it's sequels) should definitely be in your collection, but it certainly won't be worth it to those who are not.

												I really well and truely love this game. The animation style is beautiful, there's a perfect amount of humor and the characters are rather interesting.Set in an intreguing future world filled with junk, you play as Rufus who seems desperate to get out of Kuvaq and to Elysium to make a better name for himself. He's an idiot along the way, has a few mishaps and has his heart stolen - not quite so literally though (sorry to disappoint).For anyone who is interested in animation or even video game design, this game should be at the top of your wishlist - or even better, in your library - so that you can get a basic and rough idea and how things word in this wonderfully made, 2D point and click enviroment.11/10			"

												Wonderfully adorable and insanely fun game. Very reminiscent of the Monkey Island games with their humor and obscure puzzles. And while sometimes the puzzles are a little on the obscure side, it's never anything that can't be figured out with a little bit of thinking. In all honesty, the puzzles were surprisingly easy. The plot is funny, and again, very reminiscent of Monkey Island. (As a side note, it's been mentioned that movement between scenes/maps is slow. You can double-click to skip the walking animations and go straight into the next scene. Be careful though, cause sometimes this can cause some cutscenes to skip as well.)			"

Definitely worth the money. The voice acting is brilliant and I absolutely adore the songs. Deponia is one of those games in which you absolutely have to try and get all the acheivements which means it has a good length play time. Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody, and I have! I just have to save up for the other two now!			"

												Feels like a classic 90s LucasArts comedy game. That's both a good and a bad thing, really.The good:- Great art.- Rock solid voice acting.- The puzzles don't quite get as obscure or ridiculous as 90s adventures, which is a good thing since there's nothing like the infamous Monkey Wrench puzzle here.- Some neat innovations in 90s adventure game playability. Clicking the middle mouse button highlights objects you can interact with, whilst scrolling it brings down your inventory. Feels natural.- Characters are mostly good. I feel Rufus has a good progression from self-centered idiot to someone who actually wants to do good by the end, and that's a nice progression. Other characters serve the plot well too, except for Goal (see below).- The setting of Deponia feels very alive, like a lived-in place with backstory, and not just a shoestrung setting for some doofus causing havoc.The bleh:- Animation is a mixed bag.- Humour is also mixed. Some jokes are funny, others not so. I think the visual gags work well, whereas the ""witty"" puns fall flat eight times out of ten. That's what you get when translating German jokes, I guess.- Goal's character. Don't know anything about her, since she's barely awake for most of the game. Can't say she's particularly bad, but I'm unconvinced she's a worthwhile heroine at this point.- The plot is interesting, but largely unremarkable, especially the romance. It's kind of the typical 'save the world and win the girl as a trophy' trope that's all tired out. As far as that goes it's competent, but I'd have liked to have had a better motivator.The bad:- The ending is a total bummer, and you feel like you've accomplished nothing.- Some plot threads I feel should've been addressed in this game, have instead been held off for the sequel.- Some puzzles feel obscure, and only after accidentally solving them do you ""get it"". I felt I stumbled into as many solutions on Deponia as I had eureka moments, which felt very unsatisfying.All told, I think the good outweighs the bad, and none of the bleh moments particularly spoiled the game. If you like 90s LucasArts comedy games (Monkey Island 1-3, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, and the like) then you will probably get your money's worth out of Deponia, and not feel like you've wasted your time.

												Rufus is this generations Guybrush. That's not a fanboy title, he is hopeless in his own way and endearing for that reason. Its not as hard as Resonance and most puzzles are of the medium to hard difficulty and maybe one or two boarder on Toonville or Discworld quality.  Story is told well and the art design on the worlds are original and interesting to explore. I wasn't bored or frustrated when I was temporarily stuck just motivated to solve the problem because I knew I was missing something. It will take you a while if you don't use a guide which I dont do myself unless stuck for days and days...then i might want a hint. Eitherway the only let down is when it ends..you are left wanting a lot more and its certainly been set up for a series of games. Good fun			"

												Super funny! I like the main character for being a self-absorbed jerk. It's nice not play a goodie-two-shoes for a change and I love all the sarcasm and hatred he encounters when speaking with others and how he is a derp and is often oblivious to it. I like how even when he does realize it, it doesn't stop/affect him.This may be a spoiler but I have to say that: In the end of the game, I honestly did feel sorry for him. I mean, we don't know why he is exactly the way he is to begin with. His father left him behind, he is probably emotionally scarred. His life on Deponia doesn't work out. He knows (or at least thinks) that his dad made it to Elysium so he wants to go too. It's not like I'd enjoy living on a smelly planet either you know. Probably the fact he thinks he will leave Deponia soon, causes him not to want to put in any effort on his life or bonds on Deponia, and rather put in all his efforts into finally get Elysium. (And perhaps seeing his dad again) although it's said that his dad was apparently selfish too so whatever. I mean I am fine with him being selfish, at least he is up front about it. In the end, every person is selfish or at least at times but they try to hide it. :P Rufus could have played himself off as not selfish and simply wanting to help Goal the entire way, and reached his actual goal in the end, but instead he was up front about his intentions in the end and also came clean which came from the heart. I can appreciate this characer for that simply because even if he may seem a jerk, at least he stays true to himself. There are plenty of people who seem to do something for another but secretly only do it for a selfish motive, no? So if you hate Rufus please go do some self-reflection. LOLAlbeit I felt sorry for Toni for having to deal with him the way he is though, I still think she is rather stupid for continueing to allow Rufus to stay in her home. I mean, does she still love him or something? If someone would live in my house and did that stuff I'd kick them out mercilessly. Didn't really understand the charm of Goal at all, she seemed like some kind of robotic person, reminded me of Chobits (it's an anime) which I guess is nice in a sense but she was most of the time just asleep so we didn't get to know her personality at all unfortunately.The game's puzzles were fun and combining items in your inventory was as well, although I at times couldn't figure out what to do after trying out tons of ways without any result. Thankfully there are walkthroughs on the internet but I really wished that hadn't been necesarry. The puzzles are all logical, yes, but sometimes there just isn't enough hinting towards what you could do or objects that you can use aren't really obvious, I've had several times where I moved my mouse past an item I could have picked up but it did not show it at the time. This still didn't get in the way of me appreciating the comical aspects, settings, and character interactions in this game, so much in fact, that I recommend it to anyone who has a more dark sense of humor and doesn't get offended easily by jokes that revolve around degradation, or a characters whose considered a selfish jerk in general. :P			"

												Daedalic's Deponia is easily recommended even though it has a few flaws and, for me, a challenging design decision, i.e. the b-a-stard main character. It is well crafted, so main aspects like story, style, user interface and voice acting are almost all of the time great - in that way where you don't have to think about them since you hardly stumble over anything to be irritated much less annoyed by.+ Beautiful comic style graphics+ Awesome intermission songs+ Very good voice acting - believable characters+ Good story+ Mostly very good game/puzzle logic, + Shortcuts to menus, quick-save and quick-load, fast access via inventory+ Drogglejug- Multi-minute bl(a/o)ckscreen when starting and quitting the game- Dislikeable main character that I want to slap in the face from time to time- Some graphical glitches- Some subtitle glitches- Sometimes unnecessarily loud sound pieces- Unnerving background music (at the start, see below)Hints:* F5: Save/load menu* F9 + F10: quick-save + quick-load* If your game starts with an inescapable black screen give it time, maybe 5 minutes. It resolved after 3-4 minutes by itself on my machine.Backgrounds, characters and items are with two exceptions beautiful and interesting and are probably what brought you to the store page. The two exceptions were the two states of a mousetrap in the inventory. By the looks of it the image was read out wrong and thus skewed. In some cases the background panel for dialogue choices was missing.The voice acting is superb and characters are portrayed with consistency thus contributing to mysterious, outlandish (in a good way) story.I do despise the main character and the way you have to go along with his egotistical and destructive reflections, disregard and actions - there is one decision forced on the player much alike ""Why use the door handle when you can break down the door?"" However, that character is also consistent and driving the story. Also, he makes practically every other character pretty likeable - his ex even before she enters the screen. I do hope the final scenes are supposed to indicate a change of character, i.e. a future moderation and an emergence of care for othersI can't say much about the background music of the game since it quickly became unnerving enough for me to mute it and so I don't know whether it improved later on. However, the intermission songs are despite there shortness awesome - think Bard's Tale songs. And they really cracked me up in Drogglejug mode.A few times some very loud sound pieces or music were played, e.g. when making ""the discovery"" coming back to the candy store. Also, Argus is too loud. I would have wished for those to be tuned down with the other volume settings.I really liked the interface, e.g. how the mousewheel seamlessly brings in and out the inventory. I think it an ingenious idea to have a shortcut to the save/load menu from the inventory and I applaud the employment of F-keys.The game logic is sound and puzzle threads are well graspable so that the player can follow the story without much stumbling.I really liked Drogglejug mode. It took me forever to get the reference even though multiple related hints appear throughout the game, e.g. the globe.Two more flaws:1. Sometimes the subtitles glitched from English to German.2. A major, almost off-putting, problem are the blocking black screens that happen when starting or quitting the game. With their three to five minute resolution time - all while catching any keyboard event, e.g. Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Del, Ctrl+Shift+Esc - I think a lot of people may have hard-reset their machines before realising the problem would resolve itself with time.I had the luxury of having another machine on my desk that I could use to search for the problem thus not experiencing the minutes as pure waiting time, otherwise I would have restarted machine 1 after less than 2 minutes. And I refrained from quitting the game in order to write this review without delay. So it's waiting time for me next.In case I didn't make it clear so far, I enjoyed Deponia :)I was looking forward to playing it and wasn't disappointed. And after my 3.5 play-throughs I'm looking forward to the sequel: Chaos on Deponia.Huzzah Drogglejug!			"

												Well, I won’t lie, it’s a tad buggy, and like hate story, Deponia suffers from the flaws of its genre. However, It makes a comeback with superbly drawn art and an interesting setting with interesting characters. There’s also some very good humor in here.My only gripe is that the ending was abrupt. I think they were trying to sell the sequel, which I will get once I see a 50% price drop. Not because that’s all it’s worth, but because this is steam, and I am patient. :3Droggeljug! "

												The game is great after you learn the shortcuts, such as double clicking on doorways and arches automatically take you through them (very helpful in the town). Left clicking skips dialogue that appears in the speech bubbles, which is helpful if you're a fast reader.I really like point and click adventures, and I do reccomend the game, but the main character is such an annoying scumbag. In the beginning I thought he was funny with a sarcastic side. However, he only cares about himself, as the other characters with remind you constantly, and what was once humorous about him gets annoying after a short a while.The game felt rather short though, and due to the main character, I can't say I would want to play the other Deponia games because he's just too much to sit through.

												Deponia brings the classic point and click animated adventure games to a new level of quality. A modern series of games with a system and artwork that might bring Leisure Suit Larry to mind, packed with a lot of humor and abstract situations. There's a plethora of characters with their unique personalities and tons of interesting stuff happening in the plot.It certainly is one of the best games in the point and click genre, yet it's not flawless. One of the flaws is that there are moments where you're clueless as of what you're supposed to do. You're stuck, trying to figure out what to do/where to use an object. After consulting with a solution, it turns out that the thing you didn't know was so ridiculous that you'd probably spend hours on trying to figure it out, and still not get it. + amazing humor+ very long+ original story+ interesting characters- many spots that are easy to get stuck at			"

												Great game, I missed my old adventure games I played about 15 years ago, and this filled me completely with nostalgia. It's fun to play and the story is awesome, the story with the villain with which you share great physical similarities reminds me of what Simon The Sorcerer 3D set up to be the sequel, that was supposed to be great with the villain taking your place in the real world, but that it couldn't be done due to the studio selling the franchise to other developers that dropped the ball badly. I really enjoyed this part, is the more mature of the trilogy, while the second and third have somehow more childish quests. Great game!			"

												Welcome to one of the silliest-and funniest-point-and-clicks you will ever play, right next to old standby classics such as Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Deponia is a wonderfully constructed game, following our overly-sure-of-himself, arrogant, egotistical and occasionally adorkable main character through a world constructed of garbage... That's actually attractive. Far from being a dystopia, life seems particularly pleasant in the world of Deponia, relfected in the interesting places and characters you see along your journey.Beautiful environents, laugh-out-loud humor and intruiging plot and characters will keep you entertained, and encourage you to buy the sequels, which are every bit what this one is.Hurrah, he's off now goodbye!-Camolot			"

												★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Well, it's not so bad and may be even worth playing if you have some time to spend and if you like point and click adventure games with classical 2D graphics.Unfortunatelly there is a few puzzles, which are simply illogical and frustrating (e.g. you need to perform quite lond sequence of proper actions to move the story forward or you need to repeat some action a few times with literally no clue that it makes sense to try once again). The story is fine and finishing the game gives a great satisfaction, but using obligatory walthrough (due to aforementioned blockers) make it less enjoyable.I'm goint to buy next two chapters. As far as I know the second and the third part of the game is much better, with well balanced puzzles and equaly good story.			"

												Deponia is a point-and-click adventure game reminiscent of the Lucasarts classics. It tells the story of eternal screwup and egomaniac Rufus and his efforts to escape the garbage-filled planet he lives on to reach a floating city, Elysium.All in all, the game is well paced, funny, and the right mix of challenging and logical. There was no singular moment where I was just baffled over an answer, though the game does offer large enviroments that can sometimes be overwhelming.If you are a fan of the genre, this game (and it's sequels) should definitely be in your collection, but it certainly won't be worth it to those who are not.

												I like this game for a few reasons: it has got the detailed cartoon graphics I happen to like, the main character is likable even if they try to tell you he isn't and I like the setting of the story. And boy, that's good enough for me!Great entertainment of which I would happily pay the full price, but didn't as I got it at a rediculously low price on a discounted bundle on a weekend sale. Can't wait to play the other Deponia games.ps. It was a little too short from awesome.			"

												This is a game that is true to the fans of these point and click adventures, along the line of sam and max to maniac mansion (yes most good ones came from lucas arts). If you loved those old humorous games of the type than this is not that far from it. Loved every moment and but, by no means does it bring anything new to the table.			"

												Deponia is a point-and-click adventure,about a guy called Rufus,who has attempted to reach Elyisium several times,with a continuing trend of failureRufus as a character definetly has an inspiration from Matt Groening,as his personality of stupidity is fairly similar to Fry from Futurama,and you might see a few others have inspiration from other shows as wellStory seems to be set in the future,where clean water is considered a myth,and most of the people who live on Deponia think espresso was drank by cavemen. Also espresso is a b*tch to get.Pros-Bloody hilarious-Looks gorgeous-The game could run on a toaster of a computer like mine-Droggeljug-Characters well made-The idea of a world made of cr*p is smart-Story is good as wellCons-Animations are poor,you have nice,fluid ones,then you have stop motionAll and all a brilliant point-and-click game8.5/10			"

												Honestly, this game infuriates me. I can never finish an entire puzzle without looking up how to get past a certain bit. Many parts of the puzzles make no sense, and I could think of many easier ways to do them. The fact that the game gives you no tips or guidance what so ever doesn't help matters.    However, the concept and atmosphere are very captivating. The characters are believable, the artwork is pretty, the music is great, the world is intrigueing and I found myself wanting to know more about how it came to be.   There is fun to be had here, and it was worth the €2 I payed for it. I will not be buying the sequels however, and I will only recommend buying this game if it is at a heavily discounted price.			"

												A really good game with an amazing universe, characters, and art. Extremely reminiscent of old 90s point and click games.

												Deponia is a Point & Click game and the first part of a trilogy, preceding Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.The game takes place on the planet Deponia, a real discharge on a large scale. At a distance floats a paradisiac platform, Elysium, reserved for rich people and inaccessible for the inhabitants of Deponia. We control Rufus, a clumsy character with an outsize ego, which loathes the household and working, and wishes only a thing: leave Deponia for Elysium. During an attempt to leave Deponia, Rufus meets Goal, a young inhabitant of Elysium who's here by mistake. He thus decides to return her at home, while hoping to be able to take advantage of it to join Elysium.All right, the scenario is not very original, we stay in the classic pattern of a prince who has to save the princess. But the universe is very nice, rather funny, both by the mind of the characters and by the nonsense of some situations. The gameplay is simple, we collect objects, then we combine them with other objects in the inventory to interact with the elements of the screen. Furthermore, by pressing on the space bar, we can locate at once the elements which we can interact, even if it is never very complicated to find them.Deponia is reminiscent of one of the pillars of the Point and Click, one of my favorite games: Monkey Island. Even if this latter remains much better, we do not remain indifferent to Deponia, to its cartoon animations, its colored universe, its musics and sound effects. Deponia should take you till 10 hours of game to end it. At the end of the game, you unlock the mode Droggeljug, completely useless, which replace all the names and conversations by the word ""Droggeljug"". But it's fun! :)			"

												It was an okay game. Some parts were difficult to get through as this game was sexist, homophobic, and transphobic. The main character is the ""typical"" egotistic, lazy, and dirty minded male. The plot is focus on Rufus attempting to leave Deponia, lugging around an unconscious damsel in distress, and then switching out her BRAIN IMPLANT for his benefit. Worst of all her name is GOAL! Really, that is her name!  Point and click adventures are a genre I enjoy, and it was sad to see such a difference in gaming experience between this and Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. The puzzles themselves were enjoyable and there were moments of humor in good taste. Overall, I would not have bought this game knowing what it truly was, and ignored the very positive reviews. If you like a game that has sexism woven throughout, then this is a game you most likely will enjoy!			"

One of the best point and click games I have played so far.Story - Some people may get annoyed by the attitude of the main character but just bear with the first parts of the story and see how everything turns out. It's totally worth it. The pacing of the development of the story and the main character is just right. From someone who's so egotistic to someone heroic.Visuals - I can say that the artstyle used is quite relaxing, at least for me.Gameplay - The usual point and click game. Find some objects, solve puzzles, engage in conversations to get some clues. Beware of the WTF-ish solutions the main character has for some problems, though. I don't usually check Google for walkthroughs but there are just some parts in this game that left me no choice. Haha.Music - Nothing worth remem.... WAIT. There is. The Chorus guy! "

												A beautiful looking game with an ugly personality. While this game looks amazing it is blatantly misogynistic, full of bugs and rarely funny. Many of the puzzles don't make sense and the main character is just annoying. Why do I want to play as this jerk? The game is visually polished with high production values, but non of that matters once you start reading the sexist and misogynistic dialogue. I played the whole game through to the end and it only gets worse as the game progresses, more bugs, more crashes and more misogyny.I love adventure games, but I hate this one.			"

I have the second one, but haven't played it yet.  I plan on buying the third.  Great story... a fun play, for sure.			"

I played a couple hours in, and hey maybe it gets better. I really wanted to love this game, but seriously, the solutions are so ridiculous. My best way to describe it would be the whole duck and rope solution in the train station from the game ""The Longest Journey"", except that almost every one you do will feel like that.			"

												It's alright. Deponia is a point-and-click adventure with at least some of the obtuse and convoluted puzzle solving that genre entails. I liked the story as it was certainly interesting, but the character you control is entirely without depth or real personality. Technically speaking, it's an unoptomized mess that runs very poorly and is riddled with bugs.Thankfully, the game allows skipping puzzles because there exists a bug that not only makes one of the puzzles incoherent and unsolvable through normal means, but, even given a working solution, it will not allow progress beyond the puzzle.It's short, but fun. Get it when it's cheap.			"

												Excellent adventure game -- a lot of humor.One interesting aspect of Deponia: You play Rufus, a protagonist whose character answers the question ""How would a real-life person who grabs everything that is not nailed down behave?"" You know the type [non-spoiler examples by the way]-- the one who insists that there is a perfectly viable reason to for example break into a museum at night to break a priceless ming vase because there might be something inside, and is sincerely apologetic he needed an amputee's prosthetic leg to knock a kite out of a tree instead of buying one from the store. One aspect: This is a game whose absurdity occasionally extends to puzzle design. So you will probably need either a walk-through or a large dose of experimentation to solve everything. Last comment: If you read the review and know you're going to love the game, go ahead and get the Complete Edition which bundles all three games. Just don't click on the commentary boxes until your second play-through.			"

												This game is amazing. The artwork is beautiful, the voice acting is great, the music is catchy, and the storyline is a tale to behold. As soon as I got it I started playing and couldn't stop. I managed to finish it in two days and am looking forward to getting the next in the trilogy. There are some spots that are a bit back-and-forth; but a double-click fast-travel really speeds things up. Some of the puzzles are a little hard to get a grasp of, mainly because they normally wouldn't work in real life; but this ain't reality folks. It's hard to find great games like this nowadays and I hope to find more. Good luck to all who play in the future.  d~(^.^)~bWARNING!I realize that some people have issues with some of the jokes being made, but try to remember that they are indeed jokes and aren't meant to offend. So anybody sensitive to that kind of comedy, stay away. And one more thing; the main character (Rufus) is understandably hard to like, but again, he is meant to be a sarcastic and satirical character, a joke.			"

												Would not recommend. The art style is fun, the mechanics and voice acting are fine. The puzzles are quite difficult at times, with not enough hints about what you're actually trying to achieve, so I spent hours walking around trying to combine every item with everything else (This is not the case for the most part, but a few sections were particularly frustrating). Fortunately the most difficult of the puzzles (the mini-games) are skippable. This would be not be an issue if the story and characters were engaging enough to draw you through the puzzles, but unfortunately none of the main characters are likeable, and the story is pretty thin. The humour is cute, but doesn't make up for the story and characters. I found the treatment of the female characters in particular pretty grating. There's supposed to be some self-awareness to it I think (the love interest is literally called 'Goal' after all), but she is comatose and generally treated as a possession for most of the game.			"

												Enjoyed this game, particually loved the visuals. The gameplay was a bit confusing and almost impossible at times where sometimes I had to (admittedly) look up instructions on how to pass. Pressing the space bar and right-click really helps with uncovering how to progress as some of the items were really blended in with the nice backgrounds. Eventually got through.Storyline was good, I don't see how this game is sexist when Rufus's stuck-up and often assholish nature comes back to bite him at times. Some of the adult humor and dialogue really caught me off guard in this game.Sympathized with characters such as the ex-girlfriend of Rufus, given what antics Rufus gets up to in this game, although I can see why Rufus's character is disliked I quite liked his character and his design. (He reminded me of Arrow from The Silver Brumby cartoon series)If you want a bit of challenge with point and clicks this is a game you'd like!			"

												Loved it! Funny, I had to stop playing for a while, because I could'nt stop laughing.Best Trilogie puzzle game.The three games are as good as the other, and it is not repetitive.The main caracter is stupiddly funny and genius at the same time.Good story, fun puzzles, some more chalenging then others. Very fun, I recommand all three.Love that at some point in the trilogie you get to play multiple characters at the same time, and your actions have a repercautions on you other parts. Loved it!!!At some point you really have to think hard, but it's worth every minute of play time. And I will play them again, because the story is so fun. ** The trilogie is composed of : Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia			"

												Deponia is a great point-and-click adventure game. It has a fantastic art direction, interesting and well fleshed-out characters, a compelling storyline, and many hours worth of gameplay. It's a great series and you won't be disappointed.That being said, let's consider a few of the cons. Deponia suffers from the curse that haunts most point-and-click adventures: puzzle design. Progress in the game fan often consist not in figuring something out, but on clicking on everything, everyone, in every order imaginable. However, this is mostly a fault of the genre as a whole, true of even great masterpieces like Monkey Island, so you probably know if you can handle this kind of thing or not.Another con is the occasional villainous nature of the protagonist. While Rufus is certainly an anti-hero with plenty of personal faults that people will readily point out to him and which he will readily ignore, a few of his actions are simply mean-spirited. People being harmed by his carelessness is fun and good, but on more than one occassion he sets out to deliberately cause serious harms to his friends. This clashes with the rest of his character, and these moments really do stand out.The jokes can occasionally be crude as well. Nothing vulgar, and always humorous in my opinion, but I can also understand if others disapprove.And lastly, as spoiler free as I can say this, the end of the trilogy leaves several major loose ends.That all being said, Deponia was a fantastic experience and one I will readily share with my friends. The humor is clever, the dialogue is well written, the plot well constructed, and the game only improves as it goes on. Buy this game, support the developers, and demand a sequel trilogy, because this series deserves and demands one!			"

The balance in this game is perfection, humour, style, depth of character, engaging story, challenging puzzles, it has it all and it's one game I could never tire of.You play as Rufus, the unfortunate dweller of the Deponia junk piles, who wants to make his life better by going to Elysium in the sky, the problem? Rufus is a bit dim witted and egotistical, boundlessly funny and not afraid to make the craziest contraptions to achieve his dream, of course that means causing mayhem for everyone around him!Classic point and click style and never disappoints, as I said, perfection :) 10/10			"

												Beautifully drawn, funny, with actually pretty good story (and world setting) masked by simple personal quest of an egocentric protagonist. But also Deponia is a time machine with a dial set to 90's which had twofold effect on me:First I remembered playing good old P&C adventures, warm and cosy feeling with occasional chuckle, and of course accompanied with frustrations because of illogical solutions and pixel hunting. But during those days we didn't have internet so you would be stuck on a certain puzzle for hours/days, repeating your steps making sure you didn't miss anything vital (did I mention illogical?) figuring out that you are dumb after all... Ahh *wipes the tear of reminiscence*Second thing is that I realized why this genre has died out. I can't imagine someone who grew up with today's games enjoying this kind of experience. Nothing here is on platter, you have to figure out on your own how to solve it. Or of course go and find a walk-through online, but they you would ask yourself are you enjoying this or even if is this is for you. So you would drop it and go play something in 3D with jumping and shooting with immediate satisfaction.If this came out in previous century it would be masterpiece worth remembering.			"

												The game is amazing. The main character Rufus is an obnoxious jerk/idiot/egotistical maniac and the plot is ridiculous and the puzzles are sometimes stupid but that's the point! The whole idea is absurd from start to finish (junkyard planet) and the game knows it and makes fun of itself at every step (except at the very end, but that's actually when you start liking Rufus). Hilarious dialogues, cool characters, tons of sarcasm and weirdness - I had an amazing time with this game. Yet, the full price of 19.99 is a bit high for a short point-and-click game (I bought it on sale), but if you ever see it discounted - go for it!			"

												I'd recommend it on a sale anyday.For the full price however, no.It's good, not perfect. The humor is cringeworthy at times, which I won't hold against them, since it's hard to make good humor at times. It does however have that ""Saturday-morning cartoon"" wich I like. It doesn't work in all games, but Deponia managed to pull it off more or less. I really like the visuals, makes me think of ""The inner world"", which also delivers the sam feeling. However, that games has a very uniqe and intresting setting, which this game fell short with sometimes. The story was something that took time before it got interesting, but in the end I was satified. Up until the ending however it felt like I was taking baby steps, and that I was making slow progress all the time. This could also have had to do with the fact that your goal was always the same.  What I have specifically in mind was the fact that you always have oyur focus on waking up Goal, fixing her brain implant and what not. It felt att times that she was not a character, but an object that I had to fix. Not until the end did this change, when she revealed her persenality and emotions towards your actions (like wanting to get to Elyssium). From what I've seen from the later games, thsi should change and she will have a bigger impact on the story.  The puzzels were alright, not to farfetched, which might happen to games that involves puzzels and humor.In conclusion, if you have some time over (I was between assignments at uni) and if you find it on sale, then give it a go.

												Droggeljug!! Run through of the first installment was awesome. I'm definitely in for this game for its interesting set of puzzles and problem solving. Some require logic while others require thinking outside the box or just random experimentation. The visual part of the game is intriguing, cartoon-style on a planet built like a giant junkyard. By all means though, I do highly recommend this game. A number of time I found myself in stitches almost laughing myself silly. I'm eager to test my paws out on the next installment.			"

												A fun, short indie point and click adventure game. I loved the art style, smooth animation, voice acting and the setting of the game.Regrettably the audio does suffer, with music often being quite annoying after the 10th loop. Sound effects were a bit overlooked (or at least were not budgeted for), so there are quite a few sounds that are very short yet are looped for a long time.I really struggled with some of the puzzles, although I would say that is pretty typical for these sorts of games. So you should be prepared to look at a walkthrough, if you're not great at these games.Recommended. Will be buying the rest soon.			"

												I like this game a lot.If you like games like Day of the Tentacle and Monkey Island, then you will probably like this game (and vice versa).If you prefer it when everything makes complete sense, then this is not a game for you.If you get this game and like me halfway through decide that you like it enough to also get Deponia : The Complete Journey, then don't do what I did and complete this game first. Instead, stop playing immediately, because it doesn't seem to be possible to skip to game #2 there.My main complaint is that the music played when there is a puzzle you need to figure out is both distracting and repetitive, so I had turn off the sound for those sections most of the time.Another annoyance is that sometimes there are long repetitive dialogs that you can only skip a small part of at the time, and if you accidentally click too many times it'll start all over.You'll usually get clues about what to do by talking to people or using stuff randomly, so while many of the things you have to do may not seem logical it's still unlikely that you'll get stuck.

												Daedalic is probably one of the last companies making ""traditional"" point and click adventures around, as such, prepare for the sort of ""logic"" and comedy that usually is in titles like these. Deponia encompasses both the faults and the great things about the genre, wrapped around a funny story with some pretty good animation. Rufus, the main character, is very much a Guybrush Threepwood sort of deal. A not very capable person who somehow manages to worm his way out of a bunch of sticky situations with only a.. few.. bruises taken for it. This being the first of a trilogy that was already planned at the time, expect a lot of setup that hints at a deeper lore and character arc in the series beyond what we experience here. If you love point and click adventure, or just a good laugh, I recommend Deponia. Just remember, this is not an action title.			"

												Deponia is literally a dump that Rufus is desperate to leave at the expensive of his friends and his ex, for reasons that are not immediatley apparent. This pretty much makes him a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, but once past this initial premise, Deponia provides a fun point and click ride.Its full of humour aimed in all directions, jibes at characters, adventure game tropes and even at the player trying all combos to progress, it genuinely puts a smile on your face.The puzzles are well paced, starting in confined areas and expanding the world as you go. The story might not be that deep and certain characters don't always work, but the dialogue is strong, the scenery is lovely and the situations the characters end up in keep you invested.

												It was an okay game. Some parts were difficult to get through as this game was sexist, homophobic, and transphobic. The main character is the ""typical"" egotistic, lazy, and dirty minded male. The plot is focus on Rufus attempting to leave Deponia, lugging around an unconscious damsel in distress, and then switching out her BRAIN IMPLANT for his benefit. Worst of all her name is GOAL! Really, that is her name!  Point and click adventures are a genre I enjoy, and it was sad to see such a difference in gaming experience between this and Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. The puzzles themselves were enjoyable and there were moments of humor in good taste. Overall, I would not have bought this game knowing what it truly was, and ignored the very positive reviews. If you like a game that has sexism woven throughout, then this is a game you most likely will enjoy!			"

One of the best point and click games I have played so far.Story - Some people may get annoyed by the attitude of the main character but just bear with the first parts of the story and see how everything turns out. It's totally worth it. The pacing of the development of the story and the main character is just right. From someone who's so egotistic to someone heroic.Visuals - I can say that the artstyle used is quite relaxing, at least for me.Gameplay - The usual point and click game. Find some objects, solve puzzles, engage in conversations to get some clues. Beware of the WTF-ish solutions the main character has for some problems, though. I don't usually check Google for walkthroughs but there are just some parts in this game that left me no choice. Haha.Music - Nothing worth remem.... WAIT. There is. The Chorus guy! "

												Deponia is a Point & Click game and the first part of a trilogy, preceding Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.The game takes place on the planet Deponia, a real discharge on a large scale. At a distance floats a paradisiac platform, Elysium, reserved for rich people and inaccessible for the inhabitants of Deponia. We control Rufus, a clumsy character with an outsize ego, which loathes the household and working, and wishes only a thing: leave Deponia for Elysium. During an attempt to leave Deponia, Rufus meets Goal, a young inhabitant of Elysium who's here by mistake. He thus decides to return her at home, while hoping to be able to take advantage of it to join Elysium.All right, the scenario is not very original, we stay in the classic pattern of a prince who has to save the princess. But the universe is very nice, rather funny, both by the mind of the characters and by the nonsense of some situations. The gameplay is simple, we collect objects, then we combine them with other objects in the inventory to interact with the elements of the screen. Furthermore, by pressing on the space bar, we can locate at once the elements which we can interact, even if it is never very complicated to find them.Deponia is reminiscent of one of the pillars of the Point and Click, one of my favorite games: Monkey Island. Even if this latter remains much better, we do not remain indifferent to Deponia, to its cartoon animations, its colored universe, its musics and sound effects. Deponia should take you till 10 hours of game to end it. At the end of the game, you unlock the mode Droggeljug, completely useless, which replace all the names and conversations by the word ""Droggeljug"". But it's fun! :)			"

												To be fair, I started this game because it had a great art style and was a point-and-click adventure (a genre I never really got into). The story ended up being more expansive than I expected at the start, and the quirky character Rufus was really relatable as I helped him towards the goal of Elysium.This game can get really frustrating, because after you figure out most puzzles it doesn't end well for Rufus. After I'd made Rufus' rocket and hit the ship from Elysium, I had to watch him simply fall back to Deponia and continue droning on about escaping with Goal (enough to nearly make me quit the game).Overall, Rufus is a good character with a bunch of puns and a snappy attitude. He doesn't appreciate his friends as much as he should, so most of what happens really seems to be up to his karma. I love the art style and puzzles (although they can be terribly hard), and the music is impossible to get out of your head.			"

												I've had this in my library forever and finally got around to playing it when the Humble Monthly gave me the 4th game.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and laughed out loud a number of times (the end animation of the robot postman puzzle got me every time).  Some of the puzzles can be tricky and I'd be lying if I said I didn't consult a guide on a few but overall it was a very enjoyable experience.  Worth picking up if you like point & click type games, especially if it's on sale.  If you want to try the whole series though, leave this page and pick up Deponia: The Complete Journey as it includes this and the next 2.10/10.  Would Drogglejug again.			"

												Easily my favourite point and click adventure game, and when I say 'adventure' I mean it, I have become so enthralled in the story and progression that I played it into the small hours of the morning without realising. Definitely worth the money. The voice acting is brilliant and I absolutely adore the songs. Deponia is one of those games in which you absolutely have to try and get all the acheivements which means it has a good length play time. Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody, and I have! I just have to save up for the other two now!			"

												Looking for a good point'n'click adventure with some good comedy - then this is definitely for u... Awesome point'n'click game that will definitely challenge you with it's puzzles :)I enjoyed the story, the puzzles, the soundtrack was perfect and captured the mood and I liked the art direction and the world they created. The dialogue/script was on par with the classic p'n'c hits of yesteryear and is a main reason I'm thumbing this game up and enjoyed it so much (recently finished another game from daedalic ""New beginnings"" but the script/voice acting was not as good as Deponia- altho I enjoyed it as well)Anyway...... once I started Deponia, I couldn't stop playing.. just got done with the 1st instalment and now downloading chaos on deponia as I write this :) Not gonna write much more on the game, buy it and u'll see for urself.. plus it's already on overwhelmingly positive, what else could I say that hasn't probably already been said by the other 4900 reviewers :p			"

												Droggeljug. Droggeljug. Droggeljug. Bought it on sale. It was fun, I enjoyed it. Gameplay is simple. Tip: You can double click to go to places faster. I didn't realize that sooner and I had to walk for the character to walk very very slowly. My fault though, not the game's. Anyway, it's an amusing point and click puzzle adventure game. Funny and ridiculous. Story is okay. Immediately bought the sequel (luckily it was also on sale) because I'm looking forward to what happens next!			"

												This was a fun point-and-click with enough challenging puzzles to keep me interested, but a bit lacklustre in other areas. I liked the premise - a world built on a junk yard - and I likedthat many of the puzzles required you to get creative and build things out of unconventional materials. I did get stuck a few times and had to look up prompts, which I hate doing, but it helped me think about future puzzles differently so I didn't need help towards the end. While the voice acting was decent enough, I found the characters to be quite generic, and I did not care for Rufus's weird creepy possessiveness of Goal as some kind of prize (even her name alludes to this). My main annoyance was that this game has way too much unnecessary dialogue; I put the subtitles on so I could quickly skip through the lines unless they had some useful information. The dialogue was often trying to be funny but much of it was fluff. I like this kind of Monkey Island style game with quirky humour, and there was some of that, but a lot of it could have been cut. The ending was a bit abrupt. I didn't really care for the storyline towards the end; it felt rushed and the puzzles became fewer and further between to make way for overindulgent cut scenes. Overall I enjoyed it, but I'm glad I got it at the sale price.			"

												Disclaimer: I have not played Deponia in English at all. This review is for the German version only.I can only say that this is a wonderful point-and-click adventure game. The makers very obviously love the genre, love writing, and love every single one of their characters (and they love singing, of course). The attention to detail, the backdrops, and even the ""combine items in inventory"" dialogue are all testament to this. The character animations and cutscenes are spot-on. Personally, I love the art style and the fresh humour most of all.Great place to start if you have never played a point-and-click adventure game before, too.			"

The art, characters, and puzzles are enjoyable, with some very well executed fourth wall breaks (including a puzzle that must be solved from the options menu in 2 and a joke about the translation from german in 3). Well designed, well executed and a lot of fun.  When it's on sale under a couple dollars, I'll often buy a few copies to give to friends			"

												I didn't like Deponia. It's not funny and it's too old school to be entertaining. Plus, is full of bugs.			"

												This game, and the entire series (briefly but nolonger excluding 3) are all time favorites.  As dear to me as the classic Lucas Arts and Sierra adventures to which it is hommage.  The art, characters, and puzzles are enjoyable, with some very well executed fourth wall breaks (including a puzzle that must be solved from the options menu in 2 and a joke about the translation from german in 3). Well designed, well executed and a lot of fun.  When it's on sale under a couple dollars, I'll often buy a few copies to give to friends			"

												This game has done somthing I thought was impossible: It made me feel for an egotistical maniac.While the art is excellent the lip sync is completely off, and a few of the animations break occasionally, but overall this game is definitely worth buying when it's on sale. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, but thankfully I bought it on sale, so totally worth it!			"

												Fun to play, as with most adventure games watch a recording and decide if you want to play it, or if you just want to keep watching the recording.			"

												Basic point and click game. Came as part of a sale bundle. For the sale price it is not a bad little game. I will probably play the sequels when they go on sale. It's not the greatest of art or stories but not terrible either.			"

												Got this game hoping it would resemble Broken Sword 1 or 2. Id doesn't. The protagonist is unlikable and annoying. Most other characters are either not interesting or annoying too.Worst part though is the game logic. You have to pretty much click every dialogue option with everyone and click every possible thing to find the solution - that doesn't always make sense in the first place.			"

Don't refrain from using a guide before you waste hours wandering cluelessly and eventually rage quittingCons:Puzzles are not always intuitive or logic at all;Lack of a clue system to avoid getting badly stuck;Idiotic drogglejug achievement;The constant humor gets old pretty fast;If you got this thinking it was a standalone game (as I did), too bad, you'll only see the true ending if you buy more 2 games (or more? idk);Some people will find the content sexist.Pros:Amazing art style, cool environments, decent voice acting.

												This game is solid.I've bought it at the time at a discount so it was defenately worth it for me.I don't know if paying a full price is actually worth it but it heavily depends on how much you loike the old style Sam&Max adventure games.I saw many reviews claim that sometimes the advencement was far fetched.As a old geezer who grew up on Day of the Tentacle, this game was actually quite easy.The humor is not a slap on your knee kinda of thing but more of a giggle.Not to say that it isn't well scripted and fun but don't expect to tear up.Overall, I enjoyed it and it made me purchase the full trilogy (and if I like them all I'll buy the 4th installment as well).

												Well.. it's a funny and nice point click adventure, with soe funny moments... But the annoying and childish Rufus is the good and the bad about this game. BTW, Rufus is the main character, just for you know. He is annoying, childish, selfish and really clumsy. He is also smart and creative, but not so much. This is the first of the 3 games of the trilogy Deponia, I reccommend you play all 3 to get all the story together. Because Rufus is annoying, but the game is not.			"

												Best point and click adventure game I've played so far. Puzzles are hard ( and sometimesa little bit unfair ) but that makes it even more satisfying to solve them. Oh and the game is wicked fun, dialouges are written by a true genius and the music is amazing.I don't see and cons here. Just buy it!!!			"
