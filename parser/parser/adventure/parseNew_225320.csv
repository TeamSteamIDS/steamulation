												Sure these games are old, They have blocky graphics, bad fmv, control schemes that were made before analog sticks and mouse look were the standard, but there is also some of what made early 3d games great as well. This game was designed to be an Indian Jones style game, and it nails it. The enviroment is full of traps, dangerous jumps, puzzles, and aggressive wildlife.You never feel safe in this game, you wont find any hand holding here, you have to explore every bit of the levels just to find out what to do, then you have to experiment ( with jumps, running to avoid, long swims where worry about running out breath)and finally perform all the platforming, shootouts, and puzzle solving perfectly to get to the next level. Because of this the games enviroments feel more alive and real then most newer and graphically better games. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is that the controls will take time to get used to, but once you do you will actually like playing the game this way the game is built with these controls in mind and is expertly designed. Every little movement is in your controll from walking, running, the angle of your jump, grabing, pulling yourself up, these are all controlled with individual button presses where most game especially today will do all that automatically, it is much more challenging, but in the end you feel far more like you actually achieved your moves then you do in any game made today. make sure to google or check the forums to get the game running right on modern OS, dont let that discourage you from playing these amazing games.

												How does Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft measure up to its predecessors? Well, I think a more fitting title for the game could've been Tomb Raider: Part III. In retrospect, I'd apply a similar moniker to Tomb Raider II, as I feel they work more as either expansions or episodes, rather than fully fledged sequels. That being said, what we have here is still more of the same: more of the same action-packed, platforming and puzzle-pulling gameplay of which the Tomb Raider series is so renowned for.Lara Croft returns once again in another globetrotting adventure, this time in search of four pieces of a legendary meteorite, scattered throughout the world. She must travel to India, London, Nevada, the South Pacific and Antarctica to retrieve them, and stop the mad Dr. Willard, among other hackneyed antagonists, from using the meteorite pieces for their own devilish deeds.For the first time in the series, you're allowed to select which set of levels to play in order, but I really don't see the point of this at all, as you end up playing all of them anyway. Lara's mansion makes another welcome appearance, serving once again as a tutorial for newcomers and veterans alike, allowing them to get accustomed to Lara's new abilities, including sprinting, a dive-roll, crawling, and using monkey bars. And yes, you can still lock Winston in the freezer, or even shoot at him on Lara's new shooting range! Secrets return to the system from the first game, in which hard to reach places reward you with a cache of healing items, ammo and even weapons from time to time. And if you collect all of them, you can unlock a secret level, which I love as an incentive for completionists. You can keep track of this by checking your stats, which makes it a lot easier to find them.The main issue I have with Tomb Raider III is inconsistency. Similar to Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III suffers from an uneven pace and lack of balance. For example, the London levels are incredibly boring, long-winded, and full of water and ladder sections, both of which are incredibly cumbersome. The South Pacific levels offer a bit more variety, but here there's an even larger emphasis placed on water, and controlling the kayak is absolutely abysmal. I actually love tank controls, so I have no issues with games like the older Resident Evils or Tomb Raiders 1-5, but the kayak is just so floaty (no pun intended), so sticky, so unresponsive. In contrast, Tomb Raider III has one of the best looking opening levels I've seen in a video game. It truly is stunning how Core managed to work around the limitations of the engine to provide such beautiful locales. Antarctica and Nevada in particular are also very well done sections and feel far more natural and at home in a Tomb Raider game.The difficulty is also just as sporadic and unpredictable as it is in the second game, and I once again find this incredibly grating. There is a large amount of instant deaths, most of which feel so damn cheap. It feels like cheating to just save after every small section just to avoid playing the same parts over and over again, but I suppose that's a better alternative to what the PlayStation players had to suffer through. Whereas in the PlayStation version you have to collect ""Save Crystals"" to save the game (wherever you wish), in the PC version you have an infinite amount of saves (as in previous games), and Save Crystals are converted into floating green crystals that function as instant small medpacks. It's kind of bizarre and I wish Core had just outright removed them rather than changing them.The game looks and sounds fantastic, there's no denying it. The levels are so detailed and considerably less artificial. Effects such as water, fire and muzzle flashes look stunning, and the lighting is phenomenal. It has this autumn-afternoon, orange-green colour palette going on that I really, really like. Nathan McRee returns once again as the composer, and has thankfully resurrected the Tomb Raider Theme from its hideous Tomb Raider II remix. Sound is far more solid and involving in Tomb Raider III, and I think it's one of the best aspects of the game. Judith Gibbins lends her voice to Lara for the second time, and she still remains my favourite voice actress for her. Despite my aversion to the inconsistencies of the game, I'd still recommend it for fans of the previous games. I wouldn't, however, recommend it for someone trying to get into the series for the first time. It's quite difficult and not very accessible to newcomers. I enjoyed the game but I felt that, like the second one, it failed as a sequel and filled more of a expansion pack role. For me, I consider The Last Revelation to be the true sequel.4/5.PS. In Nevada, workers before you enter Area 51 have Lost Souls from Doom and Doom II on the back of their jackets. This alone added half a star to my final score.			"

												Out of all the older Tomb Raiders, this one is the most difficult. I still highly enjoy it. However, don't play it unless you're up for a challenge. In addition, there are two items worth mentioning. First, graphics are naturally better on the PC than the PS1. I noticed that TR1 and TR2 looked a bit cleaner. In TR3, there is a huge difference. It's total eye candy for those used to the PS1 version. And secondly, gone are the evil blue save crystals that you were forced to seek out if you wanted to save your game. Now, you can save your game whenever you please and where blue crystals once resided, now you get green crystals that heal you when you run through them. YAY!			"

												You're probably already familiar with these oldschool series, so I'm going to compare this to TRII. TRIII has advanced lighting, enhanced graphics (includes better textures), new vehicles, new weapons and new moves. It's also has way more difficult puzzles than before and you can choose the order of locations you visit. The locations are: India (starting location), Nevada, South Pacific, London, Antarctica (final location). The game is great (just like any other TR) and if you like adventures, gunfights and puzzles - be sure to play it.The game also has an addon named The Lost Artifact which you can download for free. It adds extra special levels that can be played separately.There's also a widescreen patch that allows you to play in 16:9 and other aspect ratios. You can get it at http://agent077.ho.ua/In a perfect world this should be played after finishing:- Tomb Raider (I)- Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business- Tomb Raider II- Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask			"

												If you are looking at this game you are most likely either a fan of the series or you have played it 10 years ago and you want to relive old memories. Either way, it's worth picking up, it's a great puzzel + adventure game with a beautiful controll system (after you rebind the keys).			"

												Way back when, there was this demo disc called Station Magazine Demo – Disc One and on this, you get to see virtual Lara. Looking at it now she wiggles like a fish however back then, it was pretty damn cool as she explains about her new adventures being Tomb Raider 3 – Adventures of Lara Croft. Of course she describes that Tomb Raider 3 is the most exciting adventure yet as she has new outfits to wear, new locations to explore, advance AI, new features like sprint and so on however there was a key element right at the end of this clip stating she hopes we take good care of her. Well, whilst Tomb Raider 3 has all these new features, once thing is for certain, it's the hardest out of the three by a mile.Whilst made all of those promises, and they are the words straight from Lara herself, the game play hasn't really changed much from the previous installments. Granted she does all those acrobatic maneuvers and showing no signs of vertigo, it still is the same game with different locations. Being the third installment, you think developers Core Design improves some of the game play like better camera angles or have the ability to use the mouse. Unfortunately this was not the case so veterans of the other two games shouldn't have any issues with the controls or putting up with the odd perk like the camera facing directly at Lara front on whilst jumping. Newcomers though will have great difficulty though.http://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-iii-adventures-of-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12585765/7 / 10			"

												i've always loved this game and i like this version more than the PS1's cuz of the brightness and unlimited amount of saving plus the ""health crystals""i should also note that unlike TR1 and TR2 , TR3's items are 3D so in PS1 version they are hard to spot but here the items could be seen bright on dark blocks .... (btw TR3 is dark as !@#$)but on the other hand , the game has alot of crashes that needs to be fixed like :1. if you tweek the gamma or just simply press on the graphics setting inside the game , you'll be ""kicked"" outta the game.    SOLUTION: don't touch that2. random black textures from time to time.   SOLUTION: save the game , exit the game , open the game3. if you customize your controls ""user controls"" and exit the game then open it again , the game would mix the default controls with the user controls .    SOLUTION: everytime you open the game you have to apply the user controls before you play (happens in TR1 and TR2).  it's really easy , your custom controls are saved ... just press action on controls , you'll see the default ones ... press right or left to switch to ""user keys"" and press action.4. as the same as the first point , if you change the graphic setup before you enter the game , you'll have a high chance for the game to crash.   SOLUTION: don't mess with that either5. AND MOST IMPORTANT : this game has no steam overlay ... in other words , if you press the  ""shift+tab""  thingy , it won't work .... same proplem could be found in TR : underworld.SOLUTION: pray that lord gaben fix that ;)enough from cons , now let's talk about this game a little bit.if you played the new Tomb Raider games and eager to play ""the history behind lara"" you must practice the movement of the first 5 tomb raider games which share the same gameplay concept and engine which are vastly different from the modern games , go to the tomb raider guides and see the jump types and how to climb.i don't recommend starting from this game right off the bat cuz TR3 is well known of booby traps and frustrating jumps , dark areas and hard puzzles ... that's why i recommend TR1 and TR2.as i said in the beginning , i love this game ... really good memories and fun moments , if you master the movements i assure you that you will be satisfied , i love the first 5 TRs more than the rediculously easy TRs nowadays7/10best version , classic , needs some small fixes.

												Tomb Raider 3 is a classic PS1 game from yesteryear. It expanded upon the gameplay from Tomb Raider 2, and added numerous features that impressed the hell out of me at the time. Things like actual lighting, and particle effects.It features a dynamic plot that branches off as the game goes on. Your able to pick which parts of the world you go to before eventually culminating in a climax in Antarctica. The story keep your attention and finishes nicely with an uber hard boss fight.Now as much as I like TR3 there are some downsides. Specifically with this port. In the PS1 port of Tomb Raider 3, they removed quicksaving and instead had the player find collectable items that let you quicksave. In the PC port they brought back being able to quicksave anywhere, but kept the savegame crystals and just had them restore your health. I'd suggest installing a mod that removes them to get the best experiencehttp://www.core-design.com/community_tr3withoutcrystals.html "

												This game is also better to both the original and the second Tomb Raider game. All weapons, 1st aids and ammo are no longer in a 2D Sprite for when you can pickup items. Also, more weapons, features and bosses await for your third adventure. Two more important things:->> When you complete India, don't select any other locations except Nevada. Because you will get captured by guards and will lose EVERYTHING; not just your weapons, but ammo and flares too, as those guards will confisicate them.>> And if you want to load Startup options for TR3 to adjust Resolution or that, Right Click on TR3 in Steam Library, then go to Properties, then click on Set Launch Options, and type ""-setup"".

												Before we get to recommendations I should warn you...- Some puzzles may drive you a bit mad  with these controls- There are time-based puzzles and they are not fun- Secrets are now even harder to discover even compared to original Tomb Raider- Level design is not as good as it was before (some levels took me more that 3 hours and some parts I even almost hated)On the plus side- You will be able to find weapons without finding secrets like it was previously- There are more weapons- Story is still decent- Better weapon models and sounds- Better visuals (if you even consider that)Bottom line:Not as good as previous games but still recommended. If you can complete few infuriating puzzles then you're good to go to the end.Also note that final boss is OP and will cause large amoun of rage :)By the way if you find MP5 and/or Desert Eagle then most of the things I menioned will most likely not matter.Have fun!

												Arguably the most hardest Tomb Raider game in the series [And rightfully so in the PS1 version]In the PC version: You do have unlimited saves and the green floating crystals restore health.In the PS1 version: You do not have unlimited saves and the blue floating crystals allows saving.This game controls much like the previous two games [End+Left or Right exits the vehicles for helpful hint], The resolution for the game is adjustable though for some funny reason the FMV's shrink the screen back to it's normal size before reverting back to 1920x1080 [current setting] You can configure button controls for your controller though you must understand button 0, 1, 2 etc to configure them right. Pros> Bonus Level if all Secrets is collected.> Controls can be changed and bind onto controller upon setup. [use -setup in advanced options before launching game]> Once passing the India level. You can select other three: South Pacific, London and Nevada for freedom of choice to proceed.> BGM, Sound effects are working.> Lots of weapons to use fromCons> No difficulty change to adjust between the two versions PS1 to PC difficulty> Secrets can be easy to miss and hard to find [well pretty much the point of them]> Unlimited Saves for the PC version to make the game more forgiving.> So many health to spare [Counting lots of Medipacks to collect and green healing crystals I finished with 22 large and small.] > FMV doesn't keep up to current setting of screen resolution.I'd give this game a 9/10 for a challenging part with freedom of choice, puzzles and gameplay itself. If you want a Tomb Raider game where it can be really punishing it's either Angel of Darkness or the Playstation 1 version. Which you should be able to get from Playstation Network on the PSone classics.			"

												Like many die-hard fans of the classic Tomb Raider games, I rate Tomb Raider 1 as my all-time favorite. However, Tomb Raider 3 lies very closely behind in second place, whereas I feel that the other games don’t quite hold a candle to TR1 and TR3. Let me explain why:For most of the other Tomb Raider games, there were a few locations in each game that I thought were just “meh” and uninspired. Every single location in TR3, however, is an absolute delight to visit. Even the modern-day London levels capture the essence of eerie isolation perfectly, and I’m generally not into modern-day levels. The puzzles are extremely well-done in TR3 and I’d say it’s probably the most difficult classic TR game that I’ve played, alongside TR4.  You can expect about 16 hours of gameplay without a walkthrough so I would highly recommend this game to adventure/puzzle lovers who don’t mind dated graphics.I can’t stress enough how phenomenal the levels “Thames Wharf” and “Aldwych” are. I’m getting nerd chills just thinking about them. TR3 is quite simply an epic classic adventure game, with haunting, memorable levels that leave a lasting impression.Just for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 3 relative to the other classic Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:Tomb Raider 1Tomb Raider 3Tomb Raider: AnniversaryTomb Raider: LegendTomb Raider 2 ( Read my review	)Tomb Raider 5 ( Read my review	)Tomb Raider: UnderworldTomb Raider 4(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness) "

Tomb Raider III is still totally playable on today's operating systems, and while short compared to some games of today, is still worth it.For those that are unaware, these early TR titles tend not to vary too much in play style - it's an action adventure set in the 3rd person perspective, but you can't aim as Lara does all that for you, assuming enemies are in range and can be damaged (although once you start firing it IS possible to continue to do so after moving out of range, provided you don't let go of the trigger!). Also, the camera cannot be altered, and enemies tend to have very limited behaviours/scripts, making it easy to (literally) run rings around them.Lara begins the journey in a jungle setting initially. After completion of the jungle some degree of choice is imparted to us, but be sure to research into your acquisition of the rocket launcher, and the map that strips you of all your weapons. The locations are varied and different enough to ensure the game doesn't get boring too fast. India, the South Pacific, Nevada, London and even Antarctica round out the base game, brought to life with aggressive animals and improved visual effects.Since the last title, Lara can now crouch and sprint in addition to everything she could do before. Sprinting is problematic - Lara steers like a brick while running, so you wont want to do it too often. It makes sense that any Tomb Raider worth their salt should be able to crouch and crawl, so this is a welcome addition to the (somewhat repetitive) gameplay. Monkey-swinging is now possible too.There are some new ways to die too. Quicksand takes a bit of getting used to, but piranha-infested waters should be avoided at all costs. Fall in accidentally and before you know it Lara will be colouring the water red with no time to get out. Poison is introduced as well, mostly in the form of dart traps, but also from blow darts fired by natives with painful looking nose-piercings. The only way to stop poison is to use a health pack or healing crystal, otherwise it'll continue to deplete your health. Perhaps disappointingly, it is still possible to die by dinosaur though. I was surprised they weren't extinct in TR2 around the Great Wall, but now I'm just 'meh' about them hiding under rocks all over the world.The 'then' impressive graphical improvements include smoking gun barrels after firing your pistols, water reflections, coloured lighting, better fire, rain and snow. I recall the problems on our 'then' computer and laugh heartily. Graphics should be a non-issue these days, but if they are, just play around with the setup options.While there have been criticisms in the past about the violence in the series, I have no problem with it. Compared to some games the violence herein is tame. Killing military officers and police doesn't ring entirely true with the character of Lara Croft, who always seemed to me above that sort of thing. She does start her ventures armed with simple pistols after all, suggesting enough experience to know to expect trouble and be able to deal with it, but not so armed to the teeth as to go actively looking for trouble. Greater effort could have gone into the Nevada / Area 51 sub-plot to make it more stealth-friendly - stealth that is proven to have worked in the game in the case of at least one secret that requires no alarm to be raised before Lara reaches it. Shooting up police and military doesn't gel with the mansion-living, quick-witted, smart-minded, aristocratic Lara, in my mind.Ultimately TR3 is an enjoyable game, and while it's showing its age (and despite the moral ambiguity) it is still very much replayable today.

												I enjoyed Tomb Raider 2 more than the original because for me it had a better level design. Tomb Raider 3 is basically more of the same (exploration, some combat and a few puzzles) although i felt that the level design took a few steps back. Sometimes it is a chore to play through, even with the help of a guide. And speaking of which, the game does not support Windowed mode. That really sucks. For me this wasn't really a sequel, but an expansion. If you liked the previous games, you'll like this one too.			"

												Now, I will admit, that I am somewhat affected by nostalgia here, but I do think that this game is great fun, even today.I think that other games have filled its niche pretty well; (I feel like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne capture the feeling I had playing these), but I still like these games, despite their often obtuse and illogical design. There are definitely some stand out examples of really great, fun levels, and you  get to choose to tackle them in whichever order you please, adding strategy and replayability to the game.The game is unabashedly completely bonkers, too. No pretentions about adhering to some internal logic; the game is unafraid of showing you some of the most ridiculous stuff.Lizard men!Immortal Lizard Men in the sewers!Magical make up corporation CEO woman!The coolest, but also most ridiculous depiction of Antarctica I've ever seen!Just be ready for some level design that really is lacking. When ya have a short development cycle, to develop a fully-fledged game with plenty of areas, and you also have to make a bunch of technical improvements, and redo the story and lore, design tends to suffer. Don't get me wrong; this game is loaded with all the ingenious traps and puzzles you'd expect from a Tomb Raiding simulator, but the ♥♥♥♥en spiked ceiling rooms, and Thames Wharf seriously make me want to go raid my own tomb, via a cyanide pill and funeral.Overall, it's quite dated, but it's close to my heart, and it's still got some really cool♥♥♥♥♥♥in it.

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider III did improve on the graphics a lot if comparing to the Tomb Raider II, but the story was not so great in my opinion, and yes, ending got fked up again. I guess it is just speciality of this game. But the story was like lacking something, can't put finger on it. The house improvement was fun, it has secrets in it so you can enjoy it even more. Specially locking up the old man in the freezer, who kept jump scaring me. (farts and moans)...Movement improved a lot, new possibilites, crawling, hang climbing, more vechiles, fancy climbing up style[totaly loved it - if wondering how to do it, when hanging hold ctrl and shift + up arrow]. New weapons, but still preferred dual pistols. And YES, b00bs, ofc they got even better. ;)What I really liked about this one were cutscenes, I was always hoping for some to come. I don't know what was so great about them but they totaly made the game better.It did also have some glitches in it, mostly texture. So be aware, but they should not really affect the gameplay. Usually when I got texture failure, I loaded last save again and it was normal again. What also got me confused were textures for climbable stuff such as wall and ceiling ones. At one place I was literally so lost, were running back and forward for 1 hour, and then I saw a little moss on the ceiling and that triggered the ""aaah, can I climb it?"". Otherwize GREAT game.As in Tomb Raider II, the 3rd one did not have steam overlay function aswell, which meant no screenshots to share. It is okay I guess.I mostly recommend it to old school gamers and to the newest Tomb Raiders fans(to experience where it all got started from).My total story + house playtime was 28 hours. A lot right? But worth it! :DLoved the game.xTzharkz [Eric]			"

												This is the HARDEST of all the Tomb Raider games of any generation (unless you're pedantic and think the dodgy controls of AoD make it more difficult)I personally feel this game is designed for those familiar with the original Tomb Raider format, especially comparing the first level in this (Jungle) to Caves and The Great Wall from TR1&2, which is in my opinion much more difficult than those two.Not gunna talk about the horrific underwater puzzle in Luds Gate - just gunna say USE A GUIDE.But, I do feel this game pushed Tomb Raider's boundaries giving Lara new abilities and new obstacles. The level design is infuriatingly brilliant and the final boss is much more of a challenge than previous games.I HIGHLY recommend this game, but only to those who have perhaps played the original two first. Probably best to emulate TR1 though.			"

												It's a GREAT game for what I've played so far. This is my second Tomb Raider game I've bought, the first one was the new one which lacked a lot of ""Tomb Raiding"" but Tomb Raider III really dives down into the exploring and I highly recommend this game. The game also features an extra little ""Bonus"" level where you explore Lara Croft's (The main character) house with secret rooms and an old man who follows you with a cup of tea farting.Price: £6/about $10Gameplay: 7/10Story: 7/10Graphics: 9/10 (bearing in mind it's 15 years old)===================================Overall game: 9/10Do I recommend this game?: Yes			"

Product received for free
												Tomb Raider became a worldwide sensation among gamers, back in 1996. And Lara Croft became an icon for both men and women for many reasons. Mainly either because of the games or the character herself.After 1996 when the first game was released for the PC, the Playstation and the SEGA Saturn and a year after Tomb Raider II was released for the PC and the Playstation, we were presented in 1998 with Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft, which brought back pretty much the same formula from the last two games, but with a new story, new artifacts to find, new locations to explore, new vehicles, a new arsenal of weapons and a new mechanic that was exclusive to this game.For starters, the gameplay. The controls didn't change much since the last two games. And there's a bit of a mix of opinions concerning the controls. All you pretty much use is the keyboard to control Lara and navigate the menus in the game. And while old school Tomb Raider fans will feel completely comfortable with these controls, new players may feel a little uncomfortable at first, as you don't really use the mouse to control anything, as there were no camera controls, back then. But I believe that these controls are easy to get used to and it's not really something that will make players quit the adventure.The game's graphics suffered a few improvements. Nothing really major, but if you have played Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II, you may notice a slight difference.Now as for the story, it starts with the intro showing us a meteorite crashing onto the earth's surface, then jumping into a few years later, showing a research being conducted by a company called RX Tech at what is Antarctica, nowadays. Now we never really learn much about RX Tech except that they're looking for this meteorite or what's left of it. One of their scientists, Dr. Willard, finds a grave in Antarctica which turned out to be the final resting place of a sailor who was part of an expedition crew.As for Lara, we find her later in India, looking for an artifact only known as the Infada Stone. Which unknowingly for her, is connected to the meteorite. After she finds it, she meets Willard and tells her the story about the crew who had lost a sailor in Antarctica and that the Infada Stone is connected to the meteorite. He also tells her that there are 3 other artifacts and requests her for assistance in finding them.Now this is where the new mechanic that is exclusive to the game gets into the picture. After India, the game gives you the opportunity to choose where to go next, as there are 3 other areas to explore. London, the South Pacific Islands and Area 51, in the Nevada desert. And you can do these in any order you like.Now let's talk about the vehicles. This is probably the only Tomb Raider game so far to provide the player with the widest variety of vehicles to drive. Although it's still not much, there are more vehicles here than in other games. Though truth be told, the snowmobile in Tomb Raider II was sort of iconic. From quad bikes to minecarts to a kayak and even an underwater propulsion unit. FYI: some of these vehicles are a little difficult to control. I mean, most of them control just fine, but the kayak for example can be a little tricky to control.As for the weapons, this is also probably the largest arsenal in the series, so far.Aside from the good old pistols, shotgun and uzis, Lara also gets a desert eagle, an MP5 and a rocket launcher. The grenade launcher and the harpoon gun also make a comeback from Tomb Raider II. And all the weapons in the game are pretty fun to use. I recommend conserving some ammo towards the end (mainly for the Desert Eagle), as it's all gonna be needed.Now I haven't talked about any down sides to Tomb Raider III, though that doesn't mean there aren't any. The game is not perfect, of course. Even games nowadays have their own down sides and glitches. On my end, I didn't see any sort of major glitches. Maybe only one texture failing, but that was just once. There are a few bugs you can exploit for shortcuts and other stuff. Some people also disliked this game a little as it didn't focus on exploring ancient tombs as much as the other games. If you ask me, I liked the game, despite that. And for those of you who don't like short adventures, you will love the length of this one. My playthrough must've taken me like at least a total of 8 or 10 hours to complete. Took me more according to Steam cuz I was using a walkthrough for the secrets. Which I recommend looking for, as it will give you access to a bonus level, after you finish the game!I know this is a pretty old game, but since I worked on this... ""review"" of it, I might aswell give it a personal score. I give Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft an 8/10. It's an awesome game!I see that more and more people are getting into Tomb Raider cuz of the 2013 reboot and now Rise of the Tomb Raider, which I haven't played but I'd love to. But I feel like I should try to get those people to play the old school Tomb Raider titles. I feel like they should learn about where this franchise began. So far I loved all the Tomb Raider games I played. From Tomb Raider to Tomb Raider (2013). And especially loved Angel of Darkness, despite how broken the game was. It was broken, but it had potential. But now is not the time to talk about it.If you are able to, buy the classic Tomb Raider games. Give them a shot. And try to have fun with them!			"

												Oh boy, where to start?Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft is not a bad game. It's not necessarily a good game, either. While the developers added a lot to the default Tomb Raider experience (including new volumetric lighting and 3D particle effects) and enhanced the otherwise unchanged and familiar gameplay formula of jumping, climbing, puzzling, shooting and dying by handing Lara a new set of skills including crawling through tight spaces, a much needed sprinting feature and monkey-swinging your way across certain areas, the game ended up being needlessly convoluted and confusing. For the first time in the series the player can choose where Lara travels next in her adventure after each completed chapter with locations ranging from the dark and rainy London over a mysterious island in the South Pacific, to a highly guarded secret military base in the deserts of Nevada. Only the beginning that takes place in and around abandoned temple ruins in an Indian jungle and the ending of the game are not selectable for story-related reasons. It is certainly not a feature that was needed but it's a neatly implemented idea that offers some minor freedoms to the player with different weapons and ammunition pickups being available in certain sections of the game that might be helpful in others.While the level design in both of the prequels was executed extremely well, Tomb Raider III throws you into a ton of complex and most of the time downright annoying areas that require so much backtracking you'll find yourself running around the levels aimlessly for hours, not knowing where to go or what the game wants from you. Some parts are so ridiculous you'll want to delete the game once you find out what you were supposed to do in order to progress.In terms of locations there is a huge variety of different structures and themes to explore much like in Tomb Raider II even though this time they tend to feel rather random and make you wonder what the hell the writers were thinking when they came up with certain places and designs.Obviously the locations don't come without a plot, which might be the biggest weak point of the game. Granted, the franchise isn't known for captivating stories but while Tomb Raider I and II both did a fairly good job at introducing the player to villains, side characters and overall themes and lore, this game just... doesn't. None of the things you encounter make any sense whenever you find your mind drifting off and occupying itself with questioning them even the slightest. The villains have no sort of backstory let alone motivations for their actions, the settings Lara finds herself in feel almost incidental and even though the main drive of her actions, the so called Infada Artifacts (named after an Indian temple where Lara assumes the only one of the relics to be located only to find out there are actually several more), are not as obscure as the Dagger of Xian (the object of desire in the previous game), they still feel out of place and the writing and lore accompanying them is simply uninspired and lackluster. Hold on, didn't I say Tomb Raider III wasn't necessarily a bad game? Whoops. Well, to be fair, I do enjoy playing through it every once in a while but only because I have suffered enough over the past decade to know where all the hidden (or should I say damn near invisible) items and passageways are and because level skip cheats exist and I don't have to torture myself with some of the ludicrous level design choices.Well, ultimately it's up to you as usual but let my review be a warning and try to take a few breaks before breaking your keyboard in two out of sheer frustration.

												My personal favorite of the series, Tomb Raider 3 is a lot more action packed and has a ton of more varied and interesting locations for you to visit.  While Tomb Raider 2 was a massive leap forward technologically from Tomb Raider 1, Tomb Raider 3 was a massive leap forward in pure design and aesthetic, really opening up the series into what it was meant to be.

												Played on Windows 7 Home EditionBefore playing any of these games you have to understand that they are extremely dated. People who haven't been introduced to the greatness that was the playstation, or perhaps as far back as the Super Nintendo should not buy and play any of these games. I rather like the idea of being able to play some of the greatest classics of the time.First to note are bugs that I have encountered:- Setting up the controls took forever as the game kept freezing right at the keybind menu.--To get around that, if it should happen, set all your vid settings first, then exit the game. This will ensure they are not lost. Then play Lara's Mansion. You may have to use the controls already preset for a little bit. Then go into the menu and change your controls to whatever works. Those who have played Tomb Raider using an emulator via the disk drive will most likely know what kind of control scheme seems to work. It sucks but you can get used to it. Exit the game when you are done to save your settings. You may have to go into the keybind and set it to user keys each time you play because the game allows keybind conflicts between the two. So when you crouch she may draw her pistols. Going into the keybind menu seems to remedy that for some reason.Other than that, I haven't come up with any other bugs. It doesn't use DosBox so that is a major plus. With the higher resolution available it looks a lot nicer than playing on the playstation. Music works fine. I don't know if there are supposed to be sounds when picking up an item, like there was with TR2. If there is, then they are absent.The reality is, in todays standards the game is a 3/10. The only thing that makes it a 3 is the fact that the puzzles are very clever and force you to be calculating in your moves. Today's games are so linear and so shoot'em up that you can run anywhere. Even the latest Tomb Raider titles are like that. Not this game or any of the Core Design TR titles.If you have never played the game on playstation and if you have never used control schemes like these, do not buy these games. They are strictly fan-only as they are extremely dated and VERY DIFFICULT. However, I do recommend this title to those who have played the series in the past.			"

												I played this game along with all the other PSX Tomb Raider games during my childhood. This is one of the Tomb Raider games I didn't play much when I was younger because I thought it was too difficult for me at the time. I still think it's pretty challenging, but it's fun. The graphics are definitely PSX graphics but the game looks and runs smoothly. So far I'm really enjoying this game and cannot wait to actually complete it.My only complaint is that I find the game's lighting is a bit dark during some levels. I just found out, however, instead of constantly using flares, you can just adjust the gamma settings to a higher number. Standard is 3 and I find 4-5 to be perfect. However, changing the gamma settings is pointless because if I try to save or load my game anytime afterwards, the game will crash. I've even tried to change it back to 3 before saving and it does not help. It's rather annoying because  I'm trying to get a good look of my surroundings but if I die I have to load my save file and the game crashes. It will crash even if I attempt to select ""controls"". I would love to know if there is a fix for this!EDIT: Found the fix for this, had to go in the game's file folder and manually change the settings by editing the ""config"" file. If anyone needs help with this, you can right click on the game in your library and clicking Properties>Local Files>Browse Local Files and the then search for the ""config"" document and edit the desired setting there.I also noticed that there are some rather strange graphic glitches from time-to-time. I'll upload them to my steam gallery, currently not sure what causes it but restarting the game usually helps. It's only happened twice.			"

												Tomb raider 3 end the triology,  however after TR1 and 2 , the game really feel ... stretched. The core game is the same, but it's bigger, more advanced with more mechanic, more however doesn't make it better.An exemple is the plot, the storyline in TR1 was simple but efficient, TR2 was less elegant but you still could follow it. In TR3 it's all over the place with an abrupt ending that doesn't really make sence. In my own opinion, the team behind the game put it together in the last minute probably after some disagreement.The game is built around those large levels but they don't seem to work well together, they're not horrible, but the difficult spikes, the bugs, the cheap deads make them very annoying at times. Making those levels bigger probably sounded like a good idea at the time, but they add to the difficulty as often I had no idea where to go or what to do next as the game is very stingy with hints . Trying and failing (often dying) was my only option. For parts of the game a walkthrough is necessary unless you feel like using weeks on end exploring the vast levels for small keys or crystals hidden in dark corners to open secret doors.To make things worse , some parts of the game are positively dull, the London levels are the worse in that respect. They're dark, confusing and depressing with few positive moments, as a player you fell you have to plough through those levels and get them over with.TR3 has its good moments, the core gameplay is there, solving the mysteries or finding your path in the sometimes confusing levels feels rewarding. But smaller and bigger problems in the gameplay cheapen those moments. The controll which never was very good hasn't changed much since TR1 and 2 making things harder for the player as they feel as uneven as ever in an environment that is bigger and more difficult than previous games. This results in cheap deads very often and the liberal use of saves and loads to progress. The great atmosphere in the game is hit and miss, some level felt almost like the original tomb raiders, others felt just dark and cramped and I couldn't wait to finish them. To it's benifit they're varied, you even get to visit a couple of temples , but they still don't give the feel of awe the original gave you. TR3 isn't as pretty as TR2 either, and while it has its moment, it's easily the ugliest of the three.In Conclusion, TR3 isn't a bad game , it's good in its core, but a miriad of problems and bugs makes it a lesser game than it could have been. Play only if you want to experience the Tomb Raider serie (as I do) , you'll have some good moments if you can oversee all its faults. I can't however objectively recommand this game to most gamers.			"

												Back in 1999 and already baffled (in a good way) by the first 2 games of the franchise, I finally bought the 3rd part of Lara Croft's (back then definitely the biggest name of the gaming industry) saga for the Sony Playstation, expecting to get that same fix of what I always loved about Core Design's masterpiece of a franchise and then some.Things, however, didn't go as smoothly as expected.Back then I couldn't get into the game because of its difficulty but I thought it was my fault for - as a kid - sucking at it. I could make progress with time and patience (some levels took me over a month), but it was simply too much of an effort and little fun to pay it off.So I put the game on my waiting list and finally, in 2015 - 16 years later - I went to give it another try and boy, was I disappointed: my displeasure with it didn't change one bit.What actually changed was the maturity in my approach to it, as well as the acquired ability to really be able to identify what went wrong with it.Ok, so TR1 was the big sensation of 1996 and everybody who played it back then know that. Absolutely tremendous in every way.TR2 brought along in 1997 a series of innovations: A more mature approach to the character of Lara itself, with more cutscenes and a more elaborate plotline, different kinds of locations (as the picturesque Venice, a dive in the deep ocean into the Maria Doria, the tibetan foothills, and so on), the introduction of urban scenarios (which in TR2 are not bad at all), new weapons, the clever use of lighting (flares) and so on. Everything underlined by a great level design that offered, in my opinion, a very fair challenge. How could you not like it?The third part, however, tried to surpass the second one not with new resources or a new approach (like TR2 did after TR1), but with (little) flash over substance. It was simply the sequel nobody asked for: More of the same with a twist of lemon. Of course, I won't deny that people back then (like myself) wanted more than anything else just to have more fun with good old Lara, especially after 2 very successful games. But to craft an entire game only on that urge for quantity, and not quality, could only lead to a bland piece of software with a very short lifespan. And that's exactly what happened. I will tell you why:The developers tried to enhance even more the gameplay and challenge by making more intricate puzzles, which, along with the atmosphere (art direction+soundtrack), basically composes the core of the game. The rest is - let's be honest - simply decorative. The level design and some ideas of TR3 are not bad at all, I admit it, and the game may look good (or harmless) in a first impression - when you, for example, are testing the game on a store or in a friend's place (until you eventually buy it). As you play however, the game engine starts to show its age, and you notice that some platforming puzzles are simply too clumsily implemented. There are some ledges you can't even see right, and back then this was even worse, as it was enhanced by the lower resolution.The intention was good, of course. If you are making a sequel you SHOULD bring something new to the table, but they simply didn't have the tools to do it and did it anyway. The result was a very confusing level design filled with alot of unnecessary frustration. Actually this wouldn't be so bad if they also didn't punish you so harshly for failing, which leads me to the other big fault of this game: It's HARD in a very unfair way. 90% of the times you missed a jump, you will either fall inadvertently to your death, or into a river full of piranhas with no possibility of getting out, or drown in quicksand (btw how that happens in the level ""Crash Site"" is just laughable), and the list goes on. ALL of them game-breaking situations, which means you WILL have to load a save. You will then, of course, be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and fall into one of these 2 situations:1. If you didn't save, be ready to ALT+F4 in anger and do something else, because the game's a long ways of being atmospheric or instigating enough to entertain you to play the same thing all over again until the part that you failed. It's a crude form of challenge, a blatant hardship with absolutely no reward apart from the dim ray of hope that things will get eventually better until the end of the game, which never really happens.2. If you, on the other hand, are a good scout and save your game every 5 minutes because you're no fool and already felt from the very beginning that you will have to do that if you wanna avoid frustration,you were right. Congratulations. Thing is, that is still annoying and it still totally breaks the flow of the game (or any game, for that matter). In the end, you can't really enjoy the experience because you're so worried with death and looking everytime over your shoulders for the next trick the developers - for sure - will throw at you. Be it some piece of the ceiling falling over your head with no chance of a timely, spontaneous escape or being crushed by a rolling boulder that just fell from someplace you can't see and didn't give you nearly enough time to even notice that something unusual was about to happen. You will just see Lara dead.So believe me you will be loading your save ALOT before you finally get that jump or notice that they purposedly put the exit of a tunnel in that dark part where the camera (which was always awful) doesn't go, just to keep you wondering in frustration. The game's full with these bad jokes. What they wanted with this I don't know, but if they figured this was going to be fun, they were wrong.Relevant sidenote: Every vehicle mechanic in this game is broken aswell.So that's the gameplay for you, one of the 2 attractions of a typical adventure with Lara. The next one is the atmosphere: As far as the art direction goes, this game unfortunately doesn't even come close either to the mysterious and instigating environments of the first game or to the aliveness and freshness of the plethora of different scenarios of the 2nd part. The London stages I found particulary boring and uninspired, as well as the Area 51 levels in Nevada. This engine simply wasn't designed to do urban stuff. It feels and it plays awkward, even for 1998's standards.On top of it, the story is really generic. I know the story was never a strong point in TR games, but this one's simply doesn't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥either about content nor value. Something a teenager could write in 10 minutes. What's really bad, though, is its presentation. There's absolutely NO fill-in as to why Lara suddenly appeared in Nevada after being 2 minutes ago in London, for example. Everything seems like a poor excuse to shove more levels down your throat - again, the hopeless, pointless struggle of quantity against quality.This entire game was actually more suited to be an expansion of TR2, and the devs actually do a really bad job of hiding this truth, beginning with the couldn't-be-more-generic title of the game: ""Adventures Of Lara Croft"". Are you serious?The soundtrack, however, is not bad at all, despite not actually being something you could call a soundtrack. It's more like short bursts of music that inspire mystery and suspense, following the tradition of TR1 and TR2, which is never a bad thing. A nice cherry to a cake that unfortunately has a bad taste.All in all, if you're a completist like me and you have a strong motivation of playing every single game of the franchise, be it for nostalgia or just for the sake of knowledge, go for it and be warned.But if you just played TR1 and TR2 back then and just wanna have some fun for old time's sake, go play those games again, because this one doesn't make the cut. If you never played anything from the franchise, I beg of you to STAY AWAY. You will ruin your first impression of it. If you know what's good for you, start with TR1.			"

												Loved this game on the PS2, it's all I ever used to play. Good game, but there is one thing I do not like about this game, The current controls of the game, and the fact that when you change the controls to what you want, they do not save. So it's very frustrating. The graphics aren't exactly brilliant, but you must expect that from a very old PS2 game, which has been ported over to PC. The general game and gameplay is interesting and enjoyable, but the controls just annoy me.  "

												This was a hard one. Compared to the two first games, this one was twice as difficult to complete. I think the main reason for that is the amount of backtracking you have to do in maze-like areas. Not that I mind much because the levels are very well designed and the movement has also been improved this time around.And the best part is that this time the music, cutscenes and dialogue work properly without any problems whatsoever! Having music really added a lot to the experience and I'm very happy this isn't going to be a problem any more in the future games.The camera was annoying in this game though, a lot of the time it wouldn't point to where I wanted it to and in previous games when the camera gave you a cinematic view of the level it was to show you something important. That isn't necessarily the case this time which got really irritating as I was playing.And I still won't give it a pass on vehicle control. You thought the snowmobile section was frustrating in the second one? Wait till you try the kayak.Don't read on if you don't want MINOR SPOILERS for the ending cutscene:There's one thing I have to mention though, something that really stuck out to me. In the end cutscene Lara shoots an unsuspecting and unarmed chopper pilot.That is the most shocking and cold blooded thing I have ever seen a video game hero do. I think I understand what happened here: It was just a stupid gag. She's hot, he's stupid and smiles at a hot chick and she shoots him and takes the chopper. I suppose they weren't overly concerned with lore and the psychology of the character at the time.But she didn't need to do it. She's knocked people unconscious before in previous games and all these people were pretty much victims of that spider doctor guy and his evil scheming. The whole thing really stuck out to me and seemed out of place for the character.To give you an analogy, imagine playing Uncharted and Drake is escaping from some temple or whatever and he sees the only car around for a 100 miles. He sneaks up on the driver standing by the side of the road taking a leak, comically taps him on the shoulder and as he turns around he's immediately shot in the face by a smirking Nathan Drake.			"

												One of my favorite Tomb Raiders of all time. This game features a few graphical improvements but still remains on the same engine. You're given more variety in levels this time around, from the London metro system to a lost island in the Pacific ocean. You can tell that the series here is really starting to step away from exploring just tombs. But the platforming and fighting is still there and you're given new moves like crawling and sprinting.

												Maybe the best out of the first three tomb raiders, but once again adds nothing new to the genre and feels more like a glorified add on pack than a new game. Some of the puzzles are just plain stupid too, such as finding the right grainy wall to put a coin into, to get a ticket for a broken, unused underground station... It's just silly. The idea of the game is still far more appealing then the actual execution. Can not recommend.			"

												Not a big fan of this one. While I enjoyed original Tomb Raider and TR2, TR3 just doesn't click for me. There is some good stuff in here but the atmosphere is missing and the gameplay already feels too stagnant, What is new is simply frustrating. Levels are designed to kill you. Many of the traps kill you even when you know what is waiting for you as they require super precise movement in order to avoid. It is not really welcome considering how clucky the game is. I feel I managed to survive the game only due to being TR veteran. The puzzles are pretty badly designed. You will not know where you are trying to get or what you are looking for. You will often find keys and items to open up doors before you even find the place you are trying to open. There are couple vehicles in the game and they control horribly.There is some potential here but the game needed new engine and better controls in order for it to work.			"

												This game is bad. A bad example of a TR game, including the 2013 ""reboot"", but also just in general bad. The game engine itself is archaic in the way the levels are created. All levels are created with ""squares"" is pretty much the best way to describe it. Textured squares. Seems kinda stupid, but in the first two games it worked really well (for 1996-1997)TR 1-2 were set in temples and jungles and what not, and didnt really need TOO much detail; TR3 has levels set in London, and replicated that city with the game engine almost made me quit this game before finishing it, it's that bad. The way computor desks looked, and a friggen kitchen stove that looks to stupid and not realistic at all. Core Design, in my opinion, bit off WAY more than they could've chewed with the amount of detail they were trying to add and replicate in TR3 with the game engine they had (but kudos to them for even trying).Level design in TR3, compared to TR2 (IMO), is plain bad and feels rushed. As i was struggling to enjoy the game, i looked back at reviews from 1998 for TR3, and a review from IGN said almost the same thing. Core Design literally only spent almost a year from when TR2 was released to push this out, and when you play the game you can tell. Levels aren't expanded in the way TR2 was, and feels like a step back in the wrong direction. Platforming is bad in most of the levels, and switches/buttons aren't even clear with what their even doing... ""Hey let's click thi switch on the wall..."" **click** ""....wtf did it do?"" is pretty much what you'll be saying 8-% of the time in TR3. See, TR2 and 1 had a quick clip of waht was opening or a certain sound of something opening around you. TR3, while it DOES has SOME clips of whats opening, not in the amount of what was in the previous titles. So you mostly left with kinda wondering around, feeling like you've never played a game before because you're ♥♥♥♥ing lost in a levels that was rushed with needless deadends and cheap boulder traps.... OMFG THE BOULDER TRAPS....You think they included the Level Skip code for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles? No, they did not. It was included because you can find yourself stuck because you saved at a wonrg time in a level, and for some reason a puzzle you were solving reverted itself, without warning, and the item you used on the puzzle is gone. You're ♥♥♥♥ed. Stuck in London, Antartica, wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you encounter the bug because the developers didnt even QA test their game they rushed out. So you can either restart the crappy designed level, or skip it and feel a little dirty on the inside cause you cheated. I felt dirty twice in this game, both because of a game breaking bug that forced me to do it. The story sucks and the Boulder traps. ♥♥♥♥ the stupid Boulder traps, man...There is some positive stuff going for the game. I loved how i could choose my own path in the way i approach the level i wanted to start first, second, and third. This was nice, and can actually help players create a unique experiance in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. There's a Rocket Launcher. I'm pretty sure Laras' boobs are bigger in this game. She has multiple outfits she wears for each level. And thats it. Verdict? 3/10 Stay away from this POS like the ♥♥♥♥ing Plague, friends... or if you're a TR like me, PLAY IT and enjoy :)			"

												People generally talk about Tomb Raider II and III like they’re the same, without much progress in between. I disagree. Tomb Raider III has so much new effects, animations and actions, you can’t ignore it. I love all the lighting they worked into it, and how they modulate the music and sound to create a beautiful ensemble. In a journey that takes you to five continents, you’ll experience a variety of levels worthy of Lara Croft. Some levels are a bore, others truly energizing. Some are too vast and disperse to be entertaining as a puzzle game – I hate having to backtrack and not getting that easy help today’s games give you when you’re stuck. I remember loving this game when I was a kid. I still do. And I still want that aquarium Lara has at home.			"

												Tomb Raider III is once more another good entry in the franchise. Once again, you get new weapons, vehicles, and moves to statisfy anyone craving for a slight difference from the last game. There's now more details in the environments as well as heavy use of weather to make the out door scenes more natural. The thing I love most about this game is that the middle levels can be played in any order after you go through the India level. This is sighted as the third and final part of the ""Classic Tomb Raider Trilogy"" as afterwards the later games would go through various experimental stages. With a vast number of weapons to use on various enemies, this is a must play game for any Tomb Raider fan.			"

												Another good Tomb Raider. Similarly to Tomb Raider 2, it has a mix of wilderness and cityscape environments, as well as a mix of combat focused and exploration focused levels. Still fun puzzles, level design, and story. The India ""jungle"" levels are  outstanding and some of the most memorable levels I've ever played, if you've ever fantasized of exploring ancient jungle city ruins those levels are more than reason enough to play!Unlike TR2 this game works flawlessly with Windows 8... buy with confidence!

												For me one of the best tomb raider. This is old school. u must find ur way trought crypts, jungle and lots of other places by urself. No ♥♥♥♥ing quicktime events or casual pathfinding tools like in the TR2013.  This is hardcore, this is what TR make so good for me. I change the controls for my own taste, and i must say i play it better then 1999 with controller.at all they leave a negative review, play minecraft or something else.  this is not for casual gamers......

												This game was a big longer than the first 2 games, and a bit harder too. What this mostly is, is Lara goes around the world to get artefacts. Every location gets tied into the storyline, even though they are random. Being able to choose what location to go first, is also amazing, but not big of a deal. If you enjoy adventures, you will enjoy this game...but of course the storyline is just as similar as the previous games. 8/10			"

												People generally talk about Tomb Raider II and III like they’re the same, without much progress in between. I disagree. Tomb Raider III has so much new effects, animations and actions, you can’t ignore it. I love all the lighting they worked into it, and how they modulate the music and sound to create a beautiful ensemble. In a journey that takes you to five continents, you’ll experience a variety of levels worthy of Lara Croft. Some levels are a bore, others truly energizing. Some are too vast and disperse to be entertaining as a puzzle game – I hate having to backtrack and not getting that easy help today’s games give you when you’re stuck. I remember loving this game when I was a kid. I still do. And I still want that aquarium Lara has at home.			"

												This tomb raider seems lack something. It feels messy with a weaker plot and overly complex puzzles. The part where you can choose the order you want to do the levels in doesn't help.

												Although, similar to the previous 2 versions of this game on Windows, there are several bugs to be aware of. It did work very well for me on Windows 10 but on Windows 8.1 i have this FMV Issue i cant seem to solve. So i have to disable the FMV's while i play through, which in this game the settings/options dont have it so i have to manually disable them. Either way, everything else works flawlessly, unlike the other 2 where i had to use a program like Joy to Key to Xpadder, TR 3 took full controller capability without problems, and i use a Logitech RumblePad 2. Besides those things this is an amazing game and really sped up the pace of the series in general. Faster moves, jumps, tricks, etc etc. You can really tell this is where the game developers started to really play with all aspects of the game engine. Really unleashing their potential and finally making a fun and pretty memorable experience. Compared to the first two the amount of Weapons in this game is Ludicrious! Rockets! a Desert Eagle! So much fun! This game is a lot of fun and with some tweaking it looks amazing on modern systems.			"

												This being my first Tomb Raider game, I remember always cheating through all the levels back in the day, because my mushy bab brain couldn't handle the brain straining puzzles and epic exploration. I also remember having to beat Area 51 normally despite cheating, because you needed to get your pistols back to do a level skip without exploding into several very polygonal Lara bits.Years later, I got the TR 1+2+3 bundle on GOG when it was on sale and decided to beat them all (and my disc copy of TR4) without cheating like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.After beating all the classic TR games thoroughly, I can say this is still my favorite classic TR game. It just seems to have the best variety and combination of things, not to mention the non-linear level select world map thing.			"

												So after replaying all of the games in the series I have to say this is my favourite. It's not perfect, and it is very unforgiving in places but for me there are so many things to enjoy in this game. I should probably mention any bias I have here. Tomb raider 1 and 2 were my first games on the PS1, so this was the first game I really followed the build up and development of. I remember buying magazines the and seeing all the new screenshots, and playing the Area 51 demo where you randomly jump off the tower over the fence instead of finding the articfact. So for the review bit. The game improves visually on the first two, significantly in the PC version, it might sound strange to say but I find the game to be beautiful in it's own way. The vibrance of parts of the India, Pacific Islands and the first Nevada level is refeshing and the sunset tone of the last two Nevada levels are visually very pleasing. Lara herself looks good, the last of the classic raiders where she looks somewhat normal in game and didn't have two massive ballons slapped on her chest. Her ponytail flickering bothered me when the camera came in too close behind her but that's a minor issue. The background audio for each of the levels enhances the feeling of being in those places, with sounds of the jungle, tribal drums, snakes and crickets etc., it should be noted the sound quality isn't amazing (noticably worse quality than TR4 or TR5). Lara's voice is how I will always expect it to be, mature sounding, non-whiny, unlike TR4, TR5 and the reboot. Remixes of the classic Tomb Raider music appear in the levels. The India remix is probably some of my favourite music ever from a video game and the military style remix is well done and used suitably. Gameplay wise it is the same block-based system of old, and if you don't like that then it's not the game for you. I will say that it is a system that takes time to get used to but once you do it's not all that bad. New moves such as crawling and monkeyswing might seem minor but they add to the realism of Lara's movemove through levels much like her being able to climb ladders introduced in TR2. One of my issues with the newer games is that Lara never feels very weighted, she magically flies further forward if the jump is longer and her place in the environement always feels a little unreal. In the older games there is no assist for jumps, you just die if it is wrong, that might sound harsh but it is the challenge of platforming that makes up a large part of the games enjoyment. Combat is as always not a strong point of the earlier games, it is something you get used to though, and there is still something about the the sound of drawing those pistols and her just holing them that brings enjoyment. One big plus for me with this game was the level design. You often pass by earlier/later stages of a level which adds to the environements somewhat. I never really felt as though I was backtracking although you do pass through certaina areas numerous times. The non-linear approach to some of the levels is also refreshing, and there are still parts of the game I haven't seen. You can also play the middle three levels in any order adding to your choice. Collectables, in the form of secrets, are present. Some of these are very challenging to find, but this really added to the game for me, and generally they are built into the levels well. Story wise the game is a little thin. There is something there but it's really just as an excuse to send Lara off to these locations. Her interactions with various characters are fun though and allow for Lara's wit and some personality to come through. Settings wise, I found nearly all of the 5 sections enjoyable. London was the exception (mainly the two middle levels) but they all have their own looks. There are ruins, I'm not sure there is an actual Tomb, but it fits in with her thirst for adventure. Overall this is a game I get a lot of enjoyment from. I have played through it 3 times in the last year, the last time just for enjoyment (once you have played through once and don't die at every turn the game is a lot more fun to play) taking in a lot more of the visuals/audio mention in this review. Most definitely my favourite of the series.   "

												Tomb Raider 3 has to be by far the best in the Tomb Raider series, it's like Tomb Raider 2 but better. It has kinda hard puzzles, exploration, secrets, combat and more. The only two bad things about this game are the controls and the combat, the controls are way too confusing and over complicated, and in the combat all you do is hold CTRL and run around hoping you don't die. But besides from that this game has to be at least a 8/10 from me. Jk 0/10 CUZ LARA'S GOT NO♥♥♥♥♥			"
