												-2/10-Nowhere near the Open World games that are out already, its way too linear and story is kinda dullThe idea behind the game is great and very innovative, but poorly executed twice nowIn the open world game genre this game fails to deliver mainly because it lacks any RPG elements and sandbox, basically its a linear shooter with nice areas to explore.Fails to deliver even in the shooter (FPS) category, I only kept playing it because I like the map detail and the idea, exploring is actually the most fun this game has to offer as it is a very nicely crafted postwar map.I tried, but somehow I just can't force myself anymore to finish this gamePros:-Good graphics, but could be better-beautifully crafted, detailed and dense world-Weapon customization on the go-Most of gameplay reminds me on Far Cry, but its good if you are a fan of it-Cry Engine was a great engine choice for this game, but read bellow, it needs fixingCons:-BUGFEST, lost count how many times I fell though the ground into the big empty and how many times it failed to load environment and how many times I had to restart the game because couldn't complete mission due to a bug.-In many places game feels incomplete, like content has been cut out to be sold later as DLC-Optimization needs working on, stuttering in some places and other glitches-Dull, predictable AI, poor AI variation, AI bullet sponges-Poor voice acting-Poor writing, story is just not engaging and not detailed enough-Very tiny weapon choice, why the hell can't I pick up and use enemy weaponry???-Cannot shoot while riding a bike-No supressor for rifles-Stealth system is a total lackluster, a disaster in a game that requires it to a large part, cannot even hide bodies-No voice acting or dialogue options for main character-Characters are boring, mostly feel irrelevant, couldn't care less about them-Activities and missions get repetitive very fast, some even to an annoying level-No co-op for story mode and co-op resistance mode has only a few missions-No other multiplayer besides co-operative mode-Map is separated into sectors which can only to be unlocked one by one in doing story missions, so where is the open world?-Liberating outposts and other side activities don't feel rewarding, but rather a chore after a whileIn summary I couldn't care less about liberating a bunch of boring, dull, lazy, same repeating face over and over characters and AI, it rather seems that the KPA is the best thing that could happen to the people in the game.its a rushed out game, its substandard, with a pseudo open world, where your movement is so limited, that it feels just like a linear shooter.A lot work is needed here to make it worth to be a AAA title, many updates on gameplay and mechanics including stealth are needed.Can't even recommend it on sale, not worth its full price, no way.I guess this is it for Homefront franchise			"

Homefront®: The Revolution is an open world FPS, similar to the likes of Far Cry but it sure feels like a far cry away from a successful game and franchise.I've played this in 2017, long after its shaky release and optimization wise the game runs quite smooth actually. Not hickups, no stuttering, it's runs pretty well compared to the mess it was at launch. But let's set aside the technical aspects of the game and lets focus on the things that really matter; the game itself.Let's start on a positive note and say that this game is a vast improvement over its predecessor. In every single way. The gunplay is entertaining and is actually one of the few saving graces of the game. You can customize your weapons on the spot, each weapon having 3 different types of transformation and that sure allows for variety in you want to take out the enemy. It's sort of reminiscent of Crysis and I guess it's not really a coincidence because this game is based on CRYENGINE, which while it might still look pretty you cannot help the fact that the models seem a little bit dated at times. Visually the game is pretty nice looking. The ruined city of Philadelphia looks fitting for the revolution theme that the game tries to create. The gameplay alternates between the red zones and the yellow zones.The red zones are all out combat, you liberating various points on the map for the Resistance, either by killing everyone or hacking something... and that's about it. There are a couple of variations and mini-puzzles (?) [not really as in you have to find a different way to access part of the objective) but basically it all boils down to doing the same thing over and over again. It gets repetitive really fast and mostly it feels like a chore or a means to get influence over the area rather than actually going and liberating a part of your city. After freeing an outpost/stronghold, that place becomes part of the resistance, allowing you to quickly change your loadout, sell/buy stuff and upgrade your equipment. You can also recruit resistance AI teammates but doing so will probably annoy you more than anything but we will get to the AI later.Yellow zones are the still standing parts of the city in which the KPA are patrolling the streets. The game switches to a more stealth oriented playstyle i.e avoiding patrols, quietly killing guards, helping people in need. Essential you have the  Hearts & Minds  meter which you need to fill to 100% by sabotaging KPA posts, capturing stronghold, freeing civilians, assassinating KPA officials. The game actually show hints of brilliance in the yellow zones and the transition from red to yellow is certainly one of the better aspects of the game.Which bring me to the failing point of the game. The AI is dumb. Like ridiculously dumb. I can understand that trying to balance between stealth'em up and FPS might be hard, but the AI really drains away the immersion the game is so desperately trying to push. You kill a guard from a distance in silence and the rest will just act all jittery for a little and then proceed like nothing has happened. It's feels stupid, it looks stupid and it plays stupid. The moment you make some noise or miss a silenced shot, you're instantly discovered and unless you find a safe spot, endless waves of enemies will come after you. They will even enter your 'liberated' outposts and start shooting resistance members like a 18th century soldier. Standing directly facing the enemy and shooting till something dies. I've seen better AI in games from the 90s and the comical situations I've encountered in Homefront: The Revolution are plentiful and that's not always funny. Your AI teammates will block you, they will follow you like puppies having no sense of self preservation or intelligence and they behave more like toddlers rather than revolutionaries.The story is cheesy but not the 'over-the-top-so-bad-is-good' cheesy. It tries to take itself seriously and the whole premise is ridiculous from the get go anyway. North Korea has control over the US and they're essentially tormenting the entire population. Nonetheless, there's some good dialogue in the game and some interesting themes that play out and I should give credit to that. Mostly the whole revolution/violence is not the magic bullet that will bring the country back together. There are collaborators, there are parts of the population who abhor violence even after the banner of freedom, there are people who think of all the innocents who get caught in the crossfire. It's actually kind refreshing to see that theme being explored a little more rather that just having a supersoldier killing everyone for America.Finally, the longevity of the game is less than I expected and the ending is very abrupt and rushed beyond all belief. The DLCs are about 90 minutes each while playing casually and the main character actually suffers from Gordon Freeman disease, that is to say he's mute. It's really baffling why they did this in a game which features plenty of dialogue between members of your own faction. He actually does get voiced in the Aftermath DLC but it's too little, too late.I wish there was a mixed recommendation for this game and by judging from the overall score of the game I can say that this should become a feature on steam soon, but I cannot in all honesty recommend this game  at its current price to anyone. I got it on a heavy discount for about $10 and I think I got my monies worth of entertainment. Asking and giving more than this, I consider it a really bad idea. If you enjoy Far Cry and other semi-open world FPS (the game is actually pretty linear but you can roam in each of the zones you unlock), you might want to give this one a shot when heavily discounted			"

												Listen, I love the whole homefront theme. Well I loved it until this garbage came out. I know you guys worked hard on it but still. Glitches up the wazoo, horrible storyline, and no real feel of change as you take back all the tiny outposts along your way to the main missions. I wish I had listened to the reviews and not given you guys the benefit of the doubt. I hate to say it but damn guys....			"

												For the first ten or so hours, I was ready to defend Homefront: The Revolution. The setting and atmosphere was, for a while at least, enough to make me overlook some small bugs here and there. But then the cracks really started showing, specifically in regards to artificial difficulty brought about by endlessly spawning enemies. As the game continued, it seemed that engaging even one enemy out in the open summoned a horde of his buddies, all of whom know exactly where you are as soon as they show up. They will continue spawning until you eventually become overwhelmed and die. This becomes increasingly annoying when you're merely trying to make your way to the next main objective and each time you turn a corner there's a patrol that wasn't there 2 minutes ago. Yes, they just popped into existence once you looked away and back again. And now they're like some sort of reverse necromancers, endlessly summoning every living thing within a 10 mile radius to zero in on you for the rest of time. I was willing to overlook the iffy blandness of the rest of the game and just kick back for a low budget urban Far Cry. But this is supremely unfun. Do not buy or play this game ever.			"

												For $10, this game is a blast. Although it may not be as polished or bug free as other open world game, the gameplay and exploration is this games strong suit. After many patches since the games release, I feel this is the version they wanted to put out. Pros+ Large, highly detailed open world+ AI is (usually) pretty smart, they will flank behind you and kill you if you don't pay attention+ No regenerating health, health packs are scarce, and you can die in about 3-4 shots which makes the game really  challenging on the hardest difficulty+ A good amount of gun customization, allows you to change attachments on the fly+ The guns feel heavy, killing enemies is satisfying+ Amazing graphics on Ultra settings, also has a texture resoultion upscaler if you have a powerful PC+ Very smooth, barely droped below 45FPS (my pc isn't that powerful to run ultra at a constant 60FPS)Neutral* The co-op mode is fun, if you can find players for it.* Sound design is a little weird at times, sometimes certain sound effects are either too loud or too quiet* The motorbike allows you to travel around faster, but there isn't much open room to go really fast, and there are enemies every where so you can get shot off if you're going too slow* When the AI isn't being smart, they are doing some weird stuff, like sprinting around for no reason at all, or getting stuck in somewhere they shouldn't be* Story is at times interesting, other times cliched and uninspired, but it's easy to not pay attention and still enjoy the gameplay* No way to completely turn off the HUD or to make it smaller/more opaque. I can ignore the minimap when I don't need it, but I wish you could move it out of the way some more, it's pretty bigNegative- Some minor bugs that are seemingly easy to fix, but still persist in the game- The DLC doesn't add a whole lot to the game (get them on sale if you want them, also the last DLC they are making looks to be one of the best they've made)- Wish there were more ""base"" guns (guns that aren't converted)- Stealth is mediocre- The ♥♥♥♥ing radio is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying. Your radio is always blowing up with messages from 4 different people at once. Too bad you can't change just the volume of the radio, instead you have to turn down the volume for all dialogOverall, while this game does have it's flaws, I believe this is one of the best games to come out of 2016. I'm a sucker for open-world FPS games, and this game gave me what I was wanting. 7/10, buy it on sale.			"

												The hype was real for this game, at least for me that is. Love it or hate it, but I was a huge fan of the first Homefront. Even though the gameplay was a bit generic, I did enjoy the setting and world it brought you into. So naturally when watching trailers for the next installment, Homefront: The Revolution, I was pretty hyped. I preordered it and was happy to finally get my hands on it. Then I played it. I first noticed small changes in the story and the opening ""cinematic"" seemed kind of cheesy at times with its obvious people standing in front of a green screen but it was fine. Opening scenes were pretty cool, I was starting to get into it, then I got to control the character. The first little city area was really nice and detailed, but I noticed some issues with animations on NPC characters and my character. For example, when I was using a tool to cut some chain on a fence, the animation was totally out of sync. Minor things, nothing to get upset about but it was noticable. So I finish this kind of tutorial mission and was on my way to the more open world section of the game. Then I notice a lot of other... Things.First thing I noticed was this NPC character I was talking to, the most interesting thing about him is he had a twin brother who sounded exactly the same. But what do you mean? Well I guess they decided that two of the same NPCs were going to stand right next to eachother all the time. Now I understand that character models will be reused, that's normal, but when two of the same model NPC are next to eachother all the time and in a VERY small area it's just really noticable. This actually happened multiple times too, if it happened a few times sure I get it, it happens, but this was constant and just really off putting. Now when I started entering this ""open world"" area, I noticed immediate frame drops. Now my PC is pretty decent, i7 4690k, GTX 970, 16GB memory, ect., and even when turning the settings on low it was still really choppy. On top of that the game just felt clunky, moving around and shooting just didn't feel fluid. I had just got done playing the new DOOM, which is a wonderful game that is just a very smooth experience, and I did feel that Homefront felt more clunky just from comparison. I know they are two different games with different play styles, but they are both FPS games and it really gives a comparison from a smooth FPS, to a clunky FPS. Something to mention is the graphics. I'm not too picky about the way a game looks, but really this game did not look very good for something coming out in 2016 on CryEngine, even on the highest settings. They are not bad, the graphics just seemed a bit outdated. Now some areas of the game look really nice, for example the city areas. They can be very detailed, and look especially good durning night time with some weather effects like rain. However there are lots of areas that just look bland and have very poor textures.One thing I thought was pretty innovative was the weapon system. You can unlock different customizations to turn one basic weapon into a completely different weapon, or just swapping out parts for that weapon on the spot. Like turning a crossbow into a shotgun, that's awesome. You can go in all sneaky beaky like (except sneaking is almost non-existant) and then blast someone in close quarters. Only problem is navigating the menu for swapping out weapon parts can be really clunky, and has often gotten me killed when I was trying to swap things out on the fly.After plays a few missions the game felt kind of repeatitive, which is fine if you like games like that, I personally don't mind it. It kind of reminds me of Farcry, specifically Farcry 3. The side missions in Farcry 3 could get repeatitive, but the main story missions were actually unique and were overall fun. Homefronts side missions could get repeatitive, but the main story missions were only kind of fun... Sometimes. The biggest problem I had was when you entered a new city area and you had to ""raise morale"" by doing stuff that the KPA (Bad guys) didn't like. The game just slowed to a crawl. I was SO BORED at this part and it took what seemed like forever to even finish the mission. At this point the game was running terribly with choppy frames and clunky gameplay, I was bored out of my mind, the teammates I recruited were all the same NPC model, and the game looked very subpar. I'm pretty disappointed, and this is where I stopped playing. Now I know this game went through development hell and that heavy affected the way this project turned out, but these things still cannot be overlooked. I wish I had played a bit more before writing this review, especially since this is only touching on the single player experience and not the co-op, but only after a few hours in I think I've had quite a bit to talk about. Of course this is all just my experience and opinion on things, which I know everyone cares about and values on the internet, but I hope my insight has given you some useful information about Homefront: The Revolution. I strongly recommend watching some gameplay video of both the story and coop mode and reading more before you decide to purchase to see if this game is reight for you. -Hunnytoes "

												If you were waiting for the 2.0 patch then I'm happy to say you made the right decision. The patch released today makes the game run like a whole new game. They did a fantastic job with this patch. My SLI flicker woes are now gone and the game is running like a well oiled machine at 3440x1440 with everything maxed, minus the TAA blur. Prior to this patch the game was a flickering, juddery mess with huge fps drops randomly. Good job Dambuster on this patch. Had only the game released like this, you would have had a ""mostly positive"" game I'm sure.			"

												Game breaking bug during Power To The People mission. Stuck at 0% and does not register completed objectives. Since it is a main mission there's no way around it. Neither loading an older save nor restarting the game helped. I even reinstalled and started a new game only to get the exact same bug during second playthrough. There doesn't seem to be any fix for this and the developers don't seem interested in providing it or any information regarding this problem. I can't recommend buying this game under any circumstances.			"

Posted: May 26, 2016
												Warning!: This review will be in depth, and I will not include a tl;drAfter spending 13 hours with the main campaign, and finishing it, Homefront: The Revolution is easily one of the worst games I have ever played, but unlike most of the negative reviews for this game, I am going to give legitimate reasons as to why I feel this wayBefore I get into the review, I would just like to say that before I purchased this game, I was one of the naysayers who defended it, beliveing that the game wasn't as bad as everybody said it was, but after buying and playing it, I hate to say that I agree with (most of) what people are sayingOnto the review Pros1. 2 Characters (Notice how I said 2, and not characters in general). Only 2 characters throughout this entire game were above the level of ""bareable"". Jack is the buddy/dudebro of the game, the guy that cracks jokes, kicks♥♥♥♥♥ and is just fun to be around. Dana is batshit, but the good kind, the kind that makes the inner psychopath in you say ""I would totally do that!"". The rest are outright boring and flat, and when characters die you don't feel anything for them2. The setting: Dambusters recreation of Philadelphia feels alive, and is bursting with personality. You actually feel as if there was a huge war, and that the KPA is a formidable force to be reckoned with, although I found the minimal refrences to historical monuments/figures odd for a city full chocked full of them3. Alternate future: Since this game is based in an alternate future, it is plausible that the North Koreans were able to take over America, unlike the first gameCons1. The story: convoluted and uninteresting. It isn't easy to follow, nor do you feel very invested in it2. The gameplay: combat is extremely clunky, (you get used to it over time), and because of this, it makes slogging through the games campaign all the more painful3. Braindead AI: The AI is extremely stupid, the only way you get killed by them is if they swarm you, and this happens more often than not4. Stealth is a no go: Killing a KPA soldier, even with a silencer, sends off an imediate alert that, instead of making nearby soldiers investigate your position, instantly spawns in enemies that start drilling you with bullets. Stealth is essentialy a terrible tactic, and the whole system needs an overhaul5. Rinse and repeat objectives: So essentially to finish the story, you need to capture different points within the hub worlds, which then unlock the next mission in the story. The problem with this is, that is literally what you do for the entire game. It boils down to: Go here, clear and capture all of these points, then do the story mission(s), repeat. This gets extremely repetitive, and even borderline annoying, coupled with the fact that the gunplay is terrible makes it all the more dreadfull6. Bugs galore. Whether it be floating pedestrians, stuttering or un-capturable points, this game is filled with a ridiculous amount of bugs that will end up frustrating you to the point where you don't want to play the game anymore7. Phantom ""Open-world"". This games is NOT open world, like Fry Cry is open world. It is filled with ""hub worlds"". Think Dragon Age Inqusition type hub worlds. 8.Brady do this, Brady do that. BRADY, BRADY!: The games characters rely on you WAY too much, making you feel like you are the de-facto leader, and/or errand boy, when you are just another soldier fighting with the resistance. I get that you are playing the protagonist, but the game doesn't present you as anyone special, just another soldier, so another resistance fighter could easily do what you do9. Resorting to Call Of Duty tactics: The game tries its best to paint your charatcer as a guriella fighter, and in the beginning of the game it does that. You will have low ammo, low health, and have to scavenge to craft items like molotovs or RC bombs that give you an edge. But by mid-game, you will have upgraded your character enough to where all of that gets tossed out the window, and you can essentially go rambo and just run in and gun soldiers down. Yes, you could ""role-play"" as a guriella fighter, but the annoying AI doesn't/won't make you want to10. Same-y enemies: It's essential the same enemy type over and over with no variation, and this really emphasizes that feeling of boredom you will eventually get11. Moral argument: This one is personal, but I found the moral arguemnt discussed by a ceratin character in the game to be extremely annoying. His argument is basically ""see, this is what happens when you cause trouble!"" I'm sorry, I didin't realize that a revolution was going to be PEACEFUL, when we are stock pilling weapons, ammo and materials for a godamn war. ""People get hurt"" Well no duh, it's a freaking war for freedom, don't like it? Shouldn't have signed up in the first place. 12. Phantom ""Customization"". The ""on the fly"" gun customization intially shown for this game is a ruse. There are few weapons to choose from, your setup will most likely end up being an SMG, Assault Rifle, and an RPG. There are few upgrades/attatchments that make each weapon feel unique, although there are some interesting conversions, maybe 2 or 3, but you will always end up switching back to the setup stated above13. Compensation for braindead AI will make some missions difficult: In certain missions, the game will spawn endless hordes of enemies to compensate for their lack of good scripting/coding, and more often than not this makes missions a pain, especially missions where you need to defend something, or you have resistance fighting with you and they get mowed down14. Poor character animation and lip sync: The characters animations are absolutely atrocious, espesially for a game released in 2016. Mass effect, yes the original, has better animations than this15. Game breaking bugs: I haven't experienced this, but I know some people who have run into a bug during a certain mission that does not allow them to progress at all, making the game basically unplayable, besides co-op16. Side missions: A complete waste of time, and unrewarding17. Graphics: Graphics are generally good (that's cry engine for you) but some low res textures are pretty noticableThings not mentioned:Multiplayer: didn't bother to try it, didn't feel like it would justify a 60$ asking priceSeason pass: not sure what they will include, but I know some people enjoy this game, so I won't tell you not to buy itFinal verdict: 2/10Purchase recommendation: Do not pruchase, at all, not even on saleI really wanted to like Homefront: The Revolution, I was part of the minority who didn't write off the game, and wanted to give it a chance, but sadly, that didn't happen. This game would have honestly done better as a linear shooter, because the main missions were easily the best part of the game. Sad to say, but in terms of overall game design, the original Homefront was leagues better than this game. Say what you will, but the original had better writing, an interesting story, great characters, great mechanics/gunplay, and included a Battlefield/CoD like, PvP centered multiplayer that gave it longevity and spawned a cult following. Dambuster essentially butchered that, and I fear this is the end of the Homefront ""franchise"" (if it was ever one) and should be laid to rest			"

												My experience with the first Homefront game was not especially pleasant.  Although the setting was well done and interesting (even allowing for the ludicrous plot) the game itself felt like every linear FPS single-player campaign criticism rolled into one.  So when Homefront: Revolution was announced, I scoffed and then ignored it until recently when a free weekend had some friends reporting good things and I tried it.  Glad I did.I think most people compare HF:R to an urban Far Cry 3/4 but that's because it's largely true.  Enter a region, note your plot objective, then ignore it as you fight your way through buildings, conquering then and flipping the map from red to blue.  Actions can increase your standing with the city residents until they are finally inspired to rise up and riot, attacking their Korean occupiers.  It's repetitive and, like Far Cry (or games like Mad Max or Shadow of Mordor), by the second strike point you'll probably know if you feel like playing 30 more hours because the game won't change significantly.  The story is serviceable even if nothing amazing or thought-provoking.  It's an excuse to run around a ruined city and shoot dudes and take over territory.  The simple bottom line is that if you enjoy games in the Ubisoft ""point control"" model, you'll likely enjoy Homefront: Revolution.Guns were interesting though the system took me a little while to appreciate. You have your Primary/Secondary weapon but each of them can convert into two additional weapons.  So your semi-auto pistol can convert into a small SMG and/or a silenced pneumatic pistol depending on your needs.  Add in attachments (scopes, silencers, etc) and you get an impressive amount of flexibility and essentially seven weapons at a time (3x Primary, 3x Secondary plus an RPG) though you'll need to plan tactically and find cover to convert your assault rifle into a light machine gun on the fly.  Still, it nicely bridges the gap between console-based limited gun slots and becoming a walking arsenal.Finally, the game includes a co-op system where you and up to three friends can band together for missions and gain experience and money for skill/weapon/gear unlocks.  Although there's an air of randomness about it (you buy a crate and hope for a good weapon), it's all self-contained and there's no item store or cash shops.  The system is in addition to the single player game rather than the focus and it adds some additional play once you're done.To be fair, trying Homefront: Revolution well after its initial release meant that I avoided its rocky, buggy launch and got in after the worst of it was ironed out.  When I played, it was relatively bug free.  No game-breaking issues for me, although once I dropped through the map and once had a physics glitch fatally launch me into the air.  Out of 50 hours of play, I can't complain though. It played well on my aging system (i7-860 @ 3.6GHz, R9 290X, 12GB) with a consistent 60fps at 1080p on High settings.			"

												Short Review:Pros-Decent Graphics-Okay gun customization and combatCons-Poorly Optimized-Short Story-Terrible Animation-Bad Voice Acting-Lack of uniqueness in content-Very small for being advertised as ""Open World""Long Review:Intro: Homefront at first seemed like a promising game, but red lights began flashing when the original studio closed down and had to switch hands to Dambuster. Deepsilver ended up publishing the game and they have published decent titles in the past including the newest Saints Row and both games in the Metro series. Following this obvious poor pattern of development, it should already be a clear sign that the title probably won't be that good. Pros: That being said the game itself is pretty bad. To start with the pros, I tried my best to understand what good came out of this game, but its really tough considering theres such a very very small amount of unique polish that no other game has. The idea of liberating apartments just reminds me of Far Cry 4, and the ""Hearts and Minds"" or morale meter of increasing the civillian morale is already stolen from other games, first that comes to mind is InFamous: Second Son. The gunplay is that of every other game except it does sort've have an interesting customization concept of swapping gun's slide and replacing it with totally different body. As mentioned in the short review, the graphics are decent, but they're really nothing to go home about, moderate as of 2016 although in a year's time they definitely will fall very short. Cons: Now after slaying the pros I want to present the cons. For one thing, I am running a Nvidia GeForce GtX 980 FTW Edition, and I still found a lot of very poor optimization areas throughout my playthrough. Many stuttering issues that brought my FPS just because a cutscene began or a few enemies loaded on my screen. Next I want to touch on the story. In my opinion the concept seemed kind've cool and sort've unique. The execution of that said concept is very poor, the story is very cliche and predictable, Its also incredibly short, I  managed to beat it in 3 sit downs of about 3 hours. The gameplay in it is so repetitive and you just do the exact same things which include capturing small bases, finding an object and fighting KPA. After you end up beating this short but not very sweet game, you can't even return to it to complete extra side content or upgrade your weapons all the way, which punishes any player who decides to dedicate extra time towards doing the repetitive tasks. The overall production value in this game falls short of many games I've ever played. The animation is absolutely terrible. when jumping in real life I typically don't see my legs spaghetti everywhere even if I am quite thin. Also in cutscenes the major characters seem to just sink into the ground as if the KPA replaced all of America's ground with quicksand. The voice acting falls very short in the impressions that some VA's try to do. And it almost seems as if the highest produced portion of this game is the song that plays in the 35 minute long credits.Overall: The only time I'd recommend you to buy this game is to MAYBE play resistance mode with your friends, but under no circumstances should you spend $60 on it, I'd wait until a sale marks this price down to $10-$20, because thats the absolute MOST value you can get out of this title.

Update 5/20- They released a patch today that is supposed to change how the game saves graphical settings, but other than that I did notice that the game does not stutter when the framerate drops below 60, and the devs have repeatedly acknowledged that many are having performance issues. It's a great sign for the future that the game will improve.Graphics- They look good, but it's also a Cryengine game, so it's hard to screw that up. Perhaps a bit rough on the eyes sometimes, however. General texture quality is acceptable, sometimes fantastic, and character models look generally detailed enough to please the majority of the graphically perceptive players. Shadows range from passable (general environmental shadows) to blobby messes (character shadows, small objects) and they do have some heavy impact on performance it would seem. Knocking them down from ""Very High"" to ""High"" gave me a pretty noticeable boost in performance.Lighting in daytime looks really good, however fails to impress in any of the nighttime segments that I've played so far. The only time lighting sources that are not from the daytime look impressive is in smaller indoor areas where there's a lot of artificial lighting going on at once.The world itself really does have a very nice amount of detail, and it really does feel like a real urban environment, at least so far. There are some woeful oversights however, such as ocean water not only being entirely flat, but also hardly even existant. Now I understand, maybe swimming plays absolutely zero role in this game, but for me to get a ""leaving mission area"" warning the second my feet touch the water, and to have my character literally walk on top of the water as if it was completely solid and then just suddenly fall into it when I ""get too far out of the zone"" seems really unpolished and a little lazy. At least use some stock Cryengine water or something.Animations overall are average. I can't say I noticed anything too bad, but they don't standout either. They do flounder pretty signifigantly when there are a lot of NPCs in the same spot all trying to out manuever each other, and they glitch out and spaz as they continue to waltz in each other's way. Graphic options are pretty basic. If you've played a Crytek game before, it will look very familiar. Simple labels with simple settings. There is an FOV slider, but it doesn't go very far and it seems to be using Vertical FOV rather than ""standard"" horitzontal, so the label only goes up to 65, which using a conversion calculator says should equal about 95 horizontal FOV. Probably the largest offense with this however, is that not only does it not really look like the FOV is quite that high, but there are some serious clipping issues with the first person animations when set this way. I also have yet to find an open configuration file that lets you change this further, but I'm also not the most observant with the files.Performance- Not too great. I'm running a 980ti and a 4770 CPU, and I am having trouble keeping it at 60, and when it drops, it stutters. It doesn't drop signifigantly however, generally only falling between 50-58 FPS, but it makes the game hiccup a bit (Vsync doesn't make a difference).Again, turning the shadows setting down seemed to help a bit, but not enough to make it stable. I'm curious if it's a symptom of the game loading in assests as I'm moving around, as it does even out smoothly when I stay still or at least in the same small area of the map, but there are a few times where framerate drops regardless. The ""Objects"" setting also seems to help, but very minimally. I'll toy around with these settings further, but I'm not even that upset that the framerate drops, I'm more offended by the fact that the game stutters so badly when doing so, especially when it's only dropping by 5 frames at most. Sound/Voice Acting- I'm a bit let down with this one, sadly. You can hear most things just fine, but the mixing does sound slightly off. A few voices do seem to be too quiet or drowned out, and environmental sounds seem passable at best. I also can barely recall the music (though again, I haven't played too much yet), and what I can remember seemed rather generic. Voice acting is also disappointing. I've certainly heard worse, dear god, have I heard worse, but I've heard way better. In the opening scenes, none of the voice actors caught my attention and truly tried to draw me into the experience. They just played the part and that was it. If I had to describe their performance, I'd say it sounds like most of them honestly have real talent, but not enough experience to truly deliver it. Other voices actors are pretty bad though, at least to me. Maybe I'm spoiled after playing a bit of Uncharted 4, but I don't feel engaged as a player with the voice acting.Gameplay- This is where some things get pretty positive. For example, the gun customization. The first weapon you get is a standard pistol. However, you also are told to buy a conversion kit. This plays an interestingly detailed animation of the weapon being taken apart in your hands, and then put back together as a sub machine gun. I have no idea the realism of this mechanic, but it does look really, really cool, and I genuinely look forward to trying out other gun conversion mods later in the game.Guns that I've used so far also feel okay. Not amazing though. There is some recoil to them, and a little impact, but they could have been much better. What's interesting, is that you can steady your aim with every weapon as far as I can tell. You can of course aim traditionally down the sights and fire away, but the recoil (even with a mouse) will throw your aim off. However, holding shift while aiming will make it more steady and allow you to hit the target better. It's a neat addition to the gunplay I think, and makes it a little more challenging. Controls feel very Crysis-like, if that makes sense, as in, they are a little weighty, and you can see your characters shadow and body when looking downward. You can walk up to some surfaces and mantle them, giving the game some slight verticality (which will likely be expanded upon later in the game, I imagine) and you move at a decent pace. There are vehicles in the game, or at least a motorcycle so far. On a keyboard, I didn't have any trouble controlling it. The mouse sensitivity shoots up when using it, but otherwise drives just fine, and it a rather fast way to get across the map. I haven't found out just how large the game's ""open world"" is yet, but it seems quite big, at least from my own perception. There is a looting system, ostensibly leading to some more complex crafting, but so far I've only crafted molotovs.Conclusion Should you buy Homefront: The Revolution today, right now? Perhaps not. Despite any praise I've given the game, honestly, nothing about the game as a whole feels very polished. It feels like it really need a few more months of development. And maybe patches will iron out the performance issues and tweak the gameplay for the better, but that's never an excuse. I know a few people crossed between buying this and the new DOOM, and if asked I would immedietely say get DOOM. I haven't personally played it yet, but I'm sure you've seen the great praise it's gotten from critics and players alike. Go get DOOM for now. Homefront will still be here later, hopefully in a more polished state. Get it on sale if possible.I really like the game's ideas and the atmosphere it's trying to go for. It does look really pretty, and has some neat mechanics, but nothing is fleshed out.			"

												7.5 out of 10 Until some patches are released then it will certainly be an 8.Let me give and quick review and then a rant about the crap I have seen around this game. First you as a consumer must know what you are buying. You are not buying a game that puts you in the position of being able to run through waves of enemies with a minigun. The game is trying to make you feel like you can't do that. So for all of you who are not very good at shooters and just like casually running through waves of enemies. Buy something else. If you are a HUGE story buff and need plot twists, grand complexity, and touching moments mixed of course with the tad of romance. This is not your game. This game is about the end of America and the resistance fighters who are trying to get it back. It is about being out numbered and knowing when to run. It is about exploring a beautiful world and doing some pretty awesome stuff along the way. Its not that innovative, but it still has its innovations and, for my computer, it works.Pros- Excellent world- Graphics are beautiful- Solid game play and game mechanics (melee kills are great too)- Very cool attachment system- It is challenging- Story is not too bad- You do feel like a guerilla- Sometimes the AI actually is pretty decent (see below though)- There actually does seem to be quite a bit of attention to detail in the world- Coop is very fun, especially with the right people who want to do more than just rush to the objective- The coop maps are pretty cool- The customization in the coop definitely adds some replay ability- Though we will have to see how long it takes, they have promised 18 more free coop maps to be released over this year.Cons- There are some occasional frame drops (but there are basically no loading screens, what do you expect?)- There are some glitches- The game does feel like it is lacking some polish that hopefully will come out in updates and patches very soon.- As with any open world game, there can be some repetition in side missions, but there is still diversity- The AI can be stupid at times.- The coop is shortLet me say that I have officailly disowned IGN as a credible game review company. It certainly seems like the higher they are paid, the better the score and this game did not have the money to spare I guess. However, the real issues I have are with the people who have reviewed it and are not pro reviewers. I saw multiple 0 out of 10 reviews within the first 3 hours of the game being released and these were not people who had it before and they did not indicate such. They also did not complain about not being able to run it, but just talked about how much of a flop it was. GARBAGE. I highly doubt they even played the game at all.I am honestly amazed at the gaming community. It is like the vast majority are a bunch of bummed out, depressed athiests, who hate everything. There isn't a single game they call good except stupid indie games. Have you become so jaded that you can't enjoy games anymore? It appears so. So shame on you gaming community. You have become a bunch of ungrateful whiners.I will update this review the more I play it.UPDATE:I have now completed the game and would like to say that I will give this game a 7.5 of 10. It simply was not polished enough to get an 8. Had the polishing work been done, then it would have been a solid 8. There are definitely some bugs, frame drops, second or two freezes all which do hamper the experience at times. Thankfully with my system, I have not had them too often. The storyline was so close to being solid, but again polish with a few more cinematic pauses in some of the cut scenes to take things in would have made it very sweet. Again, polish is all this game is lacking. Aside from that I have had a blast with it. I have really enjoyed the coop and I am looking forward to more levels. I will definitely replay the single player game once the devs get it more stable. They have been working on it and seem to be very concerned about making this game work well. I would say, pick this game up on a sale and it will be totally worth it.			"

												I was willing to forgive the poor performance and numerous bugs until I got to the last mission and encounted a game-breaking bug.  A piece of debris stopped an NPC truck from moving forward.  I couldn't blow it up, shoot it, run into it, etc.  Even loading the previous checkpoint didn't solve the problem.  I reached out to Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver and have had no response yet.			"

												this game deffinately had a troubled lauch. devs are still sticking by it. this wasn't a cash grab. this was an honest effort to do the best they could and it's above average. it's above good. it's not great, but it's not even near mediocre/horrible.  Game ran terribly when it launched for me. this has been fixed, runs smooth on an i7 and 970. no frame dips or anything. actual gameplay is fun, maybe a bit repetitive at times, but if you fancy the collector's mindset of the later far cry games, this will be fun for a while. not all tactics work on everything (shooting tanks won't do much, and not recruiting help from the other resistance fighters will mean you will die a lot) AI is horrible. most of the time they pose zero challenge, but once in a blue moon they seem ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty at a few moments. (forgot that one, thanks!)  stealth isn't really doable in redzones, but thats to be expected. I would have prefered the game stay in a yellow zone during the start before switching over to a redzone after the tutorial is done, and also the motorbikes aren't a good vehicle choice for these environments, but the game is solid, fun, and now really polished. I'd reccomend it on sale if you liked far cry type games and are willing to look past the issues.  high 6/10 in my book.			"

												I bought Homefront: The Revolution on a steam sale even after reading a bunch of mixed reviews.  Unfortunately, mixed is probably the best way to describe it.  Homefront gameplay and design is essentially a combination of more successful games but lacks the fluidity, narrative, and variation to sell it.  It does some things well: the cover system mostly works, guns look and sound unique, and the environment is initially interesting.  Unfortunately, that's about all the good that I can list.  Within a few hours, the missions are all virtually identical, the storyline is short and uninteresting, and the characters are forgettable.  I found myself listening to podcasts while I essentially ground out each area.  It wasn't particularly difficult; just very vanilla gameplay.If I had to name the number one sin of the game, it's the lack of any variation.  If you play an hour of the game, you'll know exactly what the rest of the game is going to be like.  At no point do you have any real sense of urgency or connectedness to the people.  It's just... boring. "

												This game is like a very very broken far cry. You can't play it rambo style because of endless respawning enemies and you cant play it stealth because every enemy in the whole ♥♥♥♥ing world is alerted when you only shoot once. You cant even buy silencers. Furthermore the A.I. is completly broken: On one hand its ridiculously underpowerd... enemies keep walking in the same doorframe so you can stack 100000 corpses there. On the other hand is overpowered because it makes stealth literally impossible. The A.I basicly detects you instantly and you could run through the sewer for hours without anyone seeing you but when you are back in the open the enemy still knows exactly where you are. EXTREMLY unsatisfying gameplay. I cant force myself to play any more of this crap.			"

												Just completed the campaign and it was 19 hours for me, doing just about everything.  haven't done the co-op but from what I can see it's not worth writing home about.  Gameplay is ok, not great, story is good, not great.  All and all it's probably a item that should wait until it's on sale.  It's a decent game just not worth the money it's listed as right now.I had no problems with crashing, fps was consistent 54 on high with shadows turned down (they seemed buggy fps wise) with I7-3770k Gtx 960 with 16 gb of ram..

(even though cool Weapon Customization)- Side Missions are bad- Finished main story, unable to finish the remaining side missions- Poor Waypoint Optimization! *rage flips table*- KPAs not searching hiding spots (Year 1990-1995 game?)- Arcade game, Time Splitters 2, found in restricted area (Prisoner Zone) has better gameplay- Sudden freeze in between cutscenes and ammo refilling- Bad RC consumable movement & collision- Cannot use bikes to shootIs this worth $50 or $70 (with expansion)?North Koreans may even think this game's a joke...

												Played the game for a couple of hours, the story is nothing to write home about but after the september 1 patch it seems all the slowdown and graphical glitches are gone. I havent experienced any stuttering either. And game runs 30-40 fps on my rather old GTX 870M powered laptop with medium to high setting at 1080p. The game feels a lot like a post war far cryPros:1. You can shoot a lot of people2. The game runs smooth now3. Bad guys are called Norks (Norks=Boobs in England) LOL!4. Weapon customization can be fun.5. Its really cheap now so worth a tryCons:1. Story is silly and requires an extreme suspension of disbelief2. THe bad guys are fairly generic3. Feels a lot like Far Cry but not quite as good4. Mouse is terrible smoothed but it can be fixed (See below)5. Not worth more than a single playthroughSummary : Worth playing once now that the glitches, graphical issues and bugs have been fixed          6.5/10CORRECT MOUSE SMOOTHENING BY DOING THIS :Go to your system.cfg file and add these line CVar: i_mouse_smooth=0.0CVar: i_mouse_accel=0.0""found this info on steam forums""			"

												The first word that comes to mind while playing Homefront: The Revolution, is ""atmosphere."" I'm a fan of atmospheric first person shooters, and I was recommended this game by someone who said it felt like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. For you fellow STALKERS, I can't quite say it hits the spot completely, but it scratches that itch better than many other games. I recommend playing on the highest difficulty setting for best results.Truth be told, this game scratches a lot of itches. I understand why it was critically panned: there are obvious technical and performance issues, the story is a bit obnoxious, and the characters are almost completely unlikable. But, it's far from being the ""worst game ever made"" that some reviewers labeled it as. The gameplay here is prime. Depending on which ""zone"" you're in, it sits somewhere between Freedom Fighters, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. , and Deus Ex, with elements of GTA: San Andreas, Terminator and Half-Life 2 thrown in for good measure. It has all the gameplay notes of a cult classic.In the ""Red Zones"" feel most comparable to the Terminator series' machine war scenes. The oppressive KPA army (the enemy in Homefront: The Revolution) patrols these zones with airships and drones that force you to crawl beneath rubble and ruined buildings to stay undetected and safe. The sound design, music and lighting in these areas are excellent, and create a constant sense of unease. I found myself cautiously peeking out from under cover to look for the telltale green search beams of the airships. The sound they make is... unsettling. One Red Zone even features a Metro: 2033-like gas mask mechanic, and although it honestly doesn’t impact the gameplay much (other than changing the visuals and sound a bit), it does go a long way towards making the game feel more hostile.In the ""Yellow Zones"" things feel closer to Half-Life 2 and Deus Ex. Trash and torched cars litter the streets, and people live in extreme poverty. KPA soldiers and vehicles patrol the streets in more formation, and individual officers harass civilians (much like the civil protection in Half-Life 2). In these areas, you need to cause civil unrest by secretly sabotaging KPA propaganda equipment while remaining undetected. It’s thrilling to observe guard patterns from out of sight, and move your way through these areas stealthily.While it may not be a perfect masterpiece, Homefront: The Revolution has extremely strong cult appeal. For the average gamer, this probably doesn’t mean much, but for people looking for something out of the ordinary, I highly recommend giving this a try. If you’re not sure, pick it up on sale like I did.			"

												This game took a lot of heat after it launched, with almost everyone saying it was terrible.I cant comment on this as i dint play it back then, But i can say that in its current state, i like the game quite a bit.The few bugs that remain are minor, and dont affect the gameplay significantly.A few ppl still complain that its too hard, and that you can get swarmed by enemies, But in my opinion what those people dont understand is that this is one of those few FPSs where you are NOT invincible. You actually have to know when to fight AND when to run (like when reinforcements arrive), or you WILL die.I find this game mechanic very realistic, you are fighting in occupied cities, crawling with enemy soldiers. It makes sense that once you start trouble you HAVE to do your thing fast and go away before you get swarmed.The weapons are great imo, they actually have recoil, you CANNOT carry 10 rifles, 1 rpg, 50 grenades and a flame thrower. You actually have a carrying capacity, and you also have a reasonable capacity on how much ammo you can carry. There is also a system where you customize and even transform your guns at any time, e.g. buy the proper ""kits"" and turn your pistol into an SMG, add a silencer, or a laser sight, etc. Any time you want! no need to go to a ""weapons bench"" or anything.Some also say that the game is ""too generic"", that it doesnt do anything diferent. I couldnt disagree more.In my eyes, ->Realism<- sets this game apart. You are NOT invincible, you CANNOT defeat 150 enemy soldiers at the same time, you CANNOT carry an entire warehouse of guns & ammo, and you CANNOT endure 5 RPG hits to the head.Here you cant just go running arround shooting everything. You have to plan your attacks, or die.Overall i find the game realistic, and very fun to play.Graphics are very nice, and currently the game runs fine on my less than stellar PC (i5, nvidia GTX 750ti). No performance issues for me.Controls are responsive and easy to learn & use.Bottom line: If your idea of an FPS is ""i am God, no one can touch me, and i will just run and kill everything i see"", then you will probably NOT like this one. If you prefeer the gameplay to be more tense, where you need to plan stuff and act fast to avoid being chopped to pieces, conserve ammo, plan on what weapons are right for the current job, and know when you need to retreat instead of fight, then you will like this one!

												I am with a lot of the people out there who have encountered a glitch in this game. Regrettably mine was a game killing one. Everything I have seen online suggests that the only way to fix this glitch is to uninstall then reinstall and start all over again.When in Lombard and doing the find the goliath schematics mission be wary to only shoot the tiles in the designated building don't stab them. This game had great potential and I wanted to believe that it wouldn't be as bad as a lot of people were making it out to be. However, this glitch along with a few other annoyances that made the game seem excessively rushed and incomplete. Parts of this game were amazing but then the others were just terrible. I can't in good conscience recommend a game that will be as potentially faulty as mine. Dambuster... Please try again, don't give up on it.			"

Terminator: The Game or How I stopped worrying about the hate and love the gameAt launch Homefront: The Revolution was met with bad to average reviews. The major complaint was the bugs and the poor performance resulting from terrible optimization.So now, months after release, you might be asking yourself; is the title any good? Have the bugs been killed? Is the performance smooth?Yes, the bugs are gone. Yes, the game is buttery smooth and yes, the title is very good indeed.The story of Homefront: The Revolution does a much better job to sell you it's idea of a north korean invasion than the first one. It's still absurd, but so is most alternative history stuff.You play as Ethan Brady, forgettable silent protagonist #831, who could've avoided the majority of bad situations if he only opened his damn mouth.You're part of the Resistance, the only people in america fighting against the oppressive force of the KPA.That's all you really need to know. The characters are rather forgettable, at times even downright ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Looking at you, Dana. You ♥♥♥♥ing Psycho.The gameplay and atmosphere is where Homefront's strength is really at. After a short opening sequence, you begin the game in a red zone. There are several red zones in the game and they are the place where the game shines the most for me. It's night, in you're sitting in a building devastated by bombs and rockets, overseeing the rain soaked streets, you notice the red scanners of the KPA zeppeline scanning the area, resistance fighters whispering in the shadows, planning out their ambush on a KPA patrol.Do you remember the flashback scenes Kyle Reese had in Terminator 1? This is it, man. All Red Zones look like that.The lighting and colors do a lot to create a really immersive and fantastic atmosphere. Unlike most games in which you play some sort of Guerrilla fighter, this time you actually feel like it. Each of your weapons have been crafted and are modifiable on the fly. You use pipe bombs, molotov cocktails and other DIY weapons. It really helps a lot in selling the idea that you're just part of a resistance that's fighting for survival against an overwhelming force.Instead of going completely open world, the game has hubs, each hub is a bit different, but they are usually either red or yellow zone. Those hubs are further divided into areas that you can recapture for the resistance. This results in less patrols, less powerful weapons for the KPA and less drone presence. Red Zones are usually bigger and also allow you to travel faster by using bikes.Yellow Zones are - unlike Red Zones - still intact. The streets are less open, the focus is more on small alleys and stealth, since the KPA is more aggressive here. Normal citizens live here, all of them suffering from the KPA occupation and ready to fight back. This is where the Hearts and Minds System comes into play.When you retake areas, destroy KPA forces, destroy propaganda, or rescue prisoners, the Hearts and Minds meter will go up. You'll start seeing more and more streets being vandalized by graffiti, more people in the streets shouting anti KPA messages, more civilians joining the resistance until you manage 100% and the streets will be flooded with burning cars and civilians outright attacking KPA forces.It's absolutely glorious.It sounds very similar to Far Cry 4, but it's done much, much better.A lot of elements from this game will remind you of Far Cry 3/4, the comparison is more than justified, as the game took clear inspiration from the series. That said, I think Homefront fleshed out a lot of elements that Far Cry didn't focus on, like the before mentioned Hearts & Minds System. It's a more focused experience.I think I played for 20 hours before completing the game, because I focused on retaking as many areas as possible. In all that time the game only crashed once on my computer (happened during the Time Splitters 2 demo). There are other bugs, but none are game breaking, they are usually funny glitches, like people standing on air, or cars driving into people during a cutscene that simply disappear as they weren't supposed to be there for the cutscene. Stuff like that.The performance is rock solid, on a mediocre to good PC you should be fine on the highest settings. The only thing bothering me is the stuttering whenever the game quick saves, but that doesn't happen all too often and you get used to it quickly.Sound is good as well, each weapon has it's own distinct sound effects, the KPA usually only talks in korean and the drones sound amazing. The Zeppeline sticks out, as it always makes that dreadful sound when it sees you, again reminding me of Terminator. I just wish there was more variation for the recorded dialogs for the civilians and resistance.Honestly, the developer should sit down and make this game moddable. Allow people to make a Terminator mod, because this game is just a few models away from being the wet dream of all Terminator fans.Pros:Great atmosphereReally sells you on the idea that you're a resistance fighterWonderful lighting and graphicsSolid performanceGood SoundGreat GameplayIt's Terminator in disguiseCons:Apparently you can't continue the game after the creditsStory isn't really interestingDoesn't include a Terminator skin modeScore7.2 "

												I am a man of positive thinking. I don't like exposing hatred towards everything. Well, let me start writing something about this game. This game, if i say overall, is an average. Its neither so good nor so bad. I wont talk about the mainstream topic about this game which is bug. Pros	1) Damn graphics and environment2) Weapon selection and customization is good.3) Enjoyable gameplay.4) Dialogues are good.5) Fantastic Coop experience6) Acceptable Story Cons	1) Story lacks something. When I say something it means some elements in the story that sparks your mind or give a sudden boost during playing.2) Side quests are not up to the mark. Besides the major drawback I noticed of this game is there is actually no sense of doing side quests. You get some strike points and you can use them to unlock weapons. But you can unlock them after doing some activities. No diversities in side quests.3) No scope of exploration. I know that this game is not meant to be a witcher game, but there should be a descent amount of exploration chance for the players.4) Dumb AI partners -_-. Ugh this one made me mad. 100% #Facepalm What could have made the game much more enjoyable	1) Devs could have added some player skills. If there was a system where players could do side quests and earn XPs to improve player skills then it would have been really awesome. That'd make some sense doing the side activities. But unlocking some weapons and stuffs does not make doing side quests much more worth it.2) There could be some more exploration scope for the players.3) Stealth mechanism could have been made more effective. 4) Devs could have introduced more characters. Well, the characters they introduced are very good but there should have been some more interesting characters.5) Story should have been more interesting. They should have worked more on story. It lacks so many things. Some plot twist would have been really good. Story could have been made a bit longer. I felt it was short. I did not feel the term ""The Revolution"" so much and it is because of the poor story.6) More coop maps in ""Resistance Mode"" Final Thoughts	 This game is actually a fun game to play. Some game to just pass your time and enjoy. Nice coop game to enjoy with friends. Its not something that would create a significant impact on gamers' minds and on the other hand it's not something that would disappoint you so much. Its an average. Not worth the full price at all. Get it during sale. YES I RECOMMEND THE GAME.			"

												By all accounts, Homefront: The Revolution should have never seen the light of day. The game passed through at least four developers and three publishers before its final release in May of 2016. With that kind of development hell, it’s frankly amazing that the game even came out and even more shocking that the game is even good.Having played Homefront: The Revolution in March of 2017, I cannot speak to its supposedly rocky launch. When the game released, it was met with a wave of discontent and uproar about everything from performance and glitches to being flat out broken. There were even people claiming this to be “The Worst Game Ever Made”. First off, let’s dispel that hyperbolic nonsense, in no universe is Homefront: The Revolution “The Worst Game Ever Made”. Homefront is shockingly competent given its development history, not that its history gives it a pass by any means, but I do think it’s important to look at it with context.As far as the actual gameplay goes, Homefront plays like an urban Far Cry. The long and short of it is that if you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and/or 4 then you’ll probably enjoy Homefront. It has all of the trappings of a Far Cry game: open world, climbing structures to reveal part of the map, light crafting and customization, etc. There are some aspects, however, that I think Homefront does better than the Far Cry games. Climbing towers in the Far Cry games are usually pretty straightforward but in Homefront, it’s often a puzzle that must be solved. Rarely is a base or tower a straightforward affair. I often found myself circling the building multiple times to find my pathway up. This little wrinkle made a normally mundane process a bit more rewarding. This is also in part due to the excellent traversal. This game gets first person movement right, and is some of the best feeling in any FPS I’ve played. Running around and capturing strongholds was quite satisfying as I think the free roam nature of this game is its strong suit. In fact, I think the best compliment I can give Homefront is that I never even used the fast travel feature. Compare this to a game like Mafia 3 which was utterly painful to play by the end because of the lack of fast travel. In Mafia, there was nothing to do between your destinations whereas is Homefront there’s always a pack of enemies right around the corner ready for a firefight. This emergence is really where Homefront shines.The gunplay in Homefront: The Revolution is properly meaty and all the guns have a heft to them that feels satisfying. While I enjoyed the ability to customize my weapons on the fly, it would have been nice to have an extra weapon or two. The weapons, and the world, do have a nice sense of patched-togetherness that you would expect out of a crumbled Philadelphia.I haven’t mentioned the story yet because, well, it’s pretty average. I like to play a lot of games primarily for the story but Homefront: The Revolution was not one of them. While not bad, the story was pretty boilerplate revolt and uprising stuff. There’s nothing here that you haven’t seen before. It’s enough to string together sequences but don’t expect a gripping thriller here.I’ll speak briefly about the DLC since I didn’t give it much playtime: skip it unless you really loved the story. I found all three of the story DLC’s to be subpar of the main game mostly due to the fact that they’re extremely linear. Now I’m not opposed to linearity, in fact I often prefer it to open worlds, but Homefront’s strength is in its open world. When you change the element that it does best, it’s going to suffer. Again, it’s not terrible, but it’s nothing that I would recommend buying unless you’re dying to get more of the story, which they do expand on.Despite its tortured development history, I think that Dambuster Studios managed to make a pretty darn enjoyable game in Homefront: The Revolution. The game has no right to be as fun as it is but its mechanics come together to create scenarios that remain enjoyable throughout its 13 plus hour campaign. While I would not recommend it at full price, I think that there is great fun to be had here if you can snag the game while on sale. While doubtful, I would love to see another entry in the series.

												I read the reviews before I began to play and thought to myself (oh crap, another assassins creed unity fiasco) I mean every game has bad reviews the first couple days or even weeks because of reasons that many new releases suffer for that usually get patched within a couple weeks, but people were seriously hammering down on this game like it had reset the cure for cancer back to 0. I reluctantly started playing it after a long days work expecting to be disappointed by another crappy AAA title, and then you know what happened next? I sat in disbelief and confusion in what in the actual hell everyone was complaining about! I have an amd 8350 cpu and a GTX 760 (not massively high end) and I play this game on all high settings with NO PERFORMANCE ISSUES AT ALL like seriously, I can't say I understand how people with I7's and 980s are having performance problems when I can run at high with a steady 60fps no problem.I havent encountered a single bug and the game plays exactly as I wished it would, open world style fps with a challenge, I would say this game is almost like a combination between farcry & Mercinaries 2, it has the rpg aspects that everyone expected with the epic gun customization and crafting, and keeps to the promise of guerilla warfare over run and gun tactics.I find it ironic that I followed the division for 3 years only to play it for less hours than I've already put into this game which I only knew about a few weeks before launch. The story so far is amazing, some parts funny some parts really dark (pretty much exactly what I expected from a sequel to the original storyline)  but in all seriousness I can't put my finger on why people hate this game so much, its like people are just aching for the next game to blame and follow the band wagon.Hopefully the reviews dont stay the way that they are because if so then I know a lot of people are going to be holding back on this purchase which is a real shame since it's actually quite solid of a title.All things considered I could give this game a solid 7.5 personally, mainly because the voice acting is pretty poor, but the gameplay and story more than make up for some interlapping lines and such.EDIT: So I havent beaten the story yet, but I have dabbled in the multiplayer to see what they have going on there since it was a pretty big part of the game. Firstly to anybody whos wondering, there's no competitive multiplayer, all of the focus was put into the coop which I personally prefer. The characters customization is pretty varied, male and female characters and a crap ton of gear that you unlock using currency and exp from playing in coop matches. roughly 25 or so items for each part of the body, head, arms, legs etc. and then a wide variety of skills that don't make any appearance in the single player portion of the game. It has a very similar feel to the single player, for example if one player decides to be loud and proud it doesn't mean that you have to be as well, you can remain silent and unseen by the enemy even if they are blasting their converted LMG into the heavens. Speaking of which the gun customization is all the same in the multiplayer but the system implemented makes it take far longer to unlock all of the guns, conversions, gear etc. because you unlock them via crates and don't directly choose what you want to unlock (although you can choose categories to unlock like attachements, vanity, weapons and such, but you just cant choose precisely what you want)All in all im happy with the multiplayer, very good if playing with friends since you truly do need to rely on your allies to win since the game can be unforgivingly difficult, but that's not to say that randoms are no good, but obviously with no in game voice chat it's nice to have people you can talk to directly via TS or other means. Anyways with that being said I can confidently give the game a solid 8 now for very nice and replayable multiplayer.			"

												I was expecting so much more from this game... It is a real shame.First off, the performance is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥... FPS drops, but a patch is coming for that. Though im sure that patch won't fix the fact that I can run every other game on high settings, but this, I have to run on low settings and even lower the resolution below my native! Sigh.Secondly, thinking the COOP would be cool? Nope, very small and limited mission based scenario's... It would have been so much better if we were able to free roam in the campaign world...Unfortunately this game has bombed hard and won't recover from this, I highly doubt many people will still be playing within the next couple of weeks, which is a shame because no one wanted this game to succeed more than I did.... :(Save your money, only buy if on sale for an EXTREMELY CHEAP price.

												Homefront: The Revolution should be judged on what it has become.  It started of as an ambitious project to create an open world guerilla warfare FPS.  However, on release it fell short of that mark...severely so.But that didn't stop Dambuster Studio from working on this labour of love.  Every DLC they released brought progress.  Every patch they sent out made the gameplay better. These are the types of developers that should be encouraged and celebrated.Nonetheless, the shooting mechanics are solid.  Each weapon has it own feel and you'll grow to love one over the other depending on your play style. The equipment you are given and can upgrade will make your play style individual - whether you go in guns blazing, stealth play or build a RC car with a bomb attached to really spice things up.  The story line isn't the greatest, but decent to keep you engaged to the next set piece.For what the game is now, it is worth every cent.  Don't expect a game changer, but a truly solid game to wile away the hours.  Persist with it and have fun.			"

My short reviewThis game came out on 20th of May, so that is half a year ago. I saw some pretty bad reviews, so i kept my wallet closed. I really liked the first game though, so it made me sad.Now i'm almost 20 hours in, and i think it's safe to say it's a really good game. If you play games similar to Far Cry or Assassins Creed, this game is definitely for you. I know the developers have been through some tough times, but i think they did their best in trying not to disappoint us. Of course there are some bugs (the AI is kind of dumb), but it's definitely playable.It's an open world game with great graphics, decent story (more of a ""lets blow up this and that, demolish this and Americaaaa, f*ck yeah!""(remember that Dodge commercial? :X )) and it runs smoothly on my 1.5 years old Asus ROG gaming laptop. I haven't finished the main campaign yet (yeah, there is one big main campaign and two smaller ones), but i would already give this 7.8/10.			"

												...First off I'd like to say I'd like to see the folks at Damnbusters try again at a game. There's a few good bits in here, but as a first attempt... should've tried something not as ambitious. Now I paid half price for this game. But as is, I don't think I can say it's worth that much.It's pleagued with so many technical bugs. in the first hour of being in the open world I fell through the world twice and rode a bike through a wall 3 times.Now design wise I see so much missed potential. It is so easy to avoid enemy patrols and if you have weapons out in the yellow zone(where you're suppose to blend in with civilians) I noticed no difference between if they see you waving around a rocket launcher or if you're just walking around. And I see where just living in one of these zones could be something. In fact it almost looks like that might've been a thing. And while I like the Farcry style capturing outposts, in this case it just seems played out. Like they try framing it in different ways so it's not all the same, but the reasoning for them is rather shaky.Story... oh the story... it starts off kinda nice. but after a little while, it just falls down on its face. The people who have legitimate concerns about the reprocucions of your actions are just brushed aside as weak willed. If they object to questionable things the resistance does? Bleh, they're just not dedicated enough. Just a bunch of weak justification for calling the resistance good. I so want to spoil so much, but for those who decide to go ahead and play it I wont. Let me just say the ending... it needed work.In the end... I wanted to like this. I steered away from the first one because it seemed a bit ""my country tiss of thee"" for my liking. From what I saw from this before I played made it seem more like you're fighting for people rather than a country. Kind of dissapointed on that part as well. I really wanted to like this. But while I may revisit it from time to time, I can't advise you to buy it. Strong begining, but I can tell they crunched to meet the deadline.If nothing else, they've inspired me to make my own game.			"

												I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to. To give you an idea I have an FX 8350 OC 4.5 and a GTX 970 and am getting between 35-50 fps on high settings at 1440p. Although these are not great number the game does not stutter at all (except when saving). I would say buy this from a key site or on sale just to be safe because others are still experiencing issues. After playing more I realize that the game is good at first but by the end becomes less alluring. I would still recomend it on a salegraphics- 8.5Optimization- 5.5Story-7Gameplay-8.5Atmosphere-9Fun factor- 8.5Overall- 8Even though this game is fun as all hell I would say steer clear unless you meet the recomended system requirements. As a frame of reference some of my favorite games are the The Wiitcher 1-3, Bioshock 1-Infinite, Dark Souls 1-3, GTA 4-5, and the new wave of Fallout games. I would compare this game to  Crysis mixed with Far Cry where you have more tools at your at hand but are also fighting agianst greater odds.			"

												I really don't know why there's all the hate for this game? Anyone who likes the Farcry games would like this one, I'm sure. Basically the same functions, maybe copied or, help from the Ubisoft team, IdK, however, it's running smoother than most of the other games I have, using a MSI R9 270-OC card with W7. I really wouldn't say it's an 'Open World' game, more like an 'Open City' game where you can use many avenues to get around in, although, if you've played the Metro games and others like it, many of the buildings are inaccessable, more freedom of movement though. There are no save as you go type systems in the game other than, checking into one of the, ""Safe Houses' you capture as you progress throughout the missions. There's also, ""Quick Travel' like in the FC games. You can backtrack to find things you've missed or, finish capturing important areas if you passed them by while doing the campaign, that's not a problem. Lots of side missions, same as in FC, for the locals, to build up your credits & xp along the way to purchase upgrades or, afterward, they aren't mandatory as you progress through the campaign. Credits and the like are pretty easily earned, you can find items all over if you look for them. They don't pay much but, this game can be farm crazy, killing the enemy. Just remember, if you bite off more than you can chew, you'll lose it all on your respawn. No biggie. Just go back and farm some more. lolThe crafting system is easy enough too. Its on a wheel and as long as, you have the right material, you can craft much of what you need and not have to purchase any of them from the store at the Safe Houses.The stealth / take-down is not too bad either, sort of like FC & SE mixed. Or, you can run and gun your way through it but, that just makes it harder on the locals. The less notoriety, the more help you get from them. Need not let them suffer because of your recklessness. As for multiplayer? There is none but, you can play it co-op with a friend. That I haven't done. I got it on sale so, if you're thinking about it, do the same. You can always get a refund, ya know.  Bugs / glitches? Haven't found any yet. 9/10			"

												If you have liked any of the 'ticky boxing' game play seen in gaming in the past few years from assassins creed to batmans arkham to far cry then you'll enjoy this (which i did but the fun quickly wore thin very quickly).The games objectives become very repetitive only after a few hours of gameplay like turning on a dozen hard to reach radios or liberating an outpost or turn on this tower through the most easy hacking mini game you wonder why its even there. The hit and run tactics the game encourages you to use are null since even on the hardest difficulty enemies are easily defeated. Even the 'Sponge' enemies are only there to soak up bullets and cause just  bit more damage.Even though you cant use enemy weapons, enemy soldiers were kind enough to stock up on bullets for my guns when i eventually loot their corpses.However, what you might hear in other reviews is that the atmosphere of the game is great, really gives you a sense of dread and despair but that soon washes away from the awkward voice acting and pitiful resistance enemy soldiers put up.The game at times looks great especially when its raining during the night, it does look amazing but there often texture glitches and pop in effects with draw distance.The on the fly weapon customisation is really cool but soon you find is surprisingly limited and you'll quickly being to rely on two weapons outside of the fun and gimmicky ones such as the shotgun that fires napalm or the 'freedom launcher'.All and all an average game that isn’t crap but not spectacular either.I only wish there was more to the game except go hear find x amount of things to unlock more things ad nauseam			"

omg... dude... Can somebody tell me why this Game got around 50% positive rating? Because I don't see a reason to hate this Game? Am i missing something? The Game feels great, runs great at 100+ FPS mostly [Specs mentioned below].The Story ist ""Okay / good"". It's nothing really special, which you haven't seen somewhere else, but its worth its 15€ actually.The Cutscenes are well made, and you have full control on the World Map.It's a FPS Open World Shooter, that's why you have much choices to do!For Example you can upgrade your weapon as you wish, with money, maybe some visor or upgrade your Damage? I Love that you can just pull off the Top of your pistol and put on an SMG, like wtf? :DThe Game feels actually pretty decent and I dont see any reason to dislike this gameIt gets a solid 8/10 for me, atleast for playing the first 2 Hours straight.Specs:i7 4770k @ 3.50ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC with 8gb VRAM16 GB DDR3 RAM*RECOMMENDED*			"

A decent looking game with a few critical flaws.1st flaw, Enemy Spawning.You can have a convoy of 2 vehicles and 6 men slowly coming down a road, only for them to disappear right infront of you and then have men spawn on the street corner behind you and get you spotted because of it/them. You can kill a guard harassing some prisoners only for him to respawn back in as you get about 15ft away, in full view. Makes some of the ingame jobs/challenges really easy, you can just farm the same 1 guard over and over and over.......you get the point.2nd flaw, the stealth engine.Its just too simple/basic. You can hide behind a car or wall and still get seen, but othertimes you can run right at them without being spotted. To escape the alert phase after being spotted you can either evade the patrols for about a minute or hide in a bin/porta loo. The moment you jump in a hiding spot you instantly lose the guards, even if they can clearly see you as you jump into the hiding spot. Its that simple/basic its more of a chore, 'Oops, I've been spotted', run round the corner and dive in a bin for 15 seconds, continue ad nauseum. Tied in with the broken enemy spawning, you will end up spending most your time peering out of a bin.3rd flaw, Rubbish story.This is possibly the 1st game I've played where I genuinely didnt give a sh** about the story or any of the characters. It's all so damm forgetable, especially the woman who plays the 'grr, I'm a scary Nork skinning bi***' card...soo damm overdone. I laughed out loud at her peak moment in the campaign near the end...am I meant to care about what happend? The story seems shoehorned in, If you want a game with a decent story that drags you in/make you care, avoid this. I've already forgot half the story and I've only recently completed it.4th flaw, performance.I was running the game at max settings at a solid 60fps untill it would load in a area and it would cause microstutter. My game would also crash regulary after about 20-30 miutes of playing untill I changed into windowed borderless where it would only crash every 2-3 hours instead (lost a few hours progress in my playtime because of this), no matter what graphic settings I picked. Your mileage may vary, some cannot even get a steady 30fps with similar hardware. i5 4690k, 1070 8gb.General Roundup.The graphics are quite nice, some great looking areas/vistas. Just don't go examining every texture with a microscope and you won't be dissapointed graphics wise. The gunplay is fun but simple. (No crosshair, for those that struggle with aiming) I ended up running around hip firing at everyone with starting smg with no problems on max difficulty. The ingame weapon modifying is fun/unique but is quite simple, once you have 3 weapons setup the way you want you will never touch the weapon modding again. The story and characters are all forgettable. Stealth and spawning engine is broken. Performance is unsteady & crash happy. Season pass content to date is lackluster, completed all dlc so far in under 1.5hours.Steam had the option to rate a 50/50. I've played worse but I have also played so much better for less. Only get with a heavy discount, and do not expect anything amazing.....just 'meh'.Edit:The latest content has just dropped, and its just as short and as mediocre as the rest of the dlc's. I also managed to complete all co-op resistance levels since 1st writing this review. Resistance mode is quite fun but the levels are very short and there aren't many of them either.			"

												Pros:I enjoyed the game for the most part, Assassins creed like, post-apocalyptic Shooter. Capturing different areas, and building the resistance was fun for me. The weapon customization was kind of cool. RC Car grenade/Hack tool was a fun idea. Cons: THE BUGS! This Game was horribly optimized and buggy. I have a high end computer i7-5820K, 16Gb DDR4, and a GTX 970. Playing on a Med-High Settings it would lag out at parts dropping down to 10 FPS. The game wasn\'t even finished, some of the safe houses glitched out and I literally had to look up work arounds to get into a safe house because the doors were glitched shut. (Ashegate Propaganda Depot)Multiple times I got stuck in areas that I couldn\'t get out of and had to restart the game. When you customized the weapons it wouldn\'t save the configuration half the time. The developers got very lazy with the GTK equipment; they all had the exact same upgrades for each device and you really only used 1 or 2. My biggest complaint: On one of the last missions, you need to escort 2 trucks to different spots so you can shoot down some blimps. The truck was trying to path through a building!!! Eventually out of frustration I used explosives and got it unstuck, At which point it tried to drive through a broken car blocking the road. When I got close to it, It said I was out of the mission area. Conclusion:I spent 18 hours on this game, and had an OK time doing it. But I couldn’t even finish this game if I wanted to. Awesome concept, but please finish your game next time before releasing it. "

												For now, this game is still a construction site. Sorry for clear and honest words. It has potential. It theoretically is fun if you like the formula of Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4. But there are a few heavy down-sides that kill the fun:- Performance: As soon as I left the tutorial area, the performance went down. I usually get between constant 60 down to 40 fps. But as soon as this game hits 55 fps or less, it feels as if it goes down to 15. I tried all the settings in different combinations, playing on 1080p and 720p and I can't get this game to run smoothly on my rig (i7 4790k @ 4.4GHz, 16gb RAM, GTX 980, Win10 Pro x64).- AI: Dumb as hell, they are running into my gunfire. 30 minutes of shooting, 200 killed enemies of which like 25-30 corpses stack up on one single pile within a doorframe and I knew: The AI is sadly broken. Buying a silencer and silenced boots at the beginning seem to be somewhat overpowered and allowed me to gun down a whole platoon within the very first hour of the game.- Spawnpoints of enemies and mini-events: They spawn randomly. Everywhere. Even within a 15-meter-circle, I was able to run in circles between 3 mini-events to fulfil my ""get 100% of trust""-mission within 5 minutes. Also friends and foes tend to spawn right next to each other when war is going on. And after 30 minutes of defending a house, one enemy spawned right behind me within that hermetically sealed house as soon as I stepped out of the doorframe. That wasn't a pleasure.In general, these issues aren't things that would make me say ""DAYUM, 'DIS GAME'S BROKEN, DUDE!"" - but these 3 issues are the main reason why I couldn't truly enjoy my first 2 hours of this game. I'm diving into it a bit more and hope that there will soon be a bunch of bugfixes and patches. But for now, I simply can't recommend this game in it's current shape. The potential is there, but now is the time the devs have to show whether they're willing to use it or not.			"

												I don't know why all the hate but to me this game is amazing. It has everything that I wanted. First, a lot of people complaining about bad performance. I have a gtx980ti and I run everything maxed at 90-70 FPS. It drops to 57-54 there and there sometimes but nothing really bad. So to me the game is running smoothly and well. The engine is amazing. The graphics, the animations, the rain, the lighting and the whole atmosphere look very nice. Oh and the cutscenes. They are beautiful, movie like, but not overdone, yet interesting to watch. Actually, this is one of the few games that got me really interested into them and not willing to skip.The world doesn't feel empty. There is always something to loot, a secret to find or a piece of land to claim. You can always pick what you want to do next - a main mission, a small mission from the mission board or maybe conquest a stronghold or a sniper nest. Also there are dynamic objectives that popup when you are close to them - i.e. somebody contacts you via a radio saying they are pinned and need help to defend their outpost. Or find that juicy loot crate. And you can always pick the approach. What is even better, there are lots of NPCs around which you can recruit to help you with a simple button click. You can have up to 5 I think and each NPC in the world carries its unique loadout. They will help you by shooting enemies, throwing frags, some even carry rocket launchers - all accessible from a get go. Gun fights are satisfying. There are no crosshairs so you have to aim, compensate the recoil and distance. Weapons have tons of upgrades and each of them have what the game calls a conversion system - i.e. you can convert an assault rifle into a machine gun or a sticky mine gun, a crossbow to a flamethrower etc.  in a blink of an eye during the combat or before and then switch back when you want the previous weapon version right on spot. Weapons also have lots of mods and upgrades. Yes, you can say that it is just an another average AC or Far Cry clone but this game is a blast to play provided you have a good enough system. What's most important to me - the game atmosphere and events shown in the cutscenes and during other moments really made me immersed in the game world willing to help the rebels win the war. 10/10			"

												This game played me like a used car saleman, and by the time I blew through the story, I couldn't help but talk♥♥♥♥♥♥on it every time I thought about it. The only saving grace to this game was the multiplayer (or so I thought) because of the character customization, but you're lucky to find a single person playing the game besides you on any difficulty level. Steam wouldn't let me refund the game, and I feel bad because my brother bought it for me, thinking it would occupy our time until something good came out. Don't buy this game, just don't. There are a million and one other shooters out there that do it better. There's nothing new offered here. Save your money.			"

												This is nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be. This is just your standard open world shooter set in an alternate future where the North Koreans have taken over the US. There's elements from Just Cause 2, Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed, Infamous and pretty much any open world game you've played in the last decade.Average shooting controls, nice visuals, brain dead AI and a pretty lengthy campaign. Bargain bin type stuff, but not a total write off.Full video review:

												Although this game has its issues, it's fun at its core. It was a steal for about 15 dollars, and highly worth the money.The multiplayer has lots of customization options. From what you were before the KPA invaded (which number is in the 20s) to the amount of different helments, gas masks, shinguards, etc. in the game (which is at least 200+), it isn't too hard to find a look that meets your needs. The missions are fun and challenging on the ""hard"" difficulty. The main game is good as well. Although the story is somewhat cliche, the different places you go to look amazing and provide you with lots of eye-candy. The gradual change in the environment from KPA to Resistance also is refreshing. The gun custimization is somewhat limited but good as well. You can attatch silencers to muzzle-breaks on a multitude firearms, and all of them do their job quite well. The addition of allowing you to change your firearm's attachment and ""mode"" is also refreshing and very useful. For example, if you have the modification, you can transform the long ranged, silent crossbow into a flamethrower to decimate and roast infantry (literally). Although the capturing of the different zones has been labeled ""repetitive,"" I actually found it quite varied. The tasks for each point you captured were different and forced me to think about how to liberate each one. One notable one I remember was when I came across a capture point where you had to somehow get a motorcycle onto a roof to charge a generator and capture the area. The voice acting, I must admit, was only alright, and there still exists multiple AI bugs and glitches that need attention. Another thing I would like to touch on is the the cap of 20 skills per character in the multiplayer ""Resistance Mode."" Although well intentioned, this cap only limits your character's potential and forces you to use more than one character. Overall, this game is well worth the cost if it is on sale; however, if it is not so I suggest that you wait until another one comes along. Thanks for reading!Killemall "

												If you want a solid, semi-open-world shooter with all of the modern frills, you could do far worse than Rev 2.  The setup is still ludicrous -- North Korea turns America into an occupied apocalyptic hellscape -- but it's pretty clear that the headcanon is that China are the bad guys, which is slightly less ludicrous.  In any event, I had a very good time crawling around like the dirty Yankee rat that I am, avoiding contact when I could, and gunning down the faceless Yellow hordes when I couldn't.  All of the various gameplay systems work well without any real gripes on my part, except maybe that the weapons lack enough ""oomph"".  The graphics and effects are nicely current-gen in 2016.  I recommend Rev 2 to anyone who wants a decent FPS to fill their time between the big releases.  Note that I played the game after it was patched up and the price knocked down half.			"

												Pink textures, 20fps drops, boring and uninspired plot and gameplay mechanics ripped from other games. I loved Free Radical Design, I loved Perfect Dark...but they should retire now and skip the slow death started with Haze.The pros though...this game looks amazing.Everything else ranges from mediocre and unspired to utterly awful.With patches the technical bugs might go. But that won't excuse the fact the plot is basically an amalgamation of COD, Dying Light and Far Cry. And none of those are particularly inspired either (but at least Dying Light had fun gameplay and Far Cry had excellent voiceacting).			"

												This game was an awful mess at launch, and it still has technical issues, but I think it's mostly been patched into something with some real value.The campaign missions are generic modern shooter stuff, but the open world has fun elements.  If you're into the ""liberate regions of the map with gunplay and some light stealth"" gameplay of, say, Far Cry and want it in an urban, anti-authoritarian package, you'll probably like this game.  The Yellow Zones (civilian regions where you have to inspire people into joining the resistance) in particular are fun as you have to sneak and run past large patrols while doing your best to cause damage and help people.I recommend picking it up on sale.  It's probably not worth a full $60, but for any less than that it's good if this is your kind of game.I haven't played the DLC yet, so no comment on them and the season pass.			"

												Homefront 2 didn't interest me much. I finished the first one and it wasn't a good game. On the rails shooting gallery that felt too long even with its pathetic four hours of playtime.Second one wasn't developed by Kaos, but when I learnt that it's being cooked by Crytek UK, known as the muppets behind Haze, my enthusiasm didn't exactly grow. Plus all the trouble during development, bankruptcy of the publisher, change of dev team to Frankfurt, then back to UK, unpaid salaries of emplyoees, half the dev team leaving, then Deep Silver buying the project (followed by the return of the previously left devs, incl. game director Hasit Zala)...No good game could have come out of this mess, could it ?Well, according to reviews, no, it could not and it did not. For inexplicable reason (well..of course it was money) Deep Silver decided to release the game around 4 months before it was finished, at a time when console versions were almost unplayable due to low framerates, and PC version was a lottery ticket - one had it unplayable, the other could play, plagued by bugs.To Deep Silver's credit though, they allowed Dambusters (new name of Crytek UK aka Free Radical) to finish the game post-release, via some hardcore patching. Of course, the low sales and low review scores are set.But, patch it they did! First the technical side then. Homefront 2 looks fantastic, almost photorealistic at times. Cryengine has amazing lightning. War zones have, particularly at night, impressive atmosphere. Framerate is pretty much perfect now - 60fps maxed out in 1080p (on 2500K@4ghz, GTX1070) without any significant drops or stutters. There are some ocassional glitches here and there, a bit of pop-in, but nothing too distracting. The patches also added ability to tune HUD (turn off almost everything) and FoV.Now on to the game itself. Unlike the first one, Revolution is much more open affair. It takes place in Philadelphia divided into multiple zones. These zones are either Red, where most of the battles against Korea took place (Revolution takes place 4 years after the US lost the war), so they are bombed out and reminded me of the 2029 scenes of Terminator 2 (Revolution also takes place in 2029, probably not a coincindence). These zones have great atmosphere and contain the FarCry/STALKER like gameplay with taking over bases and open combat against KPA armed forces.Yellow zones are full of civilians and instead of open combat, you need to play a guerilla rebel, taking out enemies stealthily. These most reminded me of City 17 from HL2 right after you arrive, except here you are an active saboteur, not just an observer.Thanks to these zones the game is nicely varied, it is not constantly the same killing gameplay all the time.Revolution has some very likeable sense for detail, you can see some here:https://twitter.com/BlendoGames/status/776632296472313856 I like games that show their interface through ingame object - in STALKER it was PDA, in FarCry 2 you hand held the map, in Homefront you have a korean phone :)The arsenal is great. There are not many weapons, but each can be modified in multitude of ways and each upgrade feels worthwhile. The punch and feel of the guns is flawless, the sniper rifle is one of my favourites. You can transform guns completely, for example make uzi from a pistol, or a flamethrower from a crossbow. Plus there are bombs strapped to RC cars or teddy bears at your leisure.The game surprised me. I only gave it a chance because of the free weekend and I ended up buying it and finishing it since I enjoyed it so much. I liked it significantly more than FarCry 4 or Division, which I played right before Homefront.That said, there are some flaws. The most significant one for me - the silent fu**ing protagonist. Oh how I hate this trope. There is even a moment in the game when another character shouted at me ""Say something Ethan!"" and my lovely Ethan just looked, the mute idiot that he is. Please devs, stop with this nonsense. It is not adding to immersion. It is hurting it.Another flaw is that the AI could be better. Felt a bit too canon foddery at times. Too bad we will probably never see AI exceed or at least match what first FEAR offered in 2005.Anyway. Great game. Give it a chance. Oh and that easter egg is effin' awesome.Here are some gameplay vids I took:

												After finishing the game, I felt dissapointed. Not in the gameplay, but in the basic aspect of it. I loved the play style i chose, it was OP, but allowed for a challenge when i wanted it. I was a super fast stealth monster whose primary weapon was a knife and a crossbow. Many people complain about the stealth mechanic in the game being ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and i can agree a bit. If you are caught, everyone know where you are, but, considering its a super advanced army with self driving tanks, I would not be surprised. There were more stealth options than people think, including if you kill an enemy quick enough, they can't call reinforcements. Made use of that real well.But....There is one thing i hated, absolutely hated. It was so bad that I have to give the game a thumbs down. The story, As you started feeling emersed in the game, the story comes by and tears you away like a bandaid held on with super glue. like, WTF happened to the original mission! Your original mission is to find some dude who was a huge asset to the resistance. Halfway through the story, you forget he exists and you never hear from him again.And the ending was so anti climactic and made no sense. spoilers ahead.You are so OP that you end up going through the final mission barely getting damage, then out of nowhere, without any context as how it happened, you are on your death bed, limping at 0.2 MPH and only have a pistol. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is my SMG, my battle rifle, my mine launcher. did they just disappear?!? And WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THE ♥♥♥♥♥ COMMIT SUICIDE I COULD HAVE TAKEN OUT THE GOLIATH WITH 2 ♥♥♥♥ING MINES!I can't understand it. While playing the game you are a god who runs up to enemies and stabs the ♥♥♥♥ out of them while blasting heads off with ease. then all of a sudden you are stopped by a grunt who somehow sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face.Here is another problem. People mix up open world and sandbox. Open world means you have access to the entire world, but it can still be controlled by the story. Sandbox means no rules. Fallout 4 is a good example. You dont even need to do the missions, you can go and destroy the entire wasteland right out of the vault.On the topic of open. The story is linear as ♥♥♥♥. You have no control as to what happens. The only time you have the option to choose is when you decide to either kill, or spare a double agent. and you know what, your decision DOES JACK♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING!!! HELL YOU ARENT EVEN SENT AN EMAIL OR TEXT SAYING YOU SHOULDA LEFT HIM ALIVE OR KILL HIM! LIKE NO INTERACTION TO THE DECISION AT ALL! If you are going to give the option to choose, that option HAD BETTER HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT!At this current point in time, don't waste your money on the game. If there is an update or even a DLC that fixes these issues and helps close holes in the story, then it may be worth the buy.			"

												At the beginning of the launch, the game was ""somewhat playable"". The performance issue was annoying, but still playable, there were moments that initiated huge FPS drops.After the latest patch that the team was working on has finally made a game - the game. The game runs nicely on Ultra. They also updated a lot of other things and added GearScore (basically to show other players how ""advanced"" of a player you are). The graphics of Cryengine is as always pleasing to the eye, and the textures in this game (guns, gloves, equipment etc.) look amazing.With a on the move weapon customization you don't need to be worrying for bringing the wrong weapon to the field, as you can customize your gun in-game, just make sure you choose the right right class for yourself before initiating the mission.They also added 2 free maps which are really nice, and pretty big size with of course new missions and objectives.From this day on, do not let the ""MIXED"" reviews to bother you. The game is great and surely needed sequel to Homefront series. And always make sure before buying games that your PC can handle it.*Feel free to add me for coop or helping you to start up.			"

CryEngine really delivers it.The sound as well.The plot is nice and the characters in the game are interesting, but it is not more than decent.The gameplay is very similiar to Farcry gameplay: open world shooting game where you need to unlock outposts (or any other way you want to call it) and have a main missions that you can do.The game is pretty easy as well.in the end I think you should buy this game in a sale. it is a decent fun game.

												Homefront: The Revolution follows what's known as the Far Cry Formula. So basicly it's a open world shooter with a bunch of side activities to do apart from the main missions. So if you like the Far Cry Games (FC2-FC4) (FC1 doesn't actually follow this open world formula, which the other Far Cry Games do), there is a good chance you'll like this aswell. However I don't think it can live quiet up to the Far Cry Games. But that's enough comparison to the Far Cry Franchise.The game is running on one of the more recent versions of the Cry-Engine. So it looks pretty good. Not quiet as good as Crysis 3, but close. I like the design of the Environment. I think it pictures very realisticly how a destroyed American City would actually look like.The Shooter mechanics work just fine thoughout the game.The game is set in Philadelphia in the year 2027. Two years, after North Korea invaded the USA.The main story is entertaining, but nothing particularly special. However I think the story telling outside of the actual main story is done pretty well. you can find letters from people, both american and korean throughout the city, where you can read more of the story of individuals during the war. simular to how you can find journal entries and stuff on terminals in fallout games that will tell you more little stories that happened in this fictional world.So yes it's a good game. But if you are not particularly looking for this dirty somewhat realistic war setting of the near future and you have not played all the Far Cry Games yet, than these may be worth to take a look at aswell.

												If I could have refunded this game I would have. Its a terrible PC port.The biggest issues the game has is the control scheme, you cannot key bind other than default controls , as the default scheme remains active regardless what configuration you selected. I eventually just gave up and tried to use my wired 360 controller, that even had issues, with the UI prompts constantly flickering and not displaying properly when needed. I had to settle on using auto hot key, in which this is the 2nd pc port I've had to resort to this now. Aside from it being a bad PC port. Its just not a very good shooter campaign. Don't let it fool you, this is just a run of the mill first person shooter campaign. It is hardly an open world game. There are no branching paths and nothing you do in the open world matters in the plot. I recently played through Killzone Shadowfall a launch game for the ps4 and it was infinitely better than this. I had way more fun with that, and its graphics were more impressive and it wasn't using cryengine running on ultra. Especially near the end of this game, the art assets looked very flat and very low res/ low poly for what is supposed to be the big finisher moment of the game.The highlights of this game where when the engine shines, showing moody atmospheric lighting with contrasting lights.Also, If you are going to play this game, play it on the normal difficulty. Its not a well balanced shooter, even with all the upgrades, you will find yourself dying in under 2 seconds sometimes.			"

												I feel this game needs some praise because of early reviews people are giving it a wide birth and online play is suffering for this reason.Its far better than some would have you think IMO.  The campagn is much like farcry 2&3 with the concept of taking back the map one section at a time and this suits the hit n run style gameply a lot.I enjoyed so much I even broke one of my own rules and got the season pass due to the content being substantial for the price and I needed more than 30 hours of content after it was done.The online coop is fun also with objective based gauntlets for 4 players to work through.If I have any gripes at all its that the skill system in online mode and certain gear like suppressors for rifles & armour are all not availible in single player which would have added a lot to the campaign, also no mod support to add these things ourselves which IMO there is no excuse for in a game these days, all games should have mod support as there is high demand.

												It is huge step up from how I remember the first being, the open world and revolution are a nice touch but its just so easy. On the hardest mode the AI has no other moves then get in cover and call for more people to get in cover, although you take a decent amount of damage it doesent change how overpowered your weapons are and how easy it is to upgrade everything. Half way through the game I ended up in a new yellow zone that ""Isnt like anything you've seen"".... it was alot more pretty for about 2 minutes before i hit a couple of radio's.... if thats all the revolution needed then why the ♥♥♥♥ are we trying so hard to save this dude. I dont think i'll end up finishing this just because it wasnt very challenging at all, If the end turns out being you're all we ever needed I wouldnt be suprised though. In the end even with the extra mechanics it felt like a watered down division.Just a sidenote almost all the negative reviews mention bugginess which i cant comment on, worst thing I came across was terrible AI popin, half a block away stuff would spawn and despawn, but the actual game seemed to play fine, might be an issue related to certain people?

												A missed opportunity.	I've played it for a bit and overall, its boring. Its repetitive, falls utterly flat on is mechanics in more ways then you can see . The save system is Completely useless, and activates when you least needed it. And can utterly screw up you progress in game. The graphic/frame rate is a utter shame seeing as to how it optimized. The shooting mechanics are tedious and  down right frustrating in critical situations.The story is underlay executed and wasted in half of the missions. Its a shoot this, break that repeat. Its like they took the far cry dynamics and stretched them out. Hell you can't even acquire enemy weapons. It a waste of a title.			"

												***Never ever buy this game***Feels like it is still in Beta, however it has been sold and marketed as complete. This game is now so broken that it will freeze or black-screen within about 5 minutes of play. Sometimes publishers will push a game to be release too early and put way too much pressure on the developer. That could be the case here, howver since the patches have now made the game completely unplayable I'm leaning towards total incompetence as the main cause.Here are some of the persistant issues:- Pressing or spamming *Enter* will sometimes not skip logos upon startup despite displayed message stating to do so.- Game black-screened with continuing audio, after opening cinematic on first try.- Awkward and dysfunctional parkour. Dambuster Studios could take some lessons from Assassin's Creed.- Bad AI. NPCs have a habit of trapping you in a corner or blocking a doorway.- Can't do the Car Park Chop Shop mission due to a bug with the motorcycle dyno which results in the rollerdoor not opening.- Gameplay completely stalls on the Power To The People mission, meaning that you can make no further progress in the game. Only option is to restart from the beginning with a random chance that it may happen again.- Light outside of doorways is too blinding and washed out to see a KPA target shooting at you.- NPCs clip through each other, the ground, and other objects.- NPCs will come and stand in front of you just as you pull the trigger on your RPG resulting in their death and possibly your own.- NPCs in your squad act like they're on an invisible bungie cord and will stand so close to you that they can push you off a ledge.- Patches are reminiscent of DayZ, where every patch makes something worse.- Developer wants to expand the game in the future so it's quite likely that more features will be broken in the future.*Edit:*Now that the game has been 'patched' you can expect more frequent black-screening, even on the introductory level.*The frame rate is so bad after the introductory level that it stutters worse than Michael Palin 	(as Ken Pile) in A Fish Called Wanda.*Edit:*The latest 2.0 patch has resulted in a weird stuttering issue related to the running mechanics. Also seen in running NPCs.*For some reason they've spent time adding 2 new maps for the 3 players that still play resistance mode.			"

												Worth a purchase at $10-12 or less for the game + DLC.  Not worth more. There are brilliant little elements sewed in to an otherwise repetitive open-world FPS.  Interesting concept, good game to play for a few days or a couple of weekends.  Isn't going to net you hundreds of hours, but you'll get your $10-12 worth considering I went to a movie last night for $14.25.  "

												Great open world game with a gritty atmosphere, runs pretty smooth on my machine (NV760, quadcore haswell cpu from 2014, 16 gb ram). If you liked Far Cry 3 + 4 (I did, although FC4 did not add enough to the formula compared to FC3) and Mad Max, you might like this one, too. Don't immediately believe what people are saying, go have a look at some of the lets plays and decide for yourself.			"

												I love this game so much, At its core it really is something fantastic but the buggy and terrible gameplay ruins all of it. The dependency on broken AI is too high, Why can't I take control instead of watch this AI walk into wall for 4 hours before taking another path? This game is great it really is but it's not worth the money in its current state. Wait til'  they patch this ""thing"".			"

												It took me 106 hours to complete. I will say this game was very fun!  Very good combat and good choice of weapons. I played more stealth and with a hit and run strategy, take some things out and run!  I think the way it was meant to be played. I think the story was good although the writing was a little weak, sort of like a B or B+ rated movie. I will admit I played on easy but for me (being 56 years old) it was just a right amount of AI and even still I needed to use a good strategy. I would recommend this game to any fan of FPS I’m sure on hard or higher it will give you a very hard time.			"

												Playing this felt like a complete chor, at every stage I felt the game fighting back at my input. Even just basic movement was jerky and unresponsive. Gunplay was bland and overall not very satisfying. I noticed pretty early on that the gun lowering on allies (Preventing you from shooting them) ended at about 10 metres or so and no one responded to it. On top of that, the loot you could scavenge off of them was the same as enemies, so you could get the same results for significantly less effort by just gunning down all your allies that spawn in safezones.It's a shame, the setting was an interesting one. But there was very little story telling, you just sort of bumbled from point to point on your own (because allies are completely useless). It seems very much akin to Far Cry's idea of open worlds, just without a clear idea of what it is you should be doing.I never thought I'd play a game that had managed to fail at virtually every aspect. Both the story and gameplay elements are dull and comletely forgettable.			"

												This game has received some poor reviews, and it made me leary to try it, however the idea behind the story had me intereseted. I, personally don't care much for multiplayer, and therefore can only speak to the single player. It took me just shy of 20 hours to complete this game, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Granted there are some very irritating glitches, but none that I experienced were game braking. This game was far better than the original homefront, which was short and god aweful. In the end, this game did for me what games are ment to, it gave me about 20 hours of enjoyment. If you are like me and enjoy a dystopian style story this game is for you. Give it a Shot			"

												Honestly not even a fraction of as bad as people say it is.Guns feel nice. Neither you nor the enemies are bullet sponges. Story is interesting enough to keep you going.Don't expect a full open world RPG though. The open map serves only to give you a sense of freedom of engagement and movement, but it should be played running from mission to mission, the open world is not enough to keep you entertained for long, at all.This game can be compared to Far Cry 3/4 in terms of gameplay, but I think this game fixes a lot of things Far Cry 3/4 did wrong, such as the aforementioned bullet sponge enemies and the general feel of the weapons. You don't have a huge arsenal to choose between, but just enough to fit every possible playstyle, and the game features a rather simplistic weapon modding mechanic which allows you to toggle between certain weapon types, the pistol can quickly be converted into an SMG for example, and the rifle can be modded into a sniper in a matter of seconds, depending on if you've bought the mod.All in all, a strong 7/10 in my opinion.

												1 HOUR PLAYTIMENow I write this first review with no hatred whatsoever (unlike everyone else)The game started with a great opening, the story line is exciting and the opening scene gets you in the zone... My first walk around the neighbourhood was slow... the textures look great, the environment is wonderfully detailed with many unique objects around to complete the immersive experience making the environment feel busy and alive. The main characters so far are all unique and have different personalities... the ambient NPCs are cool too however there is an issue with the rigging as their necks look like they are possessed by a demon... There is also an issue with the NPCs interaction with their environment and other NPCs as I seen 2 of them walking into eachother and continued walking on the spot.Sounds used in the game are excellent however the fades/crossovers need work, as sounds are often clashing with one another, overpowering or even turning off other sounds altogether. Now I'm not like these other morons out there that say a game has optimization issues because they aren't getting 120FPS, we all know anything over 35 is excellent for gameplay... however this game does have optimization issues, but it's due to the environment being so detailed and RAM consuming... but it does need work because as soon as i got into battle, I couldn't play it... let alone ride a motorbike at full speed... it ruined it for me... I'm yet to turn all my settings to LOW and see how it goes... FYI I'm running Alienware with GTX680 and 32GB RAM... I play the division on mostly high with a couple ultra settings with no slowdown...Player movement feels very stiff like me on a Saturday morning, interaction with objects and climbable areas sometimes takes a few times to register...The weapon custimization options are exactly the same as Crisis which I dont mind at all as it's a cool looking system... The graphics are beautiful the plot is excellent and I'm really liking where this is going, as I haven't played a good UPRISING styled game since half Life 2... but right now, where it is... I CANNOT give it a thumbs up... in fact I am very disappointed I purchased this as in Australia, this game costed me $70 AUD but I'm not sure if I want to refund or not... I'm holding the hope that this game will be rescued...I was a big fan of the first Homefront when noone else even liked it, because it was too linear and short... but it was a good game... I will update this review after a few bug fixes, but right now I just cant play it... IN FUTURE DEVELOPERS... BE SURE TO QUALITY ASSURE YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE YOU SELL IT... DON'T BE LIKE SO MANY OTHER COMPANIES AND SELL AN UNFINISHED GAME AND THEN HAVE THE CHEEK TO SELL DLCs...3/10 "

												I reall wish there was a so-so button, instead of the like or dislike Option.Because I really kinda liked the games at times and at other times I was soooo♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for the many things that are wrong with the game.So here the hard facts Pro + Setting : very cinematic dystopian USA , feels a little like Fallout + Graphics : Raindrops falling, water puddles on the ground, + challenging : This can be also be deemed negatively. Let's be warned you'll die a lot . Truth be told I'm not the best FPS gamer around, but I played on normal and I died countless times ( not as much as in Dark Souls though) + the motorcycle: driving that motorcycle through town feels very realistic + plays very smooth ( GTX 750ti ) with ZERO frame drops Con - Enemy AI : At times you can just walk past them and they won't really bother to do anything and at other times they will ""sense"" you killed one of their own even if you killed them with no-one in sight and with the knife. Which will make them automatically go into alert mode.- Graphic glitches  : e.g. Fellow rebels which obviously should be carrying a gun, but in reality there are just moving their empty hand with the trigger finger in the position of holding a gun. Enemies vanishing, citizens running into walls, enemies being able to see you through walls and hit you with a gun sometimes, ...- at times Tedious side missions : collect this, donate some cash to beggars, pull that lever in the enemy base, hacking terminals , still there are some big games out there that did worse. - Story sometimes a little cliche ( won't spoil it)  I enjoyed playing the game because I enjoyed the setting and the combat system, although it felt unfair at times, with the enemies being able to hit me through walls and stuff. It feels and plays a little like a mix of METRO and Watch Dogs. MUST BUY ? Hm depends on you, maybe you should be waiting until there are a few more patches released. Honestly I don't think it deserves the mixed reviews it got. It's not bad. It's fun. Also I was talking with a friend and it seems that gamers who are using AMD graphical cards are the ones to experience performance problems mainly. So maybe if you are owning AMD, you should buy it on STEAM directly so you'll be able to return it in case it won't work "

												An excellent, immersive, emotionally satisfying game.Take note, though: Homefront The Revolultion is not 'like' a Far Cry game - it IS a Far Cry game.Really, the mechanics are exactly the same, from stealth to combat to weapon procurement.And even though this is so, there's nothing wrong with that, particularly if you're a Far Cry fan.Voice acting by the man characters is excellent, and the game storyline -though taken from all the classic dystopian movies- is paced very well.Characters that pehaps when you first meet them are irritating -Dana, for me- become like family while you're in this game world.The music, though limited, is fantastic, evocotive of the original Terminator, and really puts you in the setting.Gameplay is excellent, though achieving all the side goals can be a bit of a grind.  When you liberate an area and have freedom fighters running about things can get chaotic as they battle in the streets against your occupiers.Enemy blimps trawl the skies above, seeking out rebles, and if you get caught in their view all hell breaks loose as they call KPA troops down on you.Very glad I got the game and pass during the Christmas sale, was well worth it, particularly if your a fan of dystopian or post apocalyptic worlds.The only issue I had was that frame rates dropped if battles were too huge and a lot of bodies began piling up.  The only work around for this is taking a break from the game and coming back to it - wich is actually a good thing since it's engaging enough to play hours at a stretch.			"

												This is better than I thought it would be, if you can get past the stupid premise that North Korea invaded America and won somehow? According to Wikipedia 24 million people live in North Korea,  324 million live in America… hell North Korea couldn’t even take over South Korea, they apparently have a population of 50 million…..so yeah stupid as f*ck. China makes sense, they have a population of over 1 billion, but America wants that Chinese currency so they don’t wanna p*ss them off in their media. The Red Dawn remake switched the invading force to North Korea as well (but they already filmed it with the Chinese as the enemy and just CGI’d the uniforms and such lol).As for the gameplay, this is what Crysis 2 should have been. If you’ve played any of the Crysis games this plays exactly like those. The gun sounds even sound similar, and they both use the Crytek engine. I would say it’s better than the 2nd and 3rd Crysis games.This is open world….ish. There are about 6 pretty big areas that you can run around in and take over by capturing strikepoints (think outposts from Far Cry). It’s Far Cry mixed with Crysis. I really liked how most of the enemies don’t take a lot of ammo to kill on normal difficulty, and die pretty fast. The actually adds a lot to immersion after playing games like The Division where it takes a week to kill a mofo.Also, this looks amazing on high settings, most games that use the Crytek engine look amazing. What’s not so amazing is the performance, I got between 40 – 50 fps on high settings.The characters and story are all meh, I managed to complete the story mode over the free weekend…so I don’t plan on buying it anytime soon lol. If you are a fan of the Crysis games I would recommend it though, if you aren’t then maybe wait till it’s cheap.P.S. There's a hidden arcade machine on the top floor of the prison area (where the two people in the cage fight) near the end of the game, which has two full levels of Timesplitters 2 you can play!!!

												Story: Predictable, I'm ok with thatGameplay: Fair, slightly interested, I like itGraphics: Amazing assuming your comp handles it correctly(Many people have bugs, I do not)Bugs: MASSIVE AMOUNTS! AI Bugs, Wall Bugs, Graphic Bugs, and GAMEBREAKING BUGS!I was ok to keep the game and play it through even with the bugs until I ran into GAMEBREAKING BUGS over and over again. 4 times I ran into these bugs. I reported them, I also reported how to recreate them. As of 5/22/16 they are not fixed. I am not a play tester for this game, but I assure you it needed some. These bugs were easily found and recreated.Now how are these bugs Gamebreaking? Basically, it puts you in a mission that can neither be completed or end. Often area becomes a ghost town because AI won't spawn properly, or they get stuck in walls. Your objective will be to do X, but you have already completed X so you can't do it. Quest/Mission Flag fails to realize you have already done request. You are just stuck in same area, with no way to proceed in the game. Does not reward exploring because you might bug your game if you explore something too early.Thats ok, I can just go to a previous save right. NO... by the time you figure out you have put yourself in a never ending bug. Its too late. There are no save states. Game autosaves and autosaves often. You have a total of 4 autosaves. These autosaves happen whenever you do something significant or if you change your weapon at a locker. Basically, you can't rely on savestates to return to if you bug the game.Their solution if you get bugged and cannot proceed. 1. Wait for patch to fix bug. 2. Erase your saves, and start over. I started over 4 times, and found different Gamebreaking bugs each time. The only way to avoid these bugs is to not explore and only follow mission requests. Makes game boring and not fun at all. "

												Update after finishing the game:I have to bump the overall score down to 6/10 :(  I don't want to spoil anything for those considering buying this game but mehhhhhhh on the ending.  The game was still hours and hours of fun but it almost feels like they rushed the plot to ship the game in time.  It was probably the most un-interesting, short-sighted, predictable ending of any video game, ever.  Also I found something that really helped performance big time about half-way through.  Put the object detail at medium.  I could hardly tell any difference between medium and very high, and I was able to max everything else out and play with a pretty much locked 60fps @ 2715x1527 which looks considerably better than 1080p.  And oddly runs much better than 1.5x supersampling in-game.Good try Dambuster - hopefully you'll have some great lessons learned from all of the user feedback and will make a truly great game if there's a sequel.Original review:I waited 10 hours to post my review because I wanted to give HF:R a fighting chance.Short version:  7/10 - I say buy itPros:  Actually pretty damn fun so farCons:  GPU utilization/frame pacing issues reminiscent of Fallout 4Long version:Maybe my version of a fun FPS is different from 99% of the world, but I'm actually really enjoying this game.  Considering DeepSilver/DB inherited a POS bankrupt title that was tossed back and forth for 4 years like a red-headed high school cheerleader, I think the results are pretty great.Sure, there are some framepacing issues, GPU utilization problems, and yes theres some points where it's sort of mindboggling that basic features arent there (hello...cough... save game), but the overall presentation is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good and enjoyment is high.  Maybe I'm weird... but  I was compelled to write a review in favor of this game after seeing so many bad reviews before playing it. All I've seen are reviews saying how disasterous the performance is.  I also see the majority of reviews saying the gameplay is bland, combat is weak, stealth system sucks, graphics are underwhelming, on and on and on.  I disagree with those for the most part too. I swear people are way too critical.  Here's my take:Stealth:  7/10 - If it had better cover mechanics, or even the ability to lean from cover, it would be 8Combat: 7/10 - it does feel a little sluggish at times, but I turned auto-aim offGraphics: 6/10 - compared to Division or UC4, which have set a new bar for graphics these daysEnjoyment 8/10 - despite the lower scores above, for some reason this game is totally pulling me in, its fun!Performance: 5/10 - see belowStory: 5/10Value: 7/10The only real major flaw I see so far is a GPU utilization problem.  A 6700k/980ti combo should be able to run a Dying Light clone (essentially what this game feels and looks like to me) at a resolution of 2715x1527 @ max settings and achieve a locked 60fps with about 90-95% GPU utilization.  With HF:R it's nowhere even close to that.  I'm able to get 55-60 fps @ 1920x1080 but it only uses about ~65% of the GPU to do so.  If I step it even 1 notch above 1080p, or use supersampling at all, framerates become wildly unstable - as does the GPU utilization.  Even at 1080p there are a few very rare and unexplainable dips into the high 40s.  Every time it happens the GPU util actually drops to around 30-50%, almost as if something's choking the bandwidth.  Actually, it's a similar symptom to  Fallout 4.  Even with the necessary hardware to run it at 2k DSR max settings, the game just couldn't keep up with the draw calls - showing the signs of an aging engine I suppose.But to note: the frame rate issue (for me anyway) is very infrequent ... maybe 3-4 times in the 10 hours I've played.  I think it's a minor nuisance.  The rest of the time it's a pretty stable 60fps using ~65% GPU at max settings.  Good enough to be enjoyable.Anyway - I don't understand what's with all the hate.  It's a fun game and a killer concept with only minor performance issues.  If they fix the framerate issues I'd even go so far as to give it a 7.5 out of 10.  If you're on the fence but enjoyed Dying Light, I'd say buy it.  You'll probably enjoy this game.  It's kind of like a mix of DL and Division... sorta.  Maybe wait until it goes on sale, which with the number of negative reviews sadly, probably won't take very long.Specs:I6700kGigabyte G1 980ti64gb Dominator Pro DDR4950 Evo NVMEAsus Hero Viii			"

It has many bugs and issues, such as out-of-sync audio, buggy AI, clunky controls both on foot and on the motorbike. The biggest issue I have is the Ashgate ""Hearts & Mind"" error which to be fixed requires you to delete your save and restart the whole game.

												Well,I actually enjoyed the game.I know it has gotten some bad returns but for me...I had a blast!The story is what you would expect from an apocolyptic end of da wurld! senario but not bad as these stories go.The graphics are about the norm for this day and age and the detail is admirable.The music is cryptic in some levels and really adds to the feeling.Now the good part.....GRENADES AND THE LIMPET MINE LAUNCHER.Since there are no gibs to speak of the rag doll mechanics is hilarious.Stick a limpet mine at a soldiers feet and watch the fun.....40 feet in the air and a resounding WHTAGHHHHHHHH!The heck wit da plot and hand me a grenade.The side quests are more like mini-games than quests and the voice acting is really pretty well done also.The mocap could have been a little better but in the end it's whether you had fun ....and I DID!All in all well done....for ME!If you can get it on sale so much the better.7\10			"

												Bought this game on the last free weekend. Never regret buying this game. Eventhough not as bad as what the reviews said, it does still has some bugs, glitches and a few crashes. Across 26 hours of playing, i got like 7-8 crashes with 2-4 hours range for each crashes.+ Pros:- Graphic is goooood- Weapon modification is cool, the flamenwerfer is awesome and battle riffle sure packs a punch, but my fave is always smg- Open world far cry style, with minor stealth element (really really minor)- Motorbike, unfortunately, you cant kill the Norks by crashing your motorbike, they always find a way to disable your bike first- Cool gadgets, rc cars with mounted explosives is great for blowing things, besides explosives you got hacking device, firecracker,and molotov- Resistance mode is great, IMO, its better than the main game+ Cons:- The stealth, is weird, killing an enemy with suppressor weapon will alerts other enemies even after the guy died, but with crossbow, this doesnt happen- Mediocre story with some holes, like no explanation in some parts, like how did he still alive after getting that many shots and wth happened with walker- Dana Moore, she's creepy - Hacking, meh- Crashes, 7-8 times (might be more, I didnt keep track), but never crash in Resistance mode, some minor bugs and glitchesConclusion, I recommend this game, but get it only when its on sale. If it runs good on your rig, enjoy. If its not, refund.   "

												I had fun. Simple words but in the end that is what matters regardless of the features, the glitches the everything it all boils down to whether you had fun or not. Homefront 2 did very little to be different to other games, there are a lot of areas where you can tell there has been some rushing involved and you will run into problems here and there such as audio loops or an audio piece being triggers multiple times at once for whatever reason, the other major problem I saw was the fov just not going high enough. In terms of bugginess though its vastly superior to what it was at launch, pathing from ai is very good now and I didnt have it crash throughout the 13 hours I played it. Missions all worked properly as well. Firstly if you are going to play this then turn off the music in the settings because there is something that seriously makes this game and that is the atmosphere, it is the feeling of dread and warzone that you see, it all just seems so believable as well and a legitamate fear for enemies overpowering you is present, the first time you see an airship up close is intense  especially when the enemies will drop you fast so you need to be careful. This is what brings it back, if you ignore a lot of problems that raw atmosphere is still there and its fantastic because a false step will end in your death, i personally didnt use the spotting mechanics as well because I find them to be cheap and it adds to that great level of immersion.I cant say what it was like at launch but its pretty great right now at least for me and depending on how you play its a pretty fun game, its no way near perfect but its something I can comfortably recommend now dueing a sale. I managed to get this for £6 and im quite satisfied with what I got.			"

												Before you get into the review, let me get this out first, if you don't like the gameplay of Far Cry 4, then STOP, I assure you you’ll find the gameplay of Homefront : The Revolution tedious and repetitive, as the game takes great inspiration from Far Cry 3 & 4, although it doesn’t do it better. However, if you like the gameplay of Far Cry 4, then you might like this game.Let me just say first hand that I love the core gameplay itself. People may deem it very repetitive, but I don’t mind. The game itself is very fun and is interesting enough to get me to finish the campaign, but MAN is this game riddled with a lot of issues. I think a lot of people reviewed this game a little too harshly, but I wouldn’t blame them for getting frustrated while playing through this game, cause I did a couple of times. Let’s start with the positives of this game;+ The world is absolutely detailed and believable, you really feel like you’re being dragged into a dystopian Philadelphia. Red zones looks like they were ravaged by war and Yellow zones really feel like it is occupied by the North Koreans ( Norks )+ The gameplay pays homage to Crysis and Far Cry, which is fine and offers enough variety to keep you going through the campaign. You also have a lot jobs to take, outposts to liberate, and Norks to kill to keep you busy.+ The weapon conversion system is an interesting concept and interjects smoothly into the gameplay, however I feel like it could’ve been done better.+ Yellow zones are a blast to play in, where you have to employ this hit and run tactic and lurk in the alleys where you plan your next move.Apart from that, there’s not much else that sets this game apart from the others. It does, however, have a lot of negatives which pretty much sums up why a lot of people disliked the game;-  As I’ve stated before, gameplay does get repetitive and may force people away as they get further into the campaign- The story is pretty generic and the ending isn’t very satisfying - Gunplay feels clunky and is below average compared to recent shooters- Some mission designs are abysmal - The game is very stingy when it comes to autosaving, so prepare to be frustrated when the game crashes- The characters, oh my god the characters, are some of the most forgettable and deplorable characters I have ever seen from any game I’ve played. They can be either generic to downright annoying, let me give you some examples;a. The silent protagonist, Brady, I don’t get why this guy doesn’t talk, so much awkward situations could be avoided if the guy had just said a word, but he didn’t. The guy just doesn’t talk throughout the entire campaign and it’s pretty annoyingb. Perrish, this guy isn’t a bad character, but he’s not a good one either. He’s like your dad who always tries to fit in by trying to be funny, but always ends up doing it in the wrong situations.c. Moore, the psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥ who’s backstory is so vague that you just don’t ♥♥♥♥ing care and want to stay away from her as far as possible. Her actions are always straightforward and end up being dumb and bad for everyone.d. Dr. Burnett, the guy who complains and whines about everything. He is always against everything the resistance does making me wonder why he joined the resistance in the first place.- Red zones, ♥♥♥♥ red zones. There are so many things that could’ve been done better when it comes to red zones. For instance;a. Airships, they’re a unique concept, but they end up being infuriating in this game. They seem to be designed for only one thing, and that’s to track YOU. They ignore every resistance fighters they shine their light on and ONLY go red when they see you. b. Enemies, sometimes they’re dumb and  just stand still, sometimes they’re smart and try to flank you. They also spawn out of thin air and track you like blood hounds if you’re in a red zone.c. Bikes, again a unique concept, but falls short. Driving isn’t very fun and ends up being slower than running due to the many debris that blocks the roads in the red zoneIn the end, Homefront: The Revolution feels rushed and is a missed opportunity. There are so many unique concepts, like the story and the game mechanics, however they aren’t really done properly and ends up being an annoyance that drives players away. It’s definitely not worth full price, but if you don’t mind the repetitive gameplay, I’d recommend getting it during a sale. < 6 / 10 >			"

												Not without it flaws, but very fun game nonetheless. It's basically a Far Cry in urban setting and that worked spectacularly for me. Fights are fun, gunplay is solid, bots are fairly stupid to abuse but still competent enough to fight.World is divided in several regions that you will ""liberate"" by hacking/blowing different objects of interest inside it, these regions can ""red"" or ""yellow"" zones, which I've found very interesting. Red Zones are pretty large open areas with a lot of ruins and rubble, where enemies shoot on sight and your gameplay is mainly kill everybody and capture everything. Also ride on bike on every stairwell.Yellow Zones are more like City 17 in Half-Life 2. Building are mostly intact, there are lots of alleys, civilians and patrols. Fighting there is a little tricky, thanks to constant enemy reinforcements - you should run away and fight smart.Both zone types feel a little different while keeping focus and gameplay loop intact. That results in pretty varied but consistent experience, which is pretty hard for a sandbox. Maybe there will be a green zone, I haven't reached it yet.Being pretty much happy with the game it the current state, I must mention that it is very clunky. It does suffer from the lack of polish you expect from AAA open-world games, but mainly because in a game of this scale there is a LOT you need to polish. Some voice actors are really dull, radio chatter is extensive, human models are pretty bad and it is a little buggy. From minor physics glitches to disappearing enemies on long distances.And oh my god the intro sequence was horrendous. Cutscene, cutscene, walk, instant failure if you walk wrong, cutscene, walk, cutscene, loading, walking cutscene. You'll see all the flaws in this intro: bugs, clunkiness, bad acting, bad character models and it's pretty lengthy too.I do hope that intro won't scare you, because after that you'll be dropped inside a Red Zone and it's a great fun. With ruins you can run and bike inside, stronghold to capture, koreans to ambush and random flashpoints the game generates for you - it's really fun. Clunky, but fun... Funky?..Also, there is a coop Resistance mode. It's... weaker, but still fun. Missions are heavily scripted and linear, while progression and loot systems are not very interesting. So I can't say there is a lot of replayability after you beat all missions on Hard. Which by the way IS hard, so you know, it's fine as a side activity.In the end I can see why people was unhappy on the release of this game, but right now, without anything gamebreaking, with fixed performance and lowered price - this game is very, very solid.

												If you like the idea of running around and blowing people up with cool gadgets, this is the game for you.I can't however with honesty recommend a game that breaks every single design rule I have learned.- A long, and I mean long cinematic and then period that you can't skip or do anything in.- 30 minutes until you do anything at all aside from hack a console that you are given no tutorial for but punished heavily when you fail (you take a lot of health damage - not that it's a big issue since it's pretty easy anyways once you figure out what to do).- AIs will constantly get in your way. About 10 minutes into the game, a civilian made me stuck between two doors causing me to glitch onto the roof then fall out of the map.- There is no clear effect for when you take damage. It looks like you are barely damaged and then you fall dead.- Enemies can run into the respawn area making you die repeatedly.- Enemies are in no way scaled to teach you the ropes. You will right off the bat be swarmed with enemies and APCs.- Speaking of which. If you see an APC and then go around the corner to bomb it. When you turn back, it is gone. Just poff. Very weird despawning. Even had a robot teleport from one side to another.Now that is just the game design and some common sense rules that they break.Aside from that, the game just doesn't feel responsive and they have some really ethically questionable stuff like teddy bears functioning as proximity mines. Because as wel know, toy bombs are weapons aimed at children, not soldiers. That's like a basic ""don't do it"" of content design. It's not funny to joke about murdering children.At its current state, I can only recommend it to people who just want something to play while waiting on other games. I recommend however that you wait until there is a discount.			"

												Find an FOV calculator, enter in your desired horizontal FOV and then use the calculated vertical FOV number to set your FOV higher in the files. Go to: (user name)\Saved Games\homefront2\game.cfg and open the file in Notepad.Find the below text, which should be right at the top.cl_defaultnearfov = 50cl_fov = 50The default vertical is set at 50. But I like to play it at 68, which is 100 horizontal FOV.Save the file after the changes, boot up the game and enjoy your new perspective on the world.--The game itself though, I honestly find really enjoyable. I have not played another game that has really nailed the feeling of urban warfare and guerrilla tactics like Homefront: The Revolution has. You will frequently feel outmanned and outgunned, which I find incredibly refreshing compared to the mass of games that treat you like a super soldier.The difficulty is no walk in the park either, even on Easy a shotgun to the face will kill you instantly if you aren't at full health. Again, I very much enjoy this kind of feeling where engagements have to be planned out and taken seriously.The co-op is a real high point, adding a very positive team dynamic to the guerrilla warfare, but unfortunately it is pretty dead. This is a huge shame, as some of the best fun in the game can be found in these missions playing with other people and sharing the experience. Bring friends for the great co-op or buy it just for the singleplayer.			"

Long story short, this game suffers heavily from bugs and glitches,   There is no point in playing until the end with this uninspired setting and boring story and characters. I don't feel attached to anyone because there are no personality in these characters. Game graphics looks superior because it is built on the Cry Engine, but other than that, there is nothing great in this game worth mentioning. My rating: 1/5			"

												I can’t understand why this game is getting bad reviews. Story line is good, gameplay is tight, and the graphics are top notch. Running Homefront on its highest settings is going to be demanding but if you’ve got a strong system then you’ll appreciate the benefits of this game. CryTek’s CryEngine 3 is still one of the best game engines used. Frame rates are high and crashes are extremely rare. Homefront: The Revolution may not be a contender for game of the year but it is a formidable release and well worth the investment.			"

												Really enjoying this game. Played both co-op and single playeer and have had zero issues with the game. Am I lucky I didn't buy it when it first released? Probably. I've followed the game for awhile and finally decided to make my purchased. I'm quite sure others that posted problems about their experience was valid. It is a risk we all take, and it is something we all will experience ourselves on making game purchases.The game-play for me feels a bit in-between Dying Light and Metro. The graphics are on the side of Metro and the play feels like Dying Light with on the climbing and looting for componants. Bots are a bit dingy. Not much help, and more in the way. They are not scripted to the story so there you go. Par-for-the-course. Sounds are good. Weather is awesome. I love seeing the rain begin and start to dampen the sidewalk. That detail was something I don't ever recall seeing in a game before. Usually it just begins raining and tada!, its wet! Story and acting is primo! Very well done.UI is simple and has most of what you need in regards to tuning your game right. Like with most games the story doesn't seem to be that long, but you add-in the side-quest or just (like me) going for that 'completionist' set' the game will last for awhile.I would say get it if your unsure. Make sure all your drivers are utd. Enjoy! No regrets and I'm happy with my purchase.Rig is; CPU i7-5930@ 3.5ghz, mobo Asus X99 Deluxe, 16g Corsiar  DDR4 LPX 2666, 1T Samusung TLC EVO SSD, Corsair i1200AX psu, EVGA 980 GTX.			"

												When you play, try roleplay yourself as an actual resistance fighter, try not to worry much about how gameplay works. It's actually feels like Far Cry 3/4 knockoffs, with similar features but not as good as them.It's worth it only when on sales, unless you're a hardcore inspiring-revolutionary who really wants to be a part of political/militant resistance movement but have too many responsibilities in real life. Then I'd recommend it.			"

												Homefront revolution is far cry and dying light kinda open world game.Story is simple,you are a resistance fighter trying to liberate his country from North Korean invaders.To reach your goal you are using guerilla tactics.Hit & Escape,set traps,steatlh etc.pros:+Game uses cry engine.Graphics are good and become better if you turn on super sampling.+Guerilla warfare+open world+Crossbow and RC Car bomb.+Detailed weapon modifications+Alternative ""what if"" historyCons:-Sometimes missions become repetitive (take over outpost kinda missons)-When you detected you are surrounded by korean soldiers instantly spawned.At least they should come with trucks etc.not to spawn instantly.-You may experience some little bugs.Personal note: In my opinion,If Homefront series set at 1980's in the USSR occupied USA would be more plausible and interesting than North Korean occupy.

												If I had to describe the game, it would be ""Urban Farcry"", Farcry 3 specifically. Take over bases, they become allied bases with gun shop cabinets and safe points. You can upgrade guns or gear, a lot of the upgrades are the exact same from Farcry like looting an enemy on a melee takedown. They hammered out details of the Koreans gaining power and invading it's own timeline, personally I think they should have kept it as the Chinese when they initially drew up the story when they made the first homefront. The storyline is weak. Koreans don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥that Americans are seizing territory and setting up very noticable bases. Americans practically spray paint ""AMERICAN BASE HERE"" on the sides of these places.Game keeps freezing at weird points, since the game uses a check point system it's a good chance you will lose a lot of work when it happens. I've also seen other weird bugs like NPCs freezing and standing in place. At one point in the storyline this happened and I couldn't progress without restarting from the last check point. I've watched an armored vehicle spawn at a gate, looked away and back, poof it was gone. Models look good, but the animations get very choppy and it's like trying to shoot an agent from the matrix at times when the enemy model sputters around when it's trying to get in a position.			"

The game feels sluggish with a 980ti - poor optimizationGame breaking bugs that end the storyline/optional side misisonsEnemies don't drop guns or give ability to pick up guns, instead ammo for whatever gun you use.Game is not unique at all.

Product received for free
												Played this over the weekend both co-op and singleplayer and it's just... eugh, I know we have to give concessions to open-world nature but, it quickly just felt like <Insert Ubisoft Open world title here> Goto location, kill the guards, press button, suddenly these resistance members move in, if there's any AI enemies nearby they'll be as shocked as you are that these people arrive (Had a hilarious moment when a drone flew upto a man with a rocket launcher on his back, scanned him as clear, flew away and then everyone started shooting)It has some fun ideas but it's not well implemented or introduced (Which is a shame) the stealth feels hit and miss with enemies seeing you through walls and not seeming to be alerted when the guy next to them suddenly falls over dead.I won't bother too much with the story because it just fell flat on it's face with this Apex corporation trope (If anyone who did finish the story, please tell me it didn't involve norks time travelling with technology, cause if it did I'll cry) Unlikable characters, no clear reason why the North Koreans are such bad people just 'Merica can't be tamed y'allThe co-op is the only bit I had quite a jolly time with, although it was mainly laughing at the game, as tanks appeared infront of us, the gear unlocking limiting the missions somewhat, some objectives not unlocking. All in all, it's a fine example of what development hell does to a game, plenty of good ideas poorly integrated, also I smell crytek all over that retconned story.			"

Homefront: The Revolution - Single Player Campaign -- REVIEW:SIDE NOTES:This review has been edited a bit to get this review up on the Steam Review Page.For the full blown Single Player Campaign review, go to this link:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TGAEC/discussions/0/133259956022376176/MysterD's Verdict:RECOMMENDED.Intro:With Homefront: The Revolution (HF:TR), Dambuster Studios has taken on the Homefront franchise here, right it into another direction entirely: the Far Cry 3+4 style of open-world FPS gameplay. A lot of the same mistakes from the original Homefront are here: technical performance issues; & not-so-great story + character development. Though, this time around - HF:TR mostly succeeds because of its excellent graphics quality loaded with details galore everywhere + superb lighting provided by the killer CryEngine; excellent open-world; the gameplay + gunplay; & the few interesting twists + spins on the Far Cry 3+4 open-world gameplay.Granted, this is all provided as long you can actually get around any sort of technical issues. HF:TR is certainly not without its share of technical issues, to say the very least.Performance Issues, Technical Issues, Other Anomalies, Etc:Over time, from the first Free Weekend with this on Steam to even quite recently, I've had more issues than I can shake a stick at. During the Free Weekend, I had performance issues + had to limit the game's framerate via MSI Afterburner to a custom-set 35 FPS keep it stable on my PC at 1080p. After purchasing + re-picking up the game (from where I left off, last time during its Free Weekend) just recently on the same PC (at least power-wise), more issues were introduced to me: texture flickering and/or shadow flickering. I dropped down to 1440p, to try to improve performance. I kept the graphical settings mostly at High settings. When doing so, I just couldn't see very much on the screen in certain areas for either a brief amount of time or for lots of amount of time, whether using normal V-Sync On or Off.Trying NVidia's FastSync worked in some areas, but didn't always work out entirely in other areas. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. So, that wasn't the best solution for my flickering issues either.Forcing a 1/2 Refresh V-Sync On to limit + sync it to 30 FPS solved those issues for me with NVidia Inspector. This is not ideal, mind you - but the game was still at least playable & not having the shadow + texture flickering here. The Gameplay + Gunplay In This Open-World Dystopia:""The weapons are interesting here - not because of what they are (they're your typical gun types - pistols, SMG's"", assault rifles, ""etc), but what you can do with them. While on the fly + actually in combat, open up the Weapon Customization section (which shows your guns & what pieces you have for it) & you can quickly turn one gun into another by swapping parts out. For example, you eventually get a pistol - but it's easy enough (with a like 2 or 3 mouse clicks) to swap out enough pieces & turn it quickly right into a SMG. Since you can only have a max of 3 guns at some point, you can carry all kinds of different pieces - which is a pretty cool, different & interesting mechanic.""""Combat itself plays quite well & is just fine, as one would probably expect from a game on the CryEngine. Shootouts on the game's suggested difficulty look & feel pretty good here, which makes getting into combat a joy here. To make it even more interesting, there's two states you can wind-up in, if you get all your HP (Hit Points) destroyed.""""You can either get 'critically injured' or just flat-out 'die.' So, I'm getting 'critically injured' way more here, which sends you with all your progress right back to a nearby base + you will lose some items for surviving. The other thing that can happen is you just flat-out wind-up 'dying', instead just loads your last actual save-game instead - so, this game can be a bit challenging for me. ""You will want to also overthrow areas b/c you'll have random AI walking around in your area, who you can have following you, as you go around the game-world. This can really help to get AI tagging along with you, if you don't feel like being a Superman stuck in a spaghetti western here, just lone-wolfing & killing numerous guys in one area - since going the spaghetti western route in this game will make it much easier for you to get either critically injured or killed.""You can also sneak up on enemies & take them out, taking the stealthy approach.  This is a good approach to start down this path with, if possible, to knock down at least some numbers of opponents until you possibly get caught. Though, if you get caught + seen, you can expect for things to go down & to wind-up into your typical shootout situation. If you're doing a sneaking-only required mission that you can actually fail & have to restart from your last checkpoint - fortunately, there are only a few of these stealth-only missions.When going through enemy areas + turning them into one of your own for the Resistance. Doing so, of course, is to your benefit. This gives you more areas you can Fast Travel between; gear-up; buy new weapons + equipment. One thing that is wonderful about this, is Enemy Areas look so different when turned from a KPA Area to a Resistance Area, making it always looks like a Revolution is actually taking place here & areas are completely being overthrown.Plot, Story & Character Development...And Also Presentation:""While the game presents itself rather well with the presentation stuff, the story + character development is....not that good, TBH. And it's not because of the voice-acting or the dialogue - that stuff's passable & decent enough, actually. Seriously, this game does NOT give you much time to care about many characters or much depth for them, before the game finds some kind of exit strategy for them - i.e. kidnapping, death, writing them off, and/or dropping their story. And given what happens in this game with events of people getting hurt & killed brutally, you actually want to care here - but aren't given much reason to do so."" There's a decent amount of Lore to find + read, also - though it's honestly nothing often truly special or spectacular here, in most instances.Outro:Provided the player can actually get past any sort of technical nonsense + issues, performance issues; & not expect the Moon here in terms of story, character & plot-development - the gamer is in for a solid open-world FPS here. ""After getting past most of the technical hurdles, the open-world Far Cry 3+4 style of gameplay in an excellent dystopian + urban-based Philly certainly made it certainly worth my while + numerous hours with it.""

												Homefront The Revolution is a heavily flawed game.The first Homefront was a CoD copy and not even a good one. Homefront The Revolution plays like Far Cry 3 and 4 but without a great story or memorable missions. How to free the checkpoints is the only thing HTR does better than FC 3+4. In the Ubishooters you have to climb towers over and over again. In HTR you have to complete different objectives, like killing certain targets or hack a computer but here the developers made some mistakes too: One computer was hidden in a building and I found a different way to it. I could have easily jumped up and climbed through the window but was forced to take a different route to it. Funny that I could jump out of that window to get back on the streets. On another checkpoint I could have climbed over a fence but wasn't able to do so. I had to climb up on another building and jump on the rooftop. The modular weapon system may have been a great idea on the paper but the Crysis trilogy does it a lot better. In HTR it just takes too much time to switch the weapons and the enemies take way too much bullets even with the upgraded guns.The programmers said that you are no CoD hero but why do I still have to kill dozens of enemies per mission? Many of the main story missions didn't feel much different than your average CoD massmurdering. The story itself is also very weak: You play as a guy named Brady who doesn't speak and gets mixed up in the resistance where you are some sort of John Connor because you alone can do what dozens of other fighters can't and you have your Resistance buddies like the typical leader, the nice doctor and a female psycho. Oh and there is a traitor too! Surprise!What the game does get right however is the atmosphere. When you start in a yellow zone the people are depressed and the KPA shows up just everywhere. The more you liberate the zone the more the people will rise up and you can actually see it. First there are some people protesting and later on the start to kill the KPA and the whole zone atmosphere changes. But that is also the only cool thing about the game. The rest just feels mediocre and in the final mission you even have some heavy bugs. You have to escort two vehicles but they can get stuck. First time on some debris the second time on each other. Had to exit to the main menu to avoid the first bug and the second time when the car didn't continue and dozens of enemies spawned from nowhere I got killed but when I reloaded the checkpoint the car continued. Totally annoying! Overall this game is boring and repetitive and brings nothing new to the shooter genre. It copies heavily from other games but doesn't even get that right.So I really can't recommened this game.			"

												I have heard that this is the worst FPS, and that it sucks, and it is bad. I played it in the free weekend, and I got to say, that if you think this is the worst FPS, you frankly have not played many games. For me, this is above average. I really enjoyed the feeling of hopelessness, and the rebellion aspect. Im going to pick this up soon on the winter sale, but do not let mixed reviews deter you. It is better than you think.EDIT: Just recently bought it, and so far, it is really good. Is it the best game of all time? No. Is it the worst? No. Does it have great shooting, ideas, and gameplay? Yes it does. I say pick it up on a sale. This game is great at making you feel a part of a revolution and does guerilla warfare well, even though the AI is dumb at times. The game feels like Far Cry in an urban setting. The red zones all feel like something out of terminator with less robots. Also, some people say Norks is a dumb word. It actually was used in the Korean war when speaking about North Koreans, so the devs did their research, but most people do not know that. Pick it up if you like Far Cry but want a more atmospheric game and feel more like an underdog.			"

												I have no idea why people give this game a bad rep. I have played only the single player campaign and not touched the multiplayer. So far, I'm having a good time with this.Sure, it's a little rough on the edges, but every good game has it's quirks.The thing I like most in this game is the overall difficulty. This isn't some run of the mill FPS where you can run around and start gunning people down. You have to be careful and think what you do. Stealth is the key in many places and because this game runs like Far Cry in many ways, you have to loot bodies and stuff to get some valuables to sell. With money you can buy attachments to your weapons and better gear for your character, like kneepads that makes you faster while crouching and backpack that hold's more loot.Guns can be modified on the fly, just like in Crysis and that's really nice feature in this game.It runs on Cryengine so expect the same machine requirements.Overall, this isn't a bad game! Get it if you can from Steam sales or somewhere else. I could have bought this from the getgo if I would have knew this game is this fun to play.			"

To me, the map of the game is a little bad. Also, you are always doing the same or similar quests. So, you can get bored after a certain period of time. However, the game is in general nice. It is continuously updated. What do you want more?			"

The normal gameplay looks a bit like Dying Light; the way of running + there's a bit freerunning in it.

												After much debate I ended up getting this game. This was before the Patch Two. ( If you are reading this and are debating on playing, the games fps issues are very very smoothed out IMO and many bugs are fixed. On my end I have had ZERO bugs )So when I first got it I was plagued with the crazy fps issues. Blah blah the game rolls on and finally Patch 2 comes out. Amazing. For me, I have everything on very high besides shadows. With a sweetfx setting for ""DPX cinema"" only which really lifens the game up! 40-45 fps here for me with the very rare dip in heavy heavy combat.The game is pretty intense depedning how you play. I love it. Theres many ways to deal with enemies, scenarios or you can do hit and run guerilla tactics instead of the usal BAMBAMBAMBAM kill them all style. The cutscenes are SUPBERB, the environments are great. In my opinion the npcs are pretty repetitive in their day to day banter, I wish we could hear some more game lore and hear some tragedies or atrocities the Norks have commited. So.........Gameplay? epic.Visual? epic ( you will def need to play with them i youre on a medium end rig this game is gpu based)Story? Pretty good. People are very picky. The game needed some time to grow up, which it did and its very good. Definite reccomend			"

												Wasn't sure about buying this game, did research watched some gameplay video's and still wasn't sure.Then when I saw it onsale figured i'd take the gamble and it paid off.I really enjoyed this game and wished it lasted longer.Finished it in about 20 hours, it has online gameplay which I shall do a little bit.The setting is just lovely, the graphics are pretty good.Basicly America get's taken over by the Koreans.You are the resistance and you slowly build up more resistance and fight the invaders.You take over Area's this will give you points and money to buy weapons and what not.I like the storyline it's a good one that keeps on building up.Weapons are also nice and you can convert weapons to become other weapons, anywhere.Per example the Assault Rifle can be transformed into a 'noobtube' and into a LMG and all those weapons can have different scopes and other little changes. It's a really nice set up.So yeah I recommend this game, it's great and I'm hoping for Homefront The Revolution 2.Don't buy the DLC's from what I can tell those aren't worth it and the game has minor bugs, reload checkpoint if ever.

												Well im only four hours in, but cannot see the hate for this game - Its like a dirty farcry 3/4 - gunplay is great; loads of small skirmishes to engage in; its got a large open map; campaign seems a long length; loads of small side missions which give you this games equivalent of XP so you can upgrade weapons etc; graphics are supurb, though with my 290x, Iv had to go to medium to enable smooth framerates, but still looks great.I can see the gameplay mechanics possibly getting a bit samey throughout the campaign,  but at present Im thoroughly enjoying this - A+++++++++Update 31/12/16 - well im 22 hours in now and am pretty far through the single player - have got loads of side missions untouched, so plenty of playability yet. Am still thoroughly enjoying this game - still cant believe the hate this has been getting - gunplay is wonderful as far as im concerned - story line - yeah its ok, but its the firefights that win me over every time - A++++++++++ - its also on the Steam sale at the mo for £8.99 - unbelieveable value if you ask me - go get it !!!!!!!!

												My first review ever. I really want to love this game but my experiences with this game sounds more like a love/hate relationship. I love this game for its setting, its politics, and the designs are welldone. But then I hated this game to the core due to it's not optimize well enough to run. Hence I had to play in the lowest setting while suffer lags. Basically you're a resistance fighter who had an entire arsenal of weapon that you could carry. The game now felt more like COD and less survival-ish. I have never had trouble fighting the ""losing war"" that the game promised us. You can carry weapon bigger than your arm, sometimes 2 of them and you can 'hide' it under your coat, no problem. So yes it felt like an action game. More like a copy of the Far Cry series starting from FC3. You run around, doing side missions, capturing bases and do core missions, then repeat the same process again. That is something Farcry games did well to hide its core gameplay from you so every time you repeat the same process, it feels like new. However that is not in this game, this game tried its hardest to remind you that you're doing the samething over and over again until you come out a mad man.This game has upgrades for everything, every single guns has upgrade, every single gadget has upgrade. But you'll max all of them out midgame, leaving all the side mission which give you weaponry point irrelevant. Unless I'm missing something here, then all of my extra weapon point which count up to a hundred are useless. The game has no skill tree so I guess those weapon points are just there for show. You can customize your weapon on the go which is really good but that's the only feature that make this game standout the most.You can play this game stealthy or just go loud. You can recruit resistance member and run freely on the street in broad daylight, because that's what all the guerrillas do. You can hide in trashcan so the enemy won't see you, at least in earlier missions. This feature haven't been spotted after midgame. You can incite a revolution by sabotaging the enemy's equipment and resources, but then capturing bases increase the revolution mechanic greatly so you dont really need to sabotage anything since it's just there. The enemy is strong no matter how many sabotage/assassination mission you do. Oh and missions doesn't reward you much. Ammunition is available everywhere, you'll never run out of ammo at all. The enemy will never raid against you unless it's a mission. Some missions are tedious and if you have no time to play the game, you can run around the area like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ walrus looking for items for like half an hour and still clueless on what to do. Same enemy for most of the time you spent on playing. You'll encounter almost all of them after the first map which was 10% of the game. North Korean doesn't believe in tanks. Their helicopters doesn't shoot you, and their airship's main function was to sweep the area and alert their troops to get you instead of raining down fire and make the game more interesting. You can hack various North Korean equipments, but realistically in this game you only hack their cute petite robotic tank 100% of the time. Due to the futuristic theme, some of the North Korean soldier are equip with a teleportation device, sometimes they will spawn right behind you, or right on your left. Just enter scoping mode and turn right, one of them might end you on the spot. Would be cool it they show some airdrop animation from the airship instead of soldier appearing from random corners. North Korean also teleport to area where you already cleared, but that's all strategy. Story wise. You know nothing about North Korea, just as in real life. But then you don't know much about the American government either. All you know are diaries, and a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥shouting revolution all the time. And indeed that's all they do, they run around shouting revolution, shooting everyone on the street, there was no armbush nor tactical planning. It's all run and gun out there. But I guess the revolution was going strong in this game....civilian NPC doesn't thank you for fighting for them. All they do is ""oh not the resistance again...get out of my hood...I'm tired of this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; Which make you think you might as well join the North Korean, at least they feed you and keep peace when they invaded. They don't kill people outright, they allow you to have a job, and they only treat rebel inhumanely. Most of their soldiers are ordered not to kill civilian and only arrest them. Basically they'll only fight when they got attacked. It felt like the resistance is doing more harm than good. You don't see any improvement on the people's life after you liberate them. They all hang out in the slum and do what they do while living under North Korea anyway. They had the same gloomy face, and they doesn't seem to cheer up much. May be they misses the North Korean's aid but who knows? [Edited add on] I forgot to mention Multiplayers. Multiplayer have a skill tree which will improve your multiplayer experiences except for the fact that in single player you already have 80% of those skills at the start of the game. So the 20% of the remaining skill MP sounds really good. MP is mission based instead of co-op which you and your friends fight against the North Korean. It's no where as good as the MP in the first Homefront which pvp existed. Other than that, one of the reason I forgot to review the Mutiplayer section is because there are no MP in this game. MP player base is dead beside a few group of random people play together on weekend. Hence MP is just you starting a mission on your own 100% of the time (in my experience) This game used to have a system similar to Overwatch where you can buy crates of upgrades/weapon parts, etc but since the developer found out the MP player base is too stronk for business, the only way for you to get it is through in-game currency.Would love to see the next game more polished. But part of me think it's not the dev but the dreaded money man who forced them to push the game before it was finished. I do love this game as a generic mindless shooter game. And I do recommend it to other mindless generic gamers.			"

												Homefront the Revolution is a post apocalyptic game set in the realms of philadelphia attempting to tell the story of survival and rebelion under a ruthless and oppressive enemy or so you would think. The story is very lackluster with no real sense of making a diffrence to the people who inhabit the game world, there is zero emotion to be felt with Homefront the Revolution which is a shame as again another AAA game chooses a real possible scenario as the backdrop to there game but it carries no weight in terms of emotion or caring for the person (character) next to you. The story or main campaign is easily one of the most forgettable stories i have played the only thing i remember is getting frustrated with the hearts and minds parts of the game which is very tedious and repetitive. Combat in Homefront the Revolution is very unsatisfying the game is an FPS game but has none of the fundementals of an FPS game FoV is limited to 65 i would like at the very least 90 there is no dual sensitivity for hipfire and aimed fire. There is a few bugs in the game and a lot of cut corners. You cant even freeroam after the main story is complete so if you missed things in the game like side quests you have to start the game again.There is a co-op section in the game which was fun for a little bit but what i dont understand is why for a couple of  co-op missions there is so much in terms of character customization and weapons when there is no multiplayer, there is certain attachments for weapons like the suppresor for your assault rifle which you can only use on your assault rifle in co-op mode and not in the main game. There is a lot of cons with this game and not enough pros to justify giving it a positive review which is unfortunate as it could of been such a great game that i could of been quite happy to sink alot of hours into but after 14 hours the main story is complete and so are the co-op missions and there is no desire to go back and play it again so as it stands its an over priced ballon that quickly deflates and i wouldnt recommend this game and would suggest either waiting for a sale or investing in another game. So sadly its a thumbs down for this one.			"

												This game is a little bit of Far Cry and a little bit of...well it's a lot like Far Cry. Based on that if you like/love Far Cry then you'll enjoy this game. I've played two hours and so far have had a blast freeing civilians, taking down enemy positions and upgrading my weapons.You can choose to sneak or blast your way through most enemy encampments which is nice and depending on which weapons you buy either of those can be done much easier. The protagonist is silent but honestly I don't mind it, Gordon Freeman and Doom Guy don't talk so now I can put my own thoughts in the characters head.Running on a GTX 980 with an Intel i7 and 16 Gigs of RAM = No problems with loading anything, game runs fine.

At the very least, the Modern Warfare games felt like playing through some bombastic Michael Bay flick, this game feels like I'm playing through a film that Zack Snyder directed after he got stoned, played Half Life 2, watched Red Dawn, and decided: 'hey, i can make something like this'. The plot is stupidly over the top -- and the worst part is that it takes itself way too seriously to the point of pretension.Guys, Doom is out. The New Wolfenstein's been out. Buy those instead.And if you'd rather Call of Duty, just play whatever CoD you're playing now. It's probably better than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												With only a taste test so far; a little over an hour in the first Red Zone (Hot zone), I can tell I'll enjoy this regardless of story length.   Mainly as it uses mechanics from two of my favorite games (Far Cry 3/4 & Dying Light) in a Red Dawn/Revolution setting that's right up my alley.  Unless this game does a total 360 as I progress, I have no prob recommending to those who enjoy loot shooters at the normal price (39.99).   If it does flop as I progress I will definitely alter my recommendation.			"

												It's not the most interesting game, but I have to admit that I actually had fun with it during the free weekend they did. And once we got used to the coop, the boyfriend and I had quite a lot of fun in that actually.The weapon customization is actually pretty damn nice and the standout element of the gameplay. Swapping out different receivers for each weapon to make them do something different is actually really good. While technically only carrying three weapons, the pistol and two primary weapons, the alternate receivers are always available meaning you effectively have nine weapons at all times if you have all the receivers for each weapon. It's something I'd really love to see in a lot of other games.The open world is what you'd expect from the recent Far Cry titles, or any open world game from Ubisoft really. Clear out rather meaningless outpost/checkpoint style zones until you've filled up a meter. At least there is an actual change in the world, albeit minor, when you fill up that meter. People start appearing on the streets of the ""yellow zones"" protesting and fighting with the KPA, things are lit on fire, it at least feels like there is some response to your actions.Gunplay is fairly solid, some guns feel a little weightless and meager, but some really feel good to fire.Coop is the highlight of the whole game though. While set up just as preset missions set in the singleplayer maps, usually with restrictions on where you can go without completing certain objectives, it feels fun playing alongside others. As opposed to the singleplayer, you also have character customization in the form of picking various skills and wearable equipment to give you different passive perks and different cosmetics. I feel like the only downside is that I really wanted even more to do in the coop because it was genuinely that fun.For $15 it's definitely worth it, even for $20 though I'd say it's certainly worth it if you aren't opposed to the more typical Ubisoft style open world in the singleplayer.

												Get this game on sale! When you play this game you may feel like playing Metro 2033 (The first person animation and details) and dying light (The Free running and guiding carpets near safehouse and cache) as they are similar in some way.Probably because this game had developers from above games and many others.Pros:--Beautiful Open World-Guerilla Warfare-Bike to travel faster in the open world-Basic free running-Decent length of Story mode (I have 30 hours before the final mission and yet to play the DLCS)-Amazing first person animations and details-Crazy gun modifications and that too anytime and anywhere.-Graphics are amazing-A seperate Pve/Co-op Mission game mode to play with friends upto 4 ( Note: You can not not play Campaign in Co-op)-Co-op mode has lots of items to unlock and style your character-Better Hacking and RC car than Watch dogs 2! Cons:--You may experience bugs and crashes (Personally did not find any major game breaking bug just few animation bug once or twice)-Missions can get repetitive Runs smoothly on below specs on High Settings at a constant 60 Fpsi5 4670K 3.4 Ghz8 GB RAMGTX 970 Windows 10 "

												not a bad game, the gunplay is decent and everything feels like it has a kick to it like it should, not like the laser pointers we get in most fps the gadgets are decent especially the remote controlled cars with bombs, the graphics are good with a few bugs once in a while with the lighting but only happened twice in 3 and a half hours of play. I would really recommend this game if you enjoyed the past farcry games or the previous homefront game, this game is like farcry in a destroyed city but alittle bit less bullet spongey as you die faster so its good to recruit rebels to fight with you max 3 at a time, one thing I dont like alot is the motercycle driving which is completely impractical because of all the terrain obstacles that stop you from really going far, story is not amazing but serviceable and the characters are generic but I wouldnt play this for that anyways, would recommend if you can find it on sale for like 70% off as you should get your moneys worth from that. I should also note that I run it on maxed settings on my gtx 970 and 980m at 55-60 fps with v sync on, sometimes it dips to the high 40s on especially hectic moments but rarely.also if you plan on playing on different computers you have to manually move your save files as its not saved on the cloud7.5/10			"

												I have read may bad reviews for this game, but I enjoyed it very much.  I thought the story was interesting.  I like the setting and the feeling of having to avoid the guards, and play hide and seek.  I did hit a few things with the AI acting strange, but not enough to stop my enjoyment.  I will admit I only played the single player game, and doing the hearts and minds of each zone was the same, but the map made it somewhat interesting.  Maybe I'm just not picky enough.I thought it was well worth my 60 bucks, and I can only hope they do another one.  I didn't reinvint the wheel, but I didn't expect it to.  It's a good solid shooter, with a good enviroment.  I thought the graphics were good, and I liked the fact it made the zones easier the more you captured of it.  I felt part of the Revolution without making me some type of Superman.If you want a fun ride just enjoy the game, but it's not going to change your life or how you see FPSs.			"

												Call me a sucker, for expecting much more from this pile of sh..! If you like unfinished games, than this game is for you...-Really bad Optimization, almost all players experience FPS drops, and to be blunt this game doesn`t look really that pretty!-Chunky Controls, sometimes unresponsive, pretty hard to aim w/o the aim assist (and I`m never using this)-Horrible Lightning, Glitchy fire particles but man, does the shadows look bad and glitchy...awful.-Audio glitches, peeping the whole mission the hiddens stash, after I found and looted it, well it`s not my idea of a FUN! And there is no music at all - Just some ambient loop crap!-Repetitive Gameplay, not bad but nothing new. Side missions are really easy, playing on the hardest btw..There are at least 10 games with better gameplay.-Story sux hard! Pretty dumb, bad acting...audio mash-up from radio msg, ""main story"" and some random people deciding to speak some uninteresting bullcrap.It is really a shame, because I was expecting this game to be in my top Games this year.I`m still playing it thou, but we`ll see how much more I can endure this abbomination.

												Single player / Coop Game+ This game uses a bunch of game mechanics that we've seen before in other games, but it uses them well in an open world first person shooter. It's a fun single player experience with lots to do.+ It has a fun coop game mode that uses an rpg style character progression system. 10 coop missions (at date of review)- It's hard to find a random player for coop. Coop mode allows you to create a game and play by yourself but it won’t be open for other's to join. This creates a bunch of private games happening with everyone playing by themselves. "

Product received for free
												Ten minute intro scene is a bit much :DAfter that you get control, it plays a bit like an urban Far Cry, the Koreans have occupied the USA and you are part of the resistance.You get to ride a bike early on, with somewhat clunky controls, the FOV can't be made larger than 65° so you have a very limited vision as well.I wanted to make a first impression video like I do with all my games, but after I checked to see if it recorded well, the recording froze :/Wasted an hour of recording, and screw it, I'm not gonna try again.The game's not fun anyway. Also they need to use more character models, saw two resistance twins having a conversation, maybe they are supposed to be twins, but I doubt that, was pretty funny thoAt least it runs smooth on my GTX 1080 Skylake beast, no problems playing here, it does heat up my rig, that's usually how I can tell if a game is demanding, as they all run smooth loland there is still that recording issue of course.Anyway if you like to see some first impression vids of random steam games, check out my YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBJJtaPXEeCubP-2YPKk4g "

												So this game has been getting many many bad reviews because of its ""terrible frame rate"" and ""clunky gameplay"" maybe its just my computer but this game has FANTASTIC gameplay!! it feels so good to just walk! and to run and climb and shoot. the gunplay is a bit sluggish but that is more because the game is going for a more realistic take on gunplay. its not like call of duty. its not my favorite type of gunplay mechanics but for what it is its fantastic. Not to mention the amazing graphics, story, and how gosh darn likable ALL of the characters are! the characters are all great! even people you just see on the street. they all feel so real! it really gives the entire game a different feel than most shooters! also the world is massive! it feels so open and free even when youre running through crowded alleyways. the weapon customazation is also really neat! you can see your character take apart your pistol and install parts to turn it into an SMG right before your eyes! it really interesting!! so overall i say this game is GREAT. maybe the framrate is actually pretty crappy for a normal computer, my computer is an absolute monster so...well i freaking love this game. id definatly suggest giving it a try especially now that steam will let you refund games! id honestly give this game a solid 8/10. its pretty much all i expected and i am quite pleased with my perchase.

												Pros: Pretty decent story, awesome gun customization, cool exploration, and nice map layout.Cons: Shooting sucks especially aim assist it doesnt put the crosshair on the target more likely on the side of the target causeing you to miss shots, recruits are always in the way of your line of fire and you cannot give them orders to move to certain points. IF this game was to suppose to be tactical your recruits run all over the place making it hard to sneak or perform silent take downs. (note the cons are from a single player stand point.) I would recommend waiting till game has been patched up fixing some of thses issues otherwise prepare to be angry and put thumbs down, "

Worst weapon handling i´ve seen for a long time. All weapons feel the same. Lot´s of performence issues. Have i7 6700K, GTX 970 OC and 16 GB DDR4 RAM and guess what?

Yeah, glitches, bugs and getting stuck on everything in the world.Really hoped it would be good after the first trailers. But no!!! Don´t buy this game.			"

Posted: October 9, 2016
												Thanks to the developers at Dambusters and Publisher Deep Silver for providing a really fun new IP for me to enjoy and escape.As one of my most anticipated FPS games this year I never faltered even after a middling beta(I didn't play) and middling reviews(suckers buy games day one) I did my usual.I sat back relaxed and played other games while it received a few patches, updates and a price drop where I was comfortable and upon completion what different gaming universe do I live in? Homefront TR is part Dying Light, Fallout, The Division, Half-Life 2, and Far Cry and while it doesn't achieve greatness as some of those titles it does the next best thing, it provides a helluva lot of fun in both single player and surprising co op gameplay.Lets talk about performance since everyone today seems to go ballistic if there is a minor issue. During gameplay I had all options set to high including V-sync,playing at 2560x1080 and never had any frame rate(60+), crashes or game breaking issues. In game I did notice enemies would disappear in the distance on occasion and some minor sound outages but game play for the most part is fast and solid. I Also noticed if you downsized the game to the toolbar and brought it back up you would need to restart the game as it just seems to chug. Its an open world game where minor hic cups will exsist and if you dont know that by now stop playing them.Homefront begins with one of the most brutal opening seqences I can remember it's very disturbing and cringe worthy as are some of the melee kills and just scenes of violence. You are cast as the typical silent protagonist Ethan Brady who arrives to the front lines of the resistance for a meeting with their leader Benjamin Walker. Walker is captured during this meet and greet and this sets up the main story and thrusts you straight into the world of the revolution where North Korea(the Norks as they are called) has taken over the US due to unpaid gas bills. The story is split into 4 acts and it doesn't give a very good first impression but if you hang in there the voice work, mo cap and some moments have feeling but because you are mute with no opinion you just follow orders, whether right or wrong. HUGE problem for the story and huge mistake by the devs but overall its not bad.While the game bills itself as open world its really divided into three zones. The green and yellow  zones are the heart of the enemy and where they are they strongest. The environments are clean and is militarized with constant enemy patrols. This is also where most of the regular population resides and these patrols, scanners, cameras and drones have a constant presence and stealth is required. The red zone is more chaotic, open and war torn. The buildings are bombed out, roads are an obstacle course of carnage and the resistance actually has a small advantage if any. This is where you can freely roam with a gun in the open, easily recruit resistance members to help with missions and you will also be given the ability to use a motorcycle to get around. Breaking these areas up into these zones keeps gameplay from being stagnant and was a great decision by the devs. In these zones you will be given the usual main or side open world missions which involve sabotage, reconnaissance, retrieval, investigation, etc. All are familiar but depending on the objective and zone there are a lot of ways to approach each mission and end goal. This approach is highlighted by outstanding level(world) design and the tools at your disposal. One additional task you will be given in each zone is to make the people 'rise up' or as its called in game win ""hearts and minds"". This is mandatory as some missions and zones will stay locked until you reach 100% resistance for that particular zone. Increasing resistance can be accomplished by turning on radios know as the voice of freedom, completing flash missions, liberating strategic sites, saving civilians, assassinating targets, or just blowing stuff up. I can't tell you how awesome this feature is especially as the resistance grows NPCs begin to act different, say different things and it truly feels you are impacting the world and that's pretty cool a definite highlight for the game. One thing absolutely clear at the start is you are underpowered and its highlighted with limited weapons, gadgets and amount of damage you absorb before falling. It makes sense the resistance is underpowered and the weapons and guerrilla tool kits(GTK) have a unique home made feel which is another cool highlight. However, being able to purchase GTKs and scarce resources at the store is sort of confusing.  Every weapon you purchase except the RPG can be converted into 3 weapons and all have different attachments. The animations for the weapon conversions are cool and the weapons themselves are solid, a lot of fun and in some cases a little too good(hello auto matic shotgun). There are also 4 GTks you can equip at all times that include hacking, molotovs, pipe bombs, and firecracker. All of these base GTKs can be converted and then used as a remote(use smart phone to detonate), proximity(land mine), or driven on on an RC car and detonated. As you explore the world you  will also be scrounging parts or finding hidden stashes to build gadgets and a reason being able to purchase them at the store is a mistake. As for the world of Homefront its beautiful though it doesn't look like a  Cryengine game in some aspects. Graphically it doesnt compare to the likes of The Diviions but it equals it with its attention to detail. Every room, alley, street, tunnel, and bombed out building all look unique it's really impressive and it makes exploring so much fun. Character models on the other hand look impressive as do animations and mo cap. The absolute biggest suprise in Homefront are the co op missions. A co op vetern with my friend Silver(15+ co op adventures) we absolutely loved this mode. There are 10 missions(2-4 players) that are mulit mission based and avg. about 15-25 minutes each. As it was in single player you begin bare bones and are very vulnerable at the start so a little grinding is necesary. The level cap is only 6 and money(at various prices) is then used to unlock chests which give you armor, consumbles, guns, attachments. As you gain XP and DNA you can then spend them in 4 skill trees labeled Brains, Brawn, fighter, Survivor. None of the trees differentiate themselves and once you have maxed your charcter and skills you are unable to respec those points. All that said its fanatstic co op fun and challenging. Homefront is a pretty ambitious game that has been through the ringer of development and unfortunately due to bad release it has been killed by the casual reviewers polluting the industry. Dambusters did not waiver and have continued to provide patches, updates and support. I like the game its not perfect and maybe it was too big for this small team but its provided dozens of hours of fun and that's all I ever ask out of a game. I played the game with m/kb 2560x1080 High setting on Deathwish difficultyPositivesGreat Atmosphere world feels lived inSolid 60FPS performance 1080P(2560x1080) high settingsFun gameplay all aroundGreat level design. Multiple paths offer choice on how to approach objectivesMo cap and acting is pretty good, story is okHearts and Minds and watching change is unique and awesomeWeapons and GTKs are a lot of fun to useSuprising and addicting mission based co op NegativesSlow start does not give a good first impression Enemy and variety is very lacking. Also I hated more of my comrades than any of the NKsPoor sound and graphic optimizationCan't use phone/map while on motorcycleYou are a mute with no opinionBeing able to purchase GTKs and resources at the store makes no senseA few bugs and obvious game would have benefited with another 6-12 months of development "

												This game seems to be a bit of a mixed bag for a lot of people.I personally love this game though... would strongly recommend if you like any of the Crysis games' gameplay/graphics.The only downside I have with this game is the optimization, which, quite honestly, isn't all that good...I can run nearly all the latest games on Ultra @60fps so my PC isn't the issue here. I tinkered with The Revolution's graphical settings a bit and finally found the optimal one which stays at @60fps 95% of the time, which is great! Didn't even have to go all the way to Low settings, fortunately... but then again, I shouldn't have to do that when my PC has the power to run it at Ultra quite easily. I will list some of the pros and cons below (That I think make the game good and bad)PROS:- Good gameplay/combat-Beautiful and immersive environments-Awesome weapon customization (about customization in cons)-Cool concept for a game-Day and night cycle-Lots of free-roam content---------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-Bad/stupid enemy AI-repetitive sidequests-Bad optimization (I hope they'll release more stabilizing patches)-Lack of weapon customization parts-The game could use more weapons overall.-Re-appering character models w/ body parts switched----------------------------------------------------------------------If this review helps you, leave it a thumbs up.

I've sunk a lot of hours into this game this weekend and feel I have enough experience in it to make a judgement on the game.If you played the first Homefront, there's not much in common here other than it's the rag-tag US vs. THEM gameplay from the first. But the first game may as well not even existed because nothing from the first story carried over. Maybe the name of the ""main"" leader you are trying to rescue, but that's about it.Simply put, this is a first-person shooter where you are an American rebel fighting a guerilla war against an occupying Korean Military force. That's about all the ""story"" you get.You get thrown into the fray pretty quickly without hardly any hand-holding. This can be a good thing for mechanics that anyone familiar with playing a fps should be used to, but the game needs to have a much deeper tutorial on the aspects of the game that are different from the generic shooter. The game is severaly lacking in telling you how to use the map correctly, which ""opprotunities"" are more important than others, and explaining why you can't modify your weapon into the cooler choices or why so many of the upgrade choices are greyed out and not even attainable until you are halfway through the game and have meet a certain story mark (ie scripted section).I learned that I could recruit AI rebels to assist me, but they do much more harm than good.First of all, you can't give them any commands what-so-ever and secondly they do nothing but get in %$&@#*(%! way. I have died several times because AI GI-Joe would push me out of cover as they stole my position. They also will lock you in behind objects, walls and doorays and the only way I could get the idiots to move out of my way was to kill them or sometimes disbanding them. Since you have no control over them, you don't get to choose who they shoot at or when. Trying to sneak up on the an enemy base with them is pointless because they start shooting (very badly I might add) at the first bad guy they spot 2000 yards away. Even that is pointless because for some reason the enemy they shoot at become super bullet sponges that seem to take round after round from my AI guys but they can take my guys out in 2 shots. They don't use cover, except to push me out of mine, they don't use tactics, unless you consider running out in the open past multiple cover spots, screaming patriotic♥♥♥♥♥♥and firing (and missing) at a group of enemy AI that outnumber them 10 to 1 and getting killed. Not only are they ineffective, but their actions cause the enemy to pursue me all over the map because the idiot rebel AI doesn't understand when it is losing. They never retreat, which is odd because the enemy AI will use retreating and flanking actions when they come under fire.The game is also very brutal with the deaths. 2 to 3 shots and you are dead. This would be fine and great if the game modeled everything else related to infantry combat realisticly, but in this case the 2 to 3 hits and your dead is just annoying. When you die you spawn at the nearest friendly area, loose all valuables you picked up and any work you may have put in.(I guess none of your valuable ""recruits"" would have thought to retrieve and of your things). Say you wiped out 25 guys and a couple drone machines and got killed with one half-shot up bad guy left... You run back to the area not more than 10 seconds later and everything is ""restocked"" with full enemies. Oh, and back to ""your"" friendlies, they don't offer medical help, they don't offer ammo, they don't engage anyone killing you, they just go off in Rambo mode in their own little world and just do their thing.Story wise the game is just boring and so cliched it hurts. You become like a God to the rebels just for pulling off a few missions. I seriously heard a brain dead AI female rebel gushing over with her friend as if I smiled at her or not. These are supposed to be hardened rebels who have been at war and endured a hard♥♥♥♥♥life for some time now, not a bunch of teenage pop-star fans who get starry-eyed at the new guy who completed one mission successfully. It just feels fake and overly pandering to the player.I can't put my finger on what feels so wrong with the actual mechanics of the shooting gameplay, but it just feels weak. Weapons feel like BB guns, killing a bad guy just feels really ho-hum and nothing you do seems to matter because you have ""HQ"" screaming in your ear ever 5 damn seconds to go support this AI group or that AI group. How about letting me concentrate on my actual objective you said was so darn important instead of sending 10 miles in the opposite direction to secure a pointless magazine of bullets? So 25 innocent people dying from a bombing is less important than 30 rounds of ammo some idiot left behind? According to AI/HQ and their ""Strike mission"" mentality, yes. Early on I believed them and would hustle to the area where the AI was supposedly getting run over and people would just be hanging out talking about the latest gossip. Then once I would get within a ""trigger"" area, suddenly the bad guys would show up. So it's all scripted BS made to feel like it's dynamic.Oh, here is another nag. You are given a phone. On said phone is a mission roster, a map, a camera and a thing I call the ""beeping annoyance from hell"". You are given the minimal instruction on the functions, not anything about the camera. The camera is sopposed to automagically identify bad guys, and you are supposed to be able to take pictures I assume to send to HQ. Not once have I been instructed or told what the camera does, or how to get the photos to actually do anything. I did take a ""job"" offer posted on a bulletin board that said I needed to take photos of an enemy convoy.No waypoints, no idea where said convoy might be. I ran all over the place for a solid hour looking for this supposed convoy... Never found it (Yes I checked the map). So, I thought maybe if I sneak up on an enemy base and take some photos that will help HQ? Hahahaa. Apparently the camera function only works for very scripted missions. Since I took the job ""too early"" in the game, the convoys were showing up yet so I couldn't complete the job anyway. And the beeping transponder? It's supposed to show you where a cache of supplies are, but several times I would get to said cache, and take as much stuff as I could, but either through a glitch or poor implementation, if I didn't pick-up every single cache item there was, the transponder would keep beeping every few seconds and not ""clear"" that I had gotten to said cache. A few times I would find a ""journal"", basicalyl a wall of text that shows up on your magic phone, and that would clear the transponder, but at least twice I went to a cache and there was no ""journal"" to pick-up so the darn thing would never shut-up or clear the location.TL:DR Game is a scripted pile of crap that pretends to be dynamically played out. An 8-year old can see through the fake scripting in 15 minutes. Your AI are an annoyance who do not help, actually they do more damage than good, and have the emotional maturity of a teenage pop-star idol girl.I give this game a 5 out of 10. A big fat ""Meh""It's been awhile since a games broken mechnics have actually made me mad.Well done Homefront, you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off pretty good.			"

												I liked the earlier Homefront and was semi hyped for this game. The game fell a bit short and is just average, not anything special. I hope they fix some stuff in the game just for their pride, it's not going to make this game good even if would have no bugs at all.Plus points:+The shooting mechanics are decent/okay+Gun customization is nice+The single player length is 10+ hours+Possibly more to play in multiplayer/co-op+At the hardest difficulty the AI offers a decent challengeMinus points:-Graphics-Dull story-Bad vehicle (bike) mechanics-Bad performance-Lots of bugs on release-The final mission is really buggy, takes many tries to complete just because X's are getting stuck. (X= would be considered as a spoiler)-throughout the game they have used the exact same mechanic for hacking, no increasing challenge-The health mechanic are kinda stupid: firstly you take no damage at all and then you just lose 95% of it by one shot of enemy sniper			"

												-The gunplay doesn't feel good and is not accurate. I ended up hip shooting most of the time instead of aiming down the ironsights because it is to hard to hit anyone. It does make the game hard and frustrating. The stealth part of the gameplay is annoying since the AI have super good vision and spot you most of the time but doing a stealth kill takedown can be fun. Driving the motorcycle is hard to control and gets caught on the terrain in a matter of seconds. I ended up running on foot most of the time because of it. The story is very boring and not interesting. The voice acting is terrible and the AI isn't smart. Overall it feels really repetitive and generic. They should of made the game linear like the first Homefront instead of open world. It would be better off that way instead of fetching for things going back and forth which gets old really quick. They could of focused more on the gameplay and story that way.			"

												After playing through the campaign in Homefront: The Revolution in its entirety, DLC and all, I have to say that it was honestly one of the best things I've spent 10$ on. It certainly has flaws in its gameplay and graphics, but none that deter me from reviewing it positively. Only small bugs and glitches here and there. I havent played through Resistance Mode very much, but it seems to be promising with its customization features and co-op scenarios. I know this port went through a terrible release, but it seems they've patched it up very nicely, and I'd certainly recommend this at the 10$ price tag, and venture that it'd be worth it still at 15-20$ Story 8/10Gameplay 7/10Replayability 7/10 (Resistance Mode mostly)Graphics 8/10 Overall 7.5/10 "

												Ok so this is actually a pretty good game.It's definitely overpriced at 40$. I got it on sale for 12$. I'd say i would def. pay 20$ for it.I think the marketing for the game was somewhat poor since it's actually pretty good. It plays a lot of Far Cry 3 and Red Faction: Guerrila but it's non-open world. Rather you have multiple hubs you get to explore, scavange supplies and pick off ""Norcs"" (North Korean Military). Collect supplies. Hack relays. Shoot Norcs. Unlock upgrades. Unlock safehouses. Progress through Story (which they made into alt-history reaching as far back as the 1970s.) So far so good! Definitely recommend if you like Far Cry and Red Faction style gameplay with a Deus Ex-like environment hubs.			"

												Thank you Deep Silver and Dambuster for the free weekend. Unfortunately, this game is not very good. Ostensibly a mix of Far Cry, Stalker and Freedom Fighters, it soon reveals itself to be a mere Crysis-alike with a gimmick. The weapon customization menu probably gave that away to some of you.The story is very predictable and at times comically vile. And it's absolutely terrible! There's no reason to play Homefront: The Revolution for the story, its perfunctory rah-rah patriot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t doesn't even compare favorably to the Call of Duty garbage of a few years back. But does it at least play well? Eh... not really.The gunplay and movement is typical for CryEngine - that is to say not very good. Even smooth 60+ fps can't hide the weird player movement and unsatisfying gun action. The novel weapons aren't really fun to use, which is an absolute bummer. Painting the map blue by liberating outposts and strongholds also loses its draw after the first map. The concept of Yellow Zones is interesting on the surface, but completely wasted in practice. Sprinting past guards takes care of every problem. The world just doesn't feel believable or internally consistent.Homefront certainly isn't a terrible game, but with the amount of quality games available today, why play a thoroughly mediocre one?

												I've really enjoyed this game.  I was looking for a fun FPS to play and it delivered.  Sure the story could be a bit better and the gameplay got somewhat repetitive closer to the end, but overall, I loved it! I would love to see DLC content from the Homefront team. So many negative reviews of this game made me reluctant to get it in the beginning.  I'm glad I finally did.  I can see myself playing this again on a harder difficulty level.  I just wish the stealth was more developed.			"

												Homefront was a pretty standard FPS game. It did not invent anything new or did any wonders storywise. But it showed potential that could spawn a good series. It was smooth, short and bereft of bugs.Homefront the Revolution is a sub par shooter which tries to follow in Homefront's steps but fails miserably. It sports an open world which is just a bunch of large areas tagged together. The story is standard run of the mill affair and there is a new and kind of fun gun customization on the run.It would have been received somewhat better if it launched with far fewer bugs. It is an average game which is hidden behind a plethora of crashing, screen freezes, excessive lag and loads of bugs. On top of that it sports a season pass while trying to imitate other AAA titles.Please stay clear of Homefront: The Revolution as in its current situation, it's not worth the asking price.			"

												Once again, people are disrespecting a perfectly good game, for no good reason. If you like the Farcry style of FPS games, you will like Homefront: The Revolution just fine.In fact, I found it easier to immerse myself into because it is grittier, more ""realistic"" in terms of weapons, environment, styles and AI.  The phone and menu navigation is a little unwieldy, but that just adds to the realism of trying to juggle a rifle and a phone.I've not had an experience like this since FarCry 2 and I am really enjoying it.This has been on my list since it came out, but I hesitated, wanting to give time for bugs to be worked out.  But I meant to get it before now.So when Steam offered a free weekend of play, I couldn't pass. I bought it after only a few hours of play.Deep Silver has made some of my all time favorite games and they always get preferential treatment so I will make a gift of this game to a couple of friends to show my support.

												Let me preface this by saying I do not think this game is bad. Homefront: The Revolution has a good foundation, and with great potential in my opinion, but almost nothing is built on it in the end. This game is an open-world FPS title that has you play as Ethan Brady, a fresh recruit for the Resistance, fight against the KPA who hold control of Philadelphia. This game however never takes full advantage of its alternate history setting and the fact that it is an open world game. Retaking the city is pretty lackluster and repetitive. You can expect to be doing the same thing for one Zone for most of the others. You do Main missions, raise the ""Hearts & Minds"" percentage to 100%, do another mission to win the zone, then repeat.I can forgive that if the rest of the game had something else to makes it stand out, but besides the weapon conversions (which are interesting, but ultimately clunky), this game has no such thing. The story is very weak, shallow, and fails to make me empathize with the Resistance. Characters lack depth and act predictably throughout the story. And while gunplay is decent, your arsenal is small and what you play with from the first zone is likely what you'll use for the rest of the game.The final nail in the coffin for me though was how unrewarding all of it was. Most everything outside of main missions and set activities does almost nothing at all. If you killed a platoon of KPA troops nothing is gained. If you decide to capture all strongholds in a zone you only have Tech Points for changing existing weapons. All you can do is earn money, do the same activities, and finish missions. That's all the game really wants you to do.The game can have it's moments due to the fact how you tackle each task is left for you to decide, but it's really not enough for the asking priceof $40. The game overall feels incredibly average and sometimes even below average later on in the story. Even if it's on sale I would consider looking elsewhere.Tl;Dr - Overwhelmingly average Open-world FPS with missed potential. Not worth the price unless on (a very good) sale.			"

No. Maybe in a weak sales-moment...-------------Don´t buy this now!The performance is hell and graphic settings don´t make a difference. (i5 2500k, GTX 970, 8GB)Savegames are easily corrupted. So you are able to play again and again.The game crashes after ~15 min of gameplay when saving after a cutscene (Mission ""Welcome to the resistance"") You are able to fix this by creating a new user in windows. The username must not have any chraracters otherthen a-z. (e.g. â ê ö ü will crash the game when saving). And don´t think of ""starting as user""...wont´t work.I spend more time on installation, patching and crashing then on playing.Wait for the next patch. Or the next two, three or four....			"

												I was happy to see Homefront 2 coming out. Happy enough to pre-order (which I don't usually do). It had an interesting setting, story was so-so and over acted (so was the original Homefront -- it was to be expected). But the more I played this game, the excitement diminished more and more and frustration took its place. It wasn't frustrating because it was difficult or challenging. No, it was frustrating because there were so many stupid things to deal with. Either bad design, random puzzle mechanics (especially those where the mechanics were not properly introduced or apparent), ugly dev shortcuts (patrols randomly popping into view?), and bugs. As another reviewer stated, you could start seeing the “cracks” appear. The story, the acting, that all would've been forgiveable. But the engine was ridiculous. I understand the issues with development and changing hands and all that, but when you take a game and patch it only to make it worse, you really have to question what is going on. Some of those changes were not even needed, yet the developers messed with them and screw it up even more. I recorded my playthrough and put it on YouTube, but by the end of the series, I was basically muttering “this is so stupid” the entire time. The multiplayer is okay, but not worth the hassles you have to go through to paly it. If you can actually find a game, you have to hope that you’re a decent enough player to not fail the mission for your team. And of course, you have to hope that you get decent teammates. It’s not bad if you have to exit a game because of those issues, but it takes forever to find enough players for a game you could spend your entire ‘gaming time’ allotment sitting there waiting. the multiplayer is nothing like the original Homefront. And on that note, the guns/shooting/etc feels nothing like the original Homefront. Those had some good feeling to it, but Homefront 2... man...Summary: Do not buy it at full price (terrible mistake on my part). Buy it at around $5.99 USD (okay, maybe $8.99) for some fun that you can jump out of when it gets tedious. Or better yet, watch it on YouTube.			"

												First thing I'm going set in the books is, if you enjoy the HomeFront story line from the start I highly recommend this.The game is base off another char and a new chaper, yes you do run into main char from the first HomeFront (Not say how or what happens)Pro:Very good story line - picks up just as great from the First Homefront, but this one seem alot more clean (Grahpics / Engine / Less bugs)Very good story line from char that you interact with as well the one you play.Con:1)Ai even though I was playing on hard seem little to good with aim. As I ran I would randomly get picked off with head shot (Health dropping from full to dead.) With all gear / armor unlocked2)Another Ai bug I notice bad guys would spawn really weirdly - They would either spawn behind you or even right in front of you. (annoying cause they randomly get headshot)3) Notice things would spawn and despawn very fast in the open world. Like side quest or events, I would see something I can interact with... I would approch it running and hiding within a car look around and the event is gone this happen alotBut I know nothing is perfect still loved the game!! Going play it again just to do all of the side stuff on higher settings			"

												I've only just played the main campaign without the DLCs, and I would say it is a good game. The changeable weapon idea was real creative. The story is good I guess, not as breathtaking as some other games but it is not bad at all, I certainly enjoyed it. All in all I would give it 7.5/10. You have a good foundation here, just make sure the next sequel is going to be a real gem thats gonna wow all of us.			"

												I had a good time with it. You're looking at around 20 hours give or take worth of content if you're willing to deal with frustrating ai and doing the same objective over and over again. To be fair, it gives you a lot of ways to takle objectives, which i loved. In one part i had to release a prisoner with 2 heavies and a armored convoy nearby. I set up remote decoys ahead of time and approached from a different direction. When the convoy passed i remotely activated the decoys, rushed in and hacked the panels to let the prisoner out, only to have to fight my way out and run. If this game gets something right is the feeling of being chased. In an actual scale of 1 - 10 where anything lower than 7 is♥♥♥♥♥♥i would give this a 6/10. Super fun.			"

												So far I'm pretty happy with my purchase of this. I enjoy it more than the typical Far Cry / UBI formula of taking over territory. It's strength for me is definitely the atmosphere, the feeling of being part of a movement, and the way the city responds to your progress of winning the hearts and minds of the people.As far as the action goes, it is a pretty typical shooter - which isn't to say bad, but that part is nothing special. I'm enjoying the story even though it is pretty far fetched.My biggest complaint is how easy it is to just run though the enemies. It's not difficult to cause your mayhem and then just run like crazy to get away. It also seems like the enemy just materializes out of nowhere at times.			"

												Played through the entire game over the Free Weekend, and unfortunately it's just not that good of a game. It doesn't have anything that really makes it stand out or makes up for the number of crashes and other bugs it has.I think the developers honestly tried, but it just didn't work out. Although, when I say developers, I mean everyone except the writers. The plot is subpar at absolute best, and straight up stupid at several points.Overall, you never really feel involved in the revolution, combined with bugs and rather average gameplay, it all just falls apart. Maybe pick it up if it's 5-10 USD.			"

The only thing diffrent would be that this game was ok. Doesnt really do anything special so it kinda feels like a knockoff farcry but farcry was fun and so is this. So i would say is to wait for a sale and buy it and see for yourself.			"

												Played this game during the free weekend, and I made through the whole main story in 24 hours. I'm not saying it's bad but it's also not good, just mediocre. The story is predictable and repetitive in several ways, the enemies are just a bunch of idiots running around, and there seems to be some kind of a weird bug that sometimes make some NPCs disappear into thin air. At least I didn't put 60 bucks into this game went it first launched.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Far Cry series. If you are too, then this game is for you. It has a few issues here and there but nothing major. Nothing game breaking. The game gets tense when you are being chased in the red zone on low health, whilst trying to find somewhere to hide. The game is not 10/10 but it is good enough that you will enjoy it immensly if you enjoyed Far cry. Get it on sale if you must. Such a shame it had a very dodgy laynch. Patch 2.0 fixed it all apprently and I have not seen anything game breaking.The multiplayer is fantastic. Objective-based Co-Op missions. Nothing addictive mind you, but good enough to jump into every now and then.			"

												Picked this up in the recent sale, and for $12, a great deal. Probably a pretty good deal up to $30. I have only played the base SP campaign so far, so that's what this is based on.It's a fun shooter with okay writing and excellent world building. While it's nothing new, it's pretty convincingly portrayed, and it's easy to rally behind the cause as you liberate Philadephia from the 'Norks'. (Despite the enemy being drawn from real life, it's also relatively free of jingoism. Unless you speak Korean, it's easy to imagine them as any faceless invader you like.)While it's not exactly an open world - each area is a walled off zone, so it's not totally free roam - there's plenty to explore. There's a nice alternation between heavy action and light stealth too, which breaks up the pace nicely.My only quibble? I have no idea why, when he's clearly identified as a male, there's no voice for the main character. Maybe he's a literal mute. Groundbreaking stuff. ;)			"

												This game got a really bad rap on release, that is not in any way deserved. The graphics and artstyle are topnotch, the combat mechanics and parkour movements highly enjoyable, the missions get better and better as the story progresses, and the environmental scenery gradually changes as you 'free' sections of town in a way reminiscent of The Saboteur.The plot, with it's nationalist undertones, should be embraced by the player, not rejected: Just retain a meta-view and self-awareness that Spec Ops: The Line attempted to instill. Just look at the current situation, with both Kim and Whatshisname in the WH on both sides threatening and posturing, both using the publicity as a distraction.I can also recommend the Voice of Freedom DLC, as it provides a brief prequel to the opening scene of the main game.

												An urban warfare variation of the Far Cry formula with a better level design, but overall more clunky.Pros:- Good level design, especially some environmental puzzles in some of the strike points (think towers in Far Cry). They get better as you progress in the game. My favourite one: Hospital where you have to find medical supplies before unlocking the point.- The city is a much better environment for the Far Cry formula than a jungle or mountains, in my opinion. In Far Cry I found the travelling between bases and towers boring, here it's fun and you have to be wary of your surroundings all the time.- Vaulting over obstacles and mantling on higher platforms is used naturally everywhere- The writing in the later parts of the game- Voice acting- Diverse environments. From rich villas to gassed and desolate industrial zonesCons:- The shooting is not very satisfying and some weapons behave strangely. A fully upgraded silenced SMG has more recoil than a LMG, for example- Rudimentary stealth with few options. Stealth is required as in some maps if you raise an alarm, the game spawns soldiers infinitely, unless you hide. But the tools you have at your disposal are lacking.- The movement system (vaulting, mantling) is quite slow, the PC feels like an elephant. Fast movement feels more fluid, see Dishonored or Titanfall- Writing in the earlier parts of the game is cliched and quite bad. I feel it gets better in later parts, where the situation is more desperate.- Some bugs (wrongly placed objects, levitating NPCs, even a show-stopping bug in the main quest, that was luckily solved by reloading)Overall I recommend the game if the idea of a Far Cry formula in a city appeals to you. Just be ready for some clunkiness and a few bugs.			"

												At first, this game felt pretty mediocre to me, but after a few hours in to it I got more interested in it and also learned all the different mechanix. Starting with the singleplayer, it is slow at start and the story is maybe not the best, but it is pretty alike to far cry 3-4 and your main mission is to take over different strongholds and hack different control panels. This becomes more interesting after you get better weapons and also the cool explosives, which some is controlled with a remote. There are also hacking throwables which u can use to make enemy trucks and drones ur own. What makes this game fun for me is these different weapons, and it is fun that you can choose to either go full rampage or just stealth kill until you can make a stronghold urs. So, the gameplay is better than the story and also makes up for it in a way.Over to the multiplayer, unfortunately, it´s very hard to find games. Not many are playing which results in less players to do the online-missions with. The cool thing about the co-op mode is that there are new missions that are only playable in co-op, and is not a part of the main story. It is therefore not like Borderlands(awesome game) where u team up with others to complete story missions. In this mode, u level up, can unlock differents skills(which som are better and more interesting than others) and also get new wapons and attachments to those through buying cases. You can also play these missions by yourself if u make a private lobby, but according to me, playing with others is more fun. If u have some friends that wants to play the game with u,  I think it´s even better because you can then plan ur missions and make them easier to complete. Especially the hard difficulty on the missions are very difficult, and it is hard to beat them without some sort of communication. Final verdict- 7/10- Good gameplay and co-op missions, but lack a interesting story.			"

												To be completely honest, this game isn't up to par with the original game. Sure, it looks nice, and the freeplay environment is cool, but somehow, they managed to make the gunplay worse than the original game's. Converting weapons on the fly is cool and everything, but realisticly, it's too fast and the changes that are made are sometimes quite rediculous. Also some conversions are just♥♥♥♥♥♥ Convert your sniper rifle into a firework cannon? Nope, do not do that. You'll have better luck with a grenade or you know, an actual rocket launcher. The online game is pretty just the missions from singleplayer(sure they're different missions, but they play out the same. No freeplay online, its just mission after mission and theres really not that many missions to play. Also, the online is dead already, so don't expect to actually get to play online if that♥♥♥♥♥♥Bottom line, I bought the game to see if it was really as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as everyone said it was. I can confirm it's pretty bad, but probably not quite as bad as everyone else says. Buy this game if you want to play another Far Cry esque game and would like it in some ""The United States has been invaded and you, the most patriotic of patriots would rather die than let those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Koreans win"" kind of perspective. 8/10 Concept wise, 3/10 gameplay wise, 0/10 multiplayer, and 1/10 for optimsation and polish. Overall, I'd say its about a 3.5/10			"

Not a great game yet4/10 Not what was expected of the game.Not a well-polished game and gets a bit boring fast with the repetitiveness of the objectives, the world does feel somewhat empty but overall I did buy the game for the Co-op mode and that’s all.Pros:-Nice online experience with leveling up and unlocking new items-Different approaches that can be made with your team (Aggressive/Stealth)-Crafting-attachments-Customization (Character/Weapons)Cons:-Lots of bugs-Some might encounter FPS drop due to poor optimization quality-The feeling of an empty world-Random NPC spawning’s-Not enough supply point’s laid out in a big map-Being detected is a very common thing, so stealth is hard since even if you kill the NPC on the second he sports you every one seems to know you are there, like they all have telepathy or a 6th sense.-playing alone gets boring fast.

												I have to say.. due to all the bugs that exist within the game. 1 would think this is in beta state.. i say beta because it isnt terrible but there are alot. The lack of multiplayer base for this game literally within the first week of release tells me that this game will end up just like starwars battlefront. Flopped... an example is today.. sunday at 5 pm eastern.. i went looking for games and didnt find a single 1.. tells ya something about the future state of this game in general. story is ok but nothing to speak of. truthfully listening to the leaders of the resistance give talks to the resistance in single player was really eh. didnt feel really all that hardcore to resist haha.. some would say the story itself is short.. maybe not as short as the first game.. but short enough that i hammered threw it in a few hours.. so truthfully i went in really wanting to love this game and deep silver pre-released it to early.. really half did everything in the game.. and truthfully the hype everyone sees when watching the trailer.. the game didnt live up to. its a shame really as iv invested to many hours to request a refund and am stuck with the game. on the plus.. i wont have to spend any more money on dlcs/expensions as deepsilver kinda lost my business. really liked the company till now and always supported their games. shame but oh well..  sorry for any errors as i am writing this really quick before heading out the door. my advice is if you aint sure , give it a go as you may enjoy it but i personally wasnt impressed. games worth maybe 30 bucks at best at its current state. and truely feel it needs a way better story line.. but to each their own.

RATING6/10GOODI'm taking the time to write this review for two reasons, one being that the game is awesome, and second one being that they finally PATCHED and FIXED THE GAME! Homefront The Revolution is an awesome game despite all the negative reviews, if you're after Far Cry type of games, this one is for you.I've finished the story on PS4 so I can comment to the game's story and everything in global.The Revolution as a first person shooter game is set in, as the name suggests ""THE REVOLUTION"" type of open world (sorta) location with lot of details and stuff laying around. I won't spoil anything for the story, as it's not great, but decent. Characters are decent and relatable, graphics are awesome (not something next level obviously but awesome for the eye in every way, details on characters are greatly done), and system requirements aren't that scary at all. I have a weird Metro Last Light feeling while walking around, I don't know why.They patched the game in the beginning of September so the game is very stable now. Considering the requirements it was playable even on a Core 2 Duo processor (30+ FPS with drops as expected from an older architecture), also Core 2 Quad (40+ almost stable with few minor dips, nothing too serious).I tested the game myself on a GTX970, i5 6600 and 8GB of RAM (because it's free for two days, so why not?) and it's pretty stable (compared to before patch - it was a mess), 60+ FPS all the time on all settings maxed out, not optimized? What are you talking about? With a decent specs you can max the game easily without anti-aliasing and super-sampling.BIG LIKE FOR THE CUTSCENES - MOVIE LIKE FEELING! GREAT ANIMATIONS COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMESBADAs for the bad part, there are...not just a few issues with the game. I was unable to get the game working on anything but 1080p resolution, it doesn't support 4K display for some reason, it always keeps me in the 1080p resolution, 1440p resolution obviously DOESN'T WORK TOO.This game have had so much potentioal once it was released - but not anymore, considering it's ruined by bad reviews. I guess that's what you get for releasing an unfinished product nowadays (and thereee are alot of them, but compared to other disasters they actually fixed it - so The Revolution wins a point for that).As for the AI - it's a mess, I can't think of any game that has worse AI than this game, it's...ahh...terrible, horrible, there's no word to describe how stupid the AI is actually.IS IT WORTH FULL PRICE?Homefront The Revolutions is obviously NOT WORTH THE FULL PRICE TAG, catch it on a sale or some third party websites for half the price.

												Not worth the 60€ original price, neither is it worth 30€. This game is at best a 15€ game in my opinion. I expected it to be a great mix of known games like Division (Haven't played), Metro (10/10), latest Far Cries (Man of the people, fighting the revolution etc.). I bought the game solely because of seeing how the graphics were and what the theme was. Sadly I have to say, this game's story is a major lackluster.In terms of mechanics, imagine the Devs are sitting in their kitchen, they have this Pot full of boiling water that has ""Mechanics"" written on it. It is meant to be the Mechanics soup. What they did there, they decided that peeling the ingredients for this soup, would be a waste of time and simply took them raw as they were and threw them in the pot, expecting their soup to taste the same. Little to their knowledge, soup tastes like garbage now and they totally should've spent more time on each ingredient. Stealth mechanic is below basic, Weapon customization is half-done(you're gonna reach end-game gear really quick and you won't have to grind for it, in fact you will have too much cash left over sitting there doing nothing useful for you), Core gameplay lies in the amount of bullets you put into your enemy and where you shoot. Its as simple as that. The mechanics of this game are nothing special, and some are even worse than any of their competitors not just by a little bit but by a lot. Expect this game to be short-lived in your library. The whole story took me as much as I will ever play it. No, I did not complete every single objective, Cause simply these objectives had literally 0 use, but yes I did complete a major part of them like 50%. You can rush through the main story-line brainlessly and you're not going to miss out on anything, mainly because side-quests are nothing more but eye-candy. Character development sucks, although I'm not really criticizing that aspect in the games enough to explain it well enough. Other reviews have done a good job of describing how it is.  "

												Good game, great, modern, realistic FPS, nice design (actually, I expected something of this level for Fallout 4), interesting concept, but only partially developed. The game feels incomplete at times, but I had a great time and the bugs didn't, not once, impede a good gaming experience. The hate probably comes from the early players. At this stage, Homefront is superior to most games around (even at this stage, I should say). It's rare to see good single-player games these days, but this is one of them. There are problems, as I said, but I didn't care much about them. I'd say there are more opportunities than problems. The game beginning presents an awesome concept which keeps you asking for more, but there is little of the same quality for the rest of the game. I could play the game at around 50-55 fps, there are some frame drops, but they never took place during crucial moments, so, despite there being room for improvement, the experience is nonetheless amazing. I think the game is worth 40hrs of enjoyment, I have explored only to some extent the multiplayer, which seemed very entertaining, but lacking diversity - I suppose that it will continue in this state, after all the marketing failures of the game. I had a great time, I applaud the effort to produce a complex single-player game, and I do recommend it with the above minor qualifications.			"

												It's been a ride finishing up this game. I must admit, this game will not win game of the year. However. Homefront: The Revolution is not a bad game. It's not great, but it isnt bad. Probably because of all the problems this game had, this game could have been more. There are good fun features in this game, but they are poorly executed. Story is ""okay"", but not interesting. I loved the first Homefront, but this one...doesn't go much in the background or story. It feels like doing a shore. Liberating area's seems fun for the first two area's, afterwards it seems pretty much the same thing. It seems like some things were simplified, and that seemed like it was just for ""speeding up"" the proces. It's not a good game, but it's not a bad one either. I do like the voice actors, and they do try their best to create a homefront world. But it just doesn't feel right. I want to say this game was worth it, but it just doesn't feel so. Great sound effects, great music. The gameplay is ""okay"", story was dissapointing, but it wasn't ""bad"". I love the game, but it missed a lot of greatness. I rate this game a 6/10. But i can not recommend this game at full price. Wait for a sale, and then maybe sure.			"

												I wanted so badly for this to be good. Sadly, the title should've given it away; this is Homefront: The Revolution, not Homefront 2.The first Homefront was a totally underrated FPS. It was linear, yes. The gunplay and mechanics were quite standard, yes. But there was a unique setting, some brilliant writing, and one moment every level where the only response I had was ""Wow."" Some of those moments still sit with me - in the gut, not in the brain. The same way Spec Ops: The Line still does.But The Revolution does not have those moments. It's tutorial driven. Despite the half open world it still feels very linear. The story is worse. The writing is obtuse. The game went too cerebral. They thought about it too much and overplanned. Micromanaged. It goes to your head instead of your heart.The graphics are ok - they weren't going to be the thing to make or break this game anyway. The controls are quite bad, mostly because there are some very important keys you can't re-assign (like holstering your weapon). Stealth is constantly suggested but impossible to actually pull off. The open world aspect felt more like a chore than anything approaching fun. The balance of money and points for upgrades is totally off: there's far too little early on and far too much later.The whole system is buggy, especially around achievements and saving progress. The only reliable way to move forward is by sprinting back to a store to get a check point after accomplishing the optional objectives. If you don't and the game crashes while you're out in the world exploring you'll have to try to remember what you did and repeat it all.The multiplayer is worth mentioning because I'm a sucker for co-op, especially with RPG elements. But this was terrible. The skills you unlock don't usually matter and it takes too long to get them (although it's worth noting that there are one or two that are totally overpowered compared to the rest). The different classes don't really complement each other. And finally, there isn't nearly enough content. Once you beat all the maps one time there isn't a strong incentive to keep playing.I'm glad that they got this game out, but creating a game is very different than creating a good game. The latter is far more difficult, and requires a level of care and polish that simply isn't present in The Revolution.Hopefully Homefront will get a true sequel one day. I'd enjoy that.			"

												The main complaints about this game are about the optimization. I have a fairly powerful computer, and it runs fine, albeit i turned a few settings from ultra to high (poor me). There are occasional lag spikes, once every 10 minutes i'd say, but it's not game breaking at all. Seeing as I'm not a whiny baby, i realize that optimization is something that will be fixed in a month or two through patches, and if its not, THEN i'd be worried, but until then, we're going to look at the game from a non technological standpoint.My only complaint so far is that i feel like i was thrown into the action a little too fast. Not enough intro plot for me, but an hour in, i was very comfortable with how the game was going. Gameplay wise, it's similar to farcry. Liberate zones to increase your support in the region, disable North Korean infrastructure, and gain the ""hearts and minds"" of the people, to bring more people to the revolution. This is done by capturing special objectives and areas, like observation points, patrol areas, securable areas, saving civilians, broadcasting revolution propaganda in place of North korean propoganda, and a few other ways as well. The hearts and minds system is a nice refresher to this style of gameplay. The combat feels good. You have the choice between stealthing, brute force, or hit and run tactics using tech you aquire in the game.  For example, a remote car explosive device could be driven under an armored patrol vehicle and detonated, destroying it and the soldiers patrolling with it, letting you stay at a safe distance and leave quickly. The guns feel good, the sounds are nice and even on hardened you can take down norks with a good headshot, or a few body shots. The most interesting part of this would probably be the weapons customization. For your first weapon, you are given a pistol and an SMG conversion. To apply this conversion, you remove the slide of the pistol, insert the lower into the SMG upper and load the magazine, all of this being a very nice animation you actually see in game. You can also switch out AR15 uppers, shotgun parts, and pretty much anything else you want on the fly. I'll probably update this review once i've completed the game, but so far, i can safely say most of the compaints and negative reviews are based upon the game not being properly optimized for the PC, which is understandable, but not enough to give it a negative review in my opinion.

												Homefront: The Revolution is an underrated shooter with brisk open-world conquest, proficient weapons and engaging mechanics. Although the story is flimsy, major characters hold it together. Set in Philadelphia, the game focuses on an underground resistance group fighting the occupying North Korean forces. The Goliath vehicle (from Homefront 1) returns, but players must clumsily escort it because, sadly, they cannot command it. Story missions are rough, especially those near the weak ending.This is a sandbox game, first and foremost. The initial world building is not as good as its predecessor, but the world design and gameplay are much better. Players will shoot and sneak their way through a few sizable levels. The basic goal is to capture ‘Strike Points’ in each level and retake America one piece at a time.There are two Zone types—Red and Yellow. Red Zones are warzones with a heavy ‘Nork’ presence that shoot on sight. Airships slowly patrol above and you do not want to get caught in their spotlight. Stealth is encouraged initially and, after gaining sufficient ground, additional resistance soldiers make the levels safer. Yellow Zones are smaller residential locations that encourage hit-and-run tactics. These tend to use more vertical space and utilize cameras to keep civilians in line. Stealth is easier because you can blend into the crowd. After winning enough respect, civilians will riot which also reduces danger. The difference between each area is refreshing, even though many tasks are similar. You will hack antennas, capture strongholds, recharge generators with motorbikes, and even do some basic parkour navigation. Some tasks are random, like saving civilians or killing officials. It is strange that many Strike Points can be captured while enemies are still hostile nearby, but this makes for rapid conquest. The two different Zone types provide natural pacing and satisfying conquestSadly, Revolution has its share of bugs. Problems include: not being able to complete side jobs, grenades falling through the ground, and enemies disappearing. My character even flew high into the air, after getting off a motorbike that was barely moving. Also, after capturing one Strike Point, the game spawned me inside a shelf. Performance is not the best—with a few late-game crashes—although it still looks good on medium settings with changing weather and a day-night cycle. The game is not technically polished, but it is quite playable.Using CryEngine, the AI has familiar routines and similar problems. Sometimes they walk into walls, float above the ground, or forget they got shot. Fortunately, they also have many positives. They react appropriately to dead bodies, sounds, and thrown projectiles. Toss a Molotov near soldiers and survivors will search the approximate source location. Cause a large explosion and Norks will swarm that area, reducing the threat elsewhere. The AI does not cheat; they move and shoot based on your last position. The mostly-clever, partially-glitchy AI makes for decent action. There are several effective stealth options, including a melee takedown, silenced pistol, and proximity devices.  RC cars can be driven short distances to produce chaos elsewhere; you can even drive them under vehicles undetected. There is a great selection of guns, including a powerful sniper and an excellent assault rifle. Enemies and vehicles have weak spots, so positioning and accuracy is important. The Hack grenades will temporarily turn autonomous vehicles against the Norks and these devices are also used for puzzles. It is a shame that you can only carry two primary weapons but they have alternate modes (e.g. the crossbow turns into a flamethrower) and it usually isn’t far to change loadouts.Multiplayer is co-operative only, although this is not a bad thing. Players become a resistance soldier and complete missions across the same zones from the single player. You might escort vehicles, breach strongholds or rescue prisoners. Stealth functions well, in fact the co-op plays much the same as the solo mode. There are skills, outfits, and boosts—they could have been part of the single player to add more depth. There are only 6 missions (more are planned) that take around 10 minutes to complete. You typically buy crates to refill consumables, and the RNG Gods will dictate whether you get a useful hack device or a 10% XP boost. It’s a grind without enough content, and there is barely anybody playing just weeks after launch. Homefront: The Revolution will provide around 15-20 hours of decent action in the single player, assuming players capture all Strike Points. What makes it successful is in how it presents the world and how it provides small encounters with different objectives. There are barely any drawn-out battles, and tasks can be completed without firing a shot. Players can progress through zones in any direction, avoiding snipers or destroying enemy patrols, and the encounter spots are rarely the same. It’s a sandbox game, so the experience relies heavily on letting you have fun in bite sized pieces. The game achieves this more often than not. Homefront: The Revolution is far from perfect, as numerous bugs, AI quirks, poor story missions, and performance issues hold it back. But damned if it isn’t enjoyable to enter a hostile sandbox and have it completely under control after an hour or two of competent shooting. 7 / 10			"

												The campaign is the thing I`m going to focus on in this review.So it starts good and the gameplay is really fun. But it gets boring as hell when you need to get the ""hearts and minds"" thing to 100% in like three different places. The story overall is really good, and the ending is not bad either. It has a few bugs though, but I didn`t really notice them that much.Is it worth buying? Yes, when It is on sale, I don`t think that the game is worth full price, but you will definetly have a decent game to play for about 12-15 hours :)			"

Why hello, old friend!Now here's a game I didnt think I would see again. Homefront was a game that I thought I would never really see again, and honestly, I dont think anyone really did. But, it's here, much to my surprise. Although, this surprise is mostly from the lack of advertising and marketing for it, I hadn't seen an ad anywhere, nor any commercials.The PerformanceOh boy. I am still not sure after 7 hours of playing how I feel about this. I have not had any massive frame skipping, stuttering, nor lag. However, there is a considerable amount of hitching when scripted moments occur during the game, and they are very easy to predict. I'm not really sure why this occurs, though it does seem to happen 99% of the time during climactic events or large enemy spawns. I was able to run this game at a constant 60FPS with no drops, spare the hitching during the events I have stated.The GameplayThe gunplay of this game is relatively responsive, and the modifications, though limited, certainly help your weapons feel more alive. Watching your character slide the barrel and forgrip off of an assault rifle, only to slap on a much larger one with a belt fed box magazine to effectively convert your old M4 into a M249 is very pleasing, albeit a bit silly. The guns kick as you would expect, without any massive spikes in recoil. This can be relieved by the addition of foregrips and worsened by muzzle breaks. The game follows a Dying Light-esque parkour system, with vaulting, climbing, and sliding. You can equip certain gear items to imrpove your performance in these areas, such as knee pads to improve sliding distances. While there is always a nice feeling of excitement when you can afford a new piece of gear, the selection feels rather bland in the story mode.The AIGood lord, the AI in this game is hilariously bad. Enemies will either be incredibly responsive and aggressive, or will not notice you at all when you mow down their friends with your weaponry. Friend and foe alike will find themselves battling their pathing routes more than each other, shooting walls and getting stuck on trash cans. While this can be frustrating, it can prove to be equally amusing, even if it is an extremely masochistic way.The Co-OpGoodbye, TDM. This game features mission based co-op, having the settings of several revolutionary battles between the North Korean Army and the Resistance. There are 6 missions total, each taking about 15 to 30 minutes depending on your teamwork and responsiveness to things going sour. You are then rewarded with EXP and money, which you may spend on skill and equipment. The equipment in this game is given to you in cases, each costing anywhere from $500 to $3000, depending on the quality of the gear and what you get from it. There is a lot of gear and vanity items to choose from, some better than others, but there is definitely an extensive display here. I find myself being drawn to wanting the better gear that looks much more militarized, and it definitely has kept me playing this far. I would not buy this game strictly for the co-op however, as it does get tiresome after a few missions.Final ThoughtsWhile Homefront: The Revolution has definitely shown that it is trying to achieve greatness, it ultimately falls short of its dreams. Boring quests with uninteresting characters, uninspired voice acting and some poor sound sync and design drag this game down significantly. However, I can't help but adore this game. I find myself wanting to play more, and the amount of customization options in the co-op mode definitely add some depth to this game, even if the models are preset. If you are hyped about this game, you should probably leave it at the door, and come into it with an open mind. You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised by this game.Final Score: 7/10 "

												I had the change to try the game during a free weekend event.All in all I think not every negative review is justified and the game can be fun. Think of it as the following game mix:Far Cry 3 missions and movement set in a dystopian scenario using the typical Crysis engine and weapon modification features.Story / Missions:The missions are not very innovative and can be copied 1:1 from Far Cry 3. Kill/destroy, defend, collect, use/hack. It can get boring to hack another console for the 100 time, but if you liked to simply stray in FC3, you might also like it here.I can't say much about the story, but from what I've seen it's more like a no brainer. More like a medium to get you through the scenario. Dont't expect crazy drug dreams like in FC3. So don't play it if you expect much story.Maps / Levels:The game has no big open world map like FC3, more like about 7 bigger levels with tasks. Each area has a distinctive look, although the alltogether look similar due to the destruction of the city (ruins, kinda grey). What i like about those semi-open-world levels is that most actions change the level. Buildings look different, when you liberate them. You can even notice more and more rebels moving around or civilians revolting, which is nice for the atmosphere. In the end, if you begin the real rebellion in a sector it starts to look more like a warzone.Graphics:The game is by far not ugly. It sometimes looks very ""Call of Duty"" / grey-in-grey mid day. But I guess thats only realistic in cities. Sunrise and sundown look very nice and give a nice touch of colors to the greyness of mid day. The night is usually really dark, so you need your flashlight (think pitch black darnkess like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with mods). So in the end the graphics are atmospheric considering the scenario.AI:Quite dumb. More like Call of Duty AI / quantity instead of quality.TL;DR:Mix Far Cry 3 with Crysis set in a dystopian scenario without much story. If you liked doing mischief in FC3, give it a try. But don't play it for story.			"

												I'm not sure how much staying power the game has, but as an in-the-moment sort of the game, it's very fun. There are still a few bugs present, but if you wait even longer than I did, and the developer continues to refine their game, it wouldn't be unwise to purchase it for even full price or on sale.As for the game itself, think Far Cry gameplay filtered through Call of Duty and Metro, visually stark and atmospheric but tonally fatuous like an action movie. Can't say I approve of the overt jingoism either, as it turns to inanity a few times. Guess it's an American thing, like that guy running for governer, firing a minigun in his campaign ad.			"

Amazing graphics,amazing reflections, super clean  and very detailed shadows. Also , technical area of Homefront: The Revolution is the one who played the leading role in my experience . Looking however below the stack of amazing technical matters , I met a stress filled and inspiring story , extreme realistic gameplay mechanisms and a highly trial campaign.- WARNING.. if you dont have a 250$ or better graphics card dont even buy it.It wont play even at the low settings. With my ( r9 380 )  barely playing at high settings and got rarely fps drop.Te game also want 5 GB of  RAM			"

												Ok so I played this for Steam Weekend It really was not that bad I ran a solid 60fps after optimizing through Nvidias driver. The gameplay is pretty generic but otherwise it can be fun for a while.The gun customization comes from the crysis series. Played a bit of the coop mode it was a mission based kind of thing complete objectives and extract. I liked the game I always thought the premise of the game was interesting North Korea vs The USA. This game defintely is not worth the high price though wait for a sale something under 20 the story is not very enaging but man do those graphics impress. [8/10 Would Play Again]			"

												Well... It's not too bad. It's an average open world shooter. You might be into this style of game but i pretty much get bored of it.I only really played this because of three reasons, one being i have a brand new 1060 graphics card which makes the game gorgeous looking so it gave it a good work out and the other being that there's an easter egg that contains two FULL levels of god damn TIMESPLITTERS 2 that works with mouse and keyboard. Oh... and it was free because of the free weekend thing so, why not? But i stayed for Timesplitters and i wouldnt have given Homefront a second look if it wasnt for that easter egg.I mean, it has some nice ideas and some pretty great scenery, but it's just... eh, you've played it before. Just imagine Far Cry 3 and 4 in an urban environment and that's pretty much this. I guess i recommend the game but i'd wait for a discount maybe? Just don't buy it too expensive, like.Anyway, speaking of that easter egg. Hey, see that Dambuster, former Free Radical i'm sure? You see that arcade cabinet? That's what i want in a shooter, that's fun. Open world stuff is overdone, i want to pick up a shooter that's  Maybe your teasing ports of Timesplitters 2 and 3 on PC or a remaster or something. I want a shooter that doesnt take itself seriously and Timesplitters is 10/10 in my book. So... you know, please release them on PC? You know you want to.			"

												nearly cleared out a stronghold, threw a grenade at the last one hidden, grenade bounces off ally right back at me. 10/10 would get blown to pieces again.Rewrite: Now that I've put more hours into the game, finished the main campaign and several expansions, I can write a more critical (but still very positive!) review of this game. I can still say that it appears most of the bugs, glitches, whatever was initially wrong with this game have been patched together. This is a very solid game- imo worth full price even though I got it on sale.Issues? Sure, the AI is occasionally slow to engage you when you take your first sniping shots on a group. Generally, though, the AI is solid when they're chasing you through the city or you're battling through waves towards an objective. Solid and challenging; they will flank and swarm you.Graphics are phenomenal- no glitches, fast FPS. Level design is very thorough and detail oriented, atmosphere and NPC activity advances with the storyline in each area, different zones offer a variety of scenery, obstacles, and structures to use as cover. Campaign is a good length plus open-world ""jobs"" and side missions help to unlock gear. Sound is great- really good voice acting (noted: protagonist is not voiced in main campaign, but it's really no big deal- still very smooth). Good build-up of different personalities in the game. Weapons are verrry customizable- I've only even needed to use ~1/3 of the weapon choices so far!The only, only, only thing I could ask for is to turn off snipers' laser sights in the red zone for an extra challenge.. and for all KPA to turn off flashlights.. and to turn off the mini-map. That would add a new level of rubble-crawling difficulty :D			"

Homefront : The RevolutionThis is a tough review because the game does some things really good and some things really bad.Homefront : The Revolution is a FPS open world game that tries to be Far Cry but fails due to repetitive gameplay and bad gunplay.GameplayThe game plays like Far Cry a lot.It borrows a lot of mechanics such as the ability to capture bases and the battle between two factions(Rebels and North Koreans).Sadly,capturing bases is not nearly as fun as in the Far Cry series.The gameplay is not linear as some might say.You have plenty of choices besides following the campaign.You can raise the ''Hearts and Minds'' meter by doing certain activities like capturing bases,disabling North Korean machinery,destroying armored cars and shuting down radios.When you create enough chaos in a region of the city,the citizens will start to riot and join you.The game does a very good job at this.The level design changes as the citizens get more and more fed up with the occupation.Random events are among the good things that this game has to offer.You can save citizens from police brutality,kill Korean officials and aid the rebels against attacking North Koreans.Populated areas are very frustrating.Stealth in the game is very bad and when you are in a urban area,it is very hard for you to move around without getting spotted and have to fight endless waves of attackers.Why can't you just have a disguise?They recognise you instantly.Platforming in the game is also very bad and not intuitive.The game sometimes fails to register jumps and sometimes you can't jump/climb somewhere even if you should have.Gunplay...this is one of the most disappointng things in the game.You'd think a shooter game would have decent gunplay,but Homefront : The Revolution does not.The guns feel clunky and unresponsive.The conversions kinda save the gunplay and make it bearable.Another clunky mechanic of the game is driving.The motorcycles in the game don't feel right.The A.I in the game are pretty dumb and probably glitch out a lot and that's why they are so dumb.Overall,the gameplay is repetitive and because of the bad gunplay,at times it is painful.Some levels are chaotic and badly scripted also.It's a good thing the actual gameplay gets better as the game progresses because I would have stopped two or three hours in.Technical problemsThe game suffered an awful launch and even after several months and several patches,the game still has bugs,glitches and performance issues.One bug kept happening to me over and over again.When I would get down from a motorcycle,I would get thrown into the air a few meters and then fall and take damage from the fall.NPCs kept getting stuck in objects or just went through them and so on.Those bugs don't happen enough for me to say that the game is unplayable...but I noticed them.Graphics and AudioI saw people complaining about ugly graphics.The game actually looks really nice.The level design is pure eye-candy.If Homefront did one thing right,it's world building with those pretty graphics.The soundtrack is serviceable and the voice acting is top notch.StorylineSPOILERS DON'T READAfter reading through reviews I expected a bad plot but it's actually not that bad.It has great moments,decent dialogue and a few memorable characters.Maybe having North Korea invade and conquer the US is a bit too imaginative.But it's a game after all.I think they messed up a bit towards the end with a very weird self-sacrifice.Also,they scrapped the first Homefront game and recreated the backstory.I don't know what to say about that.Conclusion,TL;DRHomefront : The Revolution is a mediocre game at best.The Open World is beautiful in design but offers next to nothing in content.Gunplay is bad but gets better throughout the game while the storyline can be great at times but they mess up towards the end.That coupled with the performance issues make it very hard game to recommend.Why I am recommending it?Because I enjoyed the storyline and the dialogue and also enjoyed the level designs and some mechanics of the game.I give the game a 6/10.It may not be a good game,but I enjoyed going through it with all it's faults.Hopefully the Devs won't abandon patching the game since I heard they are going to release more singleplayer/multiplayer DLCs.

												Well... It's not too bad. It's an average open world shooter. You might be into this style of game but i pretty much get bored of it.I only really played this because of three reasons, one being i have a brand new 1060 graphics card which makes the game gorgeous looking so it gave it a good work out and the other being that there's an easter egg that contains two FULL levels of god damn TIMESPLITTERS 2 that works with mouse and keyboard. Oh... and it was free because of the free weekend thing so, why not? But i stayed for Timesplitters and i wouldnt have given Homefront a second look if it wasnt for that easter egg.I mean, it has some nice ideas and some pretty great scenery, but it's just... eh, you've played it before. Just imagine Far Cry 3 and 4 in an urban environment and that's pretty much this. I guess i recommend the game but i'd wait for a discount maybe? Just don't buy it too expensive, like.Anyway, speaking of that easter egg. Hey, see that Dambuster, former Free Radical i'm sure? You see that arcade cabinet? That's what i want in a shooter, that's fun. Open world stuff is overdone, i want to pick up a shooter that's  Maybe your teasing ports of Timesplitters 2 and 3 on PC or a remaster or something. I want a shooter that doesnt take itself seriously and Timesplitters is 10/10 in my book. So... you know, please release them on PC? You know you want to.			"

												Οne of the best games I've played till now. And within the steam and outside. The Playthrough was an endless experience and there were incredible changes to the events . Amazing graphics,amazing reflections, super clean  and very detailed shadows. Also , technical area of Homefront: The Revolution is the one who played the leading role in my experience . Looking however below the stack of amazing technical matters , I met a stress filled and inspiring story , extreme realistic gameplay mechanisms and a highly trial campaign.- WARNING.. if you dont have a 250$ or better graphics card dont even buy it.It wont play even at the low settings. With my ( r9 380 )  barely playing at high settings and got rarely fps drop.Te game also want 5 GB of  RAM			"

												I'm not sure how much staying power the game has, but as an in-the-moment sort of the game, it's very fun. There are still a few bugs present, but if you wait even longer than I did, and the developer continues to refine their game, it wouldn't be unwise to purchase it for even full price or on sale.As for the game itself, think Far Cry gameplay filtered through Call of Duty and Metro, visually stark and atmospheric but tonally fatuous like an action movie. Can't say I approve of the overt jingoism either, as it turns to inanity a few times. Guess it's an American thing, like that guy running for governer, firing a minigun in his campaign ad.			"

												Homefront TR is a surprisingly fun game! After all the bad reviews I expected a lame, buggy, and broken game. What I got was a competent, interesting, and well-made game. The environments are well laid out and visually interesting, the main story moves at a nice pace, all the grindy side content is avoidable, and the shooting and stealth mechanics are fine.Clearly you could play better games like Wolfenstein or Doom or Deus Ex, but Homefront TR is actually a fun game, worth picking up when it's on sale.Disclosure: I played this during the free weekend, and only got about half-way through. I'll buy it when the price goes down further.			"

												Ok so I played this for Steam Weekend It really was not that bad I ran a solid 60fps after optimizing through Nvidias driver. The gameplay is pretty generic but otherwise it can be fun for a while.The gun customization comes from the crysis series. Played a bit of the coop mode it was a mission based kind of thing complete objectives and extract. I liked the game I always thought the premise of the game was interesting North Korea vs The USA. This game defintely is not worth the high price though wait for a sale something under 20 the story is not very enaging but man do those graphics impress. [8/10 Would Play Again]			"

												It has bugs, no co-op campaign, I couldn't use/shoot/do anything in the last mission I played, but this happens rarely (still not a good thing).It's a fun game, you complete missions together, get money and xp to progress by buying crates (in-game money) for equipment and leveling up your skills in different skill trees.You can modify your weapon on the battlefield, including the barrel itself (as in a fast shooting rifle modified to a high caliber sniper rifle etc)You craft hackers, explosives, distraction (firecrackers :v) and molotovs, which can also be upgraded if you get the blueprints in crates, as in bomb taped to a rc racer, proximity which is taped to a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bear for some reason, and remotely triggered, which is just a remote.Basically, craft, modify weapons, get gear that changes stats, and it has skilltrees/classes.Though, not worth 40 euro if you buy it for co-op, just sayin, but it's fun			"

												This is a very interesting game. I appreciate the bad reviews are due to some release teething problems as well as bad performance on consoles but it would be an incredible tragedy if that leads to people being put off from this game as the developers are clearly making an effort to create something worthwhile. The story is believable if you replace North Korea with China as that's clearly what they're referring to. The voice acting and characterisations are engaging and immersive. I'm definitely seeing a big nod to the game Freedom Fighters here and I'd be surprised if the developers had not played it. As far as I've got into the game I immediately engaged with the open world. A main mission seemed to disappear while I was doing stuff and I suspect,  because I did not get there in time, it turned into the next ""lost patrol"" mission. So there could be some dynamic story telling here. When I heard it was an open world game, because of Cryengine as I've seen it post Crysis and Warhead, I was assuming ""open"" would mean some alternate level approaches. But this is really open ! The level designers have some nice attention to detail in the world, and again the voice acting shines; the lady on the resistance radio sounding like something out of a Vietnam war era Dave Rabbit broadcast. Talking of Crysis, of course the weapon customisation is almost a direct clone of the Crysis system. Honourable mention also goes to the mobile phone. I've not seen in world information done properly since the map in Far Cry 2. Some of the info is displayed direct on the in game phone, but not everything. Cryengine is as always a hardware hungry beast but I don't think it's beyond everyone's budget. I had an AMD R7 260X which ran @ ~ 30 FPS on all low settings. Updating to an AMD R9 280X 3GIG gave me between 40 to 60 on medium to high settings. Once it has the right hardware the engine (yes, now with all the patches) runs smoothly. BTW there's even a day/night cycle. So thanks to the developers for this game, a British company as well. Cool.			"

												I feel sorry for the developer. This game is very good. We all know that it WAS not optimized and sold at PREMIUM price. But the developer shows commitment and fix most of its main problem. I got it on Steam Sale at 11.99$ for bundled. This is the kind of game developer that need support.The Gameplay itself is a combination of Far Cry 3 or 4 and Payday 2. You can do many kinds of actions as in Far Cry 3 or 4 games, play the way Ubisoft style games like control the tower and the area is yours. Note that AI is smarters than Ubisoft's game AI. People said that some AI came out of no where, Then I say that it's just like Payday 2 you play in LOUD way and AI came out of no where. And yes, in Homefront, you can also play STEALTH mode and achieve the goal.There are different kind of characters, specialties, and weapon upgrade.What's MISSING is the Multiplayer PvP gamemode. There should be something like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege 5 v 5 embeded in the Open world map and control each area per round.There is a Multiplayer PvE gameplay where you can upgrade your weapon the way Counter Strike Go does and Far Cry like. Win each battle, get in game money and buy weapons upgrade, gear and consumables for the next round. Trust me, AI MP in PvE is really hard. You'll feel a bit overwhelm, just like Payday 2 Hard in LOUD style of gameplay.What's MISSING in MP PvE, is they need to randomize the location where items or post, enemy spawn point, objects etc. Many players got bored due to its monotone missions without randomized objects.This game is a must have at DISCOUNTED price.8/10Pro: above and graphics.Cons: You need very strong rig, game is pricey.

												Great Stuff!Atmospheric, moody and enjoyable. Satisfying weapons, fantastic derelict waistlands to manoeuvre around. Airships that make your heart jump a beat when they let-off their 'War of the World' type spot alert sound when youve been tagged.Considering your part of the resistance in the revolution, it's true to its form and is what it should be.Fortunately for me it runs buttery smooth getting v-synced 60fps @ 1080p with all settings maxed - on GTX 1080 (Aorus X7 DT V6 CF1).It's a shame some are digruntled over this game, however I personally find there's fun to be had as otheres have also mentioned.

												This game has gotten a bad rep based on the state of the game back when it was released but I am here to assure you that the developers have made some astronomical fixes that have made this game not only enjoyable, but one of the best open world FPS on the market. I'm gonna be blunt, this game is not easy and if the only FPS experience you have is Call of Duty than this game might not be for you...BUT if you enjoy realistic shooters that actually make you think and come up with a game plan before you go in, than this game is perfect.  If you enjoyed any of the Metro games or any games in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series than pick this bad boy up.			"

												Hmmm, what to say about this......Well the game looks pretty (but we all know that good graphics do not necessarily make a good game) the shooting mechanics seem solid and fun but there doesn't seem to be much structure to the gameplay. After the initial getting to know everyone stage, the game sends you on a mission and then BAM all of a sudden the map is filled with so many things to do you forgot what you were supposed to be doing, so you head towards the nearest marker thinking that is where you need to go to finish your current mission only to find that you have just started a new side mission instead...I don't mind games giving you loots to do but not before you are familiar with a few mechanics first.I am still going to recommend this game but only if you love being swamped with things to do before you have enough knowledge about how to accomplish anything.

												Not entirely sure why people are ragging this game. It's not terrible, yes; I did get it for free this weekend, but ultimately, I bought it.The gameplay isn't bad, the only thing is the sensitivity of the gun play, but that's fixed by decreasing sensitivity. The upgrades and attachments are wicked, you only have to buy one of the attachment to attach it to all guns. You quickly get cash to unlock and buy equipment.It is open world, where just like Fallout, you can do what you want when you want all while completing the main story.			"

												Overall I have no issue in highly recommending this game, tho' i must say i just got it on sale and i have never experienced the problems people said they had at launch. As far as the game is now, it works very well indeed. Graphics are excellent. Gun play is really nice. The gun customization is great. The open world is very nice. It's similar to any of the recent Far Cry games and the capture point system is similar. The story and voice acting is passable but the weakest part. I get that people had a bad experience with this title at launch and I have seen that it was badly optimized etc but I have absolutely no trouble running it maxed out and well above 60fps. My rig is a 980 and an FX8350 with 16gb ram.			"

												It took a while for patching to make the game playable, but after 1.7 it went from unplayable to very playable.  It's not a perfect game by any stretch, but I highly recommend it. Note that i am a fan of the core Far Cry series, FC 2,3,4 as well as Arma. Those are the kinds of games I like to play.Here's why Homefront The Revolution is a good game, for me... and maybe you...1. They nailed philly and post invasion occupation.  If you ever wanted to star in your own ""Reds"" movie, this is it. 2. The whole premise, which starts with the Military in the US being disabled via hacking, is within the realm of possibility, say 30 years down the road.3. The technological advanced machines the Koreans have in the game, if you project say 20-30 years ahead, are entirely plausable.4. The enjoyment of this game, the immersion of it, went way up when I shut the Mini-map off. Recommend you do the same. It's all in settings and is easy to do.5.  The sound in the game is pretty good, sounds of occupation. It grows as the population is stirred up. Really adds to the immersion.  I like to shut off the music unless I am really feeling ""cinematic"". But normally, I like the music off which adds immersion IMHO.6. I have not finished the game but I am several hours into it. DON'T JUDGE THE GAME BY THE FIRST YELLOW AND RED ZONE you work. The game gets increasingly more exciting after a while.  You will feel like you are a fugitive from justice.7. There are a ton of side missions to do along the way, or stick with the main thread.  I started my playing with medium difficulty and hud on, focusing on the main mission 'cause I was getting my butt kicked.  Then I stopped the game, and began a new one, this time on hardest, no mini map (love it off!), and pursue all teh side missions.  And so this is why I enjoy playing this game.There are some things I wish were better however:a. You can upgrade your guns, bombs etc... but the way you obtain them is by accumulating cash (or something called ""KPA points""). The whole thing about using cash for weapon upgrades just strikes me as totally non-immersive.  Look, you're in a rag-tag group of resistance fighters, where you and your copatriots live in poverty... and you will become a big deal in teh resistence.,.. but you need money for weapons?  I'd rather they use something like the ""renown"" system found in silent hunter... if ya know what that is...  they do use something called KPA points, but they can onl;y be used on certain items and not your main weapons.This is not a fatal flaw, but one that just strikes me as silly each time I purchase an upgrade....b. As a fan of the far cry series FC 2,3,4, the protagonist speaks a few words here and there in those games. Not a lot, but enough to feel like your character is a human.  In Home Front, you are always silent, even when you woudl expect something to be said (I won't spoil it for you....).This is not a major flaw as most of the time you are doing what freedom fighters do so well... and I suspect it was about budget, why we don't have that in the game. But just a little character talking on even rare occasions would have made the story more real.Some have been critical of the story.. and it doesn't quite equal what you get in Far Cry ... still it plays a part in the journey and glues together the pieces in to a whole.  I give the story a B.====================Conclusion - as I said earlier - if you want to be in your own Reds movie (the original, not the sucky newer one...), and want to experience the feeling of taking back your community and your nation from an occupying force, I highly recommend this game for you.

You turn your vision even slightly and the whole world becomes a blur. I can not, and will not recommend this game. It is not passable for a title developed by a studio in 2016.

												Not bad in terms of the idea of the game. However, they could have made this game so much better with the storyline. As well as, they should have worked better for an open-world game. It was the same thing over and over with taking over the bases and all that. The graphics weren't bad, but the glitches were terrible.

												VERY BORINGthis game is so incredibly repetitive, that just half way through the storyline, you begin to wonder how much longer till you can move on to the next Steam game in your wishlist. Even the main storyline missions become inconsequential and lame. About 3/4's of the game is running around liberating strong holds and doing little acts of charity. The strongholds would be interesting, but the AI mechanics is so bad that the enemies will just run straight into your line of fire and have no strategy except to Leeroy Jenkins you anytime youre noticed. The gun custimazation feature held promise, but failed to meet expectations. You end up unlocking all the gear and weapon attachments after just an hour of play, giving you nothing to want to work up to. Also the Sniper attachment is absoluetly useless. The battle rifle with the sniper scope is so much better. If you want to play a game like this, but done the right way, go play Farcry instead "

												Edited to include control method**I always struggle to decide whether or not to pre-order.This is one of those times when I wish I hadn't.The gameplay is actually fun if you're not looking for insane Action RPG style life ruining immersion, and it's a pretty great shooter with some fun mechanics (hacking, and modding weapons comes to mind in the first 2 hours I've so far played).The trouble lies in what everyone else is saying too; which is that it's thus far very poorly optimized.Running at 1440P.

Maybe it will perform better once a patch or two is released but for now, for the price, it's a title that I think has a lot of promise.If you know what the game is going to be about. It might impress. Just wait a week or two to buy it.			"

												Dudes, I think this game's got way too much miscredit. I guess its the 'reverse hypetrain'.The game isnt brilliant (as in 8.5-9+ in Gamespot/IGN) but it certainly, in my experience, isnt a failed game eighter. What it sets out to portrait: An occupied america where you play as a tiny part of the opposition, it accomplishes fairly well. Sure, theres no huge set-pieces or surprising advances in gameplay. But, its solid.As performance goes, its acutally one of this years 'demanding' games which runs better on my maschine. And, its a very humble potato: 12ram, i7, Nvida 900-somthing 4GBram, an old carrot' 1gb hdd w. some ssd sprayed on top. -it handles this without one (1!) single hickup. Period. No stuttering. No do-hickeys or but..wrinckles.And if the measly performance and huge issues at launch is to believed, then Cudos to the devs. for fixing this and ACTUALLY Care for their product.Some of the big-wig' companies could learn from that.My only caveat with this one is the graphic style. Why, in all the Nordic Gods' names, do we have to get served those 'slightly cartoonish' graphics. When surely the same effort and coding could have given us near picture-perfect graphics. Its just distracting and I cant help but catching myself dreaming and imagining how Philadelphia would have looked in 'true to life' graphic style; dilapidated and worn down; bruised and burnt by firefights; defecated upon by thousands.- Lennon would have fired up a pipe', but I linger on in game'./Dr. Mabuse, Gaming since the 1980'ties C-64 days and never getting enough.

												""The credits began with an apology""Homefront: The Dance Dance Revolsution is a video game about NORTH KOREA conquering the world through electronics and military hardware sales.North Korea, in the Homefries Timeline, is, at the 1960.. 80s .. starting from the 1970s, was a more advanced economic/industrial power than the USA and JApAN COMBINED.That made me laugh so hard I got dizzy.By the time I woke up from nearly blacking out, I was being tortured by the Fictional North Korean Army that conquered America while the entire world sat on its hands and watched. Then, I was being tortured by the AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARIES of the game who joked about how ♥♥♥♥ing tortured I was about to get and how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead I was about to be. Cool introduction to the heroes.There are no sympathetic characters in this game. They are all horrible monsters. When they aren’t, they’re still annoying charicatures that barely symbolize peace, cruelty, and justice.The game itself is serviceable: You shoot enemies, they flinch and go down. It’s incredibly repetitive, and liberating the city becomes a waste of time quickly enough, divided into free fire Red zones, and the slightly more interesting Yellow zones that blend stealth and sabotage (terrorism) against your oppressors.Weapons are fairly interesting, able to break them down into variants that wildly change their behavior, but nothing you’ve not seen before. You have everything from a pistol to the rocket propelled gurnade. Most interesting is the HACKING GRENADE TOOL, which flips the allegiance of enemy robots against them. The most fun thing in the game by far!The game sucks patriotic♥♥♥♥♥♥the whole way through against a jingoistic nightmare. (played the game during its free period)			"

It was a side mission but for me it's hard to continue on with that marker stuck there and there is nothing I can do.-Optimization is bad. Really bad, with a GTX 970 I should never drop below 30fps on normal settings. Also lots of stuttering.-Lack luster story. I just never really felt engaged or connected to the characters.-Open world is a bit if a stretch. Once you open a new area there is very little insentive to go back.-Gameplay is just OK. Was a little clunky, felt more like an rpg playstyle set in a FPS. Stealth could also use some work, at a certian point you learn to just run.4/10 for now, I feel like it would be a 6/10 with enough patches, a lot of patches. "

												This game overall isnt worth sixty dollars, however the gameplay mechanics were interesting and fun. My most enjoyable moments were overthrowing certain districts from kpa authority and the gun customization was interesting and fun as well. However the bugs are prevelant through out the entire game, such as npc's getting stuck in the floor or running into walls all the time, and an escort mission i had to do 3 times, because the truck got stuck on debris. This game just isnt finished all the way, it needs ai updates for it to be better. The story is mediocre at best. TLDR: Wait till it is on sale or the price drops to buy, it isnt worth 60 dollars.

If you have to kill 10 snipers, then you can basically do it from the same spot, if you just wait.No reason to use tactics, because someone else will probably spawn right behind you,Making enemies respawn in singleplayer games, is the easiest way to make a game harder.

												Well I am going to absolutely honest here I have accessed so far the 4th part of the city into the game within the 2 hours (slightly over 2 hours actually) of gameplay I have actually played in this game. I firstly must say I been looking forward to this game since it was first announced and I played the first Homefront. I have read the reviews from others and other major sites. I can honestly say the only negative thing I can personally find in this game is optimization.Gameplay and graphics were spot on in my opinion and even though I set my expectations low because I didn't expect it to even release after waiting so long with no news. I am extremely appreciated of the fact they brought everything I honestly expected in the game. Story is pretty good so far and I have no complaints and the gameplay and the feel of the game is very good.Optimization as I mention is the only downside of this. I did update to the latest drivers in hopes for SLI to work with this game since it was provided in the latest drivers by Nvidia, but it seems SLI does not work for this game. So I am only able to get on high settings across the board (nearly maxed settings, but not quite there) and I achieve a stable framerate around 90 FPS constantly through my playthrough of the game. Of course when I attempted max settings the frames were so unstable and plummeted to nothingness when it is maxed out. This would be the only downside, but the game only just released so I am not going to gripe about it because of that and will wait and see for future updates.As for other negative reviews and the reviews from IGN, etc. I honestly would suggest others to take it with a grain of salt. I would honestly give this game an easy 8.5 for the quality gameplay, story and experience this game has given. Which I personally find very enjoyable right now and I like the game and for those who enjoyed Far Cry or any type of shooter game this is great.I love how many options this game gives you for upgradability and changing out your weapons which is a great feature to the game and a pretty decent game changer. I also enjoy the challenge it brings and how you can roam the world without a gun always on your screen. I look forward to unlocking further 'yellow zones' and other things. I was also a huge fan of 'Freedom Fighters' that came out during the good Playstation 2 days. I personally find this game a good successor of both it and the Homefront series and hope to see more like it in the future (with better optimization and graphics). As I said don't take negative reviews of this game to seriously. Take this game as it was advertised during E3 and your expectations because it truly delivers and offers a good experience for a open world first person shooter.			"

												So I just Finish this game here is my review.I did notice a lot of bugs while playing performance was bad at some points there was a lot of lag at points when doing a missions and ending side quests but I think everyone knows this.So Pros and Cons.Pros1. the weapon systen is pretty sweet been able to change your gun to get the job done.2. when taking over over the area you do see your allies all over fighting the KLPA so it feels like the missions you do does count.3. the enviroment is pretty good it does give that feel that america has been taken over.4. The Equitment in game was good gave me a lot of options on how to go about the missionsCons1. I do not like the bike the reason is just because there is a bike in game does not mean you need to make about 50% of the side quests need to be done with a bike that powers up a generator it gets really boring.2. The Ai in game so many clones I felt like I was in Star wars the Clone wars.......3.The Acting in this Game my God it felt like they went and got people that have never acted in there life it was so bad my head started to hurt listening to it.4. The weapons I think they need to learn what recoil is my god it was so bad.I will have to Give this a No for now it needs a lot of fixes and heaps more work this Game needed at least another year in Development way to soon to put it out it feels like a Alpha game might of been best to bring this out in EA and worked on it than people would of not been so negetive towards.

												This game became insanely reptitive and boring after the first hour. I went against reviews for once in my life, and made a terrible mistake.The game is cool, and the concept is interesting... definitely unique to see who the antagonists are... but, the game is quite literally as if it were a mix of Dying Light, watch_dogs, and Far Cry 4 jammed into what feels like a PvP arena, because there's no break from anything. The radio communication gets insanely annoying after a while, and it seems as if they never shut up. The initial entry to the game felt confusing, it basically dumped you off into the world immediately as a sort of ""hero"". The characters are quickly forgotten and you really make no connection to them. The gun system is interesting... something I've never seen in a game, but that's not enough to make it decent. This game overall confuses me, and I cannot recommend it at all.			"

												The game isn't bad but it's flawed and rushed.• Animation issue/clipping/slowdown• FOV max of 65• Dumb as a rock AI, bad pathfinding.• Highly repeatitive gameplay pretty much taking what ubisoft do: Open world with ""tower""As for the multiplayer• Copied the gear system from ME coop or DA:I you gain gear from random lootbox• Only 6 mission• Ugly AF character creation even more limited than division with only a couple face (mostly chinese or ugly face, especially for female character)In all.Not worth 60e (lucky for me, only play 1/6 of the price), get it on a sale or when it go under half price otherwise it's not worth it.The game is a rushed mess that should have been delayed instead of being forced out as the game feel like playing a beta with lot of flaw.TL;DR: Do not buy for full price, get it for sale or when it's under 25-20€/$, it's just a subpar game in all categorie it try to get into. Even for the coop it's not worth it as it's clunky and badly put in place with expensive lootcrate with 3 item (85% of the time worthless item such as booster)			"

												I would be willing to look past the most ridiculous story of any FPS I've ever played.... if it wasn't for the cutscenes that cannot be skipped force feeding the faux character motivation down your throat every time the writers want to advance the plot.  Even worse than the usual cutscenes are the numerous ""walk and talk"" cutscenes where you have to walk (not run!) behind someone and listen to them gradually deliver their dialog, hoping that each measured line is that characters last.  These garrulous NPCs are the real villians of this game!  If only you could shoot them as well.  Unfortunately just like the cutscenes, the NPCs delivery of their cherished plot lines cannot be ended prematurely.  At least with the usual cutscenes I can get up and go make a sandwhich and maybe it will be over when I get back.			"

My experience with this game in a nutshell.[i.imgur.com]Seriously though, let me elaborate a bit. Everything starts with this dramatic and unbelievable story where North Korea sells tech to the US, and once they're the most trusted brand, they exploit a global backdoor to takeover the government. Whatever, I just wanna be a punk and kill soldiers. Anarchy forever, right?Well, let's just say that the ""resistance"" you're a part of it's actually a full blown military operation and everybody is a soldier... they just dress like punks because it looks cool, but they're not mere rebels. Everything is meticulously calculated and coordinated, they have high end tech, bases, recon squads, arsenals, tactical strategy planning... bloody hell, the only thing missing is having my fellow ""rebels"" using the NATO alphabet for comms. There is absolutely no sense of chaos and I don't feel like a rebel at all.There's a HEAVY amount of handholding (luckily you can disable most of it). NPCs talking through voice comms all the time, blabbering meaningless stuff that is supposed to make you feel tacticool, only reinforcing what I stated in the previous paragraph. I was quickly introduced to a bunch of mechanics (smartphone, weapon upgrading, camera, maps, etc.) and the only thing going through my head was ""is this really necessary? Why can't they just throw me into the action? Why don't they stop talking and stating the obvious? Why can't they let me figure things out by myself?"". It's so bad I got achievements for doing literally nothing... I went through a hole in the wall, boom, achievement. I'm not exaggerating.AI is astoundingly dumb. Right after I got my first weapon, I went into the first underground area and killed everybody (I didn't know they were my allies). The game will try to stop you by not letting you aim at the NPC's but you can kill them anyway... you can even throw molotovs at them and THEY WON'T REACT AT ALL LMAO. I'd expect them to charge against me or at least run for their lives... nope, they just stand there and say their generic idle voicelines while you kill them. What happens if you throw a molotov towards an essential NPC? They burn and flap their arms and magically stop burning after a few secs; reach them and they'll talk to you like nothing happened.Play on hard difficulty, disable the HUD clutter - doesn't matter, game is ez af. Walk the streets, see a hot blondie, recruit her, headshot a NK guard from a long distance and no alarms will be rung. Enter a random building, see more snipars, patiently walk up the stairs and annihilate them at point-blank range, repeat a couple of times, BOOM, YOU WON, NEW BASE LIBERATED, PLAYER YOU'RE SUCH A WINNER AND HARDCORE SOLD--I MEAN REBEL, SINGLE-HANDEDLY WINNING THE W--REBELLION, JUST WOW. The whole game is a giant scripted event that reeks of Call of Duty.I wanted to take advantage of the free weekend and basically finish it for free, but it didn't hold my attention. Sound design is good, atmosphere is great, it's demanding enough to tax my rig... but it's casual garbage. Waste of 40GB.Edit. it also crashes all the time.			"

												I heard a lot of people ♥♥♥♥♥ing up a storm about this game and I figured I'd give it a try for myself.  Despite a rough start and some jank here and there in the form of hitched objective progression that required a couple of restart checkpoints to remedy, the game has overall been pretty crash / glitch free.  The game is graphically impressive cranked all the way up, but it should be noted that on my i7 4790k / 980ti / ssd system I had to drop a few things down from very high to high, namely particle density and object detail, but all the other options were maxed at 1080 and I got a solid 60fps with vsync.  Some strange hitching whenever autosaves are happening, but not too bad beyond that.  The lighting at night in the rain is really quite pretty, and there are really impressive dust storms and fog effects on top of some ridiculously high res textures and water effects make for a better looking game than anything on offer in Fallout 4 and I'd even say there are aspects of the engine that look better than GTA V in an open world setting.  I hope they finish optimizing the game for ultra settings.  The gameplay is a mix of Far Cry and Metal Gear in some weird ways, and there are even times when I found myself feeling like I was in a Fallout game.  Stealth play is viable in most scenarios and the tools given to you come together later in the game to make for some interesting sabotage / raid situations.  A good mix of mission objectives and open world enemy population / mission spawning ensures that you're always doing something different for what feels like the first 15 hours, after which the game settles in to a routine that I've little hope will change much through to the end, but that is OK because the gameplay loop is rather fun.  It should also be noted that the shooting is rather unforgiving and there are some guided mission objectives that are brutal and demanding.  I almost gave up once or twice, but if you power on and have Dark Souls patience in you then eventually you'll get the hang of it.  I'm playing on the medium difficulty and finding it just right.  AI in general is a bit wonky but enemy engagements are good enough.  Your friendly AI is indeed a bit dumb, but they serve as fodder long enough to give you the upper hand.  This seems to be their job and they do it well enough.  Having just played DOOM and Uncharted 4 I came into this game with low expectations, between the highs those two games gave me and the review embargo for this game coupled with all the toxic forum discussions about what a turd this game was going to be I have to say that I'm glad I ignored all the naysayers.  I'm looking forward to taking my time with the rest of the game.  From what I've been reading about where I'm at in the campaign, I have another 10-15 hours to go on top of the 20 I already sunk in, and for my money that is a pretty good deal.  I'd give this one a try.   "

												I really enjoyed playing this game.  Cudos to developers for putting together a great single player campaign.  I will say I purchased this game after most of the reported bugs had been patched and had no problems running the game on medium settings with my gtx 760 2 gb card.  This game is running on the crysis engine, which is a lot more demanding than other graphic engines I know of.  This game is worlds better than the first game.   If you are trying to decide if you should buy this game, ignore the overwhelming negative reviews....they are mostly pre-patch reviews where people were having performance issues.  Pro's + Great environment and sense of detail+ Weapon changing system very creative and fun to interact with+Story kept me engaged for a respectable 18 plus hours...Yes it is hard to beleive North Korea took over US but the devs had to stay in keeping with the first game.+Great graphics and sound effects....will definitely replay once I upgrade my graphics cardCon's -While the zones were decent in size, I wish the zones would have been linked into one zone...more open worldOverall, if you enjoy first person, open world games, you should pick up Homefront.  Support the people who went through so much and so many years to bring us this great titile.  I hope to see a sequel to this game in the future.			"

Posted: September 16, 2016
												The game was recently up for a free weekend, and despite the mixed reviews, I enjoyed the game enough to purchase it on sale. All in all I think there's a lot to enjoy here. First the bad - the noted frame rate drops, and the occasional minor bug typical of open world games - NPCs mispathing, or blocking doors or staircases; a few minor  missteps when jumping or looting, etc., and some audio bugs with speeches playing over each other, but over all there were no game breaking bugs and no crashes or freezes at all.The good - in terms of gameplay, the story and world gameplay both unfold nicely. The open world setting works very well for the style of game - some areas start out clean and pristine, and there's a good mix of stealth gameplay and action as you move throughout the zones, sabatoging and taking on random events and exploration. As you progress the citizens around you start to rise up, attacking guards, spraypainting walls, etc. You see the effects of your progress on the world and it helps create a lot of immersion.In terms of mechanics, the gunplay is average - there are some fairly bullet spongey enemies, but you're able to upgrade your weapons in order to reduce that. AI is decent - enemies will take cover and throw grenades, but they're fairly same-ish for the most part. There's not a massive variety of weapons, but it makes sense in the context of the game world. Ambushing patrols with remote explosives is a lot of fun and definitely makes you feel like you're playing the part of a revolutionary.The story and voice acting are acceptable and move the action forward but they're not winning any awards. Graphics are good and it runs well on older hardware, aside from the aformentioned frame rate drops, which seem to occur regardless of your specs. Overall if you get this game on sale, it's a good time and I found myself wanting to play more. Unfortunatly any online play seems to be dead, but I bought this mainly for single player and it lived up to my expectations.			"

												I would give this a 7.5/10, the game has some glitches/bugs and you will notice some if you play the story for a decent amount of time, it has poor multiplayer but what it lacks in multiplayer it compensates in the singleplayer story. What i noticed was the lack of options for the graphics and mouse sensivity but you can adjust it at a mediocre level. The gameplay is very imersive has lots of customization options i specially loved the stealth but everyone has it playstyle and i bet that all of them work, the only downside i noticed was the AI being a bit weird sometimes where the bots would stay still while getting shot. Graphics wise they are pretty good and they look even better with the day/night cicle where you can see beautiful sunsets and can also experience some night combat. Let's go kill some KPA!

												Played this for free over the weekend and bought it soon after. Very much a Farcry clone,  but that's not a bad thing.  The key thing for me is the atmosphere of this game.  You genuinely do feel like a freedom fighter and the myriad of activities and missions contribute to this feeling.  The graphics are fabulous on my 980ti at 1440p and it generally runs really well (there is the odd stutter,  but think that is linked to the auto save function). I waited to try this game after the criticism upon launch,  but fair dos to Dambusters as they have fixed 95 percent of issues (on my rig anyway). If you are a Farcry fan then try this game,  you will not be disappointed.  If you hate Farcry then steer clear.  It's really that simple.			"

There is some downsides though, I never felt SUPER attached to the campaign or story for example when a big character would die Id just be like,"" welp♥♥♥♥♥♥"" It wasent like gears of war, red faction, arma 3, and bunch of more attached feeling campaignes.

												I played this game during the FREE WEEKEND on steam.Now the review.I went into this game excited as I've been watching this game ever since it was announced but was saddened by all the negative reviews. When there was a free weekend I was stoked and tried it out.First off the graphics are very detailed and the lighting effects are amazing. Just the general atmoshpere is really immersive as you feel like you are living within an occupied city. The story seems a bit far fetched but hey its still a good game.Secondly I will say that from the time I played it I realise why people were mad about the game as you do need a beefy computer in order to run it but they have released patches to make the game run smoother but since I do not have the game yet I do not know how big of a change this has had. Luckily my computer is beefy and ran the game very well.So overall I enjoyed it but do admit the game was unoptimized at the time and a slightly beefy computer was required for this game. Once I buy the game I'll update my review to give a more complete review of it.			"

												Homefront The Revolution is not as bad of a game as the reviews seem to suggest. It has some good stuff such as the weapon progression, customisation, decent combat and beautiful graphics. Its essentially a FarCry 3/4 rip but has its own unique features. The problem with it is all the good only lasts 2 hours, after that it is just a reprtitive game with no incentive to finish. Games like this need a strong narrative to incentivise players to finish it. I doubt I will continue with it but for the price I got it for ($17AUD) it was definately worth it.			"

												I enjoyed this game. At first I had problems with performance but after tweaking and lowering graphic settings I got it to run about 40-60 fps when outside with minimum 30. Should also mention that my computer is below minimum requirements with GPU. Gameplay is like all the open world games(Far Cry 3/AssAssIn Creed) - You have a map where you can run around and you must retake outposts.  You can upgrade your weapons and each weapon has three configurations for example your assault rifle can be  also machine gun  or 20 mm rocket launcher.Single player campaign for me was 20-21 hours with every outpost taken. Story was OK, there were some things that were interesting but most of it was expected.I tried multiplayer and it the first impression was good, but I am not interested in multiplayer. It's coop only multiplayer.Music was okay and I think there were 2 songs that IMO were quite good.Flaws? Performance could have been better. More gun upgrades. There were some bugs, nothing game breaking, just visual bugs.Conclusion: If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and other open world games then you'll like this too.			"

												Just picked this game up while on special. So far I am thoroughly enjoying it. It has elements of Crysis (weapon mods, but this game takes it further), Open world FPS similar to Farcry Series (same take, hold, discover), Run, set traps just like (Dead Island) Bit of Parkour like (Dying light). The scripted scenes are very well done. The details of the game is amazing. Yes there are the of graphics glitches. Yes soldiers are there interogating a civilian one second and gone the next without any intervention. Yes there are some building glitches where gaps in the buildings don't quite line up...BUT its still a fun game. Whether its 60 to 80 hours worth like Farcry, GTA, Mafia, Fallout. Only time will tell. I suspect the game has been refined and patched since initial release.			"

												I had some pretty low expectations for this game. Virtually every critic seemed to hate it. And I get it, it's a pretty generic shooter with a lot of half-executed ideas. But what's there is fun. A ridiculous plot sets up some big set pieces, but for the most part you're free to roam around a section of the city and slowly liberate areas - which makes traversing around as a trespasser much easier. Stealth is handled competently and the gun play is fun, albeit shallow. The best parts are definitely scouting out locations and climbing rooftops to figure out how to recapture occupied areas.For around $10 on sale, this game is a neat shooter with some memorable moments.

												This game was much better for me, than the reviews suggested. It is hard at first, not a Call of Duty, you have to be more tactical, stealthy, mindful of the situation, or you can easily get overwhelmed by enemy reinforcements. Which is great, because the game-play actually conforms to the setting: you are a guerilla freedom fighter against a superior occupier force. You do not have cross-hairs when hip-firing weapons, so you need to use the iron sights or the scope upgrades or laser sights. Health is not regenerating, you have to find and keep a supply of medkits. Even if you take down a soldier quietly, or disable a camera someone will soon come to investigate. Your eye needs a bit of time to get used to quick changes in light and dark, just like in real life, so you need to calculate with this.The open world concept is good to, you have to take back outposts for the Resistance, do story missions and side quests (like in Far Cry 3, 4). There are some light platforming and environmental puzzles, not many, but enough to change up the pace. You need to scavenge the ruins of the city to get resources for upgrades and new weapons.Graphics is great, detailed and it works well with the atmosphere of a city after an invasion, with burnt out houses, car wrecks, trash on the streets. The NPCs are well designed, the Norks are hi-tech, the resistance fighters are ragged with salvaged clothes, weapons and equipment.The story is OK (not great though), the cast of characters are OK, but not great, the voice and face acting is acceptable. The game gives you some food for thought about the difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist, you can see yourself as either or both at times.It is not all good though... People said the game is buggy, I myself did not encounter many bugs, but there were some annoying crashes. Also the spawning can be weird, sometimes an enemy soldier will just appear from nowhere, or de-spawn (one time I wanted to get a better angle on a convoy of enemies, so I went around a car, and when I got to the other side they just disappeared). Checkpoints are a bit weird too.All in all the Revolution was great fun, I can recommend it if you want a more tactical open world shooter with a great atmosphere.			"

												It looks pretty great, it runs really good (for me) and the gunplay is really solid, there's a nice atmosphere to the game and it feels organic. The plot is the only real downside, it comes off real corny sometimes. The multiplayer's been really great fun too			"

												This game really could have been great if maybe there had been more playtesting and tweaking of the controls? Riding a motorcycle is pointless as it's impossible to control. I also feel like my gun fire is all over the place. I also DESPISE checkpoint games. Why can't we just go back to the old Quicksave world where you get to keep every inch of progress you earn in a game? Grrrr. Still - the game is gorgeous and framerates high and smooth.... I'll keep playing it but I would change a few things about it if I could.			"

												I enjoyed this game. Even though that's apparently a carnal sin to some people on the forums of this game. Got it for the free weekend and honestly, if I'd have had the money I would have bought it in the sale to replay it at some point. The game's actually solid, even if the weapon system is restricting (Not a fan of the games that give you one type of assault rifle and have that whole kit swapping thing). The biggest draw for me was that you felt like an actual revolutionary, using hit and run attacks on KPA officials in their convoys, subtly killing lone soldiers dumb enough to walk on the back streets with no backup, and dismantling the propaganda machines. I loved using the molotovs in the game, observing KPA patrols and then tossing a molotov into the middle of them and bolting before they figured out what'd happened.I enjoyed it, I'd recommend it while it was on sale.

												I really enjoyed playing this game.  Cudos to developers for putting together a great single player campaign.  I will say I purchased this game after most of the reported bugs had been patched and had no problems running the game on medium settings with my gtx 760 2 gb card.  This game is running on the crysis engine, which is a lot more demanding than other graphic engines I know of.  This game is worlds better than the first game.   If you are trying to decide if you should buy this game, ignore the overwhelming negative reviews....they are mostly pre-patch reviews where people were having performance issues.  Pro's + Great environment and sense of detail+ Weapon changing system very creative and fun to interact with+Story kept me engaged for a respectable 18 plus hours...Yes it is hard to beleive North Korea took over US but the devs had to stay in keeping with the first game.+Great graphics and sound effects....will definitely replay once I upgrade my graphics cardCon's -While the zones were decent in size, I wish the zones would have been linked into one zone...more open worldOverall, if you enjoy first person, open world games, you should pick up Homefront.  Support the people who went through so much and so many years to bring us this great titile.  I hope to see a sequel to this game in the future.			"

Although the game play was a bit laggy at times - even when I lowered the settings from what had automatically been selected, it had overall good mechanics and great graphics and decently smart AI. There were a few glitches that threw me outside the map when jumping a fence, but other than that, a very good experience.			"

												(I never post reviews sorry if this is not very professional.)At this point I have completed the game and played all the DLC content that has come with it. The only thing i was not able to experience was the multiplayer due to lack of people playing it. I purchased the game + freedom fighter bundle which came with all the DLC for about $11At the price I payed this game was 150% worth it. I would say that at a the $60 price for the game + DLC is worth it. I am not going to tell you the game is perfect it is not. The open world has its positives and negetives. I feel like you are not punished enough for death in the game as i was frequesntly able to just run and gun while single handedly killing hundreds of KPA securing objectives in each zone. You can recruit AI resistance to fight with you but I never found it needed. If i did die I simply was just sent to a safe house with no real penalty and able to do the mission again. The open world is also very repetitive. The same style of missions over and over to secure a zone and compell the average people to resist.The gun play in the game is decent feels smooth and kills are satisfying. the game does lack where it comes to performance. I dont have a top of the line rig but i feel like my amd 480 and I5-6400 should have been able to run it at the High setting that were recommended. However the game still looked very good at medium setting getting a steady 60 fps. Where this game really shined for me though waws the story. it had a bit of a slow point in the middle but overall it was solid. The characters were very believeable and I felt myself becoming attatched to them throughout the story. The writing was good the setting felt fitting and the backstory was a little far fetched but you could see it. The DLC were also very nice. one is more a prologue and the other two take you to thge events after the main campaign, allowing you to countinue where you left off. Overall I personally give the game a 7/10 I enjoyed my time playing it and would recommend it to a freind even at full price.			"

												If you like Far Cry style games, where you are in an open area and have to take over outposts, you will probably like this game. With the gun play and gadgets in the game, this was where the main fun was for me in this game. However, I found the set plays in this game annoying due to bad AI and glitches. I have seen people sitting in cars that don't exist, for example. I have had missions that dont go correctly because the trigger for the next part of the mission doesn't work. Due to these glitches, I would only recommend to buy this game on sale.			"

												This game sat on my wishlist for a while. I had always wanted to try out the series, but I wasn't willing to pay full price. During the fall sale, I picked it up for about $13, which I think is a super fair price for this game. After playing it, I can safely say that it was worth that price. I still don't think I'd ever pay full price for it, but it's really not a bad game. The mechanics, like others have said, are a lot like Crysis, which makes sense since it was built in Cryengine. Add in the parkour elements and stealth action of Dying Light, and you generally have the mechanics of this game. The graphics are pretty good, and I find the gunplay fairly great as well. My only complaint is that the game can get stale quickly once you figure out you repeat the same things over and over. Overall, I enjoyed it.			"

												With all of the negative press and steam reviews, I picked up this game after a lot of hesitation.  I kept waiting to find some gamebreaking bug or for the story to suck, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed this game, and I actually thought the story was great.  It definitely isn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than some of the reviews would have you believe.If you are an ultra-PC SJW, this game will probably trigger you.  But if you want to take on the role of an American insurgent, fighting against foreign occupants, and go full-on 'Murica mode, then you need to play Homefront: The Revolution.			"

												Its sort of fun in a nutshell.Has the feeling/gameplay type like far cry 3/4.. you know the so called allied. Those allies not doing anything but yet showing up after the battle to have the stones to take credit for taking credit and then wanting your help. Just like.. far cry 3.AI sucks though on your side of course, the enemies hack through walls maybe 25-30% of the time so they'll see you through it some how. Or they'll just spawn like directly behind you. Which is annoying as all can get out. No major bugs but I got it when they've probably fixed most of what others had in the beginning plus for 20$.. Its worth it probably. I say 20 cause I got it cheaper with steam wallet.Also even though I recommend it I doubt there will be a third. Considering that the first homefront botched its release by bugginess and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ campaign. Now this one being the exact same on launch day with having problems. So.. pretty sure sales on both and reviews at the start have killed the franchise.			"

												I avoided this game in the beginning after hearing so many terrible reviews due to optimization. However, after playing it over the free weekend, I immediately bought it. The game runs smooth as glass, the graphics and gameplay are both great, it's not a massive system hog, and the story is actually very good and quite long. It took about 30 hours to beat. The co-op play is a lot of fun as well and finally you can play a game with friends without having to be amped up on cocaine and Red Bull to have enough reflexes just to kill something.The story is quite a bit of a stretch, what with the US being beholden to North Korea for its technology and finances. Yes, you will need to suspend reality a bit to enjoy it, but it IS enjoyable. I have a sneaking suspicion that originally it was about China, but possibly due to real-world political and PR fallout they decided to substitute China for North Korea. This is just my opinion and speculation. Think of it more of an alternate reality than an actual cold war Red Dawn scenario, where there really was a credible fear of a Soviet attack.All in all, I give it an 8.5 out of 10. I would give it a 9, but I would have liked more weapons in the game. Yes, I do like the system of customization and cannabilizing weapons for parts to create new upgrades, but I would have liked to do that with different types of rifles and submachine guns, not just an AR-15 that turns into a SAW and a pistol that turns into some half♥♥♥♥♥SMG. Also, being unable to pick up enemies' weapons is pretty lame, although I guess it could be argued that they would all have electronic trigger locks for each individual. Finally, I would have liked to have more accessories, such as silencers for the sniper rifle. It's not a big deal, but it would've added more to the stealth aspect, which is lacking. But, then again, you're a resistance fighter, not a ninja.The obvious parallels to Far Cry are there, with the only real difference being there is no vehicle usage in the game. I actually kinda liked that, because it's not very realistic that the average resistance fighter would know how to drive a futuristic North Korean tank.Finally, I'm very excited that they're planning DLCs in the form of both Co-Op multiplayer maps and big single player maps as well. I will be keeping this game on my hard drive for a while, and I might just replay the single player again. It's a lot of fun and you would be missing out on a great experience if you don't buy this massively (at least now) underrated game. If you like FPS games but despise the spastic 11-year-old♥♥♥♥♥♥talking CoD scene, get this game. Is it worth the full price? Yes, in my opinion. Others may disagree but I think 50 bucks is fair for this game, especially since it runs so well now.Is it worth the sale price? Absolutely. It would be criminal to overlook it on sale.			"

												This game was much better for me, than the reviews suggested. It is hard at first, not a Call of Duty, you have to be more tactical, stealthy, mindful of the situation, or you can easily get overwhelmed by enemy reinforcements. Which is great, because the game-play actually conforms to the setting: you are a guerilla freedom fighter against a superior occupier force. You do not have cross-hairs when hip-firing weapons, so you need to use the iron sights or the scope upgrades or laser sights. Health is not regenerating, you have to find and keep a supply of medkits. Even if you take down a soldier quietly, or disable a camera someone will soon come to investigate. Your eye needs a bit of time to get used to quick changes in light and dark, just like in real life, so you need to calculate with this.The open world concept is good to, you have to take back outposts for the Resistance, do story missions and side quests (like in Far Cry 3, 4).

HOMEFRONT is a HOMERUN! THE ABYSMAL STORE RATINGS DO THIS GAME NO JUSTICE! GRAB THIS GAME IF YOU ENJOYED FAR CRY'S GAMEPLAY. YOU WILL HAVE AN ABSOLUTE BLAST PLAYING HOMEFRONT :)Good:— Art direction (Aesthetic is very similar to Showtime's JEREMIAH)— High production value (Fluid, optimized cinematic graphics and presentation)— Alternate history sets platform for main narrative; structure/story akin to K.♥♥♥♥♥♥s 'Man in the High Castle' — Addictive on-the-fly weapon modification system. Remember Crysis? It take's Crysis' 'weapon wheel' modification mechanic and gives it an overdose of dbol. This is probably my favorite mechanic in the game and it really amps up your versatility and allows the user to have a very creative and addicting gunslinging experience.— Co-op system with plenty of content— Well-rounded achievement/trophy system— Tangible hit registration really adds a high level of satisfaction to the gunplay in Homefront. The fights are fast and deadly (playing on the highest difficulty) and they're usually pretty challenging. Go to a checkpoint and wait for an enemy dropship to hover over you if you're looking for a good skirmish :)— BF4 style cover system (proximity covering as opposed to manual covering)— Hacking equips that allows you to hijack enemy munitions and systems— Really well done atmosphere and lore. Picking up journals and walking around areas of Philly watching NPCs go about their scripted business is a pretty enveloping experience. This game is a labour of love and the immense detail in the ambience and gameplay definitely shows itBad:— Facial recognition needs improvement. Lip synching doesn't look natural (think Anime dubs but slightly less glaring)— Looping. There's moments in the game where you'll hear the same announcements/musings from an NPC/Zone PSA at such a rapid interval that it quickly will irritate the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you (well, it irked the crap out of me--perhaps you are more tolerant than i?). First example that pops into my head is the first time you find yourself outside, looking for your first stash house. You'll hear the same exact PSA announcement every 5-10 seconds, as well as ingame ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s saying ""where you going? come back!"" followed immediately by the same women exclaiming ""no! please, don't!"". The AI--at least, when it comes to random events/conversations--just feels very unnatural. Part of the illusion that bolsters immersion (good NPC dialogue/interactions) is severely crippled because of looping (in my opinion). — Main plot device seems ridiculously improbable. In this alternative timeline, North Korea somehow becomes a financial superpower stemming from a tech boom during the space-race era due to a conglomerate known as APEX. In this timeline, America eventually hits full economic collapse and resembles third world nations, prompting a request for humanitarian and economic aide from North Korea. The entire background portrait of the game's plot just seems ridiculously laughable because of how contrary it is to current events and the modern geopolitical landscape. In that same stroke, however, it could also be seen as a sort of genius plot which embelishes the North Korean/Western conflict and satirizes it to the utmost extreme.— Only co-op, no TDM/FFA/S&D/KOTH team based multiplayer. Real bummer. The game's mechanics and scope are PERFECT for a team/faction based shooter and it would have a real shot at being a competitive shooter--It could be something similar to Red Faction/Freedom Fighters mixed with Planetside/Battlefield's MMOFPS server technology, but at this point in the conversation I'm just speculating/dreaming. Ugly:— No innovation. While Homefront earns high marks from me across the board in relation to how polished the game's mechanics are, it earns a big fat 0 from me if we start talking about what new mechanic or feature Homefront brings to the table. The answer to that is a resounding nothing; Homefront pretty much feels like a well-crafted amalgam of your favorite sandbox and fps games. We've got Far Cry 3's interface mimicked damn-near to a T, Crysis' weapon mod and weapon crafting wheels copied and improved upon, and GTA's PDA/Camera Phone 'Hub'/Ingame Menu system. — Audio mixing seems muddled at points. High volumes often sound muted and muddied while lower ambience volumes can at times sound overpowering and obnoxious. This can largely be remedied by manipulating the options menu, but the fact that such a workaround is required by the player should be indicative of an optimization problem (fortunately, this issue with the audio is the only real optimization problem that I encountered).— You lose your 'Valuables'/loot on death. A punitive permadeath mechanic that just feels oddly out of place in a game like this. While it's not enough to make you shed tears, it'll definitely be enough to make you rage for an extended moment or two as you realize you just lost thousands of dollars in crafting components or vendor junk which could have secured you a fat new weapons upgrade or valuable equipment acquisition. If sandbox shooters like Farcry, Borderlands and MGS 5 tickle your fancy, you owe it to yourself to cop Homefront and give it a whirl. Wait for a sale if you're still weary about making the plunge.

												I enjoyed this game. At first I had problems with performance but after tweaking and lowering graphic settings I got it to run about 40-60 fps when outside with minimum 30. Should also mention that my computer is below minimum requirements with GPU. Gameplay is like all the open world games(Far Cry 3/AssAssIn Creed) - You have a map where you can run around and you must retake outposts.  You can upgrade your weapons and each weapon has three configurations for example your assault rifle can be  also machine gun  or 20 mm rocket launcher.Single player campaign for me was 20-21 hours with every outpost taken. Story was OK, there were some things that were interesting but most of it was expected.I tried multiplayer and it the first impression was good, but I am not interested in multiplayer. It's coop only multiplayer.Music was okay and I think there were 2 songs that IMO were quite good.Flaws? Performance could have been better. More gun upgrades. There were some bugs, nothing game breaking, just visual bugs.Conclusion: If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and other open world games then you'll like this too.			"

												Homefront The Revolution is not as bad of a game as the reviews seem to suggest. It has some good stuff such as the weapon progression, customisation, decent combat and beautiful graphics. Its essentially a FarCry 3/4 rip but has its own unique features. The problem with it is all the good only lasts 2 hours, after that it is just a reprtitive game with no incentive to finish. Games like this need a strong narrative to incentivise players to finish it. I doubt I will continue with it but for the price I got it for ($17AUD) it was definately worth it.			"

The game's mechanics and scope are PERFECT for a team/faction based shooter and it would have a real shot at being a competitive shooter--It could be something similar to Red Faction/Freedom Fighters mixed with Planetside/Battlefield's MMOFPS server technology, but at this point in the conversation I'm just speculating/dreaming. Ugly:— No innovation. While Homefront earns high marks from me across the board in relation to how polished the game's mechanics are, it earns a big fat 0 from me if we start talking about what new mechanic or feature Homefront brings to the table. The answer to that is a resounding nothing; Homefront pretty much feels like a well-crafted amalgam of your favorite sandbox and fps games. We've got Far Cry 3's interface mimicked damn-near to a T, Crysis' weapon mod and weapon crafting wheels copied and improved upon, and GTA's PDA/Camera Phone 'Hub'/Ingame Menu system. — Audio mixing seems muddled at points. High volumes often sound muted and muddied while lower ambience volumes can at times sound overpowering and obnoxious. This can largely be remedied by manipulating the options menu, but the fact that such a workaround is required by the player should be indicative of an optimization problem (fortunately, this issue with the audio is the only real optimization problem that I encountered).— You lose your 'Valuables'/loot on death. A punitive permadeath mechanic that just feels oddly out of place in a game like this. While it's not enough to make you shed tears, it'll definitely be enough to make you rage for an extended moment or two as you realize you just lost thousands of dollars in crafting components or vendor junk which could have secured you a fat new weapons upgrade or valuable equipment acquisition. If sandbox shooters like Farcry, Borderlands and MGS 5 tickle your fancy, you owe it to yourself to cop Homefront and give it a whirl. Wait for a sale if you're still weary about making the plunge.

												Due to the first Homefront being so bad, I didn't buy The Revolution when it came out. It was on special recently, so I thought I'd try it out. This game is highly underrated! It feels like a mix of Half-Life, Far Cry and Crysis. Three games I loved playing.Pros:+ The Revolution is an exceptional open world experience. + The story was good enough. It was never dull or boring. You can also complete the campaign objectives in your own time.+ There are many challenges and objectives to keep you busy.+ The map is highly detailed and very accessible. You will be able to access most areas of the map. This includes being able to climb and jump over and through things.+ The maps offer some great platforming challenges to reach objectives.+ It took me 25 hours to liberate all areas of the map. This excludes the small stuff, like finding remaining radios. So, you get your money's worth. The story took 20 hours and it was an additional 5 hours to work my way back and complete objectives I missed along the way.+ Areas of the map differ in atmosphere and purpose, which keeps the game fresh.+ The AI is solid and a good challenge. + A strong point is the game's weapons, attachments and customisations. A very well designed and accessible armoury made the game highly enjoyable.+ By the end of the game, I had unlocked everything and had all weapons and customisations available to me.+ The RC car fitted with various devices was a thoroughly satisfying way of completing challenges.Cons:- You cannot go prone. - Fitting a bipod on my sniper rifle, for stabilty improvement, and not actually being able to use it was disappointing e.g. crouching by a window and actually having a key to deploy it.- The sniper rifle does not have a suppressor attachment. It is loud and attracts AI.- At times, a group of AI in the distance (on the street) will just disappear. This becomes noticeable if you also enjoy sniping from cover at a distance. This won't happen when clearing AI from a base though.- The final part of the story (last few minutes) is on rails which really let the game down. It is almost as if they had rushed to complete the game.The small glitches are insignificant and don't negatively affect the experience at all.I really enjoyed playing this game and highly recommend it, even at the full price. I give it an 8/10.UPDATE: I initially played the game on the Hardened setting. I started a new game on the highest level of difficulty. After a few hours, the game feels the same and you shouldn't bother playing again if you are expecting a bigger challenge.			"

												This is definately a step up from the first Homefront game.  It reminds me of Red Faction: Guerilla, the Saboteur, and maybe a little GTA.  The world is open but manageable.  The look and feel are spot on and the gun play is as good as any other current shooter.  It came across as a little to predictable for me so don't expect much from the story.  I was plesantly amused by the upgrades to the guns.  Maybe all weapons should be so easily swapped out with parts to make other bigger weapons.  I initially loved the idea of hoping on a motorcycle until I tried it.  Too much debri on the streets and using the keyboard to drive made the experience a hectic motorcross nightmare.  Claiming locations to free up the map was a bit too easy also.  Simply activate the console, laptop, pressure valve and the area is yours.  All the enemies vanish and your own troops take up residence.It's a good run around game where you get to shoot at guys or drones for a bit.  Not the best game ever and certainly stuff we have seen a time or two before, but much better than the original.			"

Posted: September 11, 2016
												Listen, I'm gonna be honest with you guys, this game ain't crap.  Here's what some people have said and here's what I think about it.""This game's too repetitive.""Shooter's are repetitive, numbnuts.  You point and shoot things, that's COD, Arma, Battlefield, Goldeneye, it's all of them. You should probably stop playing shooters.Yeah, a lot of the open world side quests might seem cut and paste, and some of them are but to me that's okay.  Each time you clear a stronghold or clear a strikepoint you gain part of the map, but it's enticing to see the map turn from red to blue.  And at that, most of the strikepoints are different, and you can decide to take different approaches to each of these objectives.  And the impression I got from other reviews was that I was going to have to incite rebellion in like 20 districts and it's this long and grindy process and the devs did this just for an ""open world"" concept.  That's nonsense, you do that 3 times, it's not that hard to, and I had a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun doing it.As a matter of fact guys, stealth does infact work. Stop sucking at the game, please.On another note, it's more andmore challenging as the game goes on to find the routes you need to take to get to the places you need to get to complete the objectives. And in a way it brings an adventure aspect tot he game, and some of the routes can get tricky with different things you need to set off to make a path connecting buildings or whatever.  So I guess people don't like thinking either. It get's too repetitive I guess.""The story sucks.""I mean, these guys didn't write Star Wars or anything.  Yeah, North Korea's not ever going to be in a position to exhibit this much control, nor have they ever been interested in ""humanitarian"" efforts.  But the story they set up creates an immersive and interesting environment to explore and fight in.  And at that, you actually feel like you're fighting a superior military force.  And still, the story is designed to question whether or not you should like the characters, and while sometimes it plays on cliches it's still original.""It's not really open world.""Really? What's all this freeroaming I'm doing?  There's like 4 or 5 sections that are almost a kilometer across that you freeroam in.  You don't know what you're talking about.And yeah, you can't go back and freeroam after you beat the story.  You couldn't in Super Mario Bros either to unlock the rest of the levels. Guess that's a♥♥♥♥♥♥game too.Whelp, I had fun beating this game for the first time. I'm gonna do it again, because I happen to like trying to find ways to survive when you're outnumbered and outgunned and that is the point. Death can be a bit problematic in this game.  Almost done cracking a stronghold? Got like 90 valuables in your pack you're gonna sell? Progress wiped, start again. Cover is important, because AI is lethal, and that's another thing.""The AI sucks.""AI sucks in every game. It sucked in Smash Melee, it sucked in Soul Calibur, it sucked in COD, it sucked in every strategy game ever, and it's always going to suck.To be honest, I thought the AI in this game was a bit better.  There were only two instances of me finding AI spawning on top of me and one was because I shot ym rifle in a safe zone and the other was cuz I was storming a stronghold and apparently there was a spawn point there.  As for actual movement and play of the AI, they do lethal damage and aren't to be underestimated. And when they have numbers, they will flank you, which is the smart thing to do. But you can trick large groups into trying to approach you up a staircase and you can just gun em down easy, but there's ways to gimp AI in every game, you just have to learn how and decide what you're gonna do with this knowledge.  Does the AI suck? No, it's AI, and it works like it's supposed to.  And again, don't underestimate them. You will die.Do me a favor, y'all stop bein ♥♥♥♥♥es, k? K thx.This game was pretty good, and as far as mechanics and environments go this is pretty much everything I wanted in a shooter. There's a lot of ways to take on the enemy, stealth, bring a gun, bring some resistance friends, bring a bike, throw some bombs, snipe em down, whatever.  Urban environments are always fun, especially for me.And uh, one last thing. Those myths of frame glitches or whatever the hip new kids are calling it these days, they exist in this game.  Now, two solutions. 1) Get a better system to run this on.  2) Turn the graphics down.  I had a good amount of frame hiccups, and I have to imagine that it was super buggy on release for people to say what they did about the game.  I still like the game though; it's unique in its ability to let me decide how I'm gonna shoot up my neighbor's house.But still, 11/10, would nuke my son and kill Boston (try the damn game).			"

												User dood1234 couldnt have said it any better. I just finished the game and I feel the same now about it as I did when I first started playing. Here is his review and its spot on.""I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to."" -dood1234			"

												I really do not understand why people are giving this game a bad review. Its a great game with a great story, beautiful graphics and combat is fun. People you cant expect to play these games that are running cryengine, turn the graphics all the way up and complain when your fps is horrible because you are playing on either a crappy laptop, a 1990 packard bell, a computer that is running strictly on board graphics or even a computer with hardware from 8 years ago. So what if you ran this other game on such and such setting with your computer so you should be able to run this. No you should not, its not that game. Its just annoying to see bad reviews that are not based on the game itself and if you are tired of having low fps quit being poor and upgrade your hardware or go buy a console.			"

												The game is great..though not the best.  Just beat the game last night b/c I decided to take off work to play Homefront.  Overall a lengthful game, but quite repetative.  It's fun raiding areas and doing strikes...for the first few times, but that gets really old and annoying.  Good things about the game are the upgradable guns.  They have gears that allow to enhance your character(Brady) to take more damage or reload faster. A note though.  This is not an rpg shooter, but I maybe or interested in these takes for fps games.  Having a standard shooter story is very boring and does not have quite the like for me.  Though this game is story focus and this game does not have PVP fights like battlefield or raindbow six.  This game is somewhat comparable to the metro games series.  The story is understandable.  U.S falling into debt to North Korea.  Now they are under their rules until the debt is payed off(surprised China didn't do that in reality).  I did run into some bugs like flickering walls or buildings.  Had some dumb AI's walking towards walls and sudden framedrops.  This only happended early and part of the way to the end.  Great game for one go, but there is no newgame+.  So no second journeys for me.  I'd recommend if you're willing to look past the bad comments and possibly wait for another sale.  Got it during the 23.99 sale.			"

But now the game runs silky smooth!Content wise there's plenty to do - Capture KPA Strongholds, rescue resistance fighters, highjack armoured convoys - there's always something cool to do! It's actually really fun to get all the radios, bike stashes, capture all Strikepoints etc.The multiplayer is really good aswell, but the singleplayer is where it shines.

												Is this a great game? No. Is it worth 40$? Nope. But is it as bad as a lot of people are saying it is? I really don't think so.Homefront: The Revolution has A LOT of problems, some of which I'll list down below, but all in all, I'd honestly say this is a decent game that's worth picking up on the cheap.Positives: - It's gorgeous. Definitely one of the most impressive looking FPS games I've played in a long time.- Great soundtrack.- Decent voice acting and dialogue.- It's a solid PC port. It has a ton of options, and it looks and runs great for me (GTX 970, i7 6700k, 16gb DDR4 RAM).- The gunplay is solid, similar to games like Far Cry and the Metro series.- The attention to detail is seriously spot on. It really feels like you're a part of this dystopian world.Negatives:- The story is pretty generic and is not even worth paying attention to.- The sidequests are pretty terrible, similar to games like Far Cry 4 and No Man's Sky (generic fetch quests).- The core gameplay loop is definitely the worst part about this game, and it can get awfully repetitive going around liberating outposts and stealthing around the city.- There's a significant lack of meaningful content in this game, which is the same problem I have with a lot of modern games like (NMS, Far Cry, Mad Max, Just Cause 3, ROTTR and so on), and it really could've been something great if they focused on the story and the characters, and overall gave the world a little bit more personality.So, overall, I think Homefront is a decent game and I really don't get why people think it's so much worse than your modern Ubisoft fare, like Far Cry 4. If it drops to the 10~15$ mark, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up. "

												Free Weekend PlayerI enjoyed this. It has a lot of problems with bugs and some very janky animations, but when it does get things right, the movement is very fluid. Animations are horrendous, characters look like broken marionettes and facial expressions are next to none.It's basically Far Cry 3 but without the charm. I did enjoy the concept of fitting in with crowds in certain areas, but it fell down a lot in terms of execution. Repetitive activities peppered with flashpoint activities a la Far Cry 4's outpost defence missions, don't hinder the game too much but also don't challenge you much.Characters are one dimensional and bland. Ethan Brady is like a less charming Gordon Freeman, which is difficult to achieve.The weapon conversion system is a nifty idea, but you'll end up relying on one or two weapons for the majority of the game (for me, it was the SMG pistol conversion, and the Marksman Rifle Battle rifle conversion, with the Rocket Launcher for the last third of the game) simply because they are more effective. Overall, it's not an amazing game. It's pretty mediocre really. But I enjoyed it, and honestly I'll probably buy it in the future. It's definitely not a full price purchase though. It's too bland.5/10			"

												This game is very good, the campaign is long, the environment is fairly big, and the mechanics of this game is unique seeing it has a mix of Farcry freeroam yet not so open as such. However, they should continue to expand on that, and with the newest DLC that has just been released, im sad to say they fell very short. As it doesnt even add 20 minutes of gameplay at most. Hell. It could have been part of the main game to begin with, as it isnt DLC worthy.Yes this is a company that has been able to stand up to Ubisoft and go ""♥♥♥♥ you"". But with the latest DLC as an example. They arent going to get much further unless they step their game up. If they continue to go down the path of what was shown in the latest DLC. They wont be in business for much longer, because they will just end up becoming just like Ubisoft. Come on Developers, don't make the game look good so you can steal peoples money. Thats how you lose your business. Make the game entertaining, more specifically make DLC's that further enchances the reputation and the dynamics of the main game, expand it further. So that more people want to play it, and because its good quality, more people will soon get it, and that will earn you more consumers, where as just making it look good and coming out with a DLC that barely adds anything just to steal peoples money will only come back to haunt you, and in this industry, those consequences are to the fullest.Would I recommend this game. Yes. But, that is only for the main game content. Would I still recommend this game if they continue to come out with let down DLC's to grab peoples money. No. So step up your game devs, You are one of the few if not the only company to say ""♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft"" and still be in business. Don't throw all that away.			"

So don't be afraid of the negative reviews. Get this game. You won't be sorry!			"

												Just bad. The combat is bad, the FOV makes the controls bad, the exploration is nonsensical and bad, and the missions are 99% bad busywork. I had to quit playing after only an hour or so due to terrible framerate, crashing, and all the unfun reasons listed above. Please please PLEASE, don't waste your money.			"

												This game is still suffering quite a lot from the stigma of its launch fiasco, so you see a lot of reviews even today downvoting the game, while either not giving an explenation, or talking about trivial things that you find in many succesful titles. I wouldn't rely too much on reviews that say ""0.2 hours played"".I would carefully recommend this game. I haven't encountered any bugs other than the odd popping in/out of objects. The game runs very smoothly and loading screens are swift. So let's get into the gameplay.The way weapons work in this game is satisfying, and requires a little skill with the feedback. It's just right. However, travelling through the city is a bit of a pain, because enemies are everywhere. Too many if you ask me. So it's good to be aware of hiding spots like containers and toilet cabins that you can hide in. Otherwise you'd be fighting forever.The story is nothing extraordinary, it's basically a story about trying to liberate Philadelphia from the control of the North Korean occupiers. The way it's executed is actually pretty good. The missions are varied, the character progression feels pretty organic, as it's entwined with the story. I love doing the main missions in this game.So all in all, I will recommend this game, but not at full price. Get it on sale.			"

This game is pretty sickIn a nutshell, it's a truly decent title. It's demanding on PC, but I haven't had any serious performance issues. The soundtrack is good, the gameplay is solid, and the graphics are superb. I'm really not seeing the problem. I have this feeling that the game isn't to some people's tastes, which is okay, but in addition, some people are determined to hate the thing for whatever reason. It's a semi-open world urban FPS game. There is basically nothing competing with it currently. If you liked Crysis 2, and wished you could have done open world freedom fighter stuff in Crysis 2, this is a game for you. The shooting is a lot better than most games of its type, with non-hitscan weapons and chunky feeling guns. People who accuse the game of bad gunplay are simply wrong.I really like the weapon customization and animation 10/10			"

												Here are just some ideas i thought about the game while playing. its the first review i've written so many words!1. i bought this game on winter sale so the price doesnt matter so much to me.2. the game run well on my pc but abit laggy on co-op mode.3. the game itself could be quite repetitive as in looting bins, dead bodies and taking down enemy towers but the atmosphere was so well done. i died several times cuz it was very easy for soldiers to find and kill me but it felt very realistic. taking down the facilities on normal mode was extrmely hard but there is a sense of achievment, like, sky high.4. looting is something i do so that i could sell it for money but whats the difference between, for e.g., ""canned food"" and ""children's toy""? is something worth more than others?5. the lighting on characters was dark on darker characters....i have to turn on the torch to see their face clearly.,, and with the torch on, moving makes me feel dizzy.6.resistance mode/ co-op is separate from story mode and the missions are quite challenging on normal mode.7. the anime for customising guns look so so cool, but the options are still limited to 3 custimisations for each gun.8. the RC cars made me think of Watchdogs 2, but in this case they expode!

												I bought this game on sale for $9.99 - was worth that! This review is based off that price and the single player section only, I have not played the multiplayer yet and usually don't base my review on that unless it's a multiplayer only game.The game is not bad at all and the story, which they force you to watch, is not so bad either except the fact your forced to watch it. The only real drawback for me in the game is you can't skip a single scene no matter how short or long it is... That can be very anoying at times. I do not however like the ending too much and I won't say anything on how it ends except this: As it gets closer to the end it gets more unpredicable and It's very sad even though the main goal gets accomplished. Also, the ""open world"" they advertise is not a real open world as it's several small areas you have to travel between but rarely ever go from one to the other for a mission, you more like advance to a new area as you finish all the missions in another and never return to that area you finished (you can return to some but really no point). You can explore and interact with the world in each section as you can in other ""open world"" style games, just not as big when your restricted to each section as you progress and cuts down on the open world feeling.The graphics are great but the game even puts a strain on my 970GTX on max settings in some areas... I had a few drops below 20 FPS when in an open area with large gun fights going on. I don't have near that strain in other more graphic intense games it seems.Total time for me to finish the game on easy was 23 hours: this isn't too bad I guess but it could have used a bit more content and missions.Overall: The game was well worth the $9.99 I paid for it!

												GET ON SALE!!!!!7/10The game itself is like farcry, the gun play, the graphics, and the AI. Easy to get used to gun play, graphics look decent enough, nothing that really WOWS except at night gameplay (shading and extras like dust and rain), AI has simple design like farcry, easy to tell whos baddies and goodies. Not much difference in AI, all enemy classes are just clones but hey my 5.56 doesnt care it still mows them down.The missions are pretty liniar, do this do that, some random occuring ""flashpoint"" or w/e it is called, typical event, defend this, kill snipers. The game is just a simple shoot em up, with the nice interchangable weapon rigs and attactments which is an awesome idea.Not a long campaign, something I may come back to and try again. Havn't tried the co-op missions (resistance mode).All-n-all got the game for $10 sale, worth the spare change for a fps with a forgetable story. It's a Homefront game, shoot every none American in the area, move on, wash rinse repeat.			"

												Based off of the free weekend I tried, The only thing wrong I see about this game is that the performance is balls. Other than that, its got a decent story with nice cutscenes, even the voiceover is good like you can tell the devs put a lot of effort. The graphics are really good too. It even plays like your typical Far Cry game but the setting is what really does it for me. Set in Philadellphia where North Koreans have treated Americans like dogs, you must rebel and start resistances throughout different parts of the city to ultimately overthrow the ""Norks"". That is so sick! In Far Cry, you are just getting signals and revealing parts of the map! Trust me, if this game was the original Homefront, people would LOVE this game. I think the reason why people hate on it hard is because of two things.1) Poor optimization = I personally get 40-60 fps on a gtx 970, amd 8320fx and 16gb ram. I get that, that sucks but it does NOT warrant a negative review UNLESS the devs are not putting out patches.From what I understand, they have been pumping patches and actually have a pastebin where they want people to submit their dxdiag logs to see what causes the issue. THAT IS EFFORT. THEY ARE TRYING. WHY DONT YOU BECOME A DEV AND SEE WHY YOUR GAME LAGS ON DIFFERENT BUILDS. DO YOU SEE HOW IT COULD TAKE TIME TO DIAGNOSE THAT?2) Unoriginal ""Far Cry 3"" gameply - It has that ""scavenge, resource, and take over base"" gameplay thats been replicated a lot. I dont mind it. That is all I did the first 3 hours and enjoyed it. If you dont likE that gameplay, that is also fine. It just suits different people well.Overall, I plan on buying the game since the free weekend help me form an opinion on it.			"

												Despite all of the negative reviews, this is a relativley fun game. the gunplay is satisfying and the weapons offer a new twist on the old standbys. The graphics are quite good, and though not perfectly optimized, are capable of creating immersion. Having read and watched many reviews for this game, I believe there was a mob mentality to providing negative reviews. Most were overstated and unrealistically critical. These days it seems that if one thing is not perfect the whole game is bad. Critics have simply become too critical and potentially deny gamers entertaining experiences. As a gamer, I enjoy a multitude of experiences, the more games the better. I don't believe in holding out for the perfect game; it may never come. If the game is on sale, buy it. You will enjoy it.

												Surprise, Homefront sequel is as good as the first. Which with how buggy, poorly written, horribly designed, and cheaply advertised as it was, meant that the bar to do better was set lower than qualifications needed to enroll into ITT Tech. Yet the developers did it, they managed to slide over that bar by making the game visually appealing, and that's about it. Sound design is out of sync, the voice actors seem uninterested, if you listen close enough you can hear their agents writing out their checks over the sound of monotone gunfire. The story is weaker than a polio stricken childs legs, with the US having given the keys to their military to North Korea...why? Because they made cool phones and apps. Your character doesn't talk as well, so you're basically Yes man Mario, with strong political views. Which with how the story plays out is really out of place. Questioned if you're a spy for the North Koreans, your lack of response clearly means you're not, and so you're trusted with every detail of the underground rebel fighters hide outs, weaknesses, locations, etc.Outside of the story and sound, the Ai is terrible as well. You can be in the middle of a warzone running around with your gun out, but a few feet away a military patrol can be standing idly swapping kimchi recipes completely ignoring you. Taking out enemy stronghold points for your ""resistance"" to take over is pretty simple as well. Walk into an area and shotgun enemies in the face as they frantically run around suffering Stormtrooper syndrome by missing most of their shots. Probably would have had more trouble firing a shotgun into a barrel of gerbils than I did taking on any of the threats in this game.If the first game was supposed to be inspired by the movie Red Dawn, Homefront: The Revolution is more like watching Patrick Swayze die of pancreatic cancer.

												Homefront the Revolution is a first person shooter based in a time where the United States of America has been taken over by the North Korean Army. Which is controlled by a company called APEX. The game is based in Philadelphia where you play as Ethan Brady and assist the resistance in gaining control and fighting back against the North Korean control. The world is filled with interesting sites and is open for you to explore, with some areas needing to be unlocked. Overall the map is not very large or filled with anything particularly entertaining. The gameplay is a bit unrefined, where you can feel the controls not responding to your input exactly. The climbing is somewhat empty and provides a Far Cry 3 kind of feel and the aiming and cover based system feel slow to respond. The crafting and weapons upgrading system is interesting, but very basic and more diverse than a game like this requires. Most people will choose on weapon and stick to it and only upgrade that weapon.The visuals of the game are interesting and the graphics is beautiful especially in the Beyond the Walls DLC. The unique markers that represent objectives or stashes in the world offer interesting immersion. The characters are interesting, but don’t provide enough content to get a true interaction between them. The graphics on the faces are good, but can sometimes seem off from the sound.The story involves fighting off the KPA as a resistance member. The plot develops at a steady pace, with the open world allowing players to explore and liberate section of the world. With each step of full resistance in an area you will not change of behaviour of the locals towards the KPA. This makes you feel a sense of progress; however the missions become repetitive with regards to the open world side quests.The main story has its ups and downs, but provides an interesting single player experience. With characters struggling to make decisions and cope with the struggles of trying to liberate your home through war.The multiplayer is a basic 4 player co-op shooter. There are objectives given on certain maps and the players must work together to defend a position or take an objective. This is enjoyable, especially with friend, but only for a few hours.Overall the game has an interesting atmosphere and different approach of storytelling to a resistance war, which may be attractive to some players.If you enjoy first person shooters, with great visuals and linear stories and don’t mind the slightly clunky controls then maybe you’ll enjoy Homefront the Revolution.Homefront the Revolution is not a bad game, it just isn't a good game. Especially compared to other FPS games and the potential the game had to use the open world properly.Rating: 6/10 "

												First off, wow, a great idea killed by the Devs.  I mean the promise of everything that was not included in the First, but nope lied to again.  This is a single player game unless you have two to four friends who also bought it, as there is no Multiplayer/resistance mode.  As stated by so many the graphics are dated, weird mouse lag, cursor bug, smart phone great idea but the texts on the ims are hard to read.If you take an area don't worry the KPA will not try to take it back nor will they venture there unless its for a strike mission or you are spotted by a large♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ship with a red light that can be dodged quickly.I really wanted to love this game, but for the cost of the game not including if you bought the season pass, this game is not worth 20 bucks.  Oh and as for custimization nope other then putting acceries onto your weapons thats it.  But you can make your charector in the non existant MP.Open world is a lie!!!!!  Open world like Fallout series to be able to go anywhere and do what you want to do, well you can in this game but that means in a couple of city blocks.  Not only that but the game does not feel like its in Philly. It does not feel like in any American city.Pros:The idea of the gameCons:Everything about this gameFrame Rates on High end machines are the same for E machinesGraphics dated and muted (not in a good way)Lag in single playerLack of making your Person uniquePoor AI on both sides allies are stupid and stand out in middle of the street (no way to give orders to them either)KPA will walk into ambushes, they have a vehicle that will sit and allow you to throw grenades at it.Molitove Cocktails that do not damage vehicles but only Infantry.  Apparently they never read why Moltoves were used and where they were successful i.e. against tanks and armor, vehicles, not that great on Infantry as people move away from a flaming bottle.So if you buy this game due so when its on sale for 10 bucks and you and some friends can play together for an hour or so, or on a drinking night.

Really annoying.- Apparently everyone in the future will have a **** ton of facial piercings?If you get it, get it cheap.			"

I tried not to listen to the talk about it being bad, but 6 hours in, I find myself whining outloud to myself as I play ""uugggh It's sooo ♥♥♥♥ing buggyy!!!!""Example... There's a part where you need to run to defend an area, and your rebel fighters are running down a corridor with you, at the end of a corridor is an open door to the next area. You can't run through the door because it's a loading point where you need to press E to load the next zone, but the NPCs are running through the door, pushing you out of the way so you can't get into the half-inch wide area to press E and you're stuck getting hipchecked over and over until eventually you button mash your way into the loading screen.On top of that, the mission structure is weird, it's like they thought ""What are some popular games?"" and tried to mix farcry with assassin's creed for the ""open world"" gameplay, the instructions are often unclear (to me at least) and I don't even know why I need 3 different currencies for things... It's just one of those games where some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ corporate♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tells developers they need to have this popular feature and that feature and have it done by yesterday, I'm sure...The story's still... ok I guess. I mean I still wanna finish the game but I think it's only because I don't want to waste the time I've put in.			"

												I've been waiting for performance patch since this game released. Most review either in steam or other game reviewer site gave low rating due to its performance. I think it is not fair to judge base solely on performance instead of actual gameplay.I only play less than 2hours but so far the performance seem great with very high setting. No weird framerate drop compare to Mankind Divided :D.Graphics is good with great visual quality. Gameplay is wise and so far I'm really pleased with this purchase. Thumbs up.			"

												When i first heard that Homefront will get a Sequel, i was more than Excited. the first game was pretty decent although it had its flaws. I thought when they make a Second one without all the Tiny Problems the first one had, it will be a Blast. But never have i been so wrong.What i got Was an entirely Different, Game, not only having Nothing to do with the original Homefront, But also it had all the issu8es the first one had. PLUS entirely new Problems, more than a Gamers mind Can handle.So basically the took the game with a mildly interesting plot, removed the plot completely and replaced it with a weak excuse to run around and kill north koreans in a boring Grinding Style, and Do the ever same Retake Scenarios over and over and over again.But wait, theres more!while they do all this, they manage to make even Cryengine 3 look bad. I mean, it needs a lot of fine hardware to run this game stable and smooth, and what we get are 2005-Textures and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lighting? while i set my hardware on fire it shold at least look cool!Conclusion:If this would look good, at least it would be a cool base principle for a MMO Multiplayer shooter.

												I bought this on sale, I didn't want to get it before because of all the performance issues that people were having. Before this new patch that just came out yesterday, I was getting 40 to 60 and most times lower frame rates and stuttering issues using a mix of medium and high textures. The only way I could maintain a smooth 60 was to put everything on Low. After the update installed I tried playing and so far it has been smooth sailing with high settings. So far I have not yet noticed any stuttering for the hour that I played after the patch. I revisited the areas that I experienced stuttering and also tried just blowing things up and getting into shootouts. Its nice to know that after everything, the devs still will be releasing one more DLC and also made a patch for the game. So far so good and I have really enjoyed the game. Ill have to play more and see if the stuttering issues have been completely fixed. That's why I stopped playing before, but hopefully I wont have anymore problems. But id still recommend this game come sale time. I enjoyed it or at least tried to despite the performance issues I had. SpecsI7 920 3.2GhzXFX RX 470 4GB black edition12GB Ram			"

												this game is good...don't be lazy and just listen to all the negative criticism out there, a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon and made out it was the worst game ever and it really, really isn't. there was a large update last year which repaired a lot, if not all, of the bugs. I've been playing shooters since Half Life and this really is a fun game. The environment is cool to run around and the different zones keep each area interesting. I put quite a few hours into this game to complete it so you do get your moneys worth.If you enjoy Fallout 3 and 4 as well as Half Life then you will enjoy this game...honestly :)JD			"

												This game has one big problem: It feels mediocre in many ways. There is nothing particulary bad about it, sure there are some bugs, mostly visual, sure the AI has some hiccups here and there and sure the story isn't super engaging but none of that makes the game bad, none of it really disturbes the flow of gameplay all that much. Yet the game doesn't really have anything great about it, nothing you are going to remember 2 years from now, no amazing stories to tell your buddies and thats what makes this game... well mediocre. Still it's worth a buy and thus i'm giving it a thumbs up. Surely not at full price but if you see this in a sale and want to have an entertaining open world FPS that borrows heavily from the Far Cry series then Homefront is certainly worth picking up.			"

												This game is just great!If you like a game that puts you in charge of a Rebellion group, trying to fight thier opressors, this is just a great job of the devs! The pro's:- The graphics are just nice!- Lots of weaponary to put your character just in the place that you want it.- Multiplayer is a little small, this needs improvement but it's still okay if you find a match!       Leveling up is exciting because the more you've got, the funnier it is, even the clothes you put on makes you stronger/weaker. - The gameplay is great, even if there are some little bugs.- The missions are just fun, getting control upon bases of your enemy!- It isn't always that 'easy' to get everything trough.- The story it tells is great, you'll always BE a hero!- Con's- Small multiplayer community, not a big deal, but it is affecting it...- Sometimes buggy and laggy, I don't know why it is, but if you'll be okay with it, it'll be still fun to play! (Like I did!)- the way you can transport isn't always great, this made me think a lot to get from A to B, here they've could done something.			"

I've played w/ the video detail and the mouse sensitivity, but the movement is lose; it's terrbile.  It's like moving underwater.. which you can't have in a fire fight.

												I have always loved movies like Red Dawn and games like World in Conflict and Freedom Fighter that use an invaded/occupied USA as a narrative backdrop. Homefront was decent enough for me to play all the way through a few times and dive into the multiplayer for a bit. I say all of this to emphasize how much I really wanted this game to be good.It just wasn't. I would only recommend buying this game for more than $20 when it goes on sale some time in the future.1) Technical Flaws: While some of these may be fixed in the future this game has serious technical flaws.  More than any other game I've bought recently.  This includes even alpha games. There were serious graphical errors and huge immersion breaking flaws in the AI and numerous scripted events fail in remarkably noticable ways.2) A flawed implementation of a Far Cry 3 Rip off: Numerous aspects of core-gameplay will be instantly recognizable as a direct rip off of Far Cry 3's approach to open world FPS.  Even the loot of bodies looks and functions in the same way. That in itself isn't a bad thing; I love FC3's style and Ubi's trying to milk that for all its worth with FC4 and FCPrimal. But the implementation of this style in this game could have been amazing but it just didn't quite cut it. The city sections were far more limited in scope and it didn't feel so much like an open world as a series of very repetitive events. FC3 can get bland after liberating your umpteenth radio tower but this game somehow made it even worse.3) Horrible Weapons System: It might sound cool to have one weapon that can switch on the fly into other weapons but in practice I found this was severely limiting and underwhelming.  Within a short time I had unlocked every weapon in the game and none of them were thrilling to use. This might seem nitpicky, but in an FPS your weapons are a huge part part of your experience and I didn't like how it was implemented at all. It was novel, but it wasn't good.			"

First off,the people who give this game a positive review are the people trying to console themselves because they know they've just wasted 60$.Get over it guys.After giving this game a solid 8 hours and progressing half way throught the story,i must say this is one of the worst games i have ever played in my life.This is a disgrace for a FPS game.Blatant storyline and gameplay,Wack♥♥♥♥♥NPC's, Crappy shadows all over the game,Frame drops then and there and the list goes on.Oh and the most disastrous thing in this game is the aiming and shooting mechanism,if i aim an enemy and shoot,i would be shooting at the enemy but the enemy wont be shot.In simple words if i aim and fire a rocket launcher at an enemy vehicle,the rocket launcher simply wont strike the vehicle.Thats how awful it is..Although the game is only 17$ for me on the INDIAN store,For others this game is not worth 60$.i would skip this game infact.Over this i dont know why they implemented denuvo over this piece of crap.This wont be played even if its pirated.The developers plainly copied farcry's mechanics and parts of dying light's BGM and gameplay.Nothing really good to say about this game except the Weapon customization,which they messed up because it takes a long damn time to customize a weapon and by the time you customize it , the enemy would kill you.Overall the game is appaling.Please dont buy this.

The game is glitchy, NPCs sitting mid-air, within chairs (I mean, as in being part of the chair) or fighting non-existing enemies inside a safe house or just blocking a doorway so you can't go through to finish your mission. I had to reload the last checkpoint a few times because the game just stalled and NPC just went into a neverending loop of nothingness. Not happy with that one.			"

												I almost forgot how much I HATE this game until I realized another DLC was released which I get as part of the pass.  So I reloaded all 70GB and am immediately reminded of just how bad it is.  It took 4 complete restarts just to get past what should have been the first 3 minutes of the DLC. Bugs galore.  From NPC's refusing to talk to me and gates not opening thus preventing any progression it brought back all the glaring ineptness from anyone that was involved in this game. The folks at Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios should hang their heads in shame at the complete pile of junk that is Homefront: The Revolution.  Thank god (or whoever) for price glitches so I don't feel completely ripped off but  I wouldn't pay a penny for this.  I wouldn't gift it to a friend for fear of losing a friend. Sometimes you look at a game and think, well, this would have been OK in 2005 or 1995 but I can't think of a time in video game history where anything about it would have been acceptable.			"

												First I Have a 980 Ti and a G-sync monitor.The game itself is fun, if you liked farcry 3 and 4 and I like that style however many dont. Instead of one sprawling world it's split into smaller zones that seems to work.However it really fails in the performance side, not only does it struggle to maintain 60 FPS it struggles to maintain ANY FPS. As in, in 5 min of gameplay I can get anywhere between 78-22 FPS it becomes completely unplayable when it is dropping to 20-30 FPS and theres no apparent reason it does it, and it happens for 5 min at a time.So to sum up if you like the farcry style this game might be for you, however dont buy it till theres a few major patches it needs to be cooked for a little longer.

												Now with extra bugs... a short one-hour DLC broke the multiplayer, hope it will be patched soon...Only recommended for fans of open world shooters if on sale at >50% off. The bad:- Rushed release with all the bugs you'd expect: Poor detection, crashes, getting stuck in the interface in-game, regularly falling through the floor, failing to trigger melee takedowns and being gunned down as a result... I could go on and on and on.- Campaign with a generic story that packs very few emotional punches.- Rushed multiplayer and really lackluster matchmacking... probably the reason why so few people are available for matches. The good:- Brutal start to the campaign, very atmospheric and dark, has that oppressed vibe like City 17.- The apocalyptic warzones / red zones are the highlight of the game and feature some fantastic level design (especially for the multiplayer missions).- Decent shooting mechanics and creative weapon animations.

												I was hesitant to buy this game because of all the bad reviews. I will say it is playable and cryengine looks good although I am disappointed that it doesn't have dual GPU support. Still my fury x coupled with a 5820k @ 4Ghz runs it on very high/ultra at 3440x1440. I don't get any stuttering except when the game saves.It would be better if I could run both my fury x's :) like I can on crysis 3.Yeah it's glitchy. Whenever it rains in game there is a strobe effect on the ground which is really irritating. The NPC AI is incredibly poor. Be prepared for some dumb enemies and allied NPCs doing things like blocking the player into corners of the room. Incredibly annoying programming basically.  I had read in reviews that enemies keep spawning until the player hides and/or runs away. I wasn't sure whta that meant but I am now.To me though it's obviously a gameplay design choice the developers made and is part of building the atmosphere.It's playable and I am going to play it through. Not worth the money though. Wait for it to go on sale. It is clearly a game that was released before it had been completed. If the deveoplers had the time and money then I am sure it would have been a far more polished product.If I was feeling cynical I would say it has the feel of whoever provided the budget just wanting to break even. If it had been finished before it was released it would have been a great game. Still good enough to play though.The following are just some additional musings......I don't know if cryengine is optimised for amd. I would doubt it's optimised for either amd or nvidia and is a generic game engine for licensing to third parties. I am not talking about cry engine 3 which was optimised for amd in crysis 3 and is still one of the most hardware punishing game engines out there along with the 4A engine used in the metro games which is optimised for nvidia of course :) Anyway recently I fired up far cry 3 again. It's unplayable using CF and if I use one card it's glitchy and I get ridiculous framedrops, stuttering and freezes. This is on an i7 5820k @ 4Ghz, 16GB of DDR4 Ram, Radeon R9 Fury X in 2 way crossfire, 3440x1440 acer @ 75hz. The OS is windows 10 pro.While it is not an insanely over the top set up. It's still a fairly decent gaming machine. Which you would expect to handle Far Cry 3.I know it's optimised for nvidia and when it dropped originally it was unplayable on amd hardware on higher settings I was using a 7970ghz CF setup. I had to drop the settngs to play it and that still had all sorts of graphics glitches as well.I am waiting to see what amd has to offer with vega but I could be switching to nvidia. Personally I think it is bad for gaming having these hardware vendor tie ins. A decent set of graphics cards is not cheap. I would probably be better off getting a console.......nah.			"

												Gráficamente es hermoso. Pero eso es todo. El juego es muy malo. Pero muy muy malo. Las animaciones son MALÍSIMAS. Los diálogos MALÍSIMOS (y encima los de los NPCs, todos repetidos jaja). Como que no te dan muchas ganas de jugarlo por tantos problemas intrínsecos al juego y la forma que fué elaborado... muy ... mala, pobre en detalles, carente de sentido... en fin, ni regalado lo jugaría, es horrendo.

												It's Not Always Sunny In Philadelphia.Homefront: The Revolution screams lack of polish. The main character moves so slow and clunky, you ride a dirt bike straight through enemies like they are holograms because they don't react after getting hit, AI and NPC get stucked in various objects or just looping around corners, pathfinding for AI in general is absolute bonker. There's no such thing as scavenging in a ""hard time"" because loots are plentiful especially when you get ammo upgrade, but for some reasons, of all things you can craft, the most important piece of consumable - which is healing kit, isn't one of them?The game has some of the strangest designs I've ever seen in an FPS title. Just like standard open world shooter formula, you can go loud or you can stealth, but it seems like the game just can't decide which aspect to flesh out more instead of balancing them out. You can buy a silencer but you can't slap on anything aside from a pistol, the other silenced weapon is the pneumatic pistol which has abysmal damage drop off. You can buy some upgrades to help stealth more reliable like camouflage or silent footstep, but... why do we need these when there's no upgrade to increase the number of equipments, you know, the things that help us much more in and outside combat? The guns handle well, the customize system is neat, but some are definitely better than others, why would you switch to standard AR while you already have LMG already? Why would you use the marksman rifle when the battle rifle only need 1 more bullet to kill an enemy while it has more ammo?The activities are boring. You can destroy machineries, turn on propaganda radios, help random civilians like slitting a KPA soldier's throat, destroy their APC, giving beggars $10... for the ""big"" ones like transceivers reveal points of interest or safe house that brings Resistance soldiers to overwatch, the way you capture them are the same: Kill all KPA soldiers and interact with a radio. You might say capturing outposts in Far Cry games are the same, but here's one thing: outposts in Far Cry have more variety. In Homefront: The Revolution, when you capture these locations, you don't need to care about alarm (because if you get into a house then the enemies won't be able attack you), you don't need to scout the location (because they are not big enough to worth giving a damn about patrol's pattern), you can't do creative things like wingsuit into a compound or use a vehicle to ramp straight into it, instead you have to find entraces that are already placed around the compound by the dev. Even the factories in red zone have the same layout and the same number of enemies, unique locations are few and far between making it a chore to capture them all.The open world feels so contrived and limited, different sections are connected through tunnels and are divided into red and yellow zones. Red zones contain exclusively ruins, bombarded cities which left only ruins after ruins after ruins, and it doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥ing sense why KPA still has heavy patrol out there. It looks fine in the first hours, but then I quickly grew tired of repetitive destroyed streets and buildings. Lombard, a section which was previously nuked by the KPA and has turned into a S.T.A.L.K.E.R wonderland has the same treatment, and KPA even bothered to put rare weaponry into it.Yellow zones are more civilized, you can hide behind civilians to avoid detection but that isn't effective all the time. When the KPA is alarmed, thanks to horrible AI design, you can cheese out enemies by running around dark corners and find a dumbster to hide. If you get caught, just run away, the KPA isn't more aggressive the more you create destruction, their reinforcement is just some soldiers, sometimes heavy soldier, a Wolverine and heavy armored tank. If your objective is capturing a section on the map then don't worry, activate the radio and alarm will be clear immediately.Story is probably the worst offender of Homefront: The Revolution. You know some movies or B-games that you can watch or play them drunk and still have a giggle out of them? Homefront is not one of them. It takes itself so serious with the ""REVOLUTION!!!!"" theme that constantly shout into your ears until you put on your uncle Sam shirt and eat 2 hamburgers at the same time. There's a guy on the radio who keep saying good job to me when I stab a KPA soldier in the face or destroy random machine which make me want to reach through the radio and slap him until he call his mother's name. The story revolves around a silent protagonist who has PhD in errand jobs, a leader who talks obvious things, a tough♥♥♥♥♥woman who can't just shut up for 2 seconds about killing every KPA soldier and their kids, a doctor who speaks low Samuel L. Jackson's accent and kinda be there to balance out the acts of violence with peace. The story is about saving some guy you can't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about but apparently he's the ultimate terrorist so all we need is to get his♥♥♥♥♥out of the prison despite we only seeing him for like 3 or 4 times throughout the game, hell even who the main villian is isn't confirmed until 2/3 of the game. The theme of Homefront: The Revotion turns from guerrila warfare and oppressing the brutality, yet we don't interact with any civilian, we only create destruction for ""the greater good"", you ARE THE TERRORIST, and the revolution is lead by a bunch of childish kids with access to guns.Deep inside, I know there's a great foundation in Homefront: The Revolution. The gunplay is decent, graphics are top-notch, the atmosphere oozes style, yet its gameplay design is outdated for 2016 standard. It's probably the closest thing to a Far Cry clone with interesting world design, but as a whole package, Homefront: The Revolution is simply forgettable. It's not a revolution worth fighting for.

												Please read if you want to know basicsFor starters i would just like to point out that i have 36 min in this game. When i started playing i put an alarm on my phone  for the next 1:30 min to make sure i still had the chance to refund which is 2hrs btw and 12 days (so if you want to refund do it while you can). The first problem i came across was the performance. The game was very jittery throughout. I played the game on low and still had issues. My pc specs is a gtx 760, 16gb ddr4 and a 5820k (bottleneck much) but my setup is for self-explanitory reasons. I was very impatient to get into the fighting and when i did, i felt like garbage. The overall movement such as mantling and aiming feels unfinished. Aiming is just dreadful and this was just the beginning of the game. The start of the game feels slow but gets increasingly better. The concepts and ideas are very innovative but it is ruined by the story and what you must accomplish. Gameplay is repetitive and i got bored and frustrated just so early into the game.The first homefront was a thrilling game with a very action-pact feel. In Homefront TR, i dont agree with the open world and would rather keep it as a point-to-point style gameplay still having freedom to explore. But since we cant change anything heres the verdict:I could see this game enjoyable but frankly no original multiplayer where you fight team vs team and poor optimization, if i was to play this game without spending almost $60, i would find myself discovering better titles that i would rather spend my time playing and not beat myself with the appalling gameflow.AND LEAVE THIS GAME TO THE NON-EXISTENT KAOS STUDIOS and THQ			"

												I Keep Seeing Reviews that say ""This is so Bad"" or ""Worst game I've ever Played"" So, in response to this, I think its time I Shed some light on how I feel about this Game.So, First off, Is it good? Well, it kinda depends if you dont really care about the story or stuff like that. It is Fun... But if you're looking for something like Destiny or Halo, you're in the wrong place my friend. The Story starts out great at first, but it fades off around mid-game. The gameplay itself is fun, its what you'd expect from any fps. The aiming is a little clunky, and the AI is somewhat stupid, but its enjoyable. Before patch 1.5, it was broken, not horribly, but it was broken. The only real downside now is how bad its optimizations are, but I'll cover why its like this soon.Secondly, the Multiplayer: It's Okay, there is no PvP (Sorry all of You Cod and Halo Fans, but this isn't for you!) This is a Bluntly stated PvE Experience. This doesn't mean its bad, the missions are enjoyable. There's Just a Lack of Multiplayer maps, But Dambuster studios said that they'd Make More maps for FREE (Everyones Favorite Word!)Thirdly, My opinion as to why this game was bad at first: This is most likely on combination of 2 reasons,ONE: This was rushed by the publishers, the Devs were probably going to take more time with this, but the publishers probably said, ""This needs to go out now, or we wont release it.""TWO: Inexperince with Making a Game like this. If you never knew what Dambuster Studios was before this, well... You're not alone. This Is Dambuster's  FIRST GAME. If you were in their shoes, and It was your first time making a game like this, It's obvious that you're going to have problems with your game, This Is also most likely why this game is badly optimized,they dont Quite Know what to do yet. Dambuster studios have made a great first impression with this game however, they obviously have some raw talent. This game was, and still is, Glitchy and Buggy, but Again, It's their FIRST TIME Doing something like this.(Give 'Em Some credit at least!)IN CONCLUSION/ TL;DR: This game is Wonky, but it's clearly not as bad as people say it is, its a solid 7/10, its release price was kinda High, but if you can find it on sale, Go for it.EDIT: Good lord, some people are really going out of their way to make this game look worse than it really is...and you know whats funny? This is near IDENTICAL to what happened to the original homefront on it's release: the game came out, everyone thought it sucked, a small group of players kept playing it, and a year or two later: everyone respects homefront as a good game.Watch, in the next year or so, everyone is gonna play this game and they'll like it, and everyone who joined the hate bandwagon will realize that they screwed up.EDIT 2: Update 2.0 came out and god DAMN. That Just turned the dial up to 11! It runs WAY better, It looks like my prediction was correct...For now.			"

												Many wrote a negative review of this game, and i'm sure that's because of how bad the optimization was when the game came out. Now in late June 2016 the game runs smooth and without problems (Atleast on my hardware which is i7 4790K, 16 GB ram, GTX 970) But i experienced a lot of glitches that i wish was fixed. The lighting in the game is fantastic, and forget everything about maxing the game out, unless you own a GTX 1070 or better. Sound is good aswell, but some sound effects are misplaced (Such as 10 people in the street but you hear a giant crowd)I like the gameplay aswell, but the story wasn't that interesting i think. It started out great, but mid and late game wasn't that great. I never felt a connection to the characters, and there are only few important throughout the game. Many face models were reused in the city which is also a shame. A nice thing is the weapon customization. You can pick between 16 different weapons and add attachments you want in a nice Crysis style. There's also RC Car, Proximity and Remote bombs. Multiplayer has potential to be fun, but is already kinda dead, and there's currently no PVP. A more hardcore open world shooter is possible by choosing Hard difficulty. You die fast and can't craft health kits. My final score for the game would be 6/10 which is of course decent. Not recommended at full price, and don't expect to be blown away by the story. Below is 3 videos of some Story gameplay (Minor spoilers), Multiplayer gameplay and all weapons shown.

												I loved this game.  It took me 45 hours to finish, so I feel like I got my money's worth.  Those people who complained that they finished it in six hours just cheated themselves.  Played properly, it's quite enjoyable.  There were some minor bugs, but I had only one that was substantial and prevented me from completing a zone, but it didn't impact the storyline.  The game did have some stuttering issues, but they were fixed the first day.A lot of people are complaining that it's not Doom, but I don't think it was intended to be.  You can't just run in guns blazing and expect to survive.  I played it as a stealth game and had a blast.  It requires you to use your NPC comrades to create a squad.  They would pin down the enemies and I would run around behind and pick them off one at a time.Played the way it was intended, this game is a lot of fun.			"

												Its not that the Game is bad in general, sequences/ cutscenes look pretty nice, light effects too. i like the story idea as well.  But the Game has more flaws than good aspects for me. First of all the character animations look pretty robotic sometimes, like enemies or npcs are moonwalking or rollerblading around. The Ai is very dumb.The Game offers no challenge, nothing really new to see. Quests and Gameplay are very repetitive and shallow.And the Graphics, besides the nice looking cutscenes, are rather ugly. But the biggest negative for me, well,  I dont know... tried the game at the free to play weekend, got bored after about 1,5 Hours. You decide if its worth downloading 37,9GB during the weekend, but sure it isnt worth paying more than 5 bucks for it.  "

Ignoring the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor story and repitition, I do like the mechanics surrounding armament and how nicely it compares to other shooters from the early 2000s.  That being said, it's 2016, and maybe I was spoiled with amazing games in childhood but there is no where near enough content to be priced where it is, especially if they add paid dlc.  Last point, it shouldn't be more fun to watch a trailer then play the actual game, especiallywith something in such dire need of polish and bug fixes.4/10, 3 for creativity and the tactical sense you need, 1 for ♥♥♥♥♥y hot nose ring lady marry me plox			"

												I've had a great time with this game so far. I've seen all of the horrid reviews describing this game as terrible, but personally I can already tell this will be one of my favorite games of the year. The story is quite intriguing to me, I love the revolutionary aspect. The environments are beautiful, even though I run the game on low due to a bad computer. It runs at a solid frame rate for me as well. The gameplay is amazing, too. The guns each individual different recoil kicks and sounds make them quite distinct from eachother and gunfights feel amazing. The weapon customization is one of the best things about this game, as every gun has 2 other sub-types. For example, the battle rifle, my personal favorite weapon, comes off the shop as a DMR, but it can also be turned into a semi-auto sniper rifle and even a ""freedom launcher"" rocket launcher! Every gun in the game including the basic pistol has 2 other weapon convertions available for it, adding even more variability and possibilities for strategy. In my setup, I use a shotgun with the ""incendiary launcher"" conversion with a marksman rifle as my other weapon. The game will remind you a lot of Far Cry, as it is open world and has different zones with activities to do inside, like capturing outposts. Except, this game takes that Far Cry formula to the next level. The outposts to capture have variability and are fun, instead of the Far Cry outposts where I'd get bored and find them just as tedious chores to do. The world around you feels alive as while you walk around, some citizens may support you, but others may be ""Nork"" sympathizers. This game is truly a diamond hidden in the rough. The only problem is the sub-par optimization. Frame drops aren't too common but they happen sometimes and it's a bit of a inconvienence but I can get past this as I enjoy the game a lot. The game is actually rather difficult, too. I played it on normal difficulty with aim assist off and I found that stealth was a requirement unless I did some hit and run. You might want to go guns blazing right off the bat but patience is the key as you really feel like you are a revolutionary due to the KPA outnumbering and outgunning you. The multiplayer is actually very fleshed out and really makes you feel as if you are a revolution. You can do some amazing things when you work together in this co-op mode. Now, for the final verdict. I reccomend buying it on sale due to those optimization errors and bad AI, but wait a while and that will be fixed (hopefully). I give the game an 8.5/10 due to stellar gameplay and story, only limited by bad AI and a below-average launch.			"

												I have no way of knowing the true state of the game when it was released. The critiques were harsh, even nasty, and the footage I saw led me to believe it was broken, to be avoided at all costs. Thankfully, I played it a long time after release, after most problems had been eradicated. In 25 hours of play, I didn't get any crash, broken save file, stuttering during saving or anything like that.  Even though I enjoyed it tremendously, the game still has a few problems. You spawn a bit randomly after you die, in some safe house you've unlocked in the area, no quick save. Not a big deal normally, but enemies can spawn close to you at times, so you might just get ♥♥♥♥ed once in a while and have to reload. Everything's going well... then boom, bunch of Norks on your flank and you're dead. Some NPCs will freeze up once in a while or spazz out, but nothing super annoying. The scripting of specific missions isn't quite perfect, so a few retries can be necessary.But how's the game?Pretty good, actually. I guess ""urban Far Crysis"" is an apt description, but it does have a lot of other influences, like The Saboteur, Half-Life 2, Fallout 3 and Dying Light. The game map is divided in zones that have to be reclaimed city block by city block, while a story unfolds through a series of main missions. The theme of hostile occupation is at the forefront here, whether it's about patriots vs. collabs, the sabotage missions, playing as the scrappy underdogs against a military power, etc.The red zones reminded me of the Fallout 3 wasteland, with broken houses, terrain carved by bombs, and pockets of resistance. Conquering each little area within the zone and the various strongholds, thus increasing the presence of the resistance, is your main objective outside of completing the story missions, and recruiting a little team fighting with you was very cool, even if they die a bit quickly. Flash events ask you to help defend a hot spot once in a while, and there are random patrols in the streets.The yellow zones are still mostly intact and feature strict patrols and various targets to sabotage. You can blow up various vehicles, destroy cameras, loudspeakers, etc. like in The Saboteur, a game that I remember fondly. There are also several ""slow parkour"" or environmental puzzling to be done to uncover weapons caches and other points of interest. The main objective here is to increase the morale of the population so they'll fight alongside you, going from terrorist status to liberator.The story is a fair attempt at displaying the tensions inside a little group of patriots trying to do the impossible and I didn't have any problems with it. It's not deep, a bit disheveled, but it has several strong moments and set pieces that felt like stuff was really happening on a big scale. I never felt like giving up on the game, and that's rare for me these days. The ensemble of weapons with their various modules were fun to use, and the sounds have good impact. It's a nice-looking game with very detailed characters and good textures.   Very ambitious game, and even with the chaotic development and messy launch, it ended up being worth playing and even memorable. I wouldn't have bought it with Denuvo, but now that it has been removed, it's a clear yes from me. Clearing everything should take between 30 and 40 hours. If you like FPS games, dystopian themes and decent to high production values, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy playing this game. I liked it more than any Far Cry, and it's certainly more polished now than the Fallout games. Just like with Dying Light, I wasn't expecting anything and ended up loving it. I'll surely pay attention to whatever Dambuster releases next, just like with Techland.   FX-8320RX 470 4 GB8 GB RAMWindows 10 64-bit1080p, mix Medium-High settings, AA, 60 fps most of the time			"

												I am having great fun playing this game on single player and I really do not understand why it copped such bad reviews. There are some problems getting stuck in things in some of the early missions but that might just be me because i keep getting stuck in nearly every game i play at least once. Graphics are good, AI for enemy is above average, AI for friendlies is average, Love what they have done with the weapon crafting, lots of missions (little bit repetetive), some characters actually freak me out (yes Dana i am looking at you), cut scenes are good, Etc. Overall I would give this game a 7.5/ 10. This would be an 8 if they gave more time for flashpoint missions. A GOOD GAME or so says me.			"

												I really wanna like this game, the concept and advertisements all introduced a game that will be fun to play but also interesting to experience. Problem is, the game truly does not match what the ads discuss, the advertisements all explain a realistic storyline which mirrors the book Red Dawn in some way only futuristic. What you get however is a questline that feels like you are just doing endless side quests for people. It is repetitive but so is any other open world game. The real problem was that you cannot connect to the storyline because of the lack of character developement, Dying Light has a better storyline and you don't even get to see the characters for 80% of the whole game. I don't wanna♥♥♥♥♥♥post this game because i still truly like the gameplay and the gunfights, but its just a lack of content from what I initially wanted to experience, I hyped myself up for a game where I could be a revolutionary and instead what I got was a game where the revolution has already happened and the others are just following the flock.

												It's an alright game story is good, game mechanics combat all that is good, What is not good is it's optimizations it is a very poorly game in that regard. I've enjoyed my 7 or so hours thus far but I really do wish it ran better, I think that is my primary peeve with it so far, as i even meet recommended specs. Still runs like poo, even on low as possible gfx settings.In my opionion take the recommended specs and move them to minimum specs. (and current min delete tem entirly lol)Any pc above recommended specs would probably run it alot better.My 2nd peeve would have to be the check point saving, games like this are insulted by it and it's a huge hassle when you wanna take a break without losing progress. There is no manual save what so ever, so if you made progresses unrelated to game story you'll have to take a sub-mission objective just to get a save in. :(There is bugs I noticed right off bat, like getting oddly stuck on some objects.Also enemy and friendly NPCs die randomly, (no cause they just fall over dead) I sorta found it strangly funny.If you can over look these bugs and poor running of the game it's fun keep you busy for few days. Get it on sale I doubt it's worth full price just because of how crappy it runs.  On to more positive things weapon customizations are pretty cool really resembles crysis weapon upgrading where they can be done on the fly. All weapons are really like 3 weapons in one that can be also changed within the feild. You can craft your tossables on the field little like rage in terms of what they are r/c cars pipe bombs remote detonations molotovs teddy bear bombs all that i mentioned has 3 different variations of each incenadery explosive and distraction.The game feels like red faction gorilla, on terms of sub-objectives and the atmosphre of the game aswell. (which makes sence, since both games are based on revolting agaisnt an oppressing goverment and the player factions using gorilla warfare tactics to recover control)Game stuff: 8/10 Optimization: 3/10 I do recommend the game but don't go in expecting your pc to run max settings at a stable 60+ fps cause it probably wont do it unless you surpass the recommended specs on store page. Primarly in the gpu catagory. CPU side probably fine game seems to be more GPU bound. It rec 2gb vram note I'm as low aspossible on gfx its using between 1800mb-1950mb vram So 4gb+ would probably be best for anything above low lol.			"

												This game is really good for single player. I thoroughly enjoy the righteous Merica mentality of it all. The open world aspect can be off putting but i think it allows for great emergent game play moments, ex, i took over a small appartment rooftop in a controlled contested area of a high security section of the city, and i started sniping the N. Koreans and started this huge battle, running roof top to roof top, like 5 star level GTA type crazy response by the NorKs but it was awesome because the resistance was joining the battle, oppressed civilians started attacking the NK soldiers and the whole thing felt really organic. It's a fun game.			"

												This game might've had issues in the past, and like many i was put off by bad reviews. This was a game i wanted to play since it came out because i liked the concept and how they made their second game an open world one. I've played about six hours so far and i'm actually very satisfied. I haven't felt the ""need"" to come back to a single player game since skyrim. Aside from the ""lack"" of weapons you can actually buy and some questionable AI sometimes the game is solid. I guess you could compare it to far cry in some ways, since it's open and it let's you plan ahead but keep in mind that you'll mostly be fighting in urban areas. The tone and atmosphere of the game is pretty much what took me by surprise. Definitely worth it if you like the genre. Sometimes you gotta go past reviews to see the true potential of things for yourself.			"

												It runs like complete garbage for how it looks, and like most poorly optimized games, lowering the graphics settings doesn't do much at all. My PC exceeds the recommended specs, yet at absolute minimunm settings I can barely pull a stuttery 40fps. FoV is capped at 65 vertical for no good reason,♥♥♥♥♥♥filters all over the place that can't be disabled, janky controls obviously designed for a console, and mediocre gunplay set to an incredibly idiodic story make this a disappointingly bad game. It might have been worth it for five bucks on sale just to play TimeSplitters 2's campaign on PC, but unfortunately this game is crippled by a disgustingly bad business practice:Denuvo, and all that brings. No doubt one of the bigger reasons for my♥♥♥♥♥♥performance, and a draconian DRM that requires constant online validation via their servers. The game cannot be played offline, and any hardware/software changes require you to revalidate as if you just bought the game. When Deep Silver stops caring about this game, it stops being playable. That is completely unacceptable. Stop treating your paying customers like thieves.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is an open world first-person shooter video game and has some great aesthetic devices and a cool concept, however, the game felt repetitive, unpolished in my opinion. Also, I had some issues with it detecting my mechanical keyboard, which has RGB backlighting for some weird reason it kept on changing the color of it and I think the game engine didn't like the corsair software which was strange. I would recommend this game, however,  isn't worth the asking price of £29.99 which it was before the steam sales.			"

												I hated the first Homefront more than any words can say. That game single handedly stopped me from ever pre-order games again and I have stuck to that rule since. It was complete garbage. I got Revolution for free from a friend who didn’t want it. I REFUSED to pay money for this after being burned from the first game but I can say that this is definitely a step in the right direction. It does have that low budget buggyness to It but the core gameplay is actually pretty fun. The level design was good (open areas now) in fact a few areas of the game are really good. Gunplay/sound was all good, only had one crash and the sound cut out on me once but a checkpoint reload fixed it. Input remapping was there but wonky, on screen prompts didn’t match rebinds and some actions you flat out could not change. This game did not need a silent protagonist, he really needed to be voiced over and his lack of interaction with other characters really took me out of the immersion. The free running/climbing system was a welcome feature as with all FPS now especially after the Dying Light handled it. Stealth mechanics could have used some more work. You could go stealth but it was not a fluid and fun as Deus Ex. They definitely need to expand on the rpg elements with gear/weapons upgrade. I got 16+ hours out of this game and I never thought I would say this about Homefront but give it a shot if your curious. It’s worth a play through.			"

												I played this on one of the recent free weekends.TL;DR version; It's a decent game, but the areas feel repetitive and it lacks story depth.  The price is not justified.  $10 USD max IMHO.As someone who played the first Homefront game, this is heading in a better direction but it's not quite there yet and generally feels like a console port.  Love was not really put into the PC version IMHO.  case and point in literally the first scene of the game you are on the floor and you can see how bad the floor textures are.  They are more than do able but not for the current price tag of $40 USD and or the current sale price of $23.99 USD.  If this game was under $10 USD then I would be way more willing to suggest it as it feels like it's worth that much on PC.  The different districts don't feel that different at all.  It feels like more of the same.  Yes they may look slightly less warzoney but it still feels like a warzone and they pretty much function the same way when you are taking over areas.The AI has some issues as well.  If you recruit some of the AI to help you then tend to get stuck in stairways and various other random places.   And I will say that I do think it's kinda immersion breaking when early on in the game if one of the airship spots you they will send out guys and go into an alert phase while if they spot any of the AI nothing happens.  I understand this was most likely done for gameplay reasons but it is kinda pretty immersion breaking to me.The game is a bit broken it terms of it's own rules as it's stated in one of the tutorial videos that if you are currently in an alert phase that the safe houses will not take you in.  When I was in the 2nd zone of the game (where the video is played the first time you go there) I would repeatedly just head to one of the safe houses if I was close and under an alert and they still let me in.  It would end and I would walk out like nothing happened.The story does not feel very deep. And really not much changes when you go from area to area from what I've played.  I will also say that a lot of the gear upgrades feel spaced out to make you grind for them.			"

												I don't understand how this game has such a low rating. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is good, even if some of the characters are a little annoying... that pacifist doctor especially. The ending was satisfying. More than can be said for Far Cry 3/4, which this game has been compared to. I will say that Homefront does tread the same path as recent Far Cry games, but I think it does so very well.Some criticisms though. The weapon modifications are interesting, but the interface is a bit tedious, and it takes time to do it, so you can't do it in combat. The LMG mods into a very cool grenade launcher, but due to the slowness of the interface, you can't just mod over to the grenade launcher when you get surprised by an armored car, so you rely on your regular explosives to take it out. This is unfortunate.I didn't encounter any major bugs while playing the campaign. Once I had an RC car explosive get stuck in terrain, and the mod interface gets glitchy at times, but these are minor things. No crashes. Ran it on medium graphics settings, 1920*1200 on an Nvidia 960, and had a mostly steady 60 FPS.Also worth mentioning: This game has the most satisfying sniper rifle ever. KABLAMMO! It'll take out heavy infantry in one hit. It's not silent though, so plan for that.Verdict: Buy.			"

												I've spent a bit of time thinking about this review after completing the game, and I can say, without reservation, that I would recommend this to any shooter fan. A solid 7/10 game. I really think (hope?) time will be kind to this one. I honestly hope we'll see more out of this IP in the future.The story is a total lark and a bit on the nose, but you can just ignore it really and have fun in the world the developers have created for you. There are a few over the top attempts to get you to really think about the horrors of war, but they fall short of ""Spec Ops: The Line"" level gut-punch.Weapons and deployables are reasonable varied, but you'll find yourself favoring one or two guns throughout your playthrough (*cough*battlerifle*cough*). Gunplay is actually pretty fantastic.It's open world, in that there are grindy capture points that pad out the campaign. But even those are actually fun and varied enough to keep your attention.			"

												I really wanna like this game, the concept and advertisements all introduced a game that will be fun to play but also interesting to experience. Problem is, the game truly does not match what the ads discuss, the advertisements all explain a realistic storyline which mirrors the book Red Dawn in some way only futuristic. What you get however is a questline that feels like you are just doing endless side quests for people. It is repetitive but so is any other open world game. The real problem was that you cannot connect to the storyline because of the lack of character developement, Dying Light has a better storyline and you don't even get to see the characters for 80% of the whole game. I don't wanna♥♥♥♥♥♥post this game because i still truly like the gameplay and the gunfights, but its just a lack of content from what I initially wanted to experience, I hyped myself up for a game where I could be a revolutionary and instead what I got was a game where the revolution has already happened and the others are just following the flock.

												I have been playing this game from the beginning, well before the patch's that Dambuster studio's has been putting out, don't believe me check my hours. Would I suggest people to play it, Damn right YES I would.The story is amazing and alot longer than I would have even expected, the gameplay is even better, come on who doesn't like setting up daisy chains and driving an RC car packed with either a molotov or C4 strapped onto it into a nicely set up murder zone.Yes it has co-op but this game isn't all about its co-op mode which can also be pretty nice, its about the single player game.If you want multiplayer go back to the biggest multiplayer map called ""The World"" in the award winning game called ""Your Real Life"" To be honest, other than a couple instances of drop in frames per second I have yet to have any game breaking bugs.Not like the fun falling through the ground in Battlefield 4, dieing to invunerable npc's in The Division or the downright annoying crashing in Fallout 4.For all those scrubs who are about to ♥♥♥♥♥ I run an I7 Intel chip and a high end graphics card. I have yet to find a game which doesnt run at 60-80fps on ultra settings.I should further mention it is becoming common practice for alot of high end game production teams including bethesda and the notorious ubisoft for releasing games which should have spent more time in the bug testing phase than we actually got in return. Effectively producing games which should not even be available to purchase.Now how does it differ hear, firstly Dambuster studios is a much smaller company and more importantly they actually listened to all of the problems from both genuine gaming enthusiast's and the ♥♥♥♥♥ing from scrubs and managed to fix alot of the games problems.All I can say to all of those whiney idiots who need a fresh nappy and their dummy is, that the story is beautifully put together ok yes its a little cliche but let me say this clearly.ITS A DAMN GAME STFU.Also I will finish this with at least it isn't ""No Man's Fail""So while I wait for the first expansion and more importantly The Walking Dead Season 3 from Telltale games, time for some Witcher 3.

												Homefront: the Revolution, not a perfect game by any means. Having said that, I don't understand why there is so much hate on this game. I realize it had a terrible launch, however it does seem like they've fixed most of the bugs. It only crashed on me once near the beginning which caused me to have to replay about 5 minutes. Other than that, a few graphic bugs mostly but nothing gamebreaking. My specs are  i7-6700, gtx 960, 16gb RAM  and I had about 45-60 fps on all high settings. The AI is pretty bad but not gamebreaking, at least not for me. The story was pretty basic, nothing special but it did it's job. I managed to finish the story during the free weekend so I didn't actually buy it. However on it's 40% off sale (or if you can get it even cheaper) I would say it's worth it, not at full price though.  Overall Rating  7/10  "

												Homefront: The Revolution is a game that is dominated by crashes (for me). There are many promising aspects about the game, and when it works, it's pretty great, However, I have not been able to enjoy the game for more than 15 minutes without a crash/stall/hang. And to be frank, the crashes come typically within 5 minutes of play time.I've tweaked settings to try and mitigate the issues, read forums and tried their advice, updated drivers, but nothing really helps. It seems like there's a great game behind the technical issues, but I'm unable to enjoy it. I see reviews praising the game, and I'll keep it in in my library in the hope I can enjoy the same experience, but at this stage it's simply not viable given the constant crashes.			"

												I do not write many reviews of games. But, this one deserved one. I bought the game March 2017 and took about 40 hours to play through it. People talk about bugs in the game, I have found zero !  The gamplay was great, the story was good. There were many ways to play the gmae , guns blazing, stealthy, or with remote control cars to blow up or flame the enemy. Or even take over control of their vehicles. All in all, there is no question I got my money's worth from this game and look foreward to more of it! "

												Ok I beat the game as far as after meeting the mayor face to face. After that the game ♥♥♥♥ed all kinds of up. I was stuck with the cam feed as my hud so then I reloaded last save then I got stuck in a safe house and could not jump to get out of the window. This is by far one of the worst game ever. FPS was so ♥♥♥♥ed I never got over 17 FPS and my PC is over the min requirements. Really WTF! You I only played it for free this weekend but you guys should give me $60 for this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I can see why people would give this game a bad review. Paying $40 for a game that is super repetitive and has very little story is insane, but for the reduced price I bought the game for it was worth it. The graphics are good and the game is fun to just play every once in awhile. Do not get this game for $40 but it's defintely a game to wait out and get if you like to just run around an open world and kill♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This game isn't half bad as people seek it out to be. I'm getting a solid 60 framesBut, some things are a little cluncky, like the movement, when they walk it looks like they're gliding, and already the dialouge is a little cheesy. Great graphics though. Story seems fun so far, starts off a little slow, I wish they could have thrown you right into the action, that the game was made out to be. I never played the game when it was released, so I didn't know the problems that were there before the 2.0 patch that made the game better. I'm enjoying it so far. I give this game a 7/10, might buy it after the free trial ends. But don't get this game for PC, get it for the ps4 or xbox one.But the game is still fun though.The Devs should do what Warner Bros did with Batman Arkham Knight and take it off the steam store for a while and work on it to make it better, this game still has a load of potential to be a good game, and the devs executed that potential poorly.

												I have been playing this game from the beginning, well before the patch's that Dambuster studio's has been putting out, don't believe me check my hours. Would I suggest people to play it, Damn right YES I would.The story is amazing and alot longer than I would have even expected, the gameplay is even better, come on who doesn't like setting up daisy chains and driving an RC car packed with either a molotov or C4 strapped onto it into a nicely set up murder zone.Yes it has co-op but this game isn't all about its co-op mode which can also be pretty nice, its about the single player game.If you want multiplayer go back to the biggest multiplayer map called ""The World"" in the award winning game called ""Your Real Life"" To be honest, other than a couple instances of drop in frames per second I have yet to have any game breaking bugs.Not like the fun falling through the ground in Battlefield 4, dieing to invunerable npc's in The Division or the downright annoying crashing in Fallout 4.For all those scrubs who are about to ♥♥♥♥♥ I run an I7 Intel chip and a high end graphics card. I have yet to find a game which doesnt run at 60-80fps on ultra settings.I should further mention it is becoming common practice for alot of high end game production teams including bethesda and the notorious ubisoft for releasing games which should have spent more time in the bug testing phase than we actually got in return. Effectively producing games which should not even be available to purchase.Now how does it differ hear, firstly Dambuster studios is a much smaller company and more importantly they actually listened to all of the problems from both genuine gaming enthusiast's and the ♥♥♥♥♥ing from scrubs and managed to fix alot of the games problems.All I can say to all of those whiney idiots who need a fresh nappy and their dummy is, that the story is beautifully put together ok yes its a little cliche but let me say this clearly.ITS A DAMN GAME STFU.Also I will finish this with at least it isn't ""No Man's Fail""So while I wait for the first expansion and more importantly The Walking Dead Season 3 from Telltale games, time for some Witcher 3.

												This game might've had issues in the past, and like many i was put off by bad reviews. This was a game i wanted to play since it came out because i liked the concept and how they made their second game an open world one. I've played about six hours so far and i'm actually very satisfied. I haven't felt the ""need"" to come back to a single player game since skyrim. Aside from the ""lack"" of weapons you can actually buy and some questionable AI sometimes the game is solid. I guess you could compare it to far cry in some ways, since it's open and it let's you plan ahead but keep in mind that you'll mostly be fighting in urban areas. The tone and atmosphere of the game is pretty much what took me by surprise. Definitely worth it if you like the genre. Sometimes you gotta go past reviews to see the true potential of things for yourself.			"

The story is the weakest part but it can easily be over looked cause the game is fun.  Think a far cry set in a run down city instead of a jungle.			"

												Experience: Played 4 hours into the game; started liberating the yellow zone.The game is a lot of fun in my opinion and plays like an Urban Far Cry. I would honestly pay a full retail price for the game but I won't be. The reason is due to poor optimization. I am running above the recommended specs but the game constantly hitches and stutters. Even though the game is fun, I can't have fun due to the poor optimization.			"

I reluctantly bought it on sale for $10 under pressure of a ton of mixed and negative reviews.  But I'm glad i bought it.  It's one of the most fun games i've played in a long time.

												Interesting game mechanics similar to Far Cry in the aspect of taking over strongholds and other various points on the map however that's pretty much all you end up doing area's may look different but it's a rehash of the same events. This game sadly fails to capture the grittiness of the previous title which is a missed opportunity on the developers part. You geniunely feel no attachment to any character or the struggles America is going through this entire game. As the previous title you had a lot of gut churning moments at how monsterious an invading force can be however it's downfall was how short the game was.Despite it being free over the weekend I personally have played enough to say I won't be purchasing the game as I've experienced all the game has to offer for me, I didn't have a chance to play the multiplayer aspect of it but I don't feel like I am missing out on much, I'd say it's a 5/10 kept my attention for a bit and the appeal wore off shortly after.

												I have felt this type of gameplay before.S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Far Cry 2, Red Faction Armegeddon...these are games that may have flaws but the gameplay is so superb.  It doesn't have that AAA mainstream appeal, instead it has an underground, I found a unique game gem, feel.If you have played and enjoyed any of the games above, then you also feel the pain when these types of games do not come out anymore. So I am glad I bought this title, extremely immersive especially when some of the HUD indicators are turned off.Also has extremely PC centric options, as a PC gamer you know what I mean, I feel no need to explain this, plus Crytech engine is still amazing to behold in action. Very talented developers worked on this, I am glad the patches came along game runs smooth as well.			"

												Surprisingly enjoyable. Patches seem to have reduced the framerate problems to the occasional hiccup. Game runs smoothly and seems to be optimized (by removing select volumetric lighting effects, etc) enough that my computer barely feels its weight. So far as story is concernced, there isn't much of one. Homefront also drops its introduced characters fairly quickly, opting to drop you into a small sandbox environment, allowing you to complete activities and unlock the small area bit by bit. Though, the overall world map is very large later on. Taking a page from Far Cry, Homefront sees you completing small tasks while disrupting radio signals and invading strongholds. However, it is in the setting and gunplay where the game really becomes fun.You might be surprised by the lack of customization options for weapons, but you'll quickly realize that 2-3 full weapon mods (ripping apart a pistol on the fly and making it an smg, for example) for each of the 5 weapons with full attatchment options (sight, barrel, underbarrel, etc) per mod make for some epic combinations. The story and characters aren't really there, but the gunplay feels fantastic and the game shines as you rip apart your shotgun, turn it into a fireball launcher and burn a score of enemies, allowing you to unlock a portion of the map and see all the other fun things to do nearby.

												This game is caca dookie. let me start off by saying in full disclosure that I did not pay for this game i only played it on the free weekend. So what makes this game utter crap, well kinda everything. 1) the weapons in the game seem to lack any real feeling, i cant place my finger on it they just seem to all feel wrong. 2) the story, i could give a flying rats♥♥♥♥♥about my charecter or any other charecter i have met. i have zero emotional attachment to anyone one, either as a comrade or a brother in arms. it just fails on all levels of making you connect with the world or the charecters. Finally number 3) this is the big MF of why this game gets the golden turd award. First let me bring your attention to the fact that I am playing this game in {{1080}} not 4k not 1440 but {{1080}}. now let me also tell you my system specs. I have a beast of a pc with an i7 4690k (no overclock at this time, i know dont judge), 16gb ddr3 1600mhz, samsung pro 250 ssd. and the BMF of a gpu. Now the game has a huge fps problem even with my specs going from the 120 down to around 70. So what is a BMF gpu you ask? well its not the 750ti, or the 960, not the 970 or the 980 hell it's not even the titan x, nope its the top of the line 1080. So there is absolutely no F""ing reason this game should not be running at a consistant 144 with max everthing except for the fact of♥♥♥♥♥♥poor optimization. Stay away from this game if the developer cant produce a game that runs at a decent FPS in {{{{{1080}}}}} on the top of the line card, made for gaming in 8k than someone done f""ed it up.			"

Warning: Sorry for the VERY long review. TL:DR = It's way better then most people say, I recommendI was kinda looking forward to this game since I first saw it at E3 2014, it looked a lot better then the sh***y half-as**d CoD clone that was the first Homefront, but then it actually came out and it got critcally panned, even the more positive reviews were pretty ""meh"". I was disappointed but not really surprised ""what a shame"" I thought before moving on to other games, but during the winter sale I saw that it had gone down to 11 euro and I didn't really have anything else I wanted to get so i decided to get it just to see if it was bad as everyone said it was. 36 hours of gameplay later I sat back in my chair, thoroughly satisfied. Homefront the Revolution isn't an amazing game by any means but it is a solid enjoyable open world tactical shooter that Is one of the best surprises to round of a sh***y year.Now that I see it showing up on many worst games lists I feel like I owe this game a review even if it's only a steam user review that no one will probably even see.StoryThe game's narrative won't win any awards but it's interesting enough while your there, basically North Korea gets it's own version of Apple (Apex) who manufacture everything from smarphones and tablets to military drones and tanks and turn North Korea into a super power. America buys lots of this tech to help them in there various wars but the U.S can't keep it up and goes into economic collapse and the Korean People's Army (KPA) move in to restore order and collect on America's debt. But everything quickly goes bad and the KPA go from saviors to occupiers and you have to join the resistance in Philadelphia and fight back.The story has some interesting themes of what armed revolution means and when does it go too far and become strate up terrorism and I have to give them credit for not going with a black and white, good vs evil story, the most ""evil"" character in the game is one of your primary allies while the the two main villians are actually somewhat sympathetic. While the characters are fairly two-demensional they are well voice acted and aren't a chore to watch. The game's atmosphere on the other hand is excellent, it really nails the whole dystopian, totalitarian almost post apocalyptic vibe and it's definitely one of the games strongest points.The story has it's problems though, the player character really shouldn't have been a silent protaganist(he speaks in the dlc but that only makes it more annoying that he didn't talk in the first place) and the character of Ben Walker is pooly handled, he's suppoessed to be really important but he doesn't get enough screen time to make you care. In the end the actual narrative is fine while it's there but you'll probably forget it a week later, but the setting and atmosphere are superb and what really sticks with you.TechnicalThe main reason this game got panned is that it released in a buggy broken state with horrible performance and numerous gamebraking bugs on all platforms, while I can't speak for the consoles I can confirm that the PC version has been almost completely patched:-Framerate drops: gone-Gamebraking bugs; gone-Stalling everytime it autosaves: gone-Broken AI: gone (mostly)I can only speak for my own experiance of cource but I got a solid 60 FPS from my GTX 1060 while running on max settings 99.9% of the time. There are still some minor bugs but nothing that effects gameplay, things like a little bit of pop-in, minor clipping and the rare floating prop, I did have a single crash 3 hours in and there was this one scripted bit where all the sound apart from the dialogue cut out for about 3 minutes but that's as bad as it got.On top of this It's a very good looking game, excellent texture work, effects and lighting with pretty good sound design and music aswell. This really adds to the games atmosphere and immersion, the animations on npcs can look a little stiff at times but overall this is a gorgeus game with a great attention to detail.GameplayThe Game also got criticism for not really doing anything new and this mostly true and while this may hold it back from being great it doesn't stop it from being good, it takes elements from Far Cry, Crysis, Red Faction; Guerrilla and Metro among others. The open world is divided into three different types of zone (Red, Yellow and Green zones)Red zones are where you will spent most of your time, there are 4 Red zones and they're a lot larger then the Yellow zones. In the Red zones it's pretty much a warzone, KPA forces will shoot you on sight and they are constantly being patrolled buy large airships that will call in waves of troops if they spot you with their search beams. You can capture sections of the zone by taking over KPA bases and capturing ""strike points"", this will increase the Resistance presence while supressing the KPA. You can also further increase Resistance morale by doing little side things while you explore like turning on resistance radios, killing KPA snipers and ambushing and destroying armoured patrols. You can also drive around on motorbikes which is fun once you get the hang of it, though I wish you could shoot from the bike as it leaves you a bit exposed.Then there are the Yellow zones, of which there are 3 (not counting the prologue area), they're not as large as the Red zones but are a lot more built up with normal civilians going about their business. In these zones as long as you keep your weapon holstered and avoid getting too close to soldiers and drones you can basically walk around freely and there are special hiding spots such as dumpsters that can be used to shake your wanted level if you are detected. Many of the same rules from the Red zones still apply, you can capture strike points and bases to increase your control and raise morale buy doing various side things like saving civilians and prisoners, sabotaging KPA devices and assinating KPA officals. Unlike the Red zone however you can't get rid of the KPA by capturing sections of the zone, the only way to suppress them completely is by causing enough decent among the people to make them riot. On that note I really like the way the zones change due to your actions with npcs seen acting different and the enviroment changing around you.Lastly there are the Green zones of which there are 3 again. Green zone aren't proper opan zones but instead are heavily fortified locations that are very important to the KPA that simply serve as the locations for some of the games larger setpiece story missions.In terms of the actual shooting it actually feels a bit more like Metro then Far Cry in some ways, the player can't take much damage even on the Easy difficulty (I spent most of my time playing on the highest difficulty btw) but neither can the enemies, a well placed headshot can kill all the regular soldier varients, even the tougher enemies like heavy troopers and amoured cars can be taken down in a couple of battle rifle rounds if you aim for their weak points, the one exception to this rule is the heavy Goliath drone-tanks but these are quite rare compared to the other enemy types. thats not to say the game is easy, as I said you die very quickly as well and the enemies are aggressive and always have you outnumbered so the use of strategy is required, knowing when to stand and fight and when to get the hell outta there is important as are stealth, ambush and hit'n run tactics. This keeps the combat intense from end to end. Stealth is also ok, pretty much the same as Far Cry. Lastly there is also the weapon convertion kits that allow you to transform your guns into completely differant guns on the fly! The only big negative I have about the gameplay is the ai can still be dumb at times even after patches.Final Verdict: pretty good, recommended especially when on sale. Sorry for long♥♥♥♥♥review, thx for reading. "

												This game is not so bad.Graphics are ok, sound ok. The scavenge system, the dreaded atmosphere and destroyed enviroment reminded me of STALKER but that´s it. The missions are quite boring after 2 maps as it is the same thing over and over...conquer this...conquer that. The weapons are weird, the enemy AI is stupid. You can have a laugh or two with this game. And that´s it. It´s not worth full price. Grab it on a steam sale.			"

Runs like a dream for me. The gun play is quite, quite good. Story is generic. The open world is pretty boring. Characters were pretty bland except for Dana who was marginally better than the rest of the cast.I would not pay full price this.

												sucks, basically requested a refund due to how bad it was. Feels clunky, bad rendering, voices out of sync, although the combat can be alright and the story is not as good as the first one but still ticks a few boxes. I do however appreciate that the developers tried to bring us a good game and that there was alot of effort put into the game. Once again however it just feels rushed, there is some good stuff but alas bad things too and unfortunately it does not compensate for what we have been given. Do not buy unless it is sold for less than £6.50.			"

												Tragically underrated.While not a ""great"" game by any means, Homefront: The Revolution is a good single-player open-world shooter.  A solid 8/10.Two warnings:1.  The DLC are ok, but non-essential.  The prologue and epilogue campaigns are well-crafted yet relatively linear compared to the main game.  I would have been satified without them.  The other DLC are for the online co-op...2.  The online co-op community is dead.  Which is a shame, because what I played in a private group was a great co-op experience.  As much as I tried, I never found a public game.			"

												I bought this game in a sale with very little to no expectations at all. Never played the original and only remember hearing mostly negative comments around release. But I have to say...once you get the graphics dialed in for your machine (this was made in CryEngine, it's not optimized for potatos) it's a lot of fun. Surprisingly so. It is by no means a perfect FPS (some *coughmostcough* of the dialogue is overly cheesy, most of the characters are throwaways, the AI is not the smartest, etc.) but it's still a pretty fun romp thruough ruined Philly shooting up the dirty North Korean invaders.The gun customization mechanic is something that should be stolen by other FPS games imo. For me, finding cover and popping the receiver off of my weapon and attaching another to completely change my playstyle never gets old. This game (like so many others) suffered from being realeased too early, but from what I can tell the patching has done it a world of good. If you can get it cheap in a sale, it's a steal. Just manage your expectations going in and be prepared to fiddle with the graphics settings.			"

I love it they better be making another one. Also I don't know why people are posting neg reviews? This game took a bunch of great things that worked in other games and put them all together and made some thing different and great. It feels like half life at times and then at times its like farcry with just a bit of assassins creed, and yet even with all that it totally feels and is a game not like anything else.

												I played both Homefront. I really loved the athmosphere in both games.  Both games had a lot of critics. Both games are that type of games that not everybody like. What can I say about this game:The Graphic is very good. The Sound is good. I didn't saw much bugs in this game, so this is pretty good. But when I first buyed the game I had a lot of problem cuz of the lag. The game was laging to much. I even thought to send the game to hell and don't play it cuz of this. But I solved the problem. And enjoyed it. So this is a big bad thing. The story itself is... interesting. But a lil boring. I liked the ""far cry"" system of the game, but it's so repetitive. The IA is good. On hard mode the enemy is letal. In the first part of the game, exactly. I can't say nothing about the multiplayer cuz nobody plays it. But I really enjoed the game. This game give you to think a little. Why are you doing this? Are you on the right side? And how to conquest a point aswell. You can choose action or stealth. It's a good game in the end. I buyed it for a couple of rubli ( cuz I'm from Russia ) and I can say that this game does not cost the price of 70 euros ( cuz new games in Europe cost like this, I'm saying it like this so you can understand what I mean ). 7.5 of 10			"

												It's not a bad game, it was just overhyped(kinda like the first one). I would however recommend you buy it on sale instead of the full price. In the first hour of the game you feel like it's too easy but as soon as you go into the next area of the game it becomes pretty difficult. I've often found myself doing hit and run attacks until the sector is high enough for an uprising. I haven't had any performance issues so I'm glad they fixed those issues. I haven't played coop yet since i'm still on the main campaign but If you go into this game with average expectations and play it on a higher difficulty you'll find it a fun game to play.			"

												First Impression; As only a short bit in to game, so far have both enjoyed and liked the game experience, as ratings given have been mixed on game.The game developers have given visable support to concern of players of game,and has already undergone serveral patches to remedy glitches in game play.The developers of this game have kept the PC spec's in the mid-range for this game, so most should be able to not only run game, but  enjoy the eye candy the game has to offer. Playing game on full ultra-high setting (System; ASRock Extreme MB / AMD six-core 1090T over-clocked to 3.6 / Nvidia  Evga GTX750 / 16 Gbs ram ), and graphics are nice, along with a smooth interface in game play, and have no regrets in buying this game so far.The mixed rating are the main reason for this early review, as after some game time, feel this is a game worth playing.Cannot comment on MP, as have yet to experience playing it, but have enjoyed SP/Campaign mode in game so far.My last review was on Doom, one of the most fluid addictive action games, I've had the chance to play, while Homefront does run a course of action, its mixed with a need to make use of one's mental faculties, which some may find inpeding to their sense of gaming, which might be the source of some of the mixed feelings of game.And while objective markers are given, how one gets physically to that point is left to the player's mental input, no 'X' marks the spot to climb, jump or grab, Game play is more in line with a game like Dead Island Riptide, where taking efforts in foraging for items to create usable equiptment to use in the fight, are mixed in with end goals.As with most games I recommend find visiting U-Tube and other sites for viewing  actual in-game play, as well as viewing posted comments and graphics on Steam Homefront game page.I will update this review after I've gotten some more game time, nor can I comment on MP, as have yet to experience playing it, but have enjoyed SP mode in game so far.When I have more depth and insight into game, I will give this game a more proper review, so at this point, asking you to keep in mind my  limited time in game-play at this time.So far I  give it a full thumbs up as far as SP/Campaign, and recommend it, as haven't played MP yet, so no comment there, but again I do want to stress have only started to sink my teeth into game.And as Arnold said; in his  well known line, in his role as the Terminator; ""I'll be back"".

												Only get this on sale...- Controls are really wonky: you walk around like a drunk guy, the aiming is off and changes sometimes without you doing anything (I jumped down a building without moving twice)... You will lose most of your bullets trying to aim correctly (not aiming gives you a higher succesrate)... Trying to center something to open with E often results in taking the viewpoint away from that spot and being unable to open it...- Like a lot of 'action'-games these days it starts off with several cinematics you can not scip followed by a 'walking' mission. The game only starts after 15 minutes.+ idea of the gameplay is ok, without the problems stated above, it would have been a great game.			"

												Far from perfect, far from being as horrible as people describe it. Sure the writing and character development could be better, but what is not covered individually is compensated by the resistance as a whole: this is not your generic patriotic resistance; it's a darker and more violent one driven by revenge and hatred more than by generic nationalism. And that is something you don't see everyday.Shooting mecanics get the work done, and the variety of weapon customization really helps in preventing a long game like this become monotonous and tedious. Worth a play if you get it on a sale and have a rig good enough to run the power-hungry beast that the Cryengine is.			"

However, I can't recommend a game that just doesn't work. Don't buy this game. EVER. You may not get crashes, but it's not worth the risk. If they do another free weekend, then I say try it out.

Posted: January 12
												So, let's get this out of the way first: Homefront: The Revolution is not as bad as the Steam user score and many of the critic reviews said it was. Yes, it has its fair share of problems. Yes, the game was horrendously buggy on release. And yes, it's extremely derivative, and often feels like any one of open-world shooters that are so popular right now in the gaming space. Having said all that, the game isn't awful, and it's certainly playable, especially now 8 months after release, with most of the gamebreaking bugs patched out.So, let's start with the premise. Homefront: The Revolution is not a sequel to the 2011 game (though it started out as one,) but is instead a reboot of the series, with the same premise of an America occupied by North Korea, and you take on the role, again, of an American citizen, Ethan Brady, waging guerrilla war on the KPA. Surprisingly, the premise here somehow manages to be somehow worse than the first game. While the ideas that it explores are interesting (technology with backdoors, leading to powerlessness of the military when their equipment is turned off,) the idea that Silicon Valley could have started in North Korea in the 1970's is just laughably ridiculous, even by the premises most games expect you to suspend your disbelief for. If it had been another country than North Korea (China, for example, or even Russia, stale as that would have been,) then it would have actually been a very interesting idea. Needless to say, it just feels goofy. Once you get over the nonsensical set-up, the actual game's plot is pretty decent. It's certainly not going to win any awards, especially when compared to several AAA game plots that have been written recently, but it's definitely interesting/entertaining enough to keep you enthralled throughout its 20 or so hour runtime (depending on how many of the side activities you undertake.) It's a pretty simple story of resistance and guerrilla warfare, and it tries to put in a somewhat interesting debate about the morals of violent insurgency vs peaceful protesting, but this debate is really hampered by the fact that Brady is a silent protagonist. While the NPC characters are fun and likeable characters to be around, and are extremely charismatic and well-acted, Brady's silence means that the player has no ability to weigh in on the debate whatsoever, one of the main complaints I have with silent protagonists in games anyway, but it's accentuated here by their attempt to have some sort of moral argument. Overall, the story is decent, with a pretty satisfying ending that still allows for the possibility of a sequel. In terms of the gameplay, I'm happy to report that Homefront is the second game that I know of to successfully capture the feel of guerrilla warfare (the first being Red Faction: Guerrilla.) This game is hard, and you absolutely have to play it like a hit-and-run resistance fighter. The KPA soldiers have better weapons and armor than you, and will always have greater numbers. In addition, the armoured cars and drones patrolling the streets will kill you in a  matter of seconds if you don't have cover. The game uses a health kit system instead of regenerating health, which is a wonderful decision for forcing you to play it smart and not a run and gun like the first game, but it can be a bit frustrating at times if you're caught out in the open without any kind of health kits. Of course, you have options for fighting back as well, and while the two weapon limit can seem restrictive at first, the game includes a weapon customization system like the Crysis games, and it really shines here. For example, your basic pistol can transform into a silent pneumatic powered dart gun, or a rapid-fire SMG, while the assault rifle can also turn into a LMG or a grenade launcher. This means that even though you can't carry a full complement of weaponry, you always have multiple for how to engage the KPA soldiers in the streets. You also have the ability to craft items such as IEDs, Molotov Cocktails, and hacking items.The open world is split into a series of gameplay zones, each falling under the classification of Red or Yellow zones. Red zones are essentially bombed out war zones, with the KPA attacking on sight and being patrolled by the terrifying airships overhead. Here, it plays most like a typical shooter, with you capturing strike points to expand Resistance influence and stall the KPA temporarily. Yellow zones, on the other hand, are the more interesting of the two. This is where the majority of civilians live, and they're heavily guarded police zones that feel like something out of 1984. Here, you have to stay stealthy, and pulling a weapon in public view will bring hell down on you as you are attacked by tons of heavily armed KPA forces. To trigger revolution here, you have to commit acts such as sabotaging loudspeakers, killing KPA soldiers to free civilians, and capturing Strike Points here as well. even though the zones are fun, Homefront is still an incredibly derivative shooter, and whether or not you think this is a bad thing will depend on how sick you are of the model. Personally, I don't play too many open world games, so I enjoyed it, but by the end even I was feeling fatigued at the prospect of capturing more of the same kind of Strike Points and taking on jobs to earn money that are actually pretty annoying because they force you to either photograph enemies/items in the world, or kill a certain amount of enemies one set way. However, most of the activities are entirely optional, and you can skip most of them if you just want to rush through the story as fast as possible.As for the visuals, it's really a stunning looking game. While the first Homefront (which ran on Unreal Engine 3,) looked pretty awful, this one runs on Cryengine and is a gorgeous looking game. The zones all have their own distinct look and feel, which is nice. The sound is good as well, with the guns all sounding and feeling punchy, and the voice acting is top-notch. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is rather lackluster, with no particularly good tracks that you'll want to listen to after. Now, for the bugs. If you've held off on The Revolution for all the gamebreaking bugs that were present at launch, well, I'm happy to report that those are gone, with only mostly visual bugs remaining. I did encounter a couple bugs that prevented me from capturing Strike Points, but nothing that would stop me from completing the game. So, should you buy Homefront? It really depends on how sick you are with open-world games in general. If you've played the Far Cry games to death and want more, you'll definitely like it. If you hated those, there's nothing here that will change your mind. But I will say it's gotten far worse press than it deserves, because what you have here is a fun open-world shooter that gives you the feel of being a Resistance fighter, with a pretty good and inspirational story of standing up and fighting back.

												Ok i don't write many reviews, and the reason I have is that this game has had really bad reviews, but I bought it reasonably cheap for steam and have to say I am really enjoying this game. The graphics are good, and the FPS is decent. the gameplay is lot better than I thought it would be. Lots of action, capturing bases, day and night cycles and a open world to boot. I can recommend this game for fun factor (Much better than the latest COD). get it if its on offer, you wont regret it.			"

												Great game; I really enjoyed it. Honestly, I don't really understand the mixed reviews for this game. It can be a bit frustrating at times and it's not exactly easy, but if you want easy go play candy crush or something. It's not short like the first game. According to howlongtobeat it takes about 11 hours on average without messing with the extras and 18 hours with extras. It looks gorgeous; the Crytek Engine really shines on this one. I defintely recommend it.			"

												Looked good, had lots of fun fighting for the ""revolution""!.  There were a few small bugs, but nothing that ruined the game or story, overall a lot of fun.  I like how the game left a lot of it somewhat open, so you could do what you wanted, but still had a linear story line.  Good fun!  Thanks to the rough road the developers had to get this out, was worth it.			"

												It's not a bad game, it was just overhyped(kinda like the first one). I would however recommend you buy it on sale instead of the full price. In the first hour of the game you feel like it's too easy but as soon as you go into the next area of the game it becomes pretty difficult. I've often found myself doing hit and run attacks until the sector is high enough for an uprising. I haven't had any performance issues so I'm glad they fixed those issues. I haven't played coop yet since i'm still on the main campaign but If you go into this game with average expectations and play it on a higher difficulty you'll find it a fun game to play.			"

												Only get this on sale...- Controls are really wonky: you walk around like a drunk guy, the aiming is off and changes sometimes without you doing anything (I jumped down a building without moving twice)... You will lose most of your bullets trying to aim correctly (not aiming gives you a higher succesrate)... Trying to center something to open with E often results in taking the viewpoint away from that spot and being unable to open it...- Like a lot of 'action'-games these days it starts off with several cinematics you can not scip followed by a 'walking' mission. The game only starts after 15 minutes.+ idea of the gameplay is ok, without the problems stated above, it would have been a great game.			"

												First Impression; As only a short bit in to game, so far have both enjoyed and liked the game experience, as ratings given have been mixed on game.The game developers have given visable support to concern of players of game,and has already undergone serveral patches to remedy glitches in game play.The developers of this game have kept the PC spec's in the mid-range for this game, so most should be able to not only run game, but  enjoy the eye candy the game has to offer. Playing game on full ultra-high setting (System; ASRock Extreme MB / AMD six-core 1090T over-clocked to 3.6 / Nvidia  Evga GTX750 / 16 Gbs ram ), and graphics are nice, along with a smooth interface in game play, and have no regrets in buying this game so far.The mixed rating are the main reason for this early review, as after some game time, feel this is a game worth playing.Cannot comment on MP, as have yet to experience playing it, but have enjoyed SP/Campaign mode in game so far.My last review was on Doom, one of the most fluid addictive action games, I've had the chance to play, while Homefront does run a course of action, its mixed with a need to make use of one's mental faculties, which some may find inpeding to their sense of gaming, which might be the source of some of the mixed feelings of game.And while objective markers are given, how one gets physically to that point is left to the player's mental input, no 'X' marks the spot to climb, jump or grab, Game play is more in line with a game like Dead Island Riptide, where taking efforts in foraging for items to create usable equiptment to use in the fight, are mixed in with end goals.As with most games I recommend find visiting U-Tube and other sites for viewing  actual in-game play, as well as viewing posted comments and graphics on Steam Homefront game page.I will update this review after I've gotten some more game time, nor can I comment on MP, as have yet to experience playing it, but have enjoyed SP mode in game so far.When I have more depth and insight into game, I will give this game a more proper review, so at this point, asking you to keep in mind my  limited time in game-play at this time.So far I  give it a full thumbs up as far as SP/Campaign, and recommend it, as haven't played MP yet, so no comment there, but again I do want to stress have only started to sink my teeth into game.And as Arnold said; in his  well known line, in his role as the Terminator; ""I'll be back"".

												The game played fine for a little bit, but then started crashing. After the first crash, I was not able to play for more than 5 minutes before it crashed again. This sucks, because what I played was actually quite fun. Being able to customize your weapons on the fly was great, and reminded me a lot of Crysis. However, I can't recommend a game that just doesn't work. Don't buy this game. EVER. You may not get crashes, but it's not worth the risk. If they do another free weekend, then I say try it out. Otherwise, just stay away.			"

Runs like a dream for me. The gun play is quite, quite good. Story is generic. The open world is pretty boring. Characters were pretty bland except for Dana who was marginally better than the rest of the cast.I would not pay full price this.

												Surprisingly enjoyable. Patches seem to have reduced the framerate problems to the occasional hiccup. Game runs smoothly and seems to be optimized (by removing select volumetric lighting effects, etc) enough that my computer barely feels its weight. So far as story is concernced, there isn't much of one. Homefront also drops its introduced characters fairly quickly, opting to drop you into a small sandbox environment, allowing you to complete activities and unlock the small area bit by bit. Though, the overall world map is very large later on. Taking a page from Far Cry, Homefront sees you completing small tasks while disrupting radio signals and invading strongholds. However, it is in the setting and gunplay where the game really becomes fun.You might be surprised by the lack of customization options for weapons, but you'll quickly realize that 2-3 full weapon mods (ripping apart a pistol on the fly and making it an smg, for example) for each of the 5 weapons with full attatchment options (sight, barrel, underbarrel, etc) per mod make for some epic combinations. The story and characters aren't really there, but the gunplay feels fantastic and the game shines as you rip apart your shotgun, turn it into a fireball launcher and burn a score of enemies, allowing you to unlock a portion of the map and see all the other fun things to do nearby.

												So, let's get this out of the way first: Homefront: The Revolution is not as bad as the Steam user score and many of the critic reviews said it was. Yes, it has its fair share of problems. Yes, the game was horrendously buggy on release. And yes, it's extremely derivative, and often feels like any one of open-world shooters that are so popular right now in the gaming space. Having said all that, the game isn't awful, and it's certainly playable, especially now 8 months after release, with most of the gamebreaking bugs patched out.So, let's start with the premise. Homefront: The Revolution is not a sequel to the 2011 game (though it started out as one,) but is instead a reboot of the series, with the same premise of an America occupied by North Korea, and you take on the role, again, of an American citizen, Ethan Brady, waging guerrilla war on the KPA. Surprisingly, the premise here somehow manages to be somehow worse than the first game. While the ideas that it explores are interesting (technology with backdoors, leading to powerlessness of the military when their equipment is turned off,) the idea that Silicon Valley could have started in North Korea in the 1970's is just laughably ridiculous, even by the premises most games expect you to suspend your disbelief for. If it had been another country than North Korea (China, for example, or even Russia, stale as that would have been,) then it would have actually been a very interesting idea. Needless to say, it just feels goofy. Once you get over the nonsensical set-up, the actual game's plot is pretty decent. It's certainly not going to win any awards, especially when compared to several AAA game plots that have been written recently, but it's definitely interesting/entertaining enough to keep you enthralled throughout its 20 or so hour runtime (depending on how many of the side activities you undertake.) It's a pretty simple story of resistance and guerrilla warfare, and it tries to put in a somewhat interesting debate about the morals of violent insurgency vs peaceful protesting, but this debate is really hampered by the fact that Brady is a silent protagonist. While the NPC characters are fun and likeable characters to be around, and are extremely charismatic and well-acted, Brady's silence means that the player has no ability to weigh in on the debate whatsoever, one of the main complaints I have with silent protagonists in games anyway, but it's accentuated here by their attempt to have some sort of moral argument. Overall, the story is decent, with a pretty satisfying ending that still allows for the possibility of a sequel. In terms of the gameplay, I'm happy to report that Homefront is the second game that I know of to successfully capture the feel of guerrilla warfare (the first being Red Faction: Guerrilla.) This game is hard, and you absolutely have to play it like a hit-and-run resistance fighter. The KPA soldiers have better weapons and armor than you, and will always have greater numbers. In addition, the armoured cars and drones patrolling the streets will kill you in a  matter of seconds if you don't have cover. The game uses a health kit system instead of regenerating health, which is a wonderful decision for forcing you to play it smart and not a run and gun like the first game, but it can be a bit frustrating at times if you're caught out in the open without any kind of health kits. Of course, you have options for fighting back as well, and while the two weapon limit can seem restrictive at first, the game includes a weapon customization system like the Crysis games, and it really shines here. For example, your basic pistol can transform into a silent pneumatic powered dart gun, or a rapid-fire SMG, while the assault rifle can also turn into a LMG or a grenade launcher. This means that even though you can't carry a full complement of weaponry, you always have multiple for how to engage the KPA soldiers in the streets. You also have the ability to craft items such as IEDs, Molotov Cocktails, and hacking items.The open world is split into a series of gameplay zones, each falling under the classification of Red or Yellow zones. Red zones are essentially bombed out war zones, with the KPA attacking on sight and being patrolled by the terrifying airships overhead. Here, it plays most like a typical shooter, with you capturing strike points to expand Resistance influence and stall the KPA temporarily. Yellow zones, on the other hand, are the more interesting of the two. This is where the majority of civilians live, and they're heavily guarded police zones that feel like something out of 1984. Here, you have to stay stealthy, and pulling a weapon in public view will bring hell down on you as you are attacked by tons of heavily armed KPA forces. To trigger revolution here, you have to commit acts such as sabotaging loudspeakers, killing KPA soldiers to free civilians, and capturing Strike Points here as well. even though the zones are fun, Homefront is still an incredibly derivative shooter, and whether or not you think this is a bad thing will depend on how sick you are of the model. Personally, I don't play too many open world games, so I enjoyed it, but by the end even I was feeling fatigued at the prospect of capturing more of the same kind of Strike Points and taking on jobs to earn money that are actually pretty annoying because they force you to either photograph enemies/items in the world, or kill a certain amount of enemies one set way. However, most of the activities are entirely optional, and you can skip most of them if you just want to rush through the story as fast as possible.As for the visuals, it's really a stunning looking game. While the first Homefront (which ran on Unreal Engine 3,) looked pretty awful, this one runs on Cryengine and is a gorgeous looking game. The zones all have their own distinct look and feel, which is nice. The sound is good as well, with the guns all sounding and feeling punchy, and the voice acting is top-notch. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is rather lackluster, with no particularly good tracks that you'll want to listen to after. Now, for the bugs. If you've held off on The Revolution for all the gamebreaking bugs that were present at launch, well, I'm happy to report that those are gone, with only mostly visual bugs remaining. I did encounter a couple bugs that prevented me from capturing Strike Points, but nothing that would stop me from completing the game. So, should you buy Homefront? It really depends on how sick you are with open-world games in general. If you've played the Far Cry games to death and want more, you'll definitely like it. If you hated those, there's nothing here that will change your mind. But I will say it's gotten far worse press than it deserves, because what you have here is a fun open-world shooter that gives you the feel of being a Resistance fighter, with a pretty good and inspirational story of standing up and fighting back.

												This game is currently underrated.  That may not have been the case 6 months ago when steam/professionals reviews nominated it the biggest AAA poopstain of 2016.  Six months later, a lot of the technical/gamebreaking bugs are gone.  What's left is something of an urban Far Cry clone with a pretty outlandish story that delivers a few different gameplay elements in a pretty above-average way.  I spent about 50 hours playing it and I enjoyed myself. Setting:   North Korea won the Korean War, uniting the entire peninsula and creating the world's foremost technological superpower.  Years later, the US is depleted and heavily dependent on Korea.  The Koreans take advantage of this and essentially take over the US under the pretense of peacekeeping.  You are a newly recruited revolutionary in the Philadelphia branch of the resistance against the takeover.  What you may like: -Above average artistic presentation.  Good textures with limited popping.  Dynamic day/night cycle.  Quality motion-captured animations.  The resistance fighters look cool.  -Level design is top notch.  Lots of nooks and crannies for you to scavange and take potshots at the enemy form.  Very vertical with lots of parkour, with lots of open-ended methods of approach.  The different areas of the game vary enough to keep it fresh despite you doing basically the same thing.  What you may not like:-Still quite buggy, although not game-breaking.  I was not able to complete some side jobs.  I fell through the world once. Some texture flickering.-The story is pretty ridiculous and the enemies are kinda goofy/comicbookish.  They look like some brokeass power rangers mixed with the guy from Speed Racer.  I'm pretty sure the designers went for this look on purpose, to create a B-Movie kind of atmosphere.  -No matter how you pamper it with quality level design, capturing a tower is still capturing a tower.  This is basically like an urban far cry, so if you are tired of that, look elsewhere.  Everything else:-Although the weapon modification system is interesting, the upgrades to the weapons are boring stat boosts-Even though the actors did a great job delivering it, the overall writing of the story is pretty cheesy.  -The enemy AI itself is not bad.  Enemies flank, take cover, and attack in groups.However, sometimes enemies will appear/disappear right in front of your face.Conclusion:  If you're itching for a quality urban far cry experience, this is for you.  The game doesn't stray too far from that formula. The level design is easily the best part of this game, and it kept it pretty fresh throughout.  It's still pretty buggy but the massive game-breaking bugs seem to be gone.  I quite enjoyed the different areas of its open world, and thought they were pretty varied, even moreso than many of its competitors.			"

												Alright, so I got this game a few days ago, and from some of the reviews and many YouTube videos I was under the impression that I wasted my money. FOrtunately enough, I gave the game a go. Hereès what I found out for myself:Pros:- Immersive Campaign- Variety of weapons and customizations- Lengthy story (This is mainly if you're like me and hate driving in this game)Cons: - Not the best console ported game in the world- (In my Opinion) Certain customizations don't go with weapons you wish they would :c- Seems to be that there's no PVP mode..Overall I would give this game an 8/10, it's great, looks amazing if your computer can handle it on highest settings and you won't regret your campaign playthrough. I can't speak for the COOP mode as I haven't even made an effort to try that yet, but maybe try to get this game on sale.			"

												I ignored all the negativity around the reviews and got this game anyways. Turns out, it really isnt as bad as people make it out to be. Its got some pretty great graphics, realistic gunplay, and you can customize just about everything. You can even customize your weapon IN THE MISSION. Talk about a game changer, you can convert your battle rifle into a full blown sniper rifle, or even a... makeshift sorta.. well, you'll find out.the only thing I dislike is how freaking fast you max out your character online. From a balancing perspective, its easy to keep it balanced with very few skills, but its a short journey- no, a short jump to max rank once you start the game. That really hurts its replayability. Luckily though, you can create a new character and keep all the gear you've unlocked. Unluckily though, you only get 4 characters max. Not really understanding that.overall though, its a good time-waster with up to 4 friends.			"

												It is an alright game, but the character development is pretty stagnant, just like the repetative missions. The weapon upgrades are pretty garbage and dont offer much variation really. I played a few missions and cleared a zone and already had all the weapon attachments available as well as the upgrades and various other items, a few more and i had half the gear and all the grenades upgrades, leaving well over half the game left with verry little to work for. Its an alright game if you want to pass time and kill some easy AI, but other than that its rather bland.			"

												Great game! I read that it was a satisfying blend of Half-Life 2 and Far Cry 4 and I couldn't agree more.  I bought the game in March 2017 after all the patches were released and the game went on sale for 75% off. I spent 45 very satisfying hours finishing the solo campaign. I guess the lesson for developers, based on all the early negative reviews, continues to be ""don't release your game until it's ready and roll out patches early and often.""  I think if Deep Silver had done that they would have had a real winner on thier hands.			"

												This game had a rough development and launch. But Dambuster Studios did something a vast majority of developers don't due when their game is broke/not fun. They continued supporting it. Have fixed a vast majority of the bugs, delievered even more story content for it and made it a actually fun and fresh shooter to play. Here is my review:GAMEPLAY:+ Satisfying shooter play, and Gun customization+ Multiple ways to approach each Strikepoint, use the enemy's equipment against them with hacks, make a suprise explosion, go in guns blazing, or go in with stealth.+ Fun puzzles to solve in a variety of ways.+ Recruit AI to fight with you+ Good progression pace in terms of getting new gear- Clunky Driving, felt like it was meant to be played on foot only.STORY:+ Story satisfies my desire for a game about American perserverence in a ficitional invasion of the United States    - Wish it went more in depth to what was happening elsewhere in the U.S.+ Later DLC additions added voice acting for Player's Character Ethan Brady.- Doc Burnett's character doesn't fit into the story. He offers little significance and most of the time just comes off as annoying. People die in war, and he plays the pacifist like laying down and taking the abuse from the KPA is going to solve thing. But yet being a pacifist had already decided to help the resistance which fights and kills the KPA.+ Satisfyingly opened up the possibility to a sequel with the 'Beyond the Walls' DLCMULTIPLAYER:+ Is actually really fun, it presents a challange and encourages teamwork.+ Great customization for different types of roles with gear/weapon selection+ Progression seams at the right pace for using in game currency earned through missionsto buy everything you need.- Multiplayer can be sparse. I had times where I tried nearly all day to find a group, and other times where I fellinto a group and played a few rounds. This isn't a problem on Dambusters end however.RECOMMENDATION FOR DEVELPOR:***Should a sequel occur, and with the latest jump into new technology. I hope you guys will consider exploring an even larger part of the U.S. expanding on the story you guys have already built. And if in fact you do that, offer a bettervehicle system that is more polished and refined.***Also consider an procedural weapon generation system akin to Borderlands or the Division. A resistance with low resources will spawn a number of homemade weapons/modifications that could be fun to play with, given realistic restrictions placed on the procedural system.SCORE AND RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSUMER:*** The game in current state as of 3/14/2017 is easily worth a 75% or above overall quality rating. You cannot go wrong getting this game, especially when it goes on sale. However consider buying at full-price to show more support toward Dambuster as they'll get more out of their percentage cut of the sale.			"

												To be honest, when I first started playing this game I was not very impressed - every time I encountered the KPA a huge gunfight would ensue and I would die pretty quickly (also partly due to my average shooting skills). I forced myself to play on, and the more I played, the more I loved it.....As you gain the hearts and minds of the locals, and get some better firepower, defeating the KPA is much more of a fair challenge than early-on.I have played almost 50 hours and don't really have any idea how far through the story I am at the moment, but the game grows on you and I am really enjoying it now...The story is great, graphics very nice - I am getting over 90FPS with a 6600k and a GTX 970 on highest settings - and most of the mechanics and game-play aspects are good, no complaints.I love how you can run (sprint) infinitely and the gun mods and upgrades are all great tooAfter a rocky start, I would give the game 8/10			"

												NOTE: I am a singleplayer gamer, so I'll only be reviewing the singleplayer portion(s) of this game.TL;DR - Great game, and I do recommend it for others. But since you can't play past the ending, it's not a game I'm going to play more than once. Thanks for the free weekend so that I didn't end up regretting a purchase.Now that that's out of the way...Played through story mode from beginning to end. Story itself had potential to be really great through-and-through, but certain climactic moments were full of cliche and uniformity (especially the end bit). While I was quite disappointed that it didn't follow the original concepts of the original Homefront (esp. because John Milius was a consultant for the original Homefront story) it ended up being capable of standing on its own feet, as it were. I did rather appreciate the constant fear of betrayal, and even being on the receiving end of suspected betrayal, but I didn't like how the KPA took over the US via waging economic war. I much preferred the original story, and this one would have been great as a game of its own, without sharing the spirit of another.With all that said however, it broke my biggest rule in ""open world"" gaming; in Homefront: The Revolution, you can't play past the ending. That, in itself, is normally a dealbreaker for me. There have been a few exceptions to this (especially Fallout: New Vegas since you can just 'fix' that with a mod). But unfortunately, this game is not the exception, but the rule. Sure, it has other ""modes"" you can play in singleplayer, but if I can't get the story out of the way so that I can freely muck about in the worldspace(s) without that main mission marker making me avoid certain areas and/or safehouses, then I simply won't play it again. This is functionally a quasi-clone of the latest Far Cry games, and both FC3 and FC4 let you play past the story. And before anyone suggests it; NO, reloading the checkpoint from before accepting the ""Point of No Return"" mission is NOT acceptable.Now, if they ever release a ""free roam"" DLC where the story bit is removed from the entire worldspace whereby all the yellow and red zones are unlocked, and you can continually do random jobs, I might consider purchasing the Freedom Fighter Bundle when it's on sale again. But until that happens, no sale. By the way, yes, I am indeed suggesting I'd buy it as a DLC.Aside from that... Even though they released the ""performance patch,"" I still got quite a bit of lag playing through the story. My rig only just barely exceeds the recommended requirements, but even still, I don't think they're quite done with their optimisations. Either that, or they may want to up their recommended requirements to match what is actually required to not have the game completely freeze for a few seconds upon entering a new zone.At the end of the day, I do like the game. I just don't like it enough to support devs who make open-world games yet keep the ending closed. So while I greatly appreciate the free weekend that allowed me to make a well-informed purchase decision, I won't be buying it until that huge mistake is corrected.I already know a lot of people don't care about the whole ""open world; closed ending"" thing, and [sarcasm]good for you[/sarcasm] if that's the case.

												Bought this game for around $23 when it was on sale. That's a fair price. I had fun playing this game, but I doubt I would play it again. The atmosphere and graphics were on point. As the game is now, my GTX 770/i5/16gb rig ran it maxed out at ~45-60fps with no noticable performance issues. There were some bugs and glitches in regards to gunplay, and some NPCs would magically disappear, but it was hardly game-breaking, just made me question the normal $40 price point. The voice acting and writing were a bit off, but the storyline was interesting enough for an FPS.This game is a bit repetitive, but the different control point objectives are different and varied enough that at least I felt engaged for every little battle. I tell my friends this is a mashup of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, with some Fallout-level destruction thrown in there. Running around the ""Red Zone"", shooting snipers, then running to a different position while avoiding air ships was fun. And seeing a guard abusing a civilian and slitting that guard's throat was satisfying. All in all, I'd give this game a 7/10 for the $20 sale price. It'd be 6/10 if I paid full price.Tl;dr: Wait for the game to go on sale.			"

												Now having played this game for just over ten hours, here are my thoughts. I have no idea what people are complaining about. I thoroughly enjoy this game. The theme, atmosphere, open-ended playstyle, open-world choice based playstyle, and (in my opinion) very good graphics (footnote: playing in 4k on a 1080) add up to a great game in my opinion. I've read about people having complaints about the story, but I honestly feel like it's just right. Hugely varied characters, mistakes are made, and a slower pace like a drawn out revolution would have.There are a lot of negative reviews for this game, but if you like games like Farcry and Fallout, you'll probably enjoy this a lot. Especially at the sale price it's available for (< $14 at time of review).			"

												Set in an alternate future, where North Korea became the technical powerhouse instead of Japan, North Korea has invaded and taken over the USA. Now many years later, North Korea enforces occupation with the KPA, who police all citizens with an iron fist. You have joined the resistance and fight to give freedom back to the USA and end North Korea's occupation.Story line is really good, with great graphics, but fights are a little repetitious (i.e. hard, given the KPA's superior numbers and guns). Money can be really hard to obtain without searching through every trash pile you come across, so upgrades are far and few between. Very interesting and entertaining, but I'd be willing to wait for it to go on a big sale (""75% off, with all DLC"") before paying full price.			"

This sucks, because what I played was actually quite fun. Being able to customize your weapons on the fly was great, and reminded me a lot of Crysis. However, I can't recommend a game that just doesn't work. Don't buy this game. EVER. You may not get crashes, but it's not worth the risk. If they do another free weekend, then I say try it out. Otherwise, just stay away.			"

This game took a bunch of great things that worked in other games and put them all together and made some thing different and great. It feels like half life at times and then at times its like farcry with just a bit of assassins creed, and yet even with all that it totally feels and is a game not like anything else.

												I bought this game in a sale with very little to no expectations at all. Never played the original and only remember hearing mostly negative comments around release. But I have to say...once you get the graphics dialed in for your machine (this was made in CryEngine, it's not optimized for potatos) it's a lot of fun. Surprisingly so. It is by no means a perfect FPS (some *coughmostcough* of the dialogue is overly cheesy, most of the characters are throwaways, the AI is not the smartest, etc.) but it's still a pretty fun romp thruough ruined Philly shooting up the dirty North Korean invaders.The gun customization mechanic is something that should be stolen by other FPS games imo. For me, finding cover and popping the receiver off of my weapon and attaching another to completely change my playstyle never gets old. This game (like so many others) suffered from being realeased too early, but from what I can tell the patching has done it a world of good. If you can get it cheap in a sale, it's a steal. Just manage your expectations going in and be prepared to fiddle with the graphics settings.			"

												Tragically underrated.While not a ""great"" game by any means, Homefront: The Revolution is a good single-player open-world shooter.  A solid 8/10.Two warnings:1.  The DLC are ok, but non-essential.  The prologue and epilogue campaigns are well-crafted yet relatively linear compared to the main game.  I would have been satified without them.  The other DLC are for the online co-op...2.  The online co-op community is dead.  Which is a shame, because what I played in a private group was a great co-op experience.  As much as I tried, I never found a public game.			"

												Honestly, I have no idea why this game have so much hate. The only issue about this game is that it's optimized poorly. If it ran with the standard 60 FPS, this would've been a cult classic. It has Fallout 4's city density, Far Cry 3's loot system (basic but get's boring) and a generic stealth system. Im assuming the stealth system is so generic because the layout of infiltrating any enemy's bases are extremely simplefied. They should've gotten a different development team for stealth infantry. It's not broken or anything, it's just barely a challenge. Anyway, the controls are solid - just by looking at gameplay, you can tell it plays a lot like Dying Light or Far Cry 3. Set the game to it's hardest difficulty and hide your map - it's a better game that way (although the game is still pretty easy). I would've given this a negative review, but its a rarity for a game to keep my attention when its running below 60 fps. Therefore, this game is decent and i recommend it. Definintely buy it on sale though.So all in all, and again, If you like the gameplay, mechanics and feel of Far Cry 3 and Dying Light, an atmosphere that looks like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series,  the basic stealth from the Metro series, and with enviorments just as active with guards and civilians as Deus Ex in a mild dystopia, that feels like what Fallout 4 would've looked like before things got too bad - then purcahse this game.

												Okay I'm about 7 hours into this game and I can't understand where all the bad reviews come from. Is it a perfect game? No, it's not. But for $11.99 I really can't complain one bit.I'm playing the game on medium difficulty and it can still be very challenging. You must strike and move otherwise you will get shot up very fast.Every once in a while, I try to climb into a hole in the wall or window and the game won’t let me. This usually leads to death or wasting health packs. This is my only complaint. But it doesn't warrant the bad press this game has. Maybe earlier version were less stable? I can't really say, because I bought the game during the winter sale of 2016.Honestly if I bought this game earlier for around $30 I still would probably be happy with it. Go ahead and give it a try, it may surprise you.			"

												So... I know why people were alittle mad about the game as the AIs still were idiotic when in combat, you die way to fast, have a limited amount of weapons plus expansion mods of said weapons. But overall the graphics are awesome, I like shooters and being able to craft so that was a plus, and the storyline was well I havent finished yet but right now its good a little bland and also bull at the part I am on. But otherwise I would recommend this game very open world with different styles also I like the fact that the redzones arent has hard as the yellow zones			"

												Knowing that Homefront The Revolution had loads of development troubles from THQ dying, Crytek refusing to pay their employees (And STILL not doing so at the rate that they're self imploding), going from a basic sequel to the original with its crazy ambition of wanting to be an open world Half Life 2 and the reading the reviews at launch, I went in with the lowest of expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. It isnt a great game by any means but its really undeserving of its ""WORST GAME EVER"" title many people give it, as it has merit and is still better compared to the original game. That said its got some flaws that make it difficult to recommend at its current price tag of $43 CDN, though if you can get it and the DLC included at a heavily discounted bargain bin price tag its certainly worth a look since it feels like a successor to THQ titles in that its flawed yet can be enjoyable, just dont go in expecting much. ProsLooks and runs greatThe stories found through collectable journals are interestingThe world itself is genuinely interesting and has a great atmosphereAt times the game feels like an awesome mix of Crysis and Half Life 2Provides a lot of bang for your buckLoads of weapon customization optionsConsCharacters are fairly bland and forgettableThough the game aimed for an open world Half-Life feel it feels more like a mixture of a modern Ubisoft game (The blander ones) and Crysis in that it can get repetitive very quicklyCan get repetitive very quicklyStory DLC is more enjoyable than the base game which isnt bad but its annoying with their short length + pricetag Music is generally forgettable and bland, would benefit more from a soundtrack used in the DLC which feels appropriate for an action gameThough its focused on guerilla combat you'll either love or hate the fact that you die very easilyAnd the most disappointing of all is that it feels really safe without much new you havent already seen before, or taking some interesting mechanics from things like Metro in terms of a cracking gas mask/ammo as currency. Its pretty vanilla.Though in fairness Dambusters really seem commited to turning this game around, and if they provide the same care they've given this game recently for future projects or sequels I could get a real kick out of it.

												This game wasn't too bad. This is based on my gameplay during the free weekend. Graphics: The graphics wasn't too bad. I didnt recieve any FPS drops like other reviewers and I have a GTX 760. The detail in facial features, wet vs. dry was pretty good. Gameplay: The gameplay wasn't the worse but it did lack storyline other than ""fight the government"". Basically you're the resistance fighting against the government thru most of the game. Each new section or you can call them chapters in the game is pretty much the same. Capture this area for communication or destroy this area to limit government supplies, etc. Bugs: The AI was ocassionally glitchy. I was able to hide in a dumpster while KPA agents were shooting me. The AI that follow you would also block you in a corner and wouldn't move no matter what you do.... unless you reload from last checkpoint was really annoying. Certain areas of the map you could glitch it where you can sometimes get up to the next floor without going around or basically fall thru the map. There was also many times where I get stuck and wouldn't be able to move (like getting stuck between the stairs and a wall) I personally find this as a bug but it may not be but the AI can not really detect you when you're above ground level. Such as chests or radio spots above ground level. Multiplayer: I was only about to get into 1 game. There doesn't seem to be a matchmaking system and if there is, well then people just were joining multiplayer mode. I would rate this game 4/10. It would have to be at least 80% discounted price for me to buy it. After playing a few hours (in which like 15 was afked) I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from buying this game.			"

												I really want to like this game, I really do, but this game is way to flawed to be a good experience. I used to love the first homefront game, the setting was refreshing and though the quality wasn't optimal I really liked it. WIth the same mindset I bought this game for 10 Euros, I mean at that price range what could go wrong be that bad that it's not worth paying 10 euros for?Well, almost everything. With emphasis on almost; because the same atmosphere was, the are graphics top notch, and I experienced little to none technical isseus which was a plague at the launch of the game. Despite me being a graphics-♥♥♥♥♥, I quickly felt dissapointed by the gameplay. That is, by all means, horrible. And this comes from a guy that loves no mans sky (look it up on my profile). The AI is one of the worst I've ever encountered in a fps, enemies just run around, get out of cover when shot upon, already lost me when I got around a corner, and when the enemies lock their guns on me, they barely pose any challenge. Thereby the missions feel repeated, most consisting of get that, go there, kill that, those kind of things. And where the first game shined in it's story, this game feels like it doesn't even got a story at all.I feel stupid that beside the negative reviews Homerfront the Revolution got, I still bought this game. Note that I haven't played the multiplayer yet, that isn't my cup of tea, but maby you could enjoy it.			"

												Overall the game was decent, the gameplay felt good, I had no game breaking bugs, and the few bugs that're there make for some funny scenarios. I had none of the game breaking bugs or lag issues that other people had, and I'm not exactly running the game on a high end rig.My only issue with the game was it felt quite repetitive and forced in the story, and the story itself felt quite difficult to attach yourself to and immerse in the game, and the characters I found annoying and destroyed the enjoyability of the story later on in the game.The online however can be great fun if you and a few friends want to hop on a coop game, although it can be quite difficult without a lot of experience. The unlock and buying system used for online is tedious, and takes a long while and many of the same, few missions to unlock, the lack of variety in the online missions kills it pretty quickly because it just gets repetitive and boring after a while.All in all, the game is decent, the gameplay feels fluid and reactive, the parkour around the map can be frustrating at times, but feels rewarding at fun most of the time. It's main downfalls is a lack of replayability, and being really repetitive, coupled with a very draw out, forced story.			"

												If the darn thing could stop CRASHING long enough for me to play it, I might be inclined to rate it more positively, but this baby is crashtastic and I have no patience for games that love to crash out while doing the most innocuous things in-game. (Like for example that time, when I just started the game and even before it presented its first screen, it bombed out. This thing is seriously f--ked-up.)All of which is fairly disappointing because although it was never about to win GOTY accolades, it SEEMED like a decent game and one I could, like FC3 and Splinter Cell Conviction before it, see myself sinking innumerable hours just running around mindlessly blowing things up or sabotaging or reducing the local platoon count. It seemed fun.UPDATE: After 14 hours with the game, I FIIIIIIIIIIIIINALLY got to do a clean shutdown of the game. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: the exit menu. Of course, this was after about five more crashes that day, but still... y'know, small steps...			"

												This game has potential but its a shame that it's been ruined by poor A.I. Seriously, this game has some of the worst A.I. design I've ever seen in a game, and it is the SOLE REASON that I go from rating this game a 7.9 out of 10, to a 2 out of 10. The first 2-3 hours of the game start off pretty strong, and then the game throws the stupid A.I. at you.  Basically, it gets to the point where the A.I. starts to hunt you down after the alarm has been sounded, and they are supposed to ease up pursuit when you leave their line of sight.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!!!  They hunt you down like you have a gps chip on your back and they have the receiver.  I'm not kidding, you can run miles and miles from your original location and not be spotted by anybody, but they automatically know where you are. Not only that, but if you choose to shoot it out like I did, you'll quickly realize that there are INFINITE ENEMIES.  Yep, somehow, this enemy force has UNLIMITED troops at their disposal.  This is just awful, poor gameplay design.  The player is FORCED to play stealthy instead of giving the player the option to decide.  THIS IS NOT A STEALTH GAME so why force stealth on the player?  Don't get me wrong, stealth games are some of my favorite all time games, but I'm not playing homefront for stealth.  It's a first person shooter, let me shoot. "

												It's a decent game, couldn't even say it was advertised unfairly. It just doesn't add up to what you would hope in anyway. Mechanics are all pretty good, customization all pretty good, story, the same. It's all professional, but it lacks. Especially bummed about the multiplayer. It's fun, but repetitive. Randoms always just rush the mission, and the missions feel like they are meant to be so that's ok, but they are too short and are really just run and shoot. There's some bugs with the guns too that I am sure will be patched but it's just another thing. The mechanics are good tho, it's like far cry and l4d and cod and crysis and idk... cover system is cool, melee os cool, guns are cool... but just in general, it's not deep enough when it comes to level design. Again, story seems well done, but I just don't care about it. I really wanted a good shooter with stealth mechanics that had a great coop mode. I don't feel I got that. Also, to update this a bit... the community is totally dead. I haven't been able to get into a coop match since the first two weeks of release.			"

												Homefront®: The Revolution was using Denuvo, but now it no longer uses it after the publishers removed it from the game.it was a terrible game before with Denuvo but and but now it's great! it has bugs but it's still great and I recommend buying the game if you like FPS with shining taste on CryEngine.Pros:Easy to get used to the game mechanics.The graphics are like on planet mars.weapon customizations have a unique structure.The ability to sleep and refill ammunition is widely accessable and the world map size is satisfying.Hiring a soldier for shootouts.cons:Instant warp during map loads.A.I. teleports sometimes.Animation becomes unfixed when running around quickly.Objectives seem to be obviously generated.Few anti-aliasing options.Amount of drivable vehicles is one.Note: this review is meant for giving opinions about the game and is not for abusing.

												Taking advantage of the free weekend to try it out. I'm really surprised at the negative reviews. The major issue I see is that the AI is bad and the game is too easy so far on the normal setting. I am a huge fan of the Far Cry series and any game that copies that formula is a lot of fun for me. I would say that if you enjoyed Far Cry 3-4, Crysis 3, the Metro series, and Dying Light, I have trouble believing you wouldn't like this. This coming from a guy who thought that the some of the recent big hit titles were pretty dull (e.g., MGSV and Fallout 4). I have a GTX 970 with an i5, when I got out into the open world the FPS dropped down below 60. Wasn't actually clocking the FPS, but guessing it was 40-47ish, so I dropped down from the Very High preset to High, and it seems to be very stable and close to 60. I even have TAA on. Plenty of room to tweak if I had FPS issues. I haven't played much so far, but I may buy it while it is on sale. If not, I will certainly buy it when it drops down to $15.			"

												I played the campaign during the free weekend and I gotta say, I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this. I had to reload about 4 times because the AI would bug out and keep me from progressing. The NPC AI would also bug out by repeatedly running in place, into walls, vehicles, whatever. Just all-around a buggy game for something that released a few months ago. This should have been fixed by now.Story and characters were laughable and forgettable. The open-world aspect is similar to Ubisoft games so I guess if you like doing menial tasks to 'complete' sections of the map, then you might like the campaign based solely on that.Didn't bother touching MP. Plenty of other great FPS out there for that.Graphics were decent. Performance was ok on my 980ti, 4770k rig. 60 fps avg @ max settings @ 1440p. I give it a 4/10. Play the campaign during a free weekend or wait until it's $5.			"

												[Played during free weekend, I didn't really receive the product itself so I left the box unchecked]Homefront: The Revolution is like, an urban Far Cry, but with North Korea having taken over the world so you've kinda got some themes from Wolfenstein: The New Order in there with the bad guys having taken over the world and all.However, the gameplay is nothing like Wolfenstein: TNO and it doesn't have the animal hunting seen in Far Cry 3. That doesn't mean it's not fun, it's actually great to play and who doesn't love shooting up North Korea for good ol' America? As for the graphics, I find them pretty nice and the faces also are visually appealing as well although I do hate it when designers give facial piercings to a character (as I hate facial piercings).Pros:-Great gunplay-Fun weapon modding system-It's like an urban Far Cry 3-Runs great on my PC (thanks, performance patch)-Interesting concept-Neat soundtrackCons:-Multiplayer resources should've been spent on the game itself, as no one would play Homefront for the multiplayer (and no one plays FPS multiplayer if it isn't CS:GO or CoD). While the multiplayer is fun (I only played solo as I couldn't find any lobby), I'd have avoided creating it altogether as people only play CS:GO or Call of Duty or hell, why not make the multiplayer a standalone experience instead?-Some collision with some meshes like tarps are stupid and immersion-breaking, I should be able to go over those IRL.-Has Denuvo. It's a pos software that not only ruins modding but it also locks people out for overclocking their CPU, and even is known to lock out legitimate buyers, too.Score: 8.5/10			"

												Homefront: The Revolution was one of the games that I was looking forward to playing this year being a fan of the Far Cry series, however, when it launched with so many performance issues and bugs I didn't bother to buy it. Now they have since optimised the performance and fixed a large number of bugs, I decided to give it a try the weekend where it was available for free. I have to say that in its current form I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world games and particularly if you like the Far Cry mechanics. Although it is still not perfect, and certainly could have taken its potential further but it is still a great game in its own right.This is the first review I've ever written on Steam, and I felt like after such a poor reception the game first received it was only fair to give a positive account of my experience given the effort the devs have clearly gone to to put the game right.Pros:Beautiful graphicsVaried game styles (Yellow zone stealth, Red zone aggressive)Tried and tested Far Cry formulaWeapon customisationRC Car bombs!Cons:Unlikeable alliesNo reason for your character to be a muteRidiculously fast respawns for the yellow zone Hearts and Minds activitiesLoot system could be more varied (e.g weapon mods, more craftable items)I'd give this a solid 75% in its curent state and would highly recommend it if you can pick it up on sale. I purchased it, after trying it for free, at 40% off so it was £17.99. At that price it's well worth it			"

												I dont know why people dislike this game so much.I wanted to buy it when it came out, and didnt because of the reviews.Now, with the free weekend...I realize I should have listened to my gut and bought it.It has great graphics and atmosphere. It doesnt resonate as a rugged shooter feeling you get with other blockbusters.Much more of a Clean and Steady Axis. I like Feeling Clean.Anger doesnt lead me and rage is detrumental to gameplay.Thats something the blockbusters might learn from Homefront.Players look for esteem and accomplishment when they play games...I dare to presume that the negativity is simply because the gamers arent clean within themselves, their own spirit and identity...and more of any, lack a sense of patriotism, drive and deliverance.Ive played only 2 hours and my opinion might change , but homefront is an enjoyable and challenging game. One where the gamer decides if he wants to banter, destroy and pummel...or rather cultivate and build.Its a well made game...and im pretty sure I will purchase it when I can.If I dont finish it this weekend when its Free ;)GG			"

I mean sure there are other games with better optimiztion and better this and that, but the thing is there's always going to be games that are better at a certain thing than the game you're playing. This game is fun and unlike any game I've played. They borrowed certain aspects of other games but blended them nicely with a pretty good story and overall fun gameplay. If you're into fps and like completing side missions and clearing zones, I strongly recommend this game! Performance is good for me (i7 4790k & evga 1080 ftw), but maybe hardware depent? Only complaint is lack of DSR support.			"

												Overall the game was decent, the gameplay felt good, I had no game breaking bugs, and the few bugs that're there make for some funny scenarios. I had none of the game breaking bugs or lag issues that other people had, and I'm not exactly running the game on a high end rig.My only issue with the game was it felt quite repetitive and forced in the story, and the story itself felt quite difficult to attach yourself to and immerse in the game, and the characters I found annoying and destroyed the enjoyability of the story later on in the game.The online however can be great fun if you and a few friends want to hop on a coop game, although it can be quite difficult without a lot of experience. The unlock and buying system used for online is tedious, and takes a long while and many of the same, few missions to unlock, the lack of variety in the online missions kills it pretty quickly because it just gets repetitive and boring after a while.All in all, the game is decent, the gameplay feels fluid and reactive, the parkour around the map can be frustrating at times, but feels rewarding at fun most of the time. It's main downfalls is a lack of replayability, and being really repetitive, coupled with a very draw out, forced story.			"

												Homefront®: The Revolution was using Denuvo, but now it no longer uses it after the publishers removed it from the game.it was a terrible game before with Denuvo but and but now it's great! it has bugs but it's still great and I recommend buying the game if you like FPS with shining taste on CryEngine.Pros:Easy to get used to the game mechanics.The graphics are like on planet mars.weapon customizations have a unique structure.The ability to sleep and refill ammunition is widely accessable and the world map size is satisfying.Hiring a soldier for shootouts.cons:Instant warp during map loads.A.I. teleports sometimes.Animation becomes unfixed when running around quickly.Objectives seem to be obviously generated.Few anti-aliasing options.Amount of drivable vehicles is one.Note: this review is meant for giving opinions about the game and is not for abusing.

												It's a decent game, couldn't even say it was advertised unfairly. It just doesn't add up to what you would hope in anyway. Mechanics are all pretty good, customization all pretty good, story, the same. It's all professional, but it lacks. Especially bummed about the multiplayer. It's fun, but repetitive. Randoms always just rush the mission, and the missions feel like they are meant to be so that's ok, but they are too short and are really just run and shoot. There's some bugs with the guns too that I am sure will be patched but it's just another thing. The mechanics are good tho, it's like far cry and l4d and cod and crysis and idk... cover system is cool, melee os cool, guns are cool... but just in general, it's not deep enough when it comes to level design. Again, story seems well done, but I just don't care about it. I really wanted a good shooter with stealth mechanics that had a great coop mode. I don't feel I got that. Also, to update this a bit... the community is totally dead. I haven't been able to get into a coop match since the first two weeks of release.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is an excellent game. While it brings virtually nothing new to the table, it combines various elements of game series known and loved by many, including similar social stealth elements reminiscent of Assassin's Creed, and the enjoyable gunplay and customization of Crysis. It also bears tribute to Far Cry in the capturing of various outposts and 'towers'. What really makes this game shine, however, are the stunning visuals, which really bring the battered city of Philedelphia to life. The game especially shines at nightime, and if it's raining. There are some bugs, mostly related to AI Pathfinding and some animation errors (Characters getting stuck in T-poses) but overall, it's a fairly polished game with acceptable optimization. Creds to the developers, as this game was in development hell for a long time. A solid 7/10.			"

Distraction grenades can be thrown while en enemy is shooting at you, and they will look at the grenade that they saw you throw. Horrible. Movement feels clunky and awkward. Weapon customization is not what it seems. A M4 can be turned into a grenade launcher and a m249. You can change the sight, foregrip and muzzle on the guns. Very small changes that don't affect I couldn't finish the story. I gave up on this game. Everything about this game is half done and mediocre at best. It's worth maybe $20.

												I played this during the free weekend and I have to say that it's impressed me enough for me to spend money on actually buying it. Yes, it has problems, but there is a good game underneath the glitches and slightly sloppy mechanics. It feels like a weird crossbreed between Dying Light, Far Cry and Half Life 2...that's a compliment by the way. There is the open world of the first two games mentioned, with elements such as base liberation and use of improvised equipment such as RC car explosives, which can be fun. Then there is the world itself, which reminds me quite a bit of City 17 from Half Life 2, with weird futuristic combine like structures side by side with dilapidated tenements. Despite my annoyances, there is a lot of ambition on display here and I would very much like to see Dambusters have another crack at an open world shooter with a slightly more coherent, focused vision.All in all...well worth a play!

												I'm not really sure what to think at the moment, I am kinda shocked to be honest. I expected more out of this game, it can't even compare to the first one. Sure it had its moments however over all it felt kinda dull to be honest, the atmosphere felt kinda nice and the graphics wasn't that bad however the story line was weak and it didn't really capture you the player EVER.To me a great game needs to capture the player like it does in The Last of Us or other games where you just wanna keep playing and playing and playing and wish it never ends. This game never does that and you play on wishing it would end faster yet the developers keep draging out a thin story as long as it goes without making it better or more exciting.This is an open world game in the style of Far Cry 3, 4 and Primal, you get different ""bases"" to take over throughout the game and it just goes on and on and on without any major changes.You could bascially say this is a remake of a Far Cry game or any other open world capture points game, without the fun and exciting story and instead a pretty dull and weak story and a fairly predictable one too. And not to forget MUCH WORSE, if you're thinking of buying this game then buy Far Cry 4 instead!Oh and not to forget, the AI in the game is just crap to be honest. They get stuck everywhere and act all weird etc.I feel like I've wasted my money, money that I could have used to buy some ice cream or some cola, that would have brought me more joy than this game and at least I wouldn't feel like I've wasted my money on something completely useless.I really liked the first Homefront, you got captured in the story and it was really likeable as a game.This game gets2/10I would not recommend other players to buy it at the moment because like I've said it's like a Far Cry game without the fun or exciting parts.

												Even for such a low price it's still a very horrible game with maddening dialogues and lots of bugs and boredom.Co-op is quite decent on the contrary but only if you find players to play with and wait until you manage to unlock weapons attachements, skills and gear that really takes a while.It could've been a lot better, but it never will be.

The first Homefront was by no means a great game but I still enjoyed it, so I figured I'd get the same kind of enjoyment from this game............but nope, not even that!Not only is the game not fun, but it's also unoptimized. It's hard to get any kind of enjoyment out of it when the game constantly stutters! This game isn't even worth $30. Hell, it ain't even worth $10. DO NOT BUY and avoid like the plague.This game is worse than Ann Coulter. Yes, it's that bad.			"

												fine, but not living up to potential. The review is ONLY regarding the story-mode, seeing that i only played this mode so far.I feel somewhat constricted in my opportunities to revolt against the ""KPA"", so far its the same everywhere i've gone. Take over one part of the city at a time by doing the exact same thing i just did in the previous part of the city.Setting up ambushes and fighting a superior force occupying your territory seemed alot more interesting in the trailers and it gave the impression of a vast array of opportunity to fight back.The very structured progression is also a contributor to the constricted feel, because there is no real open-world. It's is for all intents and purposes a level based story-mode. one level being one part of town, and the next being a different part of town.The controls of the game also feel off. Coming from Dying light that i just finished, the controls of Homefront are severly awkward. Wonky at best. And there is a lack of details that would have given the game a little more ""umphf"". Like looting is just a loadbar, no hands fiddleling, no hands reached for the drawer. The drawer just magically opens when you click, and you dont pick anything up. You just get a text on your screen telling you what you picked up.On the plus side though, the story and game idea has massive potential.And the combat is really nice, im not sure how they made the controls so wonky but still managed to make the combat feel solid. in conclusion its a decent game, but i feel pretty riped off price wise. I would have much rather waited 4-6 months and bought it on sale for 20-25 euro's.			"

												I've only put 4 hours in so far, but it's enough to answer a few questions for a potential buyer.First, my system specs.Dell Inspiron 7000 laptop. I7, 960m, SSD, 16gb ram. Nothing hardcore.I run the game on medium settings at 1080p and average a solid 30 fps. The game still looks good on medium and 30 fps is just fine with me.There are  some glitches with the AI on occasion, but for the most part they act like any other games AI.The story line is enough to justify the game. I'm a big fan of Farcry, I get most of my enjoyment out of taking the the enemy strongholds and I get plenty of that here. So far the red zone was exactly what I enjoy, we'll see what  the other two zones have to offer. "

Homefront®: The RevolutionGreat open world FPS , i like the tense atmosphere - the ideea of starting a riot-revolution ( the best point of the game which really makes all your actions worth is to witness the gradual change in city life as you sabotage KPA facilities / rescue citizens etc etc ) - the different zones have a distinct feeling ( Holloway Red Zone has a very strong Terminator vibe ) - if you liked Mad Max gameplay style / open world you will like this game also ( i'll admit the AI has some minor bugs and respawn issues and the optimisation is pretty bad - but they are working on a new patch ) - fans of the first HF will recognise some similar gameplay mechanics ( mele-knife is stil overpowered ;-D ) - big + you can see your legs and you cast a shadow + there is a FOV slider + great soundtrack - highly recommended and superior SP experience - tho it wasnt that hard to surpass the first title - great job Dambuster - 8/10 !

Gun modding system acted like the system Crysis 3.ConsThe game crashed 2 times during my play time. A few glitches that caused me to die like falling through the ground, getting stuck on a orange cone and falling to my death over maybe 1 foot fall. I had the game breaking bug in Hearts and Minds quest in Ashgate that would not let me continue without starting a new game.

												Game is obviously lacking many many good features a AAA game like any other on it's category should have, it runs poorly and not even with a high end pc can achieve a decent amount of fps, framedrops everywhere...even more when restocking ammo and quicksaving were the game will freeze for even 5 seconds killing immersion on a very savage way. Story is decent, but seems rushed, cliché, and has a very forced air into it. Game mechanics aren't bad, I like that you have to make a district react and rise(that's a revolution after all) but how you achieve it is so repetitive that it can be obnoxious, tiring and for some people, not worth the try due to the horrible optimisation problems we've already talked about. Weapon system is by far a thing I would be praising about this game since it was done very well, the conversion of a marksman rifle to a ""freedom launcher"" would make me giggle and murder incontable enemies with explosions and joy and the rain effects were in my opinion..sublime due to the fact that things such as the ground, clothes and everything else gets wet in real time, drop by drop. It's truly a shame that this was opaqued by the poor way the game would run. Would I recommend thia game?  only as an experiment and a reminder that the all glorious PC Master Race has it's own derps(even though I was told console versions was even worse) but absolutely never by full price. It's only worth if you feel like reviewing it, having the experience by yourself and finally because of the trading cards, an overall game that had so much potential and all the terrain it had left behind because of mistakes that for some looked like little and finally made the game pretty much unplayable for almost everyone.

												First off runs like crap even after the ""Fixes"" someone said it pretty good that it does not matter how pretty your game looks if it does not run well at all.Was quite boring. You will die a lot from stupid stuff and movement that seems so stiff it is hard to control. Bad story not as bad as the 1st game's story but just as dumb. Then there is the resistance.... Instead of getting things like camo body armor and anything that would be useful in an insurgency all of the resistance fighters went to Hot Topic instead.The game is so predictable you can see every twist and turn. I honestly can't imagine what the season pass is going to do or come out with. MP is totally worthless as there seems to be no public matches unless you create one yourself and it is basically just the single player game but your not nearly as effective.I wouldn't bother with this one.

WAIT FOR A $9 sale and patchesNeg•	Had potential, but it’s not worth the full price•	Massive bugs, some funny some game breaking•	Dated appearance•	Deplorable performance even with my TitanxPos•	Insurgent hit and run gameplay is fun at first•	Weapon crafting feels nice, despite very few weapons•	Game embraces the cheesy WOLVERINE style campaign, lots of MURICA•	A good ideaHad potential but obviously the development woes hit it hard.  What you get is a great concept with copy paste quests, lack of overall weapons, boring gunplay, and a campaign that feels like a chore to finish.  I actually went through the entire campaign and I feel bad because you know the devs could have done better with more time, money, better management, etc..  These guys were unlucky b/c the insurgent hit and run idea could have been amazing and I truly hope some of these guys get a proper chance in the future and their game isn't hindered by corporate restructures.

												I have to admit the game started out rough on launch, but the game is a decent open world first person game in the same vein as Far Cry and Crysis. You have to temporarily suspend your disbelieve of the story. It would have been far more plausible if it were russians, chinese or even the british. But the north koreans seem abit far fetched to be honest. THe gameplay on the other hand took inspiration from Far Cry and made the theme work. Driving the motorcycle and rc car bombs is incredibly over sensitive, which makes maneuvering them a chore, and the gun play seems average at best. Stealth works fine and the world do make the game interesting. The game do occasionally have it's bugs but none of them I have encountered through my playthrough I would say, game breaking. In it's current state I would say the game is far from perfect, but neither is it a turd. It's an average game with alot of decent mechanics. I would say, give the game a chance if you like open world in the same vein as far cry.			"

												OK, I recomend this game - with reservations. Only giving thumbs up for balance. I loved old Far Cry games. 4 wore on me. I liked primal but despite the change up it still was jungle far cry. This despite not being ""far cry"" is far cry in a city and I am actually enjoying it a lot. Heres the reservations after only a couple hours in, and I will update. Runs 60 fps for me on gtx 760 but have to turn a few things down. Still amazing atmosphere. I have had a random black screen freeze up and crash to desk top so it needs work on the optimization side. So, yeah seems rushed tbh.Yet, if you liked Far Cry 3 but might enjoy it in a burned out city this may be for you. I suggest finding on sale. It does mix things up a bit and far cry in a city is almost falloutesque at times. Definitely reminds me of Dying LIght without the zombies.I DGAF about the short freezing when it auto-saves. All in all the game seems rushed but it's OK. I think the critics were a bit harsh though. 7/10 (so far)			"

												Ok so let's talk about this game, this won't take long. I was a big fan of the first Homefront even if it was a little generic. When this game was first announced I thought it had promise but as things progressed I started to get worried. In any case I picked it up and have played a few hours and I just can't play anymore...why? Is it bad, is it glitchy? Well no to the first question and maybe a little to the second question.The big issue is that it's just soooooo generic and repetitive. The graphics are ok and I need to give the rain kudos for being some of the best rain in gaming, honestly the rain actually makes individual drops on the ground and things get wet in real time, it looks amazing! However when the best thing you can say about the game is the rain effects then you know it has problems.The story makes little sense and gives you no reason to care about anything or anyone, the level designs are hollow boring sandboxes and the shooting is intially weak and wimpy. Things get better as you upgrade weapons but the problem is other than some strong enemies the gameplay never varies. It is like a standard sandbox game where you go to ""X"" and press ""Y"" to capture an area. Rinse and repeat over and over. There is some mindless catharsis in this but after a couple of hours it gets boring. Part of me wants to keep playing because there is a little fun to sniping enemy patrols but when you go from one generic city block to the next that fun quickly evaporates after 20 mins or so.I didn't get any major bugs while playing but there were a lot of clipping errors during cutscenes and generally rough edges.All in all it's an average shooter with bland level design and a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor story that makes it difficult to play for longer than 15-20 mins at a time.5/10			"

												Totally unrealistic.First lets start off with the fact that everybody in the world loves North Korea. So, if we liberated the Americans from their capitalist opressors they would be jublient about the fact that they now live under me, Kim Jong Un. Second, because most Americans live in tents, eat birds and snow, and buy guns to kill each other, they would have no effecive logistical means to supply a effective resistance. Third, its a well known fact that everyone who lives in North Korea is very happy all the time. Those who are not happy are sent to ""Happiness Camps"" where they re-learn how glorious the DPRK is compared to the rest of the world. In fact they love me so much in North Kore I always get 100% of the vote  because they all love me so much. Anyway, this propaganda piece is nothing more then just lies being pushed by Obama, George W bush, the South Korean government, the Japanese government, and the American CIA.			"

												The game just feels un-finished. If you can get it for $5 or below it is worth it, but at its current price it is a rip off.  So many glitches and in game freezes along with AI that is broken instead of smart. (The AI will zip off backward at 90MPH to dodge your bullets... The AI can dodge bullets.)			"

												Just finished it, overall I enjoyed it, took me two days to finish it.Played it on medium on a gtx 970 with 60 fps, still looked nice enough for me.Everybody keeps complaining about bugs, I got 3 crashes and everytime the game crashed the keyboard settings were mixed up. Still, that's not so many bugs. Oh and once a civilian NPC made me stuck in a corridor, so I ended up killing him. I wanted to play this game like an infiltration game, but the stealth part is a bit wooky-dooky if you know what I mean. Headshots don't one shot enemies with the silenced pistol so that makes it even harder.I bought it for 23 euros and I don't feel like I wasted my money, 20 hours to finish an FPS is kind of unusual nowadays.I haven't tried the coop part, I'll update my review once I have !

												before i bought this game i read alot of negative reviews and could not believe the game could be so bad ,to be honest i can not even come up anything positive to say. it is not one particular thing for me it is just everything, walking ,running ,riding ,shooting ,noises and gunshots when there was nothing going on , no noise in the heat of battle and i could keep going on and on. it is not fun to play. it is not that the game is so bad there are a lot of bad games out there ,it is the fact that the people that made this piece of crap are ok with charging me 60 dollars ,i have been playing computer games for a long time and have paid 60 dollars recently for some unbelievable games and i am ok with that. but i am not ok with this. then i started reading some of the positive reviews to find out what could be positive about this game and came to the conclusion that there must be two different games out there, i must have gotten one of the bad copies  ,just my luck, can anybody tell me how to get one of the good copies.

												My little piece of review for this waste of money... The single player part of it is OK, i didn't experience any bugs that the other reviews speak of, the gun customization part was pretty fun, all you need is basically the Assult Rifle which you can spend ingame cash to upgrade to do more damage, reload faster, and more range, the AR can be customized by pressing X and can transfrom into 2 other forms, a LMG which is much more accurate at fireing full auto then the AR, and a Gernade Launcher which locks onto vehicles (range is pretty limited, but the maps aren't big enough that you need to pack a RPG around). The Snipers actually fight from range, thus you have a 2nd weapon slot, which i've equiped a Battle Rifle [Sniper rifle and a weaker gernade launcher], depending on the range of the enemy, you can swap out different scopes at ease. Flashpoint missions are repetitive, and occures way too often, there also isn't a better reward nor punishment for doing/not doing Flashpoint missions,now enough about the single player portion, now the Multiplayer Part.................. i can't think of what to write here, because my experience of the multiplayer portion consists of only doing 1 thing.... WAITINGi've waited close to 30mins in a lobby waiting just for 1 person to join so that i can experience the multiplayer, but my paitence ran thin at 30 mins, and i can't start the lobby with myself as the game prevents me from doing so.  having finished the singleplayer, i felt there was nothing more to do so i quit the game.Will try the multiplayer part again soon, hope either more people start playing multiplayer or for the Dev to fix the lobby queing process			"

												After try this game for a while, it is time I will write a review as usual. This game isn't that great, but it doesn't mean it is so bad. I would go for this game is playable. How I can say it is payable although the score from all review is 50% - 56% from game website. First of all, this game is like Far Cry, you have to release prison, base, propaganda, and collecting radio stuff. These things make this game as playable. I like to explore the game and collecting items in the game as long as I'm between main mission and side mission. What makes me feel it is not a great game - first weapons are too limited. As developer announced at first time that in this game you can craft thing and make molotov or pipebomb by looting stuff from enemy and appliance, but it doesn't make videogame variety. This game doesn't worth 59.99 dollars, but it is worth with 39.99 dollars or thiscount if you can get it lower. You still can see many bugs in this game, and sometimes you need to start mission over again, but one thing I'm sure when you're familiar with key and gamesystem. You will enjoy this game as like as a videogame from Deep Silver studio.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game years before it was released and sadly as the game was plagued with bugs and performance issues at launch to the point of being unplayable I decided to wait. The thing is, now after months of its initial release date there are quite a few reviews saying that the game is patched now and runs very smoothly. To my dismay I bought the game believing what I read. While I know that my R9 graphics card is not the sharpest tool in the box it still runs most recent AAA games with 60FPS at the highest setting with few tweaks here and there. This game, however, even though they patched it, It is still unplayable( for me at least). The game would run smoothly at 60 FPS or even higher and then without any apparent reason the frame rate would drop to half that number and in some cases the game just freezes. This happened to me very frequently to the point of making this piece of crap unplayable. I changed the setting but the same issues surfaced again and again... I ♥♥♥♥ing give up.			"

												Sweet lord this game has issues.  As with many others, I wanted nothing more than this game to be a success, but the first 30 minutes of gameplay have left me feeling cheated almost.  The original Homefront had issues, but it was enjoyable to play regardless.  If the combat was tight and on point like other games using the same engine then many issues could be looked past, but when the basics of movement, gun control and shooting feedback are lacking it is hard to physically continue playing without causing damage to ones keyboard, mouse or soul.  It seems a higher priority was placed on quantity rather than quality... delaying this for another year would have been a better idea than releasing as isI feel sorry for the developers and presenters of this as they must have been going through shock treatment to big up this one in front of the public.  I will return to this one once a few patches come through, but i find it hard to believe it will rectify what feels like a unfinished game			"

												I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, but I'm really enjoying this game. The gameplay is a mashup of Call of Duty type combat mixed with the open-world territory capture of games like Far Cry. You have to capture points on a map until you control an entire area, and you choose whether to play stealth infiltration or go in guns blazing. If you can find this game on sale, it's a no-brainer to pick it up.			"

If you already have it, I suggest seeking a refund: because even if you can run this game well on your PC the single player campaign with its borderline braindead AI and pathfinding in its current state is simply not worth the full price.

 At a glance 72/100   Should I buy this? Well if you’re thinking is it worth putting time into this game or not, I’d say it is. It’s not hard to 100% this game I’d say you’ll see lots of 100% in the 30-40hr range. Is it worth the Price? If you only care about the story, I’d say no. But if you’re looking at 100% and like a Far Cry style game with  some  Multiplayer then I’d say Yes. If you want a Multiplayer game Then move along, nothing to see here.It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the Homefront was inspired by the movie Red Dawn(1984) While its story length was around the same as your average Call of Duty game (~6hours) it left the groundwork in place for a fantastic series, sadly Homefront: The Revolution abandons that and starts anew in an alternate timeline. Homefront:TR plays more like a Far Cry game then Call of Duty or Battlefield but its limited side jobs (20 of them) and lack of zone replay after you clear an area make me look at a zone and wonder what the most efficient way to clear it is, instead of wanting to get lost exploring. The story feels mediocre at best due to the nature of the game, story missions generally send you to the next zone after 2 or so it’s hard to really connect with any of the characters. You’ll spend your time in a zone winning the ‘Hearts & Minds’ of the people, collecting radios, responding to emergency calls for help called ‘Flashpoints’ along with your main goal of attacking enemy strongholds and pushing the KPA out of that district.  Deathwish Unlike other shooters the hard difficulty called ‘Deathwish’ doesn’t feel like it punishes you for going on the offensive, Run & Gun is an option and you’re not forced into walking everywhere aiming down your sights.  Instead ‘Deathwish’ chooses to punish you for poor positioning during a fight, such as getting flanked or not paying attention to where you start a fight ie in the range of other patrols/turrets/overwatch. Even the Snipers don’t 1 shot you on ‘Deathwish’ which is always a plus in my book for this type of play. AI The AI can have moments of  Genius   Proper coding  Luck. Getting flanked on each side by a Heavy while having a patrol moving into an adjacent building to get the high ground all while 2 APCs pin me down. This might be tricky if the game didn’t Hack tools (A craftable & buyable gadget that takes control of KPA drones and turns them against the KPA  soldiers  Peacekeepers) But for the most part the AI is easily fooled and can be a joke once you get the hang of the way the react. But then again welcome to the AI of 95% of FPSs on the market. Multiplayer This game does not have Player vs. Player, it’s unknown if they will ever add PvP but they do give you a 4 player Co-Op mode separate from the main story called ‘Resistance’. In ‘Resistance’ you create a character (from a group of presets) and select their background prior to the KPA  Invasion  peacekeeping efforts. the characters gain skill points that can be spent Borderlands style into abilities and perks. Gearing up you character requires you  to sacrifice small kittens  buy loot crates with in game currency that is acquired by completing missions. A smart move not putting gear behind micro transactions as that may have killed this game for many gamers. The missions themselves are fairly open with multiple ways to get to your objective but once you arrive it plays out the same each time, an exception to this I’ve seen would be one of the early missions has you attack a convoy. The 3 times I’ve played it the convoy has taken a different route each time. I can’t see myself grinding money in Multiplayer however having people that know how to have fun makes it enjoyable.  Performance Bla Bla Bla I have 9-way SLI Fury Zs and It dips to 23 fps. Honestly I don’t know how so many people are having trouble with the game but lots of people claim to be having it.Here is my advice don’t listen to either side on Performance, good or bad. Decide if you want the game and are going to buy it or not, ignoring what fps you’ll have with your system specs. Then match your specs with that of the System Requirements if you can run the game based on those alone then buy it and if you don’t like the way it preforms on   YOUR   system. Then use the steam refund feature if you’re not happy with the graphics or fps.  Season Pass You $5 off for buying the game with the season pass. This is a gamble you  could  save 5 dollars on expansions you love or you  could  waste $20 on expansions you hate. Then there is option #3: Wait. I don’t think season passes are worth it, 1 bad dlc that you wouldn’t buy standalone can usually offset the cost of the discount. In the end, it’s your money.I was not paid to write this, nor did I receive the game for free. I felt the need to write this because I feel that a lot of game review sites  like IGN  aren’t giving it a fair shot and criticized elements that they praised in other games  just because they didn’t get paid off I also don’t like the amount of steam users that downvote this game and have less than 2 hours in it.Good Luck & Have Fun "

												So here is a game that has been battered by negative reviews, and on release I'm sure it deserved it - but what I can tell you now is that it deserves positive reviews. The game is in a good place if you can have an open mind.Performance, I get about 100FPS constant on the highest game settings - my rig is on my profile if you want an idea of my hardware.Bugs, this game has a few the odd flickering light, cursor on the screen (which I'm ashamed to admit but I thought was a navigation marker for 10 minutes :D), some NPC's look like they're holding a gun, but they're not. Audio and animations included lol. Graphics, well the graphics impressed me I liked them they're crisp, colourful and pleasant to look at.The game was easy to get into and progress in, one thing I didn't like was the stealth option is almost nonexistant, you try to stealth takedown an enemy - all enemies in the local area know where you are and as I type this ""Stealth is going to be our best approach on this one"" was just said by a character lol.I haven't tried online yet, but a couple of my friends own this so I will update when I have tried.But seriously for the price I paid for this (£7) this is a good game and a gem in my library. Very Happy with it.			"

												I have heard a lot of negative aspects about this game. And after trying it during the F2P weekend, I don't really understand why it got so much hate (yeah, it might not be worth 60€ or 40€ but for sub-25€ it's decent). I didn't experience any technical issue (aka crash to desktop, low FPS etc.), graphics are really nice and I really enjoy the whole gameplay aspect.NB! I had Low FPS due to budget GPU (GTX 650 w/ 1GB), was like 20-50FPS(aver. 30-ish) with low settings on 768p. (Lol, I know but wanted to try out that game and I love these kind games nevertheless the ""repeativity"")If you love Far Cry(3) like games, you'll like Homefront: The Revolution.			"

												This is a very odd title. Imagine Crysis got a actually good sequel, before it escalated waaaay too fast and got the aliens and all that. They are on the island with North Korea in Crysis 1, and lets just imagine it ends with North Korea finding out about the attack and them invading America and winning. Boom, Homefront The Revolution right there but with less super suit. This really does feel like Crysis and how 2 should have played in terms of free roam in a city. Urban Guerrilla warfare for days. Keep in mind each part if a section but each sector is usually 400m-1000m with lots to find. You are in an occupied Philly, part of the resistance tasked with miltant attacks to take your country back. The game itself is beautiful, since it is in CryEngine. There's moments I find myself staring at the ground while the rain falls watching the drops lets completely coat the road drop by drop until they turn into puddles and I get shot. This game has a slight feel of what STALKER/Metro 2033 has, but really feels more like Crysis meets the Saboteur/Far Cry. I have really been enjoying the game, and would easily pay 20+. The game suffered from terrible publisher disorder and was released with a ton of bugs, I haven't had any real issues with the game, I did have a load error issue but that was due to a validation.Tips for getting started. Turn off the music. Just do it. Set your FOV to something more tolerable and then finally remove the MipMap/Onscreenmap since that thing makes the game feel completely different with it enabled and by removing it forces you to take things slow since you don't have telekenetic abilites to see every enemy in real time. AI is pretty good all things considered and is on point with flanking and covering. Gunplay is fun, finding out what bullets penetrate what is one of most fun things in the game. Lots of enviromental hazards and multiple types of ways to play. Supposedly there is a way to stealth, but I end up just running around shooting people through walls. Shame the game had a rocky release, but excited to see new DLC's and support the developers on this. According to the developers, there are 2 more DLCs and the final one adding a massive new zone to operate in. Tl;dr Like Crysis, Far Cry, Red Faction Guerrilla, & The Saboteur? Buy it.			"

Characters are dull, main character Brady doesn't speak and everyone around him speaks for Brady and also everything related to revolution is up to Brady, so no one is trying to do anything to save their country except Brady. Cryengine and fancy graphics won't make it better. Consistent and rich story is what makes games fun to play not just graphics + gameplay.			"

												Played this on a free weekend. Managed to complete the whole game on single player. Thought it was fun. No major issues. It looks pretty as well.Tried to play multiplayer and kept getting error messages which upon research are pretty common. Gave up and deleted it from my library.Would I recommend it based on my experience? No, unless it was on sale for £4-5 solely for the single player.			"

												I have to recommend this game if you enjoy a good shooter game with a decent story. If you are a fan of the first Homefront its a conflicted feeling to like this game though I have a huge BUT about the entire game.  I hope that the single player missions that are coming out will address some of the issues I have with this game. I would also hope this is not the end to the Homefront series and that the developer is given a better directive on how to craft the story and give us a better open world.I can't make my review based upon the first Homefront because it wouldn't be fair to this game. Which is why I recommend the game. However I will give my opinion.1) The history behind Korea's takeover of America is very different in this game. I find the history in this game far less believable than the first game,2) The story has many holes in it. I feel the game tried to be Mad Max, Farcry, Assassins Creed, Batman, etc  in its execution of areas to liberate and cause the whole region to rebel. But how can you rebel in a sector when you got airships in the air above you? When enemies keep spawning?3) The story was simplistic. You can tell in the first few minutes of the game that the game is setting you up to be the face of the resistance at the end of the story.4) I don't feel this is open world because why go back to other sectors if they are at 100% rebellion already? Or go back when the storyline has left that area and won't be coming back to there. I feel perhaps they kept the game they had from 4 years ago (story and design wise) and used the cryengine to make the game look spiffy. They succeeded with that but I feel there was a lackluster effort to give us a better story & open world. "

												Great game actually, unexpected.Not the grindy Far Cry style open world, instead a relatively short ""do what you want"" for some hours, more focus on others. If you like Far Cry, Mad Max, Crysis, Stalker this game is probably for you.If you try this game out do not be discouraged by the bad and boring start, wait until you at least get into the yellow (civilian zone) after an hour or two since that is the real deal and makes the game what it is.Ran without bugs, very smooth.

												My opinion would be to ignore the bad reivews. Most of them appear to be from two kinds of people: Impatient children and gamers who didn't realize what they were getting into and simply do not enjoy this type of game. You get to free roam killing people which includes asking other revolutionaries to tag along and help you out. You have vehicles, guns, executions and stealth. Variey of weapons, attachments and stealth items/tools including some stuff thats not so much necessary as it is just simply fun. The story itself isn't bad but I would say it's so far fairly unimaginative once you've read the game title however the characters and dialogue are flavorful enough to even that out just fine.I probably would've found the game worth the $40 regular price although I seriously doubt I would've ever tried it at that rate if I were being honest. But for the $10 USD it currently sits at while on sale, it was a great deal with no regrets. I look forward to finishing it and the DLC now. "

If the game didn't freeze like 5-30 mins or less it a a decent game.  6700k  32 gig DDR4 and RX 480 8gig freeze out the blue.  Sure I can ALT Tab out the game or DEL+ALT+Ctrl but game way to unstable.  If they could fix that it a be a decent game.  Knowing Deep Blue it now all just about Pumping out garbage and not fixing the game core play.  Even my backup computer has Issues with the game.  FX 6300 with 8 gig and R9 270x 2gig.  I know that both systems are working good just this game.  If they fixed the games game breaking Freeze Issue could be fun.			"

												Ahh Homefront Revolution....must maligned last year. In fact, I'm pretty sure I saw it  on most worst games of 2016. I gotta tell you, though, they were wrong. I feel like there was a lot of bandwagon jumpint then. Yes, its not one of the best games of 2016, but it is incredibly further from the worst. I played much worse games last year. There are bugs in this game, particularly where it pertained to some AI behavior when there were a lot of characters on screen, but I never encountered any game breaking bugs, like those paraded on youtube. I found the story engaging and interesting. I truly enjoyed the single player experience and I hope that someone gets a chance to continue it sometime in the future. I would recommend getting this game if you see it under $30. 8/10			"

												Prelude: I'm a big fan of old titles like Red Faction, Just Cause 2, Freedom Fighters, and Mercenaries. I love these titles not simply because of their mechanics and gameplay, but because they really made me feel like I was fighting the power guerilla-style. I've been on a quest to find something similar, so that makes me especially harsh on pretenders. Bought this on sale. The gameplay functions, but it fails at creating any semblance of a compelling story or a rebellion environment. The North Korean adversaries are bland, the enemies a joke to defeat (unless you're not paying attention and walk face first into a heavy), and the strongholds/territory captures points nowhere near as exciting as FC3/FC4. By the time I got bored enough to move on (after finding that awesome Timesplitters easter egg), I was disregarding stealth, walking through a yellow district one-shotting soldiers with a crossbow. Enemies spontaneously generate 10 feet around you, which is about the only time you'll be at a disadvantage. I haven't played the expansion content, so take this with a grain of salt. I didn't find it enjoyable enough that I'd buy it again, even at a big discount.			"

												Bugs holy crap bugs1 I have fallen through the world.2 I have spawned in a base with no way out until I reloaded and one of the doors were open after the reload.3 Enemies will sometime walk about 3 feet of the ground through the air.4 Some enemies will be frozen in the T pose because they didn't activate when you got close enough.5 The AI vehicles get stuck on the last misson making it impossible to finish the game. Must reload a previous save and hope for the best.personal gripeThe bases you have to take over turn into puzzles on how to get in or turn on whatever it is to activate it. Riding motorcycles up fire escapes to power a generator with spinning 50 gallon drums is rediculous and not in a fun way. some of the bases feel like you wouldn't figure them out without looking them up. by the time I was on my 30th base I just lost intrest and would turn the game off.

												First the positives:The graphics are really up their; very beautiful game. The story is also a lot better and more immersive than the last game, so thats a huge plus. I really had a good experience playing this game.As for the negatives:My game crashed about 3 times in about 20 hours of gameplay. Thats not as bad as some other reviewers had posted but it still annoyed me and it should be noted otherwise. The mechanics of the game could be better; it is annoying sometimes to figure out how to get into building that help rertake an area.Another thing worth noting is that this game is really graphics intensive. My GTX 970 would get anywhere from 30 fps to 60 on High settings on a single 1080p monitor. This is pretty much the only game that I get that type of performance.Overall all though, I enjoyed it; it was very fun. I reccomend it if you like the plot and general story behind the game. It is a good reboot of the last game and it is definetley the game the original title should have been.			"

												I paid 10 bux for this game and I feel ripped off.From the very start this game leaves a bad taste in your mouth as the people who you are trying to help are basically about to torture you to death - because they assume you are a spy. Fortunately this torture is stopped before your nipples are cut off but the implication is that it's pure luck that you survived your encounter with the resistance you signed up with.Best part is - you can't speak at all and as per the game plot your character is totally OK with the events from the intro. Later you get to work with the person who was about to torture you - but no hard feelings. So what if they beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you - they're the 'good' guys.Fine. Lets imagine the above didn't happen - the game is still awful. It's incredibly repetitive. Get to a zone, capture an area, repeat, repeat and repeat.Supposedly the game takes place in Philly. It doesn't. There is ZERO resemblance to Philadelphia in the game. Ok. Fine. The area code on the phone numbers is 215...maybe later in the game there is something? But first 3 zones are just generic industrial/suburban/urban areas.The gun customization system seemed interesting but frankly I personally find the guns to feel awful and the upgrade options uninteresting. PayDay 2 does guns sooo much better as does  - well quite frankly every single game that has weapon upgrade does it better. Not only that but there is zero reason to use the vast majority of the guns. Silenced SMG + LMG is all you need.This isn't exactly a ""bad"" game - and for $12 it's alright - but in many ways it feels like a chore to play. There is zero investment into the story.			"

												A stale, unfinished game. Honestly, I love the concept of playing as part of a guerrilla resistance, but this game follows the boring trends of all the other open world first person shooters. Clear out this base, it is now your base, get rewards, repeat. This repetitiveness on top of a generic story that tries too hard to make you care for a character two seconds before they die for dramatic emphasis and endless clipping, pop in, and other technical issues makes me not want to play this even for free.

												REVIEW (POST PATCH)Positiv:-Changing / Modding weapons on-the-go is just awesome and makes combat feel very dynamic-Excellent Shooting mechanics, weapon sounds and hit feedback-Scenario is funny and intriguing (to a certain extent)-Some nice dialogue which raises questions about ethics -Decent graphics and runs smoothly (POST PATCH)Negativ:-Check-List gaming at its finest (or worst) --> Extremely uninspired gameplay: You just have to keep freeing district after distrit like a mindless drone-No a real open world game as advertized as (districts divided by loading screens)-Zero ""open-world"" side activities -Protagonist is basically and empty shell who is not able to interact with anybody (its almost like an On-rails-shooter)-Absolutely NO interesting or new gameplay features or innovation. NONE!-Cell phone as main menu sub par-minor bugsFinal Rating 5 / 10 --> Just a mediocre and mundane experience overall, but by FAR not the worst game of 2016 like some people have saidFOR OUR FULL VIDEO REVIEW, CHECK OUT

												Played this during the Free Weekend. I had it on my wishlist for a long time, but did not want to commit any money to it because of the negative feedback it's gotten.The game usually runs at a nice frame rate on High quality (GTX 980 Ti, i7, 8 GB RAM) but there are microstutters or uneven frame timings that make the game seem choppier than the frame rate suggests. Ultimately I couldn't even finish the first real mission because the game kept reproducibly freezing at a particular checkpoint, so I can't recommend this to anyone.			"

												I bought this game inclusive of DLCs for around $11. Mmmm not bad, but definitely not worth paying the full price. Main campaign is alright eventhough some may think the plot is short compared to other games. Technical wise, graphics isn't really that great but mine stays at 60 most of the time at ULTRA. Good side :> Solid 60fps most of the time> Sick on-the-spot weapon modding> Fun explosions> Decent map sizeSort of bad side :> Main story's plot is a bit short> Inconsistent and annoying spawn system of enemies> Tall and thick bushes at certain places of the map is useless as it doesn't conceal you from the enemy> The DLCs are very very short> Rare crash and freezesOnly buy it when it's discounted  :)			"

												my rig spec6700kgtx97016 gb ramthe rest you can imagine a dragon ( budum tss )but let me tell you something the game is great in my opinion i enjoyed it, I focused only on the main story it took me somewhere 10 - 11 hours to finish on easythe beginning it was very glitchy for instance that happenedthe waypoint purpose is for you to make sure to go forward right nope what it did made me go backwards then i go forwards to progress the story but if you didnt OBEY THE WAYPOINT you dont get to go forward the story but you can go through the map but if you see the norks they will shoot you if it wasnt like a starwars shoot out like come OOOOONN !!! im 1 cm close point blank on the gunSS BARREL ( 5 enemies all sides ) including the car on machine gun couldnt hurt me unless i go back to the waypoint then i can get shot stabed and getting run over by a friendly car you do get hurt from that on the final mission or any thing that moves to be honest .then there is the weapons the only weapons you NEED IS THE MERUCA SHOTGUN why ??? you may ask OP that it and it also acts like a sinper if the buckshot reaches that certain place you want to shoot but if you want get another gun you will get in the main mission a rocket launcher but its useless 100% of the time i ended up using MY SHUTUPGUN to on CARS , MINI GOLAITHE THAT SHOOTS STUN GUN THAT GETS YOU KILLED SOMEHOW , and a seeker but really 1 shot on there weak spot with a shotgun it takes care of it or you can get automatic shotgun which does the job better and faster but not accurate the rest of the weapons is on you the story its okay it didnt make me feel any emotion ON ALL CHARACTER even in the start all on the ending it kinda stupid and clitche but some momments is just too dull but the only character i only is heather forsome reason maybe she is an engeneire that why i feel her problame i enjoed the game dont bother doing the side mission for the cash i got alot of cash on the main mission i have used them all for character upgrades guns and that's it to be honest you can finish the game without any to almost no upgrades the only upgrades you need is haveing more med kits oh the only trasportation for you is only motorbike witch is better in my opinion and you are going to be a DAREDEIVEL because of its puzzel and riding arround the city if you you are going to ask me how big is the map i didnt even check that go watch a youtube video much easier for me and youguns customization just like crysis which it is cool i know that people use Ctrl+Shift+Esc to get out of some games but for this game it's Ctrl+Alt+DELETE then star up task manager that's how you can get out of THIS GAME and also if the loading screen for somereason stoped working that means 2 things longer waiting or the game crashed that the window WONT COME UP TO TELL YOU THAT GAME CRASH OR STOPPED WORKING becasue that game is tightly locked DOWN LIKE NORKS GAMING LAAAAW i give the rating a solid 7/10 if you dont mind the clitche mommnet , stupid AI , stupid way point AND COMEPLETE LOCKDOWN BUT REALLY it a good game you will like it but for buying it thats up to you if you dont mind playing only single player on HARD trust me easy it kinda dull but putting it hard my change my opinion on this review if i played it hard but i played it on easy to know the story and funny mooon roller blading knee it is it finiest norks army traning okay byehow i got this game for free well it free to play for only 2 to 3 days long then goes back to buying them			"

												As many reviews here show, gamers these days have mutated into a bunch of cry-babies.This game has some technical flaws but is no way a bad game.Just a few minutes into this game and i love it already.***UPDATE: After spending 3h into the game i must say, despite some technical flaws of course, this is one of the best shooters i played lately. I love the graphics, the atmosphere and the way how missions progress. On hardest difficulty you really have to carefully use stealth-tactics, every rambo-style gameplay works as well....that means if you dont have a problem with dozens of mission-restarts until you finally made it.Its really a miracle to me how this game gets such bad critics and when it comes to the technical flaws i have to say i actually play with FXAA and everything else on highest setting, and all i get is some slight stuttering at certain surroundings which never became annoying enough to make me stop playing it.

												Background.First; to those who think that `N. Korea` is the foreign power taking over the USA in the game, it seems its actually a thinly-veiled reference to China. And you know (roughly) how many soldiers they have (and their future plans for Australia/NZ and the USA [etc...] especially if the US will not pay them back for 25 years of loans [actually, NZ will probably to to Russia (but Russia will be dealing with Europes political/Military punks as that gets crushed via the effects of the 1952 Rabbi Rabinovich plan)])? Something I commented about some 10+ years ago...Anyway, the game scenario seems set after the Kissinger`ites `whack` Trump like JFK got whacked, and this time it will bust the US and `it` will go down, maybe something like this game; Probably. Review.Anyway, this game is a mixed bag of somewhere between `Half-life` and `The Division`: and for the price I got it for here, it was a bit of a bargain. Conclusion.I waited for issues to be fixed before buying, and many seem to have been sorted; and there has been a lot of improvement since I tried the Demo, ...... but the devs could do with a `gesture` for your character, to make a few intellectually misfiring robotic helpers get out of your way.. No biggie, as `dismissing` them, makes them move usually.All in all, worth my getting in the sale.It is what it is; a game. "

												My opinion would be to ignore the bad reivews. Most of them appear to be from two kinds of people: Impatient children and gamers who didn't realize what they were getting into and simply do not enjoy this type of game. You get to free roam killing people which includes asking other revolutionaries to tag along and help you out. You have vehicles, guns, executions and stealth. Variey of weapons, attachments and stealth items/tools including some stuff thats not so much necessary as it is just simply fun. The story itself isn't bad but I would say it's so far fairly unimaginative once you've read the game title however the characters and dialogue are flavorful enough to even that out just fine.I probably would've found the game worth the $40 regular price although I seriously doubt I would've ever tried it at that rate if I were being honest. But for the $10 USD it currently sits at while on sale, it was a great deal with no regrets. I look forward to finishing it and the DLC now. "

												For nomination of ""Game within a Game"" award. Finding timesplitters in this game caught me totally off guard. Was so engrossed I forgot I was playing homefront.For the game itself, it had a lot of potential and played surprisingly well. I didn't ever get the feeling that I could take on the world, which is exactly what I wanted in a Guerrilla warfare type game.However, the gadgetry could do with being a bit fleshed out. Plus the enemy AI could've used a bit of work. I think I actually enjoyed the story of the first homefront more tbh.With respect to multiplayer, as much as I liked the multiplayer in the original homefront, I'm not particularly bothered its gone.

												I know you want to buy The Homefront :The Revolution. There are some reviews.1.	The story line is hard to understand . you can say there is not a story line . korean jobs used phone and pad to destory the USA . and you are one of the arming rebel group . this game is similar to FAR CRY , exploring and liberating the area.2.	Your teammate (AI) are really idiots . you spent lots of time to avoid the enemy , but your teammats run to the enemy , use the ‘ one person fight twenty enemy ’to expose your location . and all of you are dead . because there are too many UAC and a large kirov airship in the sky . you can always find : at first , you have 20 teamates are fighting , and then only you are fighting , but more and more enemy .3.	3. Strange weapon systems. Firearms have pistols, assault rifles, light machine guns, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, crossbows and firebombs. The main source of ammunition come from your teammates and the enemy's body. No sight, but you can install a laser and optical sights on firearms. You can even see the hero in the wild in only 2 second change a pistol into a submachine gun. In this game , you will find all the firearms just have  different barrels and with recoil immeasurable. Fireworks ceremony in this world act as RPG.4.	If you encounter the enemy ,then abandon frontal attack it. Enemies like mosquitoes, you  cannot kill all of them . Note: They are simply kill endless! ! ! Equipments on your body are like a militia, but the North Korean soldiers wearing combat soldier armor from the future . Completing the game basically rely on muffler + kill a guerrilla enemy, run, dodge enemy tracking (hidden in the mystery of the trash), scrapping a back.5.	5. As a AAA-rated games, please optimization better. I7-4790k+GTX970 only to fps 306.	After 2 hours became repeated, monotonous and boring.The Homefront :The Revolution 是一款非常差的游戏1.	难以理解的故事线，可以说几乎没什么剧情。游戏类似于远哭Far Cry ，探索和解放地区的模式。2.	你的队友（电脑AI）异常白痴，你花费了好久的时间来隐藏和准备暗杀敌人，这时候你的队友就直接冲上去，以1打20+的行为暴露了你的位置。然后你们就都死了，因为天上飘着无数的带着武器的机器无人机和一个巨大的基洛夫空艇。经常会出现20+队友打着打着就只剩你一个。而地图上的红点还是越来越多。3.	奇怪的武器系统。枪械有手枪，冲锋枪，轻机枪，突击步枪，散弹枪，狙击枪，弩和燃烧弹。弹药的主要来源是从你的队友和敌人的身上摸。没有准星，但是你可以在枪械上安装激光和光学瞄具。你甚至可以看到主人公在野外徒手在一秒钟内把一个手枪改造成冲锋枪。在这个游戏里你会发现所有的枪械仅仅是枪管不同并且后坐力无比巨大。礼花炮在这个世界里充当RPG。4.	遇到敌人放弃正面死磕吧。敌人就像蚊子一样根本打不完。注意是根本杀不完的！！！你的装备是难民级，而朝鲜兵穿的是未来级别的单兵作战铠甲。完成游戏基本靠游击+杀一个敌人，跑，躲掉敌人的追踪（藏在的神秘的垃圾桶里），回来再杀一个。5.	作为AAA级游戏，拜托优化好一些。I7-4790k+970也只能到30帧。6.	2小时候开始变得单调和无聊。重复的刷刷刷。 "

												Awful; just awful.  First off it is very buggy and often crashes even on a high-end machine.  Secondly, the game is just plain bad.  The controls are terrible, the AI is garbage, vehicles are so uncontrollable as to be worthless, the first hour of the game is a wretched cut-scene (which, in of itself, nearly puts you over the no return threshold for Steam), the story is nearly non-existent and what there is to it is absurd beyond words.  It’s part stealth game without any stealth to speak of, it’s part first-person shooter where you are either overwhelmed because your companions are worthless nimrods that get lost or it becomes a turkey shoot if you situate yourself in the right spot.  This game is garbage and it’s very high priced garbage at that.  If you are thinking of purchasing Homefront:  The Revolution may I suggest you instead stick your hand into a moving blender.  You will have a better time getting your fingers reattached at the hospital than playing this abortion of a game and you might meet a cute nurse.			"

												I liked the game it was fun and everything, and the only reason I keep playing it just because I like the revolution idea. Its a fun game (if you can run it), and it also shows america in a diffrent way and not some strong force that plows through everyone. This game is fun but if your were do like $1 a hour I would wait to have it go on sale becuase right now at the moment I don't think its worth $60 plus since it didn't sell well sadly, rip I been waiting 4-5 weeks looking for 1 player to play coop with. It should have a sale soon but my opinions is my opinion and you do w/e you think suites you best. So it had fun gameplay for me, but just wait for it to go on sale and hope you can run it.

												***Review Edit***Valve had mercy on me, and compleated the refund.The review of the game still stands though.DO NOT BUY!***/Review Edit***I played this for a little over an hour just at the end of a free weekend, and was disapointed that i couldn't try it for longer, as i wasn't quite convinced that the game would run fluently once reaching some of the real action, as the frames dropped a bit at times. The beginning of the game is cutscenes and stealth, so i was a bit sceptical, given all the bad reviews the game had gotten due to stabilaty issues.But i decided to give it a chance and bought it during the holiday sale at a heavy discount. BIG MISTAKE!!!As soon as the world opened up a bit, the game started to feel really awkward due to dropping framefrates. even after lowering graphics options. The game actually crashed (Black screen) 2 times.  The second time i looked for solutions online, and was a bit surprised of all the people having similar problems.But there are in fact a whole range of different bugs causing headaches to people even those with high end gaming systems.So at this point I'm just hoping for a refund, banging my self in the head that i didn't close the game while searching for solutions online, as that probably put me over the 2 hour limit after purchase.First time i ever felt the urge or need to make a refund on a game...For good measure here are my system specs:Win 7x64i7-6700K32GM RAMASUS R9 270x CU2TOP 2GB			"

												Imagine buying a car, it looked cool in the pictures, drove smooth in the TV ad and gave you a sense that life would be better when you owned your very own. The price was reasonable, it had all the parts, but when you get in the door opens with screech, the key required a little force to get into the ignition and it reluctantly starts up after turning over a few times. Your first ride is rough and bumpy, there's strange noises coming from everything, so you find yourself deviating from your course home to feel out the problems with a few detours, twists and turns, trying to pinpoint the issues it seems to have with the steering. The air-con doesn't seem to hold the right temperature, so you wind down the electric window, only to find there's a slight stutter as it drops a few steps, rather than giving a smooth wind. The stereo is only picking up a few stations with a bit of static, you can't find a good song and the talkback channels are a bit annoying, the off switch doesn't seem to work, so you just have to turn the volume down to 0%. You wanna have a cigarette to calm your nerves and frustration, but there's no lighter or ash tray, even so, you can't be bothered pulling into the 7-Eleven to buy a lighter, because you just wanna get the damn thing home and assess the whole deal, so you just imagine how good it would have been to have a smoke with your cool new ride.You've driven around in the built up areas for a while now, the GPS has led you astray a few times and the route path seems quite disjointed, so you decide to jump on the freeway and open up before you dump it home and watch a movie to get your mind off things, there only seems to be four gears that grind into place even with the softest clutch control, and the engine has a limiter on, so you can't even let some frustration out by breaking the speed limit, but even then, the fuel gauge starts beeping and you've just hit reserve level.You get it Home and park out Front, giving the thing a bit of gas in neutral to test The engine Revolution, which is a little underwhelming, but for some reason you're not entirely upset, but more disappointed with your new car, it has a slightly unique shape and colour from other cars, but the same stock-standard cheaply sourced parts from various suppliers, that don't seem to have been oiled or put together properly. Quality control was probably a bit slack, and you get the feeling this model was rushed into production to meet demand.You find yourself having to shoulder-barge the door open to get out, the button doesn't work to remotely lock the doors and set the alarm, so you have to go back and lock it manually. Pulling the key out, you realise the back left tire is flat, but you just walk inside and throw the car keys on the floor, crack open a nice cold beer and wonder why you hadn't read any reviews about the car, waited a little longer before buying a brand new model or just taken it back to the dealer instead of driving all the way home. You're not entirely bummed though, it may be because you're equipped with those silly human traits of faith and hope, so you decide you'll leave it for a while, wait for a tow truck and let the mechanics sort it out eventually, because with a bit of oil, some fine tuning and a few added features, this car could one day be a sweet ride. But for now, you'll just use your trusty old whip to get you around.			"

												Super good co-op. The game isn't perfectly polished but it has more than it's fair share of perfectly entertaining aspects to it. Cool stealth, choose-your-own-route style open objectives, enemy AI is a good balance of tough and smart, graphics and intricate visual details are incredible, interesting variety of mission types, the game challenges you to be fast / accurate / smart, every time you think the game is going slow you'll find an upgradable perk to fit your need like reload speed or consumable improvements, you can craft from items found from a simple set of equipment between battles or in the midst of gunfire in a pinch but it's more dangerous which is thrilling, vehicles which are menacing but combatable, in-game assistance from NPC's ready to fight by your side, great dystopian style atmosphere and social commentary, character and weapon customization which improves not only visuals but impacts your strength in battle, satisfying headshot acknowledgement, radar which doesn't make the game too easy by only revealing enemies temporarily, particle effects and weapon tracers look slick... need I go on?

												Ok, so I was struggling with a hard time of liking or hating this game. There are bugs that exist but I don't see too many, so let's subtract the bugs from my review.The campaign:I have no choice but to get that Murcia' feeling when I play, but others might not like the story. From the beginning I was a little attached to it, I think the voice acting was pretty great, and there's a few cliché parts but the voice acting from them still felt like they were into it. Though only thing I wish I could do would be to be able to play after the ending and be able to reset the strike points and so on and have the KPA attempt to retake them.The weapons in the campaign are pretty diverse, and the only ones I hate are the shotgun and the flamethrower unlock. close quarters fighting is insane here because the AI rarely miss. I do wish there were more attachments and gear available. I also wish there was something I could do with KPA points after I unlocked everything, or that they just capped the amount you could earn overall.Resistance mode:	I can’t find anyone ever so I can’t give my opinion on how it plays.

												I enjoy the game. I really do, but it's extremely hard for me to give it a recommnedation, even if its discounted heavily. It's not because of the broken AI (not stupid, they're literally broken), laughable model placement mistakes (floating cars, floating debris, clipping scenery, disappearing objects when you go near, etc), broken mechanics (Drones will hunt you across the map instantly if you ever ride a bike even if nobody sees you, when hiding in bins or protable toilets in yellow zones, enemies can actually still see you and will even try to kill you by shooting and throwing bombs but they can never hurt you and your wanted cooldown will still go down. It's pretty funny actually)  or that the gameplay can be repetitive (thought personally, i don't find this to be a problem since I'm actually enjoying it).The reason why I cannot in good faith give this a recommendation, again even if its heavily discounted, is because the game has the potential to literally ruin your computer physically. After beating halfway through Holloway (in terms of main missions), the game will HARD CRASH randomly during your playthrough from hencepoint onwards (sound will still continue to play as normal). It doesn't matter if you reinstalled the game, if you try to modify game files to make it more stable or have the latest updated version of the game. The game will crash on you so hard that it literally freezes your entire computer and your only option (unless you have a fast CPU and W10, which then you can try to ""log out of user"" thereby forcing the pc to do a ""soft reset"" by forcibly turning everything running off when it exits your Window user account) is to restart the computer.Trying to turn just the .exe of the game alone either via task manager or right clicking to close via the task bar hardly helps. Sometimes it does turn homefront off after repeated tries, but overall doing either a full reset or as mentioned with signing out of your Window account is significantly faster and helps.Literally I am losing files and getting system error messages (twice i even had to do a window restore because the game somehow destroyed/corrupted some important files) because of these sudden serious freeze to the whole PC because of the game. Seeing how this is very likely the final patch version of the game, i suggest you avoid this game unless you are willing to bear with the hard freezes, nevermind the glitchiness of the game itself.Disappointing really. One of the most broken games I have ever played thus far. And what makes it worse is that I actually personally find the game enjoyable despite it glitches and understandably repetitive gameaplay.My rig loadout is on my profile if you need reference on my rig capabilities. Also another note is that if you're using RGB products such as keyboards (Corsair K70. Apex M800), mousepads (Razer firefly, Apex MM880) and mice (Rival 700, Razer Mamba new, Sensei Wireless, M65 Pro RGB) the game WILL freeze your lighting (another indication that the game has some serious software issue). Headsets RGB doesn't seem to be affected by it for some reason, same goes for any RGB lighting for your case such as RGB fans and NZXT Hue+.I'm not sure if the issue is because of Nvidia cards since I'm running 2 1070 (i tried running the game with and without SLI, problem still persists), so i can't say the same for AMD users. Nevertheless take it a cautionary note			"

Posted: September 12, 2016
												-Free WeekendMore of a ~ review than a + or - one.I have no pre-knowledge of this game.Summing the game up in two acronyms: F.P.S. A.C. Overview/Pros I finished the SP campaign on DeathWish in ~24 Hrs[You could speedrun in like 2-5hrs]. I never experienced the MP since the only time I tried was late night/early morning, so I don't know if people actually play the MP, but it seemed like something you would spend some time on.Oh, yes, I remember what I had forgotten to write about...The Moral Dilemma they push throughout the game. You have the two extremes: Doc, the pacifist, Dana, the Rebel with a cause, and a strong & wise middle ground, Jack. Whenever Doc talked about his peaceful/pacifist ways I always ended up rolling my eyes because people were dying anyway albeit in private rooms/secret rather than in public. Whenever Dana talked all I could think of was how much of a Psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥ she was that couldn't look at the bigger picture sometimes; although, of course it was justified in her eyes.There's a few interesting quirks in this game that involves the way you take over territory that is different from other games, but they quickly get old. I feel like the game would've been better off shortened by atleast one zone, but it's true that they made most of the old zones relevant throughout the game. The game is filled with cliches which I think is meant to be endearing to a majority of Americans, but comes off to me as a bit stereotypical but it is a game based on a 2nd American Revolution so...My experience was mostly negative due to 1 game breaking bug[quit to main menu to move the NPCs out of the way (Inside Job)], 2-4 instances of sound bugs, 1 CTD, but this game was in developmental hell for four years & they did release a patch to make the game better, so I gave it a thumbs up.[those long credits though]OVERALL Rating: Solid 5.5-7/10 depending on your experience Cons - Bugs- You clip through solid objects constantly throughout the game.- Friendly A.I.s are worthless.- Linear Story- The whole ""HOLD E"" game mechanic - ♥♥♥♥ off.- The save system...why?- No real consequences for killing friendlies, or civilians.- By the end, it felt like they just wanted to get it over with as did I.- Obvious plot devices[mostly cliches] & I feel like they didn't even attempt to twist it a bit.- Cheap tearjerkers that are cliche & well known within the genre. [No tears were shed]- Map of Loot Locations would've been made easier if you checked off discovered locations.- Scope Movement is so slow...wish you had an option to change it to the same scrolling speed as normal- Deathwish isn't hard, sure, you'll die, but they're mostly cheap deaths.[i.e. getting shot off your bike then proceeding to die from the annoying time-consuming game mechanic of rolling over/doing a flip? Or not getting health in time] *SPOILING the entire GAME here*  You spend 3/4 or most of the game trying to save the Revolution's supposed leader, but then Crawford, an obvious mole & narcissist, baits the Resistance with the possibility of rescuing Walker, who is already broken by the KPA[the supposed Leader], so it's a TRAP! The Resistance die by the 100's extremely weakening them, so they decide to go for the KPA's figurehead who warns them of the KPA's final solution which is promptly ignored of course and the KPA initiates a plan to kill every American alive. We then get revenge on the traitorous traitor who attempts to weasel out of responsibility & helps us figure out a way to get past the drones protecting the blimps carrying gas, but of course we're having none of that. *Slit Throat* We deploy SAMs, which would've been an excellent side-mission but it would've further tipped off the more of the plot & of course those damn NORKs have a protection plan, so we have to assault the main compound for a second time to turn them off to blow up the blimps w/ gas in them. It's time to kill off more supporting characters to advance a cliche plot...and you save the day by turning off drone control allowing SAMs to hit the blimps. *SPOILING the entire GAME here*			"

												Not a fan.  In weird ways the game is hand holdy, and in others it totally hangs you out to dry.  38 minutes before you even get to play.  In that time your character gets knocked out twice, and beaten up another. Not a very heroic beginning.  The game world is a pain to move through.  There are certain walls that I would like to walk on top of.  As the wall is 2 feet wide this does not seem to be an irrational request; however, the only interaction that I am allowed with said wall is to jump over it.  Not knowing this I jumped to my death.The rules of engagement on alarms is very buggy.  I was hidden in a building, and had broken LOS for three minutes, but the guards kept shooting me through the wall.  never hitting or doing damage.  As such I couldn't break the alarm.On the plus side the graphics, lighting, and mood are all top notch.  The story so far has been decent.  It can be hard to keep the main story straight with all the side things that pop up on your way from A to B to complete a mission.As you can see I dont' have much time in the game.  I got it on a sale, and might come back to it at some point, but for right now I just dont' have the intrest in learning the game.  Which is kinda sad because the story really looks promising			"

												Really good game i thought. It runs pretty great. The graphics and details within the world are incredible. The story while not amazing is pretty good. Surprising amount of variety in missions and how to acomplish them (not in terms of how you choose to get there more so how its set up for you to get there). The guns feel good and sound good. The game can be quite challenging at times, you are not a super hero. Damage is quite harmful in this game, so you are forced to alter your play style constantly.The game feels like playing Far Cry 3/4 but set in excellent war torn cities and towns to roam around. Its surprisingly lengthy too, if you can be bothered to find everything and capture everything for every district.Play it and make up your own mind.			"

												The first two single player levels are based on the premise that you need to avoid the enemy and not kill them (because killing them calls in reinforcements).  However, the game doesnt give you the normal tools of an avoidance game; i.e., no sneaking, no crawling, no means to kill without setting off alarms (e.g., radio jamming).  They do give you the standard run and gun tools, which backfire here.  So, this game (at least in the first two levels) appears internally inconsistent, making it more difficult than necessary.			"

From the FPS drops, Changes/Confusion/Turns in the Storyline/Dialogue that where confusing, the trouble with Multiplayer & the Little to no Tie in to the First Homefront Game, where the Only problems with the game that I Found. HOWEVER the general Outline of the story, progression, Weapon customization, level design where all really good and I really enjoyed it. Yes this game has had bad Backing and Reviews so Far but the Way I look at it is the Only True Review that someone can give or the Only True feedback someone can give is YOURSELF. Everyone has their own things that they like as Everyone is Different. So Try out the game because YOU want to.			"

												I have learned not to trust reviewers who have less than an hour in a game.  It barely scratches the surface or even gives you a sense of what is going on.  I only have 2 1/2 hours in this game and I can see all the comparisons others are making to existing games.I'm only playing this game from the co-op perspective, and for us it was a really rewarding experience.  Perhaps single player and multi-player are different expereiences.  But I'd recommend it.(I got the game for free, but reviewed it after I bought it.)			"

												Sadly while I want to recommend this game, I just can't at this point in time.  I read with anticipation all the reviews stating that the latest patches had fixed all the problems.  I was one of the apparently few people who really liked the first Homefront game a few years ago so I eagerly awaited this.However, for me, this is still broken.  I can play it for about 10 minutes and then it freezes, locks up and I have to stop it from the Task Manager.  The frame rates are usually ok but occasionally lag pretty bad which speaks volumes about how unoptimized this game is given I'm running it on a GTX 980, plenty of grunt for 1080p gaming.I think this will be a great game if the dev's keep working on it but right now I just can't recommend it.

												Good game for a free weekend, the concept is nice, capturing points like you do in Far Cry games but on a more smaller urban scale.  Weapon customisation is limited, no silencer for a sniper for example and you use one primary weapon and a pistol that can convert to a small SMG.  Even on a free weekend there is little MP action going.The graphics work perfectly fine for me but this is post launch and post patches.The end is very much a let down and is just as scripted as most COD end scenes.  The enemy in this is always a faceless foreign enemy with no real depth or insight.  You face scores of soldiers yet there is no real threat or fear of what you are doing.  There is no real dread or fear compared to a game like HL2 where you are in a similar situation.			"

												All this free weekend accomplished was giving more people an opportunity to expose this horrific chore that doesn't deserve to be called a game.The characters you fight with are Haze (PS3) level loathable. They are the most annoying form of stereotypes to the point of me suspecting that I was supposed to hate them due to some predictable plot twist where they betray me and become my enemies... to my surprise this doesn't happen so I'm just left hating them without being able to shoot them in the face.Gunplay is interesting initially but then you realize that non-story related gunfights are futile and useless because enemies infinitely respawn. I also don't like that I'm so easily killed, I mean I don't even realize that I'm about to die and all of a sudden I fall flat on my face. Customization is cool, if only it were tied to a different game.Story... screw it. I got bored before clearing the first district because they were forcing me to 100% all of their generic tasks before advancing.Multiplayer... idgaf. Tried it in the beta or alpha and it was mediocre.Deleted before the weekend was even over.			"

												I paid 10 bux for this game and I feel ripped off.From the very start this game leaves a bad taste in your mouth as the people who you are trying to help are basically about to torture you to death - because they assume you are a spy. Fortunately this torture is stopped before your nipples are cut off but the implication is that it's pure luck that you survived your encounter with the resistance you signed up with.Best part is - you can't speak at all and as per the game plot your character is totally OK with the events from the intro. Later you get to work with the person who was about to torture you - but no hard feelings. So what if they beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you - they're the 'good' guys.Fine. Lets imagine the above didn't happen - the game is still awful. It's incredibly repetitive. Get to a zone, capture an area, repeat, repeat and repeat.Supposedly the game takes place in Philly. It doesn't. There is ZERO resemblance to Philadelphia in the game. Ok. Fine. The area code on the phone numbers is 215...maybe later in the game there is something? But first 3 zones are just generic industrial/suburban/urban areas.The gun customization system seemed interesting but frankly I personally find the guns to feel awful and the upgrade options uninteresting. PayDay 2 does guns sooo much better as does  - well quite frankly every single game that has weapon upgrade does it better. Not only that but there is zero reason to use the vast majority of the guns. Silenced SMG + LMG is all you need.This isn't exactly a ""bad"" game - and for $12 it's alright - but in many ways it feels like a chore to play. There is zero investment into the story.			"

												-Free WeekendMore of a ~ review than a + or - one.I have no pre-knowledge of this game.Summing the game up in two acronyms: F.P.S. A.C. Overview/Pros I finished the SP campaign on DeathWish in ~24 Hrs[You could speedrun in like 2-5hrs]. I never experienced the MP since the only time I tried was late night/early morning, so I don't know if people actually play the MP, but it seemed like something you would spend some time on.Oh, yes, I remember what I had forgotten to write about...The Moral Dilemma they push throughout the game. You have the two extremes: Doc, the pacifist, Dana, the Rebel with a cause, and a strong & wise middle ground, Jack. Whenever Doc talked about his peaceful/pacifist ways I always ended up rolling my eyes because people were dying anyway albeit in private rooms/secret rather than in public. Whenever Dana talked all I could think of was how much of a Psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥ she was that couldn't look at the bigger picture sometimes; although, of course it was justified in her eyes.There's a few interesting quirks in this game that involves the way you take over territory that is different from other games, but they quickly get old. I feel like the game would've been better off shortened by atleast one zone, but it's true that they made most of the old zones relevant throughout the game. The game is filled with cliches which I think is meant to be endearing to a majority of Americans, but comes off to me as a bit stereotypical but it is a game based on a 2nd American Revolution so...My experience was mostly negative due to 1 game breaking bug[quit to main menu to move the NPCs out of the way (Inside Job)], 2-4 instances of sound bugs, 1 CTD, but this game was in developmental hell for four years & they did release a patch to make the game better, so I gave it a thumbs up.[those long credits though]OVERALL Rating: Solid 5.5-7/10 depending on your experience Cons - Bugs- You clip through solid objects constantly throughout the game.- Friendly A.I.s are worthless.- Linear Story- The whole ""HOLD E"" game mechanic - ♥♥♥♥ off.- The save system...why?- No real consequences for killing friendlies, or civilians.- By the end, it felt like they just wanted to get it over with as did I.- Obvious plot devices[mostly cliches] & I feel like they didn't even attempt to twist it a bit.- Cheap tearjerkers that are cliche & well known within the genre. [No tears were shed]- Map of Loot Locations would've been made easier if you checked off discovered locations.- Scope Movement is so slow...wish you had an option to change it to the same scrolling speed as normal- Deathwish isn't hard, sure, you'll die, but they're mostly cheap deaths.[i.e. getting shot off your bike then proceeding to die from the annoying time-consuming game mechanic of rolling over/doing a flip? Or not getting health in time] *SPOILING the entire GAME here*  You spend 3/4 or most of the game trying to save the Revolution's supposed leader, but then Crawford, an obvious mole & narcissist, baits the Resistance with the possibility of rescuing Walker, who is already broken by the KPA[the supposed Leader], so it's a TRAP! The Resistance die by the 100's extremely weakening them, so they decide to go for the KPA's figurehead who warns them of the KPA's final solution which is promptly ignored of course and the KPA initiates a plan to kill every American alive. We then get revenge on the traitorous traitor who attempts to weasel out of responsibility & helps us figure out a way to get past the drones protecting the blimps carrying gas, but of course we're having none of that. *Slit Throat* We deploy SAMs, which would've been an excellent side-mission but it would've further tipped off the more of the plot & of course those damn NORKs have a protection plan, so we have to assault the main compound for a second time to turn them off to blow up the blimps w/ gas in them. It's time to kill off more supporting characters to advance a cliche plot...and you save the day by turning off drone control allowing SAMs to hit the blimps. *SPOILING the entire GAME here*			"

												Not a fan.  In weird ways the game is hand holdy, and in others it totally hangs you out to dry.  38 minutes before you even get to play.  In that time your character gets knocked out twice, and beaten up another. Not a very heroic beginning.  The game world is a pain to move through.  There are certain walls that I would like to walk on top of.  As the wall is 2 feet wide this does not seem to be an irrational request; however, the only interaction that I am allowed with said wall is to jump over it.  Not knowing this I jumped to my death.The rules of engagement on alarms is very buggy.  I was hidden in a building, and had broken LOS for three minutes, but the guards kept shooting me through the wall.  never hitting or doing damage.  As such I couldn't break the alarm.On the plus side the graphics, lighting, and mood are all top notch.  The story so far has been decent.  It can be hard to keep the main story straight with all the side things that pop up on your way from A to B to complete a mission.As you can see I dont' have much time in the game.  I got it on a sale, and might come back to it at some point, but for right now I just dont' have the intrest in learning the game.  Which is kinda sad because the story really looks promising			"

												Really good game i thought. It runs pretty great. The graphics and details within the world are incredible. The story while not amazing is pretty good. Surprising amount of variety in missions and how to acomplish them (not in terms of how you choose to get there more so how its set up for you to get there). The guns feel good and sound good. The game can be quite challenging at times, you are not a super hero. Damage is quite harmful in this game, so you are forced to alter your play style constantly.The game feels like playing Far Cry 3/4 but set in excellent war torn cities and towns to roam around. Its surprisingly lengthy too, if you can be bothered to find everything and capture everything for every district.Play it and make up your own mind.			"

												Background.First; to those who think that `N. Korea` is the foreign power taking over the USA in the game, it seems its actually a thinly-veiled reference to China. And you know (roughly) how many soldiers they have (and their future plans for Australia/NZ and the USA [etc...] especially if the US will not pay them back for 25 years of loans [actually, NZ will probably to to Russia (but Russia will be dealing with Europes political/Military punks as that gets crushed via the effects of the 1952 Rabbi Rabinovich plan)])? Something I commented about some 10+ years ago...Anyway, the game scenario seems set after the Kissinger`ites `whack` Trump like JFK got whacked, and this time it will bust the US and `it` will go down, maybe something like this game; Probably. Review.Anyway, this game is a mixed bag of somewhere between `Half-life` and `The Division`: and for the price I got it for here, it was a bit of a bargain. Conclusion.I waited for issues to be fixed before buying, and many seem to have been sorted; and there has been a lot of improvement since I tried the Demo, ...... but the devs could do with a `gesture` for your character, to make a few intellectually misfiring robotic helpers get out of your way.. No biggie, as `dismissing` them, makes them move usually.All in all, worth my getting in the sale.It is what it is; a game. "

												TL: 4/10 A already borderline 6/10 (maybe 6.5 on its best day) game bogged down by too many technical problems, both big and small. The original Homefront was a borderline 6/10 and very short, like 4 hours long with zero replay value, so why this game was made is a mystery because nobody asked for it.Not worth the $12 I spent on it on sale, let alone the $40 normal price which is hilarious. Pass on this unless you are super curious then wait until it is someday $5 or less which probably won't be much longer. Way too many technical problems to be enjoyable, plus it feels generic.The enemy alarm is very easily triggered and alarms do not go away unless you hide in a dumpster or portapotty. Enemies will just spawn infinitely if you don't. Load times are long so having to redo anything sucks even more because of that. Even quitting to the main menu so you can close the game takes forever. Enemy AI is programmed so poorly that they can and always will psychically pinpoint your exact location if you aren't hiding in a dumpster or portapotty. Even if you run from them and duck way back in a corner they will still run around all obstacles to exactly where you are. Sometimes enemies will flat out disappear/despawn when an alarm is over, or even as you are firing right at them. You can only take a couple bullets before you have to stick yourself with a healing needle and even though you can eventually hold up to 7 you can still go through them all in 1-2 firefights.You can do side activities in areas which are not diverse whatsoever, very few different types and very simple like turning off a propaganda radio or cutting a wire on a generator. The few that are fun are instantly dull and very repetitive. Even so, once you get to 100% citizen cooperation which is quickly, side activities become pointless. The weapon modify system works well, it's just too bad there isn't even a single second of free time to modify a weapon on the fly during a firefight since at any second enemies will run right up to you. Enemy patterns are completely random during alarms. They will run around at random so you can't even move to risk detection because it isn't worth it since enemies spawn infinitely during alarms. Character models body and mouths move like Team America puppets. The story sucks and I had no care whatsoever what was going on even far into the game. It just became an unfun slog through a sewer of farty suckage. The worst part came when I had to do a mission to take out a supervisor without being detected. I kept triggering the alarm and spent about an hour and a half on the mission until I found out through luck that it was actually a civilian npc I was supposed to kill. Even then I kept triggering the alarm because the compound was so small and enemies and cameras can spot you so quickly and easily. That's where I gave up but you should give up at the store page because once you click buy you lose.Game is balls, avoid it.			"

												I have mixed feelings about Homefront: The Revolution. On one hand, I thought it looked nice for the most part, and played like your average shooter, but at the same time the animations, and especially the mouths when speaking looked really janky. To top it off I experienced a good deal of bugs including multiple crashes to desktop. I liked the game, but I wish it worked better. I would say buy at your own risk, but do check it out if you are interested.			"

Posted: December 1, 2016
												So, let me start by saying that as of this review, I have less than 2 hours of gameplay.With that said i still feel as though i have played enough of this game to give a decent review on it, which is pretty bad if i dont even have 2 hours game time into the game.im not going to do a list of pro's and cons, instead im simply going to explain what i think this game does right and wrong.To start the wrong stuff.Right off the bat i can already tell that this game is a fake open world. i dont mean that it says open world and doesnt give you a world to explore. what i actually mean is that the world is very un populated with things to do.I will how ever say that the world is open, you can go anywhere you please, after the first quick mission.You can go capture strongholds/points, and you can do what ever you want between story missions, BUT theres very little else to do aside from capture the points of interest (POI) and story missions, you have the mission board in POI's you have taken but im pretty sure that just says go take this POI cause its a POI... TBH i havent messed with the mission board so i cant accuretly say.another thing this game does wrong is the spawning mechanic of both Friendly and enemy NPC's.I have been walking, stealthaly, along the side of a building, saw a blimp scanning for terrorists, stopped in a spot i wouldnt be seen in then a friendly npc would spawn..... RIGHT UNDER THE ♥♥♥♥ING SCANNER. luckely the friendly npc's dont set off scanners but they will aggro enemy npc's.speaking of enemy npc's tey can literally spawn right in front of, but they can also DESPAWN right in front of you... i had a sniper that i was looking at and about to shoot despawn.... while looking at him. all i could think was ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ how dare you despawn to get away from me killing you"".now i wont say that this is a bad thing, but its not good either. the game is suppose to be a stealth game..... ya know what while on stealth lets talk about how the game does it wrong. does crouching make you harder to see.... kinda.... does standing make you easier to see..... kinda.... The ""Stealth"" in this game is more or less stay off the streets in red zones and blend in with normal citizens in yellow zones. other wise you might as well scream ""HERE I AM"" at the top of your lungs in game cause the damn scanner bots and blimps in the red zones are ♥♥♥♥ing every where, and they will catch you unless you get lucky and find a good hidding spot before they can scan you.Now lets talk about the zones. you have yellow and red zones. again TBH i havent really played in a yellow zone yet only the red zone and the red zone is the hard one. so my question is why would you get forced into a red zone after only a short time in the yellow zone. the yellow zone is suppose to be a zone where you can blend in with citizens and sneak around a little easier cause the guards arent really caring what you do in those zones. but red zones, oh boy let me tell you, red zone are the warzones enemy NPC's will see you and start shooting after they confirm its you kinda like a few seconds, but enemy snipers they just shoot....Now we went over some wrong things but lets go over right things......well..... um....... weapons............... ya thats about all i can really say is good. they do weapons right, you get a pistola dn one main weapon with about 3 different things. ya things lets just go with that. you can have a pistol/smg/railgun or a crossbow/flamethrower/blunderbuss...... plus all the attachments for the guns. not a bad system but it lacks real customization for your guns.inventory is pretty bland you have like 4 throwables that can be upgraded to like what ever you want really traps or what not. and you have a flash light....graphics arent bad, but lets go back to guns or more specifically gunplay.... HORRIBLE and thats saying some.... i try to be stealthy useing the crossbow but come to find out it only really works from a medium range.... wait what, im suppose to be using this to stealth kill guys but i have to basically be in view of them to use it..... on what about a suppress pistol works better but the recoil is horendous. no pistol recoils like a ♥♥♥♥ing sniper when shot wth... and lets not even talk about being able to hit something.oh wait we went back to bad things.... i guess there really isnt a whole lot good about this game...BUT i will say this. i, for some reason, enjoy it. is it for everyone no. would i recommend it well ya i would. believe it or not even with how much the mechanics of the stealth are pretty much not there, it makes you think about what the ♥♥♥♥ your doing. you cant just skyrim your way through this, you have to stay in the building and look before you leap or run across the stream to the next building to get where you going.you have to be patient and wait for oppertunities to present themselfs, you cant just go guns blazing rambo style. im sure even with upgrades you can't. but i could be wrong on that..... either way its good at what it does, and that is making you think. it makes you parranoid and think ""♥♥♥♥♥♥the enemy could be right in front of me and i wouldn't see them till its too late"" or ""i need to stay inside till im absolutly certain no one will see me"".its not like assasins creed, or skyrim with its stealth. its more realistic then those and it really does hammer on the paranoid part of the enemies could be anywhere at any time. i mean they do ahve beter tech and more numbers then you do.overall the wrong heavily out weighs the right but i think people dont expect what this game is actually doing and for that they think of the things that happen to them like enemies spawning infront of you as a glitch but really its to make you more paranoid.the dev's of Homefront: The Revolution, i think, tried to do something that no game hase really done before, and for that i applaud them. but they could have atleast been more open about and let us know about this stuff, i guess they thought they woudlnt have to...Score out of 10 i honestly have to give it a solid 5 out of 10 and i would recommend it if you like stealth and dont mind actually trying to be stealthy.

												Before I Begin this game is a Good game and that I enjoyed it, However just like with every game it has its bugs. From the FPS drops, Changes/Confusion/Turns in the Storyline/Dialogue that where confusing, the trouble with Multiplayer & the Little to no Tie in to the First Homefront Game, where the Only problems with the game that I Found. HOWEVER the general Outline of the story, progression, Weapon customization, level design where all really good and I really enjoyed it. Yes this game has had bad Backing and Reviews so Far but the Way I look at it is the Only True Review that someone can give or the Only True feedback someone can give is YOURSELF. Everyone has their own things that they like as Everyone is Different. So Try out the game because YOU want to.			"

												Pros: Open World makes you feel like you make a differenceGun modificationLiberating areasCONS:Storyline makes no senseLinearLast Level glitch/map error makes near unwinnableRepetetiveSo.. Homefront The Revolution is a mixed bag which is why it deserves a 'mixed' review. I am going to be honest in saying that I probably like this game because of when I played the first one and how nostalgic it made me feel to play this game.Unfortunately, it felt like they did a retcon so that everything you did in Homefront 1 didn't occur. Which sucks, it was fun helping the military and seeing them in action. The fact that NORTH KOREA could do all of this to the United States is perposterious. I know they changed it from China, but going with CHina would have made it feel more real.The game play, Except for the last level, is solid and the game can be fun. The story makes no sense, and is barely logical. They create threads that they never finish - and some of the groups you see are stereotypes. I did enjoy the radio chatter as you freed different districts.. It made it feel like a real revolution as the group became more and more organized, however.Overall , It's a very mixed bag.. The game is work 30 bucks at the high end in my opinion - a solid buy at 20..  They're stealing money at 60, or even 40.			"

												*free weekend review*Played smooth, no technical issues I noticed.  Enviroments are cool, sun/night cycles on its own and weather patterns are cool for the immersion. Unfortunately, its a game that despite have never played before until now, feels like I already had. Seems like it follows the Red Faction : Guerrilla scheme of things except as a FPS.  Seemingly shoved along storyline you could easily cut through in a short time, if you didnt pay as much mind to the side missions, radiant missions, and ""find it"" progression-% items hidden in different locations.Overall its recommendable if your into the story and theme of the game. It had a rough release with technical issues, but seems to run fine now.  Again, its just a game that dose feel like its been done before after an hours worth of playing.			"

												Disclaimer: I received this for free on a free weekend. I played a couple hours of it, so in no way is it a full experience. With that aside, I very rarely actually dislike games. This is one of them and I'll explain why.As a quick summary, this game is simply broken. I'll explain more later. The only pros so far: if you enjoy Far Cry 4's capturing of locations, you'll find this here, and the visuals are really great. But otherwise: buggy, absurdly poor performance, poor scalability, mouse acceleration on with no way to turn it off besides configs, and other strange issues make it nigh unplayable. Whatever, I can fix some of that, ignore some of it, and try to play the game, right? Nope. The controls are very clunky and the psuedo-freerunning is also subject to many of the same bugs. I've gotten stuck on terrain so many times. Gunplay feels extremely awkward at best. The customization was something I was looking forward to, but after unlocking the battle rifle, AR, and LMG plus kitting them out nearly fully within an HOUR I realized there simply isn't much depth offered here. The AI is so remarkably stupid that I've discovered a trick to defeat them nearly every time. They don't know how to shoot through surfaces below them. For example: industrial iron floor grids are things you can shoot through. I captured a couple points because they did not know how to shoot through it, while I easily picked them off. They get stuck on walls, in the ground, and I've seen a couple go to the default Jesus pose. It's VERY broken. Until/if they ever fix this--this game feels pre-alpha and I am  not exaggerating when I say that it's not worth any amount of money. I didn't even pay for the bandwidth and I still kind of regret downloading it. I'd give it a 2/10, even considering the unfortunate circumstances of development. The fun just isn't really there. The only thing I can really say about it is that it's ""kind of"" functional as a tech demo. "

												Before I Begin this game is a Good game and that I enjoyed it, However just like with every game it has its bugs. From the FPS drops, Changes/Confusion/Turns in the Storyline/Dialogue that where confusing, the trouble with Multiplayer & the Little to no Tie in to the First Homefront Game, where the Only problems with the game that I Found. HOWEVER the general Outline of the story, progression, Weapon customization, level design where all really good and I really enjoyed it. Yes this game has had bad Backing and Reviews so Far but the Way I look at it is the Only True Review that someone can give or the Only True feedback someone can give is YOURSELF. Everyone has their own things that they like as Everyone is Different. So Try out the game because YOU want to.			"

												They took me for my money, make sure they don't take you for yours.  Initially came in because I thought modifying your AR lower with a different caliber upper was awesome but what I found was lack of variety in weaponry (lack of usefulness of weapons) repetitive buggy ""tasks"" to complete, and just an overall mediocre at best experience.  When one would say that the original Homefront was better, you know this game has problems.			"

												Easily one of the worst games I've played, ever. And I've played Brink.  The AI are like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children, (Running all the time, trying to run through a solid wall, talking needlessly all the time.) The game suffers from frequent frame drops, the guns feel weightless and have absolutely no character to them, the characters themselves are easily forgettable, not relatable, and serve no purpose other than to create a ""story"" which you as the player most often feel un-attatched to.  Apart from the awful gameplay and awful characters, the setting itself is alright, the usage of cryengine really allows for beautiful lighting, and very atmospheric settings.   I rate this game a 3 out of 10, for beautiful environments, but absolutely horrendous gameplay.			"

												extremely reptitive game. You will be doing the samething over and over again for each zone minus the few cinematic experinces they have in the game to progress the story. Gunplay is ok but nothing revolutionary. I personally did not find myself changing the load out of my guns at all. LOTS of bugs where if you destroy a box and not hit the generator inside or kill the boards to open a bridge but then die they will be bugged! Bugs like this have been in the game since the start and they still havent fixed it. Overall its what you expect it to be nothing that makes you say wow just another slightly above average shooter...			"

												Outside of a few framerate dips here and there the games runs fine for me. Loving the story and the gameplay reminds me of Far Cry 3 or 4. The game definitely makes you feel outmanned and outgunned. Guns are solid and responsive and modding them is a blast. All around great game to me.  Having said that because of optimization issues wait for a sale or a few patches to pick up.  8/10 from me.			"

Posted: November 23, 2016
												I was really excited when Homefront:the revolution was announced as an open world game. I didn't play the first game in the series more than a few hours for a plethora of reasons. I even waited when reviews were somewhat spotty at best on this game. This new itteration of the Homefront series has some good quirks and some bad. Let's start with the pros shall we? On the list of pros Homefront presents a somewhat large open world for you to bring freedom to. It seems to breathe, it seems to move and be legitimately animated. When I first started playing I was absorbed into the world and excited to explore it. The next pro would definitely be the weapons. Although there isn't a large variety to be had with this game, what it does let you have are a few archetypes that can be customized to your liking (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) and each of these weapons has a feeling that it is scrounged up and hastily put together for a fight with a better equipped enemy. There is also crafting of implements of destruction here as well, mostly just your run of the mill grenades, molotovs, mines... and then you also have a few cool rc bombs and drones at your disposal. I feel like these are the main things the game does really well. On the bad side however I will open up to a list of the cons. The game feels rushed , even with the patches out for it so far (6-7ish months after release). Framerat can stutter at times even on a higher end rig. There is also the problem of render distance for the ai. I've seen many times in game where enemy ai can just suddenly disappear, even while you are looking at them. As you can imagine this hinders players who like to use sniping as their main playstyle. This has even happened up close in many tight quarters firefights. Next up is the gunplay, now to me , the gunplay can seem very blocky and almost robotic feeling. It's nice to have interesting tools of the trade, but if they all feel very robotic or almost clunky to operate  that takes away part of the fun of having them. One of the final cons I'm going to touch on is the fact that the ai is very poor. The enemy ai seems to be able to predict where you are at instantaniously and almost without warning at all. They also seem to be able to hit you as soon as you start engaging them, I have very rarely been missed by an ai ever in this game. The health system does little to nothing to help this as when you are playing on the hardest difficulty , if you get hit once you're already dead pretty much. That wouldn't be a big deal if the ai weren't all competition grade shooters. Anyways, if you are looking for a fix on an insurgant like game. I suggest you pick up a game like Red Faction Guerilla instead. I had such high hopes for this game and was disappointed by what I had actually recieved.			"

												I love this game. I think its great. I can see why people are having issues running it though. I initially ran the game with maxed out settings but that got me about 30FPS. I fiddled with them a bit and have the game running a consistent 60FPS with mostly maxed settings but some turned to medium like shadows. The recommended spec is a gtx 760 and thats a joke. I have a Titan X and cant max it out. Aside from the FPS problems, I think the game is awesome. I love the ambiance and setting. It feels like a first person perspective of Division. A combo of Far Cry and Dying Light. I wish more FPS shooters went the route of open world like this game did. I highly recommend this game if you can run it. I hope they patch the problems soon.			"

												Day One Review:• After a plethora of cutscenes I was finally able to move about. To my inevitable disappointment, there was extreemely sluggish mouse movement. This comes as no surprise given that this is a port (Fairly common issue). There was apparent mouse smoothing and mouse acceleration; which I hate with a burning passion. I searched through the settings to see if I could disable it. Aparently it's incredibly difficult to provide PC players with the ability to disable these options. Since I was desperate to effectively aim I also searched through the game folder and could not find a config file of any sort.• I also experienced many texure issues. Not missing texures or anything like that, just textures protruding through other texures. I don't know if its my high standards or not, but I found the graghics to be pretty mediocre.• The optimization seems a bit bad considering wasn't getting a consistant framerate with a GTX 980 TI on ultra in 1920x1080 (I also have 16 gigs of ddr4 ram and a 4th gen intel core i7, 3.6, just in case you might think that was the issue.) All in all, after a very short play-time, I experienced multiple bugs (which is inevitable for a AAA day one release) and I would wait a bit to buy the game. Unless the above issues don't bother you, you should have a smooth playing experience, if you can even run the game... I hope this helps.			"

Homefront: The Revolution Honest ReviewFirst and foremost, I want to address the frame drop issues everyone is talking about. The only time the game has major frame drops is when you liberate a camp/outpost after it loads back into the game, or when the game loads after coming out of the weapon locker. Everytime it frame drops its during a NON CRITICAL moment, and it is only for a second and the frames catch back up and stay stable. When you are in a critical moment; IE: firefights, cutscenes, main/optional objectives, the framerate is smooth and stable. THAT is the framerate issue, it is not game breaking. DO NOT let it push you away from buying it. If you are wondering my PC specs, I have a 4790K @4.7GHz and an Overclocked GTX 980Ti @1415MHz. I am also running the game on MOSTLY high settings with 100-170FPSNow on for the review itself.GraphicsIts running on the Cryengine 3 engine, of course the graphics look great. The world is plentiful and does feel alive in the Yellow zones. The world is less dense in the Red zones, considering they are free fire zones and covilians are not allowed to be in the Red zones. You really do feel like you are in a more Apocolyptic U.S. The upside is it is open world, the downside is, the world is not very big and you do have loading screens between zones. Lighting is what you would expect in a current AAA title with dynamic lighting. Shadows are a little dissapointing unfortunately. Shadows look as if Deep Silver really said *** it with the shadows because they look like they need 100x Antialiasing. Overall, the graphics are very good, not phenominal, but very good.GameplayThe 2nd biggest reason most people look for in a AAA game. I am going to come right out and say this. If you like the way Far Cry played (Specifically Far Cry 4), you are simply going to like the way Homefront: The Revolution plays too. Open world, outpost liberation, alot of optional side missions, crafting, gathering recources, stealth mechanics, it simply plays VERY much like Far Cry 4, simple as that.Sound and VoiceThis is where the game lacks a little bit, other than the main characters and cutscenes, the voice acting in the open world is a little dissapointing making the world feel slightly off (despite what i said about the world in the graphics segment). The sound itself is satisfying. Plinking around at the KPA with a Battle Rifle sounds nice (and is satisfyingly fun :D), explosions are booming (obviously lol), the broadcasts you hear around the zones feel real, but can sometimes be repetitive. The music is good and comes on at the right times in the right way, but i recommend turning down the music in the settings before you play because if you dont, the music's volume will overpower the overall game sound. Overall, the game sounds are satisfying and immersive, which is what sound in a game's purpose is.ConclusionIn a nutshell, this review was done honestly to counter the nay sayers that are expecting a perfect to near perfect game on every release. Hence, the frame drop issue. They get frame drops in non critical spots that dont effect gameplay so they immediately pin it as a bad game and don't even play it for more than an hour or 2. Okay rant over :). The REAL conclusion is, If you enjoyed Far Cry 4, you will enjoy Homefront: The Revolution. I have 25 hours on Far Cry 4 and i already have 5+ hours on Homefront: The Revolution as of this review. Do not let the frame drop issue push you away from purchasing it. The graphics are great, the gameplay is phenominal, and the sound COULD be better but its very good for what it is. The only MAJOR gripe i have about this game are the NPC's. You cannot push an NPC out of the way if they are standing in a doorway or in a narrow path that you need to get into. The only way to get through is to back up and let the NPC walk through clearing the path. Long story short, NPC's have the right of way, ALWAYS lol.Graphics - 9/10Gameplay - 9.5/10Sound and Voice - 7/10Overall Score - 8.5/10 "

Posted: May 18, 2016
												First, I would like to say that I think all the hate for this game is a bit misplaced. To many reviewers base their reviews solely on how well the game runs. I think that it is an important factor yes, but people should review on content as well. Does the game stutter, or suffer from graphical problems. Yes. Slightly. I am used to running Fallout, skyrim, MGS:TPP, Killing Floor 2, Elite Dangerous, basically everything I own on high or max settings with 60fps. Currently I am running about 47-50fps on the ""High"" settings. There was some tearing and choppiness, but turning on V-sync helps. There are complaints about lip syncing being bad. My answer to that is, ""Have you played any video game, ever?"" I don't think I have ever seen a game with perfect lip sync, or even what I would call great. Mouths are hard to animate. Get over it. If you really care so much about lip syncing, that that kills the game for you, you need to lighten your standards. Now, IN TERMS OF ACTUAL GAME PLAY AND CONTENT!!!I would say this is definitely worth a purchase. Try it. I found the whole Koreans invading the US a bit Red-Dawn esque, but if you can get by it, the story is not half bad. I am only in about an hour or so, but everything has been pretty solid so far. MOVEMENT/GUNPLAY: Movement handles pretty much how you would expect from a CryEngine game. It can be a bit blocky. Yes, your character moves slow, but what you have to realize is that this isnt Halo or COD where you just run around and shoot people in turbo mode. You are outnumbered, outgunned, and outclassed in about every way, so moving slow is essential to make sure you dont run smack into a patrol and die.  The gunplay is crisp and rewarding, and it feels good when your bullets find their mark. I think people have gotten too used to being super soldiers, and expect too much flashy gunplay. While it doesn't suffer the ""cap gun"" feel of COD and some other games, the gun sounds could use more ""oomph"" to them. AI: While I have only had about an hour to examine the AI, I will say that I have been more impressed with other games, but that being said, I have definitely seen much worse AI, in more popular games. Have the people complaining about the AI ever played a Bethesda game, like ever??? The enemy AI seems pretty keen, and I have deliberately fired shots just to see how well their ""search"" mechanic feels, and I think it is pretty good. You definitely feel like you are being searched for, rather than the AI just going through the motions. Is it worth 60 bucks? I think so. To the rapid-fire, ADD-like, spastic pewdiepie generation, it might bee too slow for you. I am playing on the normal difficulty, and I have died several times in firefights, but never have I felt cheated or gypped. You will die after being shot a few times. Welcome to real life pal. No BS overshields, no health regen that babies you. Preparation and thoughtful execution of your objectives will give you satisfying payoffs and make you feel like you really worked to liberate that stronghold, or find those supplies. TL:DRBottom line; Don't let the negative hype decide for you. Buy it, put an hour into it, and decide for yourself. You can always refund.			"

This homefront is a HUGE IMPROVEMEMT from the FIRST HOMEFRONT!! The action in this game will have you smilling from the start to the end. I enjoyed how they made it open world and almost half the building you come across you can enter them. Pros-takes 8hours to beat (NOT INCLUDING SIDE MISSIONS)-Convert your weapons to a whole new gun-Drive bikes-Animations are done very well-Voice acting is good-Open world/ Graphics are sexy-upgrade your character and weapons-Small shops and stores to buy items-side missions-STORY IS AMAZING-Atmosphere Cons-Cant get one achievement ""Practical Mayhem""-Once you beat the game you cant go back and roam the map again-Attachments are limited per weapon  example: Ar cannot place a silencer but you can place on a rifle or pistol.-Getting away from the KPA is TOO EASY!!-Lip sync is kinda off-Bugged achievements (beating the game, upgrading weapons, killing heavy, etc) EASY FIX JUST VERIFY CACHE START GAME AND END IT AND YOU SHOULD EARN THE ACHIEVEMENTS YOU DIDNT GET IN GAME!

												The missions are not randomized. The gunplay is not awesome. The coop works better than the campaign but there are very few missions and its get to point. defend horde, move to next point, defend horde.  The graphics and the sound work are great. The game has a ton of work to be done on optimization as 90% of the users cant play it on pc on max settings on PC's that should be able to blow the game out of the water. A streamer who runs 3 Titan X's was getting 19 fps.The Coop is still the best part of the game. It is very similar to the Dragon Age Inquisition Multiplayer where you go on a mission. Do the SAME mission each time you play it. Get xp and reward. Use your earned money to buy crates that give you weapons, attachments, boosters, gear, and cosmetics. The campaign is trying to be 10 different games at once that don't blend all that well together. The driving part of the game is vomit inducing. The gunplay itself is pretty bad. It feels overly clunky and it doesnt flow well at all. On easy the mobs will fill you with bullets at times and not hurt you at all. Then the same person shooting at you will 2 shot you. It is extremely inconsistent and infuriating.  Badly designed. Chances are if a person is claiming the game is great they either have bad taste, or are a hipster and like going against the grain. I will have a full review at a later date for this game on www.TheDrastikMeasure.com but at this time the game is soooo bad I can't play it in it's current state. Devs have to know the game was bad right? What is the thought process of releasing the game anyway ? The devs of the game even knew it was bad because in the credits they apologize for it and comment on it's troubled development. Was Deep Silver not willing to shell out more funding to help fix the title? Instead hey they IP will sell itself, lets rob our community ? I would love to know the thought process and inner workings of this game, the publisher and developer relationship.			"

												You know what... i think i perfer the last homefront game......................and the gameplay , well it's a Farcry 3 clone and looks nowhere near as good. The story is ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥too and its broken as ♥♥♥♥. Could it be good when they fix it?...no i can't. pro'sit passes the timeconsrubbish storya half arsed Farcry 3 gameplayunfinshed level design. yes thats right. i saw floating signs without any poles missing walls with half the terrain missing on the other side and a few missing textures. Floating people yep this is like a bad early access game.stiff face animations sometimes it like watch a badly acted emotionless b movieThe background crowd voices are on a loop so they will eventually drive you ♥♥♥♥ing crazy.This is probably the worst released game i've played since X-rebirth.

												This game has some beautiful graphics but the game is literally broken! Bugs from armored cars floating in the sky to armored cars driving while being upside down. Another bug Made a new a game and some how got spawned on the last level checkpoint. Achievements that i have not completed are unlocking from doing nothing. The voice acting is on point! and the weapon conversion is pretty dope along with adding attachments!			"

												After putting in some hours, I have to admit this is a really interesting game. You can not compare this to the first one, since you are on the east coast this time. I do not know where in the time line this is, but if i had to guess, its a bit more in the future by maybe 2-5 years since some of the units like the drone tanks have a different apperance.The game play is like Farcry, but in a more realistic setup, so no magic tattos or trible stuff. The weapons are very interesting, since my battle rifle can turn into a rocket launcher, or my crossbow into a flamethrower. Now I have 6 hours in, but I have only 100%'ed the first 2 zones. The story is engaging, and have the ability to instill riots (like zone 2) or able to recruit fighters to help....its pretty fun.So far I have not noticed frame rate issues, of course i'm playing around the middle on graphics..which still looks nice. Sometimes the A.I can be dumb, but hey I've seen worse. I would recommend it for the price, however I have not played co-op, only the storyline so far, and from what I have played, I could see it being around 30 hours of game time for the SP alone.			"

												I dont get why it has so many negative reviews, this game has almost everything Crysis 2-3, Far Cry 3-4, Dying Light, Metro, Division, MGSV, Call of Duty, Deus Ex Human Revolution and Mankind Devided and other games like this has and in many terms this game is much better than most of what i just listed, its quite realistic and mostly immersive (execept for UI and hihghlighting that breakes immersion), it has body awareness it has cool atmosphere which reminded me surprisingly Terminator, it has Koreans just like Crysis 1, execpt no nanosuit this time, and mostly it has core mechanics from Crysis which was and still as above most of FPS games in terms of game design. Basically this is Crytek game, that was sold a little bit unfinished and was finished by Deep Silver, and i bet if name of developer was still Crytek this game would get much higher scores, and if it was A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME, everyone would give it a 10 or 20 of 10 just because of name or just because some critics said so, but in fact this game is way better than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MGSV, yet its score is lower, how the ♥♥♥♥ is this even possible?While crytek's Crysis (and despite different name, you can pretty much consider this game a Crysis 4 without nanosuit and aliens, but with good old Koreans, it has all the *CRY DNA in it) game has some difference to Ubisofts approach to crytek's legacy Far Cry, this game is pretty much similar to recent Ubisoft CRY games, its not worse at least, and average score of Far Cry 3-4 is about 7-8 of 10, which means that if people will start judging this game with their brains and not with reflective emotion like (OMG MY GAME CRASHES! -100 of 10! Found few minor bugs, -10 of 10! Has turned everything to ultra on my 5 years old unpotimised PC and game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ and desptie it has one of the best graphics and despite im dumb enough to try to disable heavy settings like SSAA its -10 - 10! and more dumb negative reviewes like this) this game cant have a score bellow 7 of 10 in worst case.And i personally think it should has scores higher than MGSV, DXHR and DXMD, any Call of Duty, Crysis 2-3,  Division, and other somewhat similar open world games and should have score nearly equal to Far Cry 3-4 and Dying Light, because these 3 are the closes matches to Homefront 2 (while 1 was just a plain Call of Duty clone) and this game has mostly same gameplay features and production values and overall quallity.Yes, game is not perfect, there are some technical flaws that require extra polishing, some bad design decisions that require some changes (like ui customisation that dont break gameplay and allows to turn off more things separated to each other, fov slider that goes to at least 75, separate sliders for vertical and horisontal gamepad sensitivty, and deadzone, plus abilityu to rebind gamepad buttons freely or DECRYPTED CONFIG WITH BUTTON MAPPINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY EDIT!, unlocked developer console - CryEngine Editor and workshop support for single and coop, ability to turn off highlight of interactive items, fully immersive phone mode that will show all menues in real time and in phone instead of going fullscreen, and some improvements to stealth to make it more realistic and challenging), but it does not make this game bad - it makes it not perfect, but its still good enough to enjoy its core, even if some details are flawed and frustrating, This game honestly deserves 7 of 10 at this current state, if they will fix gameplay bugs and will improve some bad design decitions or will introduce some positive changes or alternate modes for more hardcore, immersive and realistic type of players, i think this game would deserve even a 8 of 10.ALso im thankful for free weekend that allowed me to judge this game and for good discount of 40% that makes this game worth buying without regret. I can understand that at launch some people was frustrated because they paid full price and game was badly optimized and had crashes and other major bugs, but right now most critical issues are fixed and people can finally enjoy game, which is good, even despite some flaws still need to be fixed. Just dont judge this game with emotions, use your brain and look at complex gameplay system, atmosphere, imnmersion, a lot of well designed features, very good graphics, good music, simple but suitable story, which is not very important in this game since its more or less simulator of resistant movement and story here only exist to glue simulation sequences together, its should not be cinematic as much as you blockbusters like Call of Duty, real life is not that enterntaining, and this games aims to reflect real life closer than you typical blockbuster games.Oh, and it has quite intensive and enjoyable Co-op which is like stand alone game of Left 4 Dead kind, with Koreans instead of Zombies and has great replay value!

												Whilst this game has had very mixed press and user feedback I can honestly say that i am thoroughly enjoying it.  The mix of stealth with run and gun keeps me wanting to push on through the missions, regardless of how unlikely the plotline is.  Having read lots of poor feedback on the game and lack of mission variety i can honestly say that i have found the game to be as enjoyable as i found Far Cry 3  and Assassins Creed.  Yes it still has issues, most noticeably around the spawn in and out of enemies which can be random and which do affect continuity at times.  Having said that i would not say that this in any way detracts from the playability of the game and with the weapon variety you will find lots of ways to push through the KPA checkpoints,   THe graphics and feel of the Philadelphia setting and oppressing actions of the KPA are a great feature and I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FC3's of this world.Yes it has bugs, yes it can sometimes drop frames but on a GT970 and i7 i am seeing 55 - 60 fps consistently and really enjoying it.My advice:  if you are looking for a polished AAA shooter then go buy Doom.  If however you want something a bit less mindless (and challenging) then you could do a hell of a lot worse than play Homefront The Revolution. "

												Amazing game. The developer is really supportive and transparent about fixes to its customers.I have not completed it yet but, I have really enjoyed this game. I think it is a awesome story with some really cool concepts on the future of America in captivity. This is a perfect sequel to the original Homefront by THQ. Some things that would be awesome. 1. 30 fps lock built in 2. If the screen on the phone was a little bit easier to see, slightly more seamless from map to other settings and back to game play. 3. The recoil on the guns needs to be scaled back slightly. Without auto aiming enabled its a struggle to hit your targets. Other than that it is on the top shelf of my library.			"

 Bouncing Bombs Rarely Hit Target During WW2Unoptimised piece of garbage with dated graphics about sums it up...Make sure you have a beefy system as there is no SLI support for this game but never mind that, just do not waste your money. The game starts off promising then.... well... it just all falls appart from there.I should have listened to the negative reviews but the game looked ok to me I was expecting a 7/10 experience and what I got is barley a 2/10. One second your FPS will be up in the 90s next second it crawls at 15fps and back up to 60 then 90, its a bit of a joke...I am not going to wast my time and your time reviewing this game more in depth, I merely want you to save your cash for a game that developers actually care about.Breakdown:I gave up before even reaching 1 hour of gameplay, it is that bad but:Story: Not going to score it, cant stop laughingMusic: Terrible, was it made on a Casio HT700?Gameplay: 4/10 Clunky moment, terrible gun mechanics, AI all over the place geez u get the drift.Re-playability: hahahahhahahahahaGraphics: Imagine the best PS2 FPS game getting HD graphics and your pretty close... In conclusion:My conscience is clear now I have been able to warn you guys away from this trash :DUPDATE: It was only fair I update this review after a patch was released yesturday, I played for another 20mins or so and with that I was compelled to UNINSTAL THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE.... mess of a game. Shame on the developers releasing this unfinished game, it should not be allowed, people pay money for a finished product, sure we are lenient, nothing is released perfect, but this is borderline false trade description to mislead the public into buying it. Maybe they had no choice to release it, maybe their budget ran out, but that should not be made the consumers problem. I hope the guys at Dambusters are able to find work after this massive mammoth of a misstep because I would not hire any of them, well that's not true, the guy that made the artwork deserves a job....They should have named the game HOMEFRONT DAMBUSTERS DEMISE.... then again bouncing bombs rarely hit target during WW2 and that should have been my first warning prior to buying the game....

												This game is severely under-rated, its URBAN FAR CRY!I decided to give it a try since I saw mixed reviews for Far Cry Primal, AC and many other good games lately. I can't believe it has a 52 metacritic rating! We seem to be spoiled these days. If we keep ragging on good stuff, it won't sell and they won't be able to make more and improve upon them. Very nice open world, stealth, shooter.  To compare it, its a mix of Far Cry, Battlefield Hardline and Dying Light.PRO'S+Graphics+Story+Stealth-Bugs+Glitches, unable to skip cutscenes if already saw but died before next auto-save. Some mentioned lag, I have a ok gaming pc and no issues, maybe they were fixed shortly after release.-No manual save system.-I heard that at the end you can't finish off liberating areas and it ends possibly not saving your equipment and progress so do side missions during the campaign....now time to rise up and revolt!

												My personal opinion is that i like this game, at the beginning it didn't seem very exciting and i have to admit it got a little bit boring but from halfway throughout the story i enjoyed it.Ingame there are very cool options like transforming your assault rifle into an LMG, your pistol into a submachinegun, etc. Driving is not that bad but it's not the greatest, map is big but objectives and missions aren't very far and the max. time that you'll need to ""run"" to them is probably 2 minutes. Other than that graphics are fantastic and story can be nice and immersive if you pay attention to notes and other random stuff that you get by exploring.Performance is not great, with my setup i have huge fps gaps that go from 110 to 30 but NEVER under 30. I thought about it and i recommend it.Until half story i would give 5/10From halfway to the end and even after 7/10			"

												Okay massive fan of the first Homefront it had flaws but the campaign just clicked with me cheesy 80's throw back story arcadey fps loved it. The sequel oh wow so much wasted potential, first off if you were hoping to pick up at the end of Homefront nope ignores it completely. Combat wise well it's an fps you point you shoot enemies die. It does not have deep mechanics but it does have a pretty good weapon customization design. You can basically turn any of the 6/7 main types of gun into three other weapons for example the pistol can be converted to an SMG and to a silcenced single shot pistol etc. The AI is pretty basic playing on Normal difficulty they seem to run straight at you or just past you in an attempt to get to cover, though it is fairly easy to get overwhelmed in the more combat intensive red zones. The main story campaign is okay not as interesting as the first homefront story at least to me, the open world sections feel like massive padding you do the same two or three types of side mission 6/7 times you free a zone and then you move onto the next one for a total of 12 zones I am currently slogging my way through zone 6 i think at this point I doubt I will finish it. Bottom line if you want to give it a try wait for a steam sale, or a free weekend because i have a feeling the way multi player is dropping off a free event cannot be too far behind.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is an unfortunate case of the whole being less than its parts. It’s clear there were a number of unique ideas being bandied about during the development of this game, and there’s certainly shadows of those ideas in the full release, but its “me too” design fails to come together in any meaningful way. As a complete package, it struggles on many levels to deliver, chiefly, the story and gameplay. With time, many of the bugs should be fixed, and who knows, maybe the DLC offered post-release might improve on the story. At the moment, from former Free Radical developers, Homefront: The Revolution is nothing less than a disappointing, if not outright terrible game.			"

												I was reminded of this game about 12 hours before it came out. I purchased in haste after reading a brief overview of the Game, and as soon as I saw ""Crytek Engine"" I made my purchase. I regret that decision. It's not the worst game in the world, but the fact they are charging $60 for this unfinished, buggy title is a bit dissapointing. Graphically, not terrible, but it performs poorly even on sufficient hardware. They are supposedly supposed to improve this with upcoming patches, if so then this game is not bad in the Graphics department, but a lot of Texture work is subpar. You can tell they cut a lot of corners on this to get it out there. Lighting and overall ""look"" still trump CoD IMO, which still looks like the first Modern Warfare with better Textures and lighting. That series also suffers from performance issues. Gameplay is very basic. A lot of control point missions, nothing fancy. AI isn't great. In the end you basically run around shooting stuff, taking over bases. If that's enough to keep you occupied then you aren't going to find much else to do. It's the same stuff they've been putting out for 10+ years. Also, there's 1 vehicle, and it's a Dirt Bike. Nothing special, it gets you from Point A to Point B.I'm not going to hold a grudge against the Developers, as they were put in a crappy situation. They may still redeem themselves with future Addons\Updates, but at this time I can't recommend this game at it's current price point. I just purchased the Original Ghost Recon Series for $10 on sale and I will probably get a lot more play time from those games. -Justin "

												Quick Review:Pros-Plays a bit like Farcry 3-4( if you like those games)-A nice weapon customization -Good Graphics-okay to decent gun fights-A.I actually hunts you down for once in a game and not for 20 seconds or so-The best easter egg you will ever see and useCons-First part of the game has bad fps i hit around 35-45fps on high settings. but then after a bit goes to the 60fps-not fully open world like Farcry and other open world games. but still big maps-A.I which you have asked can block the way this has happened about 3-4 times atm ( only way to solve issues is to kill them or wait a bit and push out of the location works every time for me)-CANT DESTROY THEM SHIPS WITH ANYTHING-no multiplayer or other game modes( i know it has co-op for set missions but a survival or co-op for campaign would be good)-Story should be better-bug in the 2x supersample ( change to 1x and runs fine)5-6/10 not worth the cash amount now wait abit if you wanna get or get it, its up to you.Balanced reviewWell, We are all quick to point the finger. But this games development was not a simple A to B as it were. The game went all over the shop, loss of funding and time wasted. Am sure if it went from A to B then this game would actually be alot better.Gameplay is similar to far 3 and 4, + crysis games. But you take alot more damage.You will die alot till you get used to the game.A.I is actually difficult in some spots and in certain zones always think twice.(AI can hunt you down which is nice for once)The cry engine again shows good graphics.Weapon customization on the go is good and crafting (If only you could craft a dam health kit)The first part the performance is not great even with the settings on high i was getting 35-45fps. after 2mins after that i get 58-60s+ on high settings. There is some windows that you have trouble entering which is annoying. But you get that with mosts games. I am playing on medium difficulty at the moment and still the A.I fights of friendly and enemies are for the most part ok. Some areas are bad they do little damage to each other, other times the A.I are just insane. e.g A friendly A.I takes out a patrol and a car then some reason follows you around( i Didn't ask it to)  Darn that A.I survived a long time and i died less times because of it.Maps are big but fails to deliver the full open world exp of a much larger map then sections.The bike can be annoying at times. but just get use to itNo change to the gameplay as it progresses or change to the phone thingy taskI encounted not many problems throughout playing this game, ok theres certain places are better then others. but no harmfull bug's stopping gameplay or missions. just my poor skills at being stealth.Changing keys works fine for me no problems and i swopped wasd for tfgh to try it out for a bit.last this thing, one of the best easter eggs i have ever come across.and works fine.

												No I did not play this for long. I love the graphics, the setting, the kinda feeling. I love hiding in buildings from a scanning airship and drones flying around. I love the weapons, the swapping system, even the liberation and I adore the melee kills.But then it does some things wrong, the story which I can look past, is dull and to easy to ignore since it doesn't really pull you in. The performance which again I can look past is horrible, The one thing I just couldn't stand, the one thing i couldn't do was the gameplay. The way the game played, it's just such a simple shooter. I was hoping for more depth, cover systems, refined squad tactics. Maybe I play too many simulators but I stopped playing COD for a reason and this game is why.If you want is a generic shooter to kill time then please by all means get it, but please not for more than $20 it just is not worth more than that.My performance so you can benchmark yours too mine:I hovered around 40-60FPS, 60 only in silent closed spaces with almost nothing around. While in a intense place I saw my FPS drop to 30's though this was uncommon, it usually averaged at around 40-45FPS.My Specs for comparison:Gigabyte R.990FXA-UD5 R5 MoboHyperX Fury Black 16Gig DDR3 1866Mhz RAMAsus GeForce GTX 1060 ROG STRIX OC 6GigAMD FX-8370 8-core CPU overclocked to 4.8GHzI hope this helps someone decide to get it or not. I personally did not enjoy my time. I even uploaded my time with it to YouTube.			"

An unplayable, stuttering, piece of you know what.To be honest, no matter how I enjoyed the world, like the idea of revolution, being not able to play the game smoothly pushes me away.This review will stay negative until I can manage to play the game the way my rig and I deserve.Anyway, what did we learn today again? We should not take anything from strangers as our mothers always say.Well done for a first timer dambuster studios, keep up the good work!			"

												To be honest at the beggining I didn't like the game (""At the beggining"" I mean when game has its first trailer). My friend showed me that game, and for me it was kinda boring shooter with boring story etc. Now, I look forward to play the first Homefront game. But let's get back to Homefront: The Revolution. For me this game has great actors, I was able to feel their desire for revolution and making US again independent, I was able to hear this in their voices. Story is great for me, it's not perfect but is great. Characters are well-written, I really liked their character and how they act (Especially Dana). Gameplay, I'm kinda sad because there weren't any stealth options only when the quest (I think we can call it the quest) was telling you to be quiet and stealthy, I couldn't approach that part of story without getting detected or I didn't see that opportunity, well if I am wrong then sorry, what more we had points to capture and capturing those was hell a lot of fun ! Some were tricky and game forced you to actually think how to get the certain area.I think that's all I can say. I'd like to give this game 9/10 because it's sometimes repetitive and buggy, but c'mon there's no a perfect game.			"

												This game was a bit of a mixed.  To start off, I think after a few more updates this would be much more playable.   Even at a discounted price though, it would be hard to suggest this game, ultimately.  But, I'll take this step by step from here.Graphics:This was really where it was kind of all over the place.  I actually expected better from the fact that this is a CryEngine game.  Some character models were fantastic with really great animations.  Unfortunately, I don't feel like they put a lot of work into characters you don't see in cut scenes.  The people on the street were mostly Ok, but I think there is only a few character models and they are simply reused them all the time.  The world itself suffered from being all over the place.  The buildings looked good, and when you are in destroy section of Philly, you can mostly go into them and find little nooks of items.  But surrounding that may be a terrible looking pile or rubble.  I can't help but feel that if everything is going to be trashed, it's actually significantly harder to pull off.  The enemy soldiers were at best, only OK.  Some of the armored one's were really cool looking, but there is one part of the city where you basically only see guys in full hazard suits with just a repaint between silver and yellow.  The enemy vehicles looked really cool in my opinion, but there were 3 different versions of them in the whole game.  There was this lighting effect where when you were in a dark room the lit doorway would be so bright you couldn't really see through it, and conversely when you were standing in the light you couldn't really see what was going inside dark areas.  It was an especially nice tough, like this is something the developers really thought about.  There is also a nice effect as your visions adjusts to the light/dark area you were entering.  Sound:The gun sounds were really not very stimulating.  I didn't feel bad♥♥♥♥♥when shooting any of them.  It's weird when you pull a rocket launcher out of nowhere, shoot it, blow up an enemy Humvee and you are like, ""eh, at least I don't have to worry about that anymore.  The enemy sounds were sparse.  For instance, when you are near a guy with a shotgun, it makes the same yell from every single enemy shotgunner.  Most of the guys didn't talk unless you were really close and then they all basically had the same voice. The ambient world sounds were a nice attempt, but it felt like the sound designer didn't know how to make the other inhabitants of Philly sound the same.  Sometimes there were 5 people around and their was conversaion sound that sounded more like 25 people.  Sometimes there were 25 people and it sounded like a group of 4 guys were standing around and just talking.  Other things include just sounds that were completely out of place, like they were just trying to fill an empty void with anything.  I would be running past something and I would just hear a beep, like I had just found something to interact with but there was nothing there.  I started by searching around for where the beep came from and it would be some unmanned empty console with a million buttons and nothing to interact with.The music and the voice acting was the best part of the sound design.  The voice actors did a fine job on what was clearly a lack luster script.  They put their all into it and it really sounds good most of the time.  Sometimes there were periods where you would be doing something and some epic music would start, and other times there wouldn't be music.  But those points it felt appropriate to be listening the ambient sounds of the world.  In a nice secion of city you would see people running around, you would hear birds.Gunplay:Besides the off sound, the game offered an interesting collection of firearms.  Each one felt a bit different, but to me it felt like they were different for the sake of being differing.  For instance, you can get crossbow that can be alterd to be a flamethrower or a blunderbuss (of all things).  The shotgun can be modified into an automatic shotgun or a gun that basically shoots molitov cocktails.  The rub is, you can only carry 3.  That wouldn't be so bad but you were basically only allowed to select 2 becaues your one slot was locked into a handgun.  Now, that handgun can basically become an uzi, which is nice, especially with a silencer and a decent medium range scope.  But that leaves you with 2 to play with.  The third slot gets unlocked a little further into the second area and that is your RPG.  You can swap it out, but you never know when you will find a humvee or a goliath, so you will probably never remove that.  That leaves you functionally with one spot.  The issue here is that you might as well just take a sniper rifle.  The handgun you are stuck with become an SMG, you don't want to get caught fighting vehicle without rockets, and the city is over run with snipers.  At the end of the game I took the automatic shotgun because it was only then that I realized how incredibly OP it is.  Vehicle?  No problem, unload a barrel into most vehicles and you destroy them.  Ammo can be found on every enemy corpse and you get it in spades and it's always for weapons you have equipped.  Progression:This part of the game feels completely unfinishd and hackneyed.  So, each part of the city, after you complete the obligatory Hearts and Minds quest, you basically go around and can capture enemy points (kind of like capturing a camp in the Farcry 3/4).  There are points you are clearly meant to capture first.  These are your strikepoint, they basically weaken the enemy enough for you to capture some of the more strategic points.  These net you KPA tech points.  Initially, these are used to unlock upgrades and options for your guns.  This is where it gets weird for me.  You use money to purchase guns, then you use KPA tech points to unlock the gun upgrades, and each gun and it's constituent upgrades can be upgraded up to 3/3 stars... which you use money for.  You basically use those tech point to simply unlock the guns and nothing else   I captured every single point in every single part of the city.  I had unlocked all the guns rather early.  By the end of the game I had 130 KPA tech points that were useless  Each thing I capture and even portions of the Hearts and Minds quest gives them to you.  But I think the most expensive one was actually only... 16 KPA tech points maybe.  Literally everything else cost money which you struggle to find.  At the end though, it feels like the developers knew they messed up the balance and started throwing money at me like there was no tomorrow.  You also use money for all your weapon attachments and gear with act as character progression.  It ultimately felt useless to upgrade anything.  Sure, you can carry a bit more ammo, you can run a bit faster and take a bit more damage, but you still feel the same as when you began, all that matters is the guns.  So, the progression part is a failure in my opinion.  The KPA tech points feel useless though, as if there was going to be more for them and they just stopped.  At least maybe if they had let me choose between money and tech points for each upgrade, that would have felt more worth while.			"

At the end though, it feels like the developers knew they messed up the balance and started throwing money at me like there was no tomorrow.  You also use money for all your weapon attachments and gear with act as character progression.  It ultimately felt useless to upgrade anything.  Sure, you can carry a bit more ammo, you can run a bit faster and take a bit more damage, but you still feel the same as when you began, all that matters is the guns.  So, the progression part is a failure in my opinion.  The KPA tech points feel useless though, as if there was going to be more for them and they just stopped.  At least maybe if they had let me choose between money and tech points for each upgrade, that would have felt more worth while.			"

												really enjoyed the game.it really is a shame it was released in this state still very playable for me.only 1 bug that actually stopped anything and it hindered nothing really.but with all its flaws i would still purchase it all over again.the characters were good,voice acting done very well,gameplay fun,weapons and mechanics worked very well,nice graphics,story was very good.im sure once the bugs are worked out and some time has past, the unfair reviews have faded from memory this game will get some recognition that it deserves.i for one am glad they managed to still get this game finished against all odds and look forward to the DLC and their next project.for what its worth great job guys keep your heads high.

												The Revolution has been designed as an amazing sandbox with complex modifying weapon systems and a strong sense of guerrilla warfare. Despite some quirks, every FPS fan can stand in line along with Kim Jong-un to gather this competently crafted first person shooter. The Revolution isn't the disaster many would have anticipated, and it gets a lot right.I'm sad to see this reviewed so poorly, I got an early copy from a mom and pop shop last Friday and have been hooked ever since. It feels like a blend between Classic FPS games like Frontlines fuels of war, an urban set Far Cry, and Starbreeze titles like Darkness, Riddick, and Syndicate. Loud guns, brutal melee, and the ability to stealth everything. If you were at all interested in this game I highly recommend giving it a chance, most reviewers were probably expecting COD or something but this game offers something different. Graphics look great as well, at times look straight photo real. Another hidden gem For old school FPS fans. The game, designed with cryengine, looks amazing and the details put into every small inch are amazing.			"

												I'm a huge fan of this genre and was really looking forward to this game since the latest Far Cry was so far from the norm. However, even after the latest patch there are too many issues remaining. The problem is that you can patch in efficiency and remove bugs. It's a lot harder to get rid of fundamental concepts. I don't feel like I'm playing a Freedom Fighter Fantasy, because it is way too easy to die, and there is very little you can do to get better gear that will prevent that. It's not a stealth action game either, it has basic don't go where it's obvious that you shouldn't unless you want a very lopsided fight. And it's not a Live, Die, Repeat game (though you do that a lot), since randomized patrols mean that you cannot plot the perfect course to avoid detection and kill everyone ala Tom Cruise.:(			"

												One hour into the campaign and three hours into the multiplayer and I don't want to bother giving this game a better chance with what I've experienced so far.With a laughable open world, sub-par texturing, bad optimization, and animations that are like moving furniture; Homefront falls well below most anything Deep Silver had anything to do with.I'm finding myself questioning why I've bothered giving the game a chance as much as I question the refund system that let my friend successfully refund this game, despite being as many hours into it as me, and myself not getting the refund.Oh; and can we talk about what a laugh the multiplayer is? I understand Homefront is primarily a single player experience, but with how bad the multiplayer is; there was no point in even including it.It massively lacks any sort of content or progression. After the few hours I've played, I've already unlocked a majority of the weapons and a good chunk of any items to affect combat. The talent trees lack depth and the only real fun thing to pick up are cosmetic items; which can hardly hold a dry multiplayer scene with a couple maps down.If I wanted to collect cosmetic rewards all day, I'll at least do it in a more captivating and rewarding gaming experience like Overwatch.

												Meh. If I didn't have anything else to play, I'd say it's ok. But fortunately I do have other games. I don't really feel the atmosphere of occupation/resistance fighting, I'm not immersed, I don't like the design of the open world. Gunplay is not the best, stealth sucks and overall gameplay feels rather clunky and unpolished. Missions aren't overly creative nor fun. The characters aren't particularly engaging and the MC is completely mute, which sucks outside of Half-Life games. Oh, and it's sorta buggy, settings don't save at all (getting correct resolution, texture quality and so on took me good half an hour or more, and involved using some workarounds). Well, at least the visuals are nice, though I find everything about design tired, the uniforms, the vehicles, the drones, the metal outposts.It's not an entirely bad game, just not a very good one either. Doesn't feel like an AAA title which it strives to be.			"

												Homefront has all the right ideas, a story, large open world, different mechanics it all seems good. However the execution of these ideas leads to one of the worst games ive play while having the ideas I love. Its story falls short on importance, its open world suffers from buggy gameplay with far to few weapons and equipment. The A.I are a joke, friends cant hit anything and enemies kill you with no real notification that you are being shot. It reall is a shame considering how cool the games ideas are. Taking back a city from occupying DRNK forces block by block. With all these issues the multiplayer also has some great ideas, of outfitting a soldier and upgrading their gear and equipment how you see fit. With a backstory that acts like a perk, i can understand the direction. Again its poor execution, long load times, limited amounts of missions, and barely anyone to play with. Good try Deepsilver good try.			"

												I loved the first Homefront.  This sequel is a shameful attempt at continuing the series.I've barely played it in co-op and I can already tell it suffers from some of the telltale signs of a bad game such as:-Even on Easy it's too hard (you die in a few shots, that's not easy)-VoIP with no push to talk is enabled on by default-Generic menu that looks like a Call of Duty/F2P ripoff/clone.-Generic Mission-Style coop system-Dropping my coop partner and I into combat not 5 seconds after the mission began (no time to take in mission objective or surroundings)-Guns using generic sound effects instead of the unique ones that the first Homefront presentedI suppose it's not horrible, it's just same old same old with a lot of problems.  Meh.  It's a really poor follow up to the original game. "

												Was toying with the idea of picking this up, and the free weekend was my chance to see if it lived up to the high standards set by the first game. It didn't.The game seems to be a reboot of the Homefront series, rather than a sequel. In the first game, the North Koreans overpowered South Korea, then Japan, and allied with China to invade the US. In this game, North Korea is portrayed as affluent and technologically advanced, allowing them to invade America after the US defaults on a loan. Seeing as N. Korea has something like the 3rd largest standing army in the world, the first scenario seems much more likely and realistic to me.I see a lot of people throwing around the word ""unplayable"" on Steam recently, but by and large, I think people are overreacting. This game isn't glitchy and bug-ridden to the point of being unplayable, just unenjoyable. Many times, I would enter a safehouse without the game registering that I had entered a safehouse. This means I could still fire my weapon, even killing everyone inside, often without my allies' weapons even loading into their hands.The AI is honestly some of the worst I've ever seen in a modern game. Countless times I have mowed down a KPA soldier, with his buddies standing not 10 feet away, with no reaction from them. Other times, specifically in yellow zones, I've been on the run from the KPA, and I've made a single turn, or hid behind something directly in the KPA's path, and they've simply given up the chase.I know a lot of people who really want to like this game (and believe me, I REALLY wanted to love it) will look at my almost 4 hours playtime and think ""that's not enough to judge this game by"", and it kills me to say that it really is. Within 3.7 hours, I bought every gun and upgrade, with only a handful of the game's districts unlocked. This game truly has nothing else to offer me, aside from buggy character animations, a truly broken spawn system, and a drab, uninspired story. I've played games that are much, much worse. But for the reduced price of $24, you could certainly do much better.Thanks for the free weekend, Homefront, but no thanks.			"

												As someone who had gone into this knowing that it was riddled with bugs, I was pleasantly suprised by what I got. While some of the characters felt shallow and underdeveloped, and a few (painful at times) minigames, and amount of guns left me wanting, I still found a game with great gunplay, amazing setting, clearly dedicated developers, fantastic level design, and more things then I can list. The soundtrack admittedly could've been much better and varied, but all things cnsidered, this is a prime example of devs listening to what fans had to say, taking it to heart, and actually using it. I rate it a strong 8 to a weak 9 out of ten.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is a mixed bag, but I think it ultimately prevails as an above average open world FPS. I played this game a good bit through its free weekend, and I enjoyed it. There's many reasons why its a mixed bag, so lets get to those reasons, shall we?PositivesThe best thing this game pulls off with flying colors is its visuals. The open world of this abused rundown urban city you explore looks great. There's lots of detail everywhere. There's also a great urban apocalypase art style, especially in the Resistance. Paired with the game's fantastic Cryengine graphics, it's a glorious looking game. Its heavy hopelessness feeling atmosphere is also great. It's fun to climb to a high point and look at the view. The art and graphics team kicked♥♥♥♥♥ There's great weapon customization. Different guns can be taken apart and swapped to transform into different guns. You can transform your assault rifle to a LMG with the hit of just two buttons, so you basically carry 6 guns when you're only carrying 2. You can carry up to two primary weapons and a pistol. That's 9 weapons you carry around, which is crazy, and it's unique how they pull it off. This is complimented by the ability to add attachments like sights, underbarrel stuff like grips and lasers, and muzzle brakes. Sadly, there's no weapon camos (as far as I know). Running around in the world is fun. You can climb up buildings if you can reach the ledges, and there's these big airships that beam down scanners that scan for Resistance soliders like you, so if one gets close, you have to dive for the nearest building and hide for them, which is pretty cool. You can also sneak past the numerous KPA patrols in Red Zones, or get immersed by blending into the civilian population in Yellow Zones. Yellow Zones is one of the best parts of the game. You have to sneakily sabatoge stuff like speakers, and save prisoners from the KPA. Eventually, the civilian population will join you in fighting back, and soon the whole Yellow Zone will be a big riot. This system is really awesome, and one of the most cool things you can do in this game.NegativesThe game is demanding. This might not be a legit negative thing, as it happens with these new titles, but it alienates people with low end machines. I know it isn't unoptimized, as my GPU is always at 95%-99% in GPU-Z, which means it's being pushed as hard as it can. My 960 4GB runs this game as a mix of Med-High with 2x SMAA at 40-60 FPS, which isn't too bad. The AI is pretty bad. They'll take cover behind a piece of cover two feet in front of you instead of fighting back, so you can take 3 steps and shoot their head. They also sprint towards you out in the open like a bunch of morons, and will also react to you slowly if you walk around the corner and surprise them. The game can also get repetitive. You go to an area, maybe kill some KPA, liberate it, and then do it all over again. This doesn't bother me, as I enjoy this kind of formula, but for people that don't like repeating the same process over and over in a video game, you might get annoyed and you'll lose any enjoyment. Although they have such a great weapon customization engine, they make one huge glaring mistake. You can't silence assault rifles and snipers. You can only silence pistols and SMGs. WHY? I was hoping to be this badass Sam Fisher kind of character with silenced weapons, but I can't do that. Why can't I silence my primary weapons? That's so stupid. There's also not much variety in weapons. There's one assault rifle, one marksman rifle, one pistol (well, two if you count the dart shooting pistol), etc. So everyone's gun looks exactly the same, which is pretty bland. It's also pretty buggy. I notice a lot of clipping, audio glitches like pausing the game and unpausing can sometimes just kill the voices of the guy that's talking to you, and just weird stuff like a low textured iron sight floating in mid air after I changed my sight one time.SummaryHomefront: The Revolution is a mixed bag, but an enjoyable mixed bag in my opinion. It's a beautiful looking game that's fun to roam around, sniping KPA for torn down buildings. I enjoyed the time I had to play it during the free weekend it had. If I can find it for around $15-$20, I might end up getting it eventually. Also, most of the negative reviews are trash, simply saying ""Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't buy it."" I HATE reviews like that because they don't tell you why it's bad. There's also some saying it's the worst game of 2016 or even the worst game ever. Those reviews are blatant lies. Ignore them. There's way worse game in 2016 and WAY worse games in the past.Should you get it? Maybe on a sale, or for around $20 on key sites. It's fun, but not worth $30 or $40. "

												Loving the game so far was waiting till I could afford it but now i cna play it for 2 days. I like the gun paly in the game and the fact its an open world game where you can explore pretty much anywhere and I was a big fan of the one that was released in 2011			"

												Dont. Waste. Your. Money.Dialogue sound doesnt work. ALL Other sounds work just fine. I have no sound problems with ANY other game. Just dialogue - and just this game.Spent five minutes waiting for a save point, so I could save and then troubleshoot the issue. No dice. For five minutes, you're watching the game, not playing it. Yep: Unskippable cutscenes. As if anyone gives a crap about your garbage video game story. WE WANT TO PLAY the game, NOT watch it.Sure, I barely spent any time with it. But what I did spend, was with a non functional game featuring beginner level design mistakes - lack of surround sound support (in 2016, really) and unskippable, watch-not-play segments.No thanks.

												There are games I call Double-A games.  They're not good enough to be considered AAA, but they're still worth playing.  This is a solid AA game.  I picked it up for 25$ on sale, and I'm quite happy with it.  The gameplay is a bit generic, but fun.  The open world has enough to keep you moving through the world without feeling bogged down with too many activities.  The story is serviceable, with a few high points.  The graphics are phenomenal, and some of the character animations are quite nice too.If you're looking for a fun AA game that will get the most out of your fancy new gfx card, this is a good go to.

												this game is very fun for the first 5 hours or so but i got very bored once i got all the guns and everything in the first 5 hours the story is above average and is the only thing that makes me want to keep playing but i just can't go blind to the cons like the bad ai and the stupid amount of guns i didn't count but i think there are 6 or 7 maybe 8 i feel very sad that this game was a flop as i loved the first homefront and everything about it the nice amount of guns the pretty nice graphics the muiltiplayer which was kinda like battlefield with tanks and large maps and just all around fun and i wish home front the revolution had some kind of pvp aspect like i understand the resistance don't have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of tanks but that is what would of map it have more life if the norks had access to the drones and all the things in the game but they don't have the gear that the resistance has like the hacking device and all that good stuff and they also have the white armour for normal infantry so they would be easy to spot but they have better guns  then the resistance so it would be a very fun mode of muiltiplayer if not that maybe like some kind of 5v5 or 10v10 modes where the norks half to find the resistance fighters in the crouds of people and they can control drones and scan people search people  all while the resistance fighters are blowing up the APCs and doing what you do in the main game the game would then have alot more players and a longer life span i did buy this game before it was on free weekend and  do not reccommend			"

												Played the game from start to finish on Deathwish difficulty during the free weekend. I'm glad I waited, because it's fantastic.I know the game was off to a troubled start, and so I waited until the invetible free wekend after the latest (as of Sep 11, 2016) patch to try the game out.Finally, after all these patches, the game is now complete. And it's pretty good.The combat is rock solid - I love the feel of the weapons. Some of them aren't really viable, but they're fun to play around with anyways. The story seems to jump around a lot towards the end, but it was overall coherent and emotional. Not Oscar-level, but good enough to keep me interested.You really do get the feeling of a desperate, scrappy urban combat. The difficulty ramps up nicely and I always felt challenged. Being able to recruit up to 4 resistance members to chum around with takes the game from good to great - the game is nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty without support and knowing when to just run.Overall, I would say this game is as good as Far Cry 3 - maybe even better, since I prefer the urban combat.

												So I will start with saying that overall I had fun with this game but I have to say it doesn't deserve 40E for what it is.Going deeper although I didn't have much time to play it on the free weekend, mainly going around the sandbox doing a few side missions and main mission and exploring around, I will summirize what felt positive and negetive to my point of view.Positives:Great graphicsGreat weapon system (mods, gear etc)Big mapVery nice sandbox ,very nice and detailed buildings etcAI i found it decent, overall left me with positive feel.Good realistic shooting.Negatives:Not optimized at all, I had to lower a bit my settings (with a 970) to make sufferable framedrops (at explosions or hustles etc).I say I had a decent 45-50fps at lows.Riding a bike was the worst experience ever.Not clear paths/directions to some objectives.Really bad dialogsOverall story wasn't good either, very rough and unprepared. I mean for a draft it is ok but when you release a game at that high price point, NO.My Verdict : 6,5/10If they improve those frame drops and the price is on sale at ~15E I would buy it. The game is really beautiful especially on a 4k monitor would be just to admire scenes and wandering around on foot(avoid bikes at all cost :P ).  Not that special game , not that bad either.			"

												Tried to like this garbage, really hard, but alas, it's just plain dull.This game is trying pretty hard to be a Far Cry, but it's just boring.Boring gunplay, dumb AI, gun customization is kind of ok (but no silencer on a rifle? Come on!!!), but still not very sutisfactory.Damn glitches and bug all over....In Far cry there was a lot of repetative missions, but they felt right for some reason, here it's a routine, I had to push myself to do side quests...Boring characters, boring story, unfortunately. Was hoping it would be better...BORING!!!! BORING!!!! BORING!!!!Overall - DO NOT BUY, waste of your cash in my opinion....Cheers			"

												tl;dr: Unfinished product. Cannot recommend to anyone.This game is infested with bugs and small annoyances, from motorbikes disappearing when you walk 20m away or sometimes right infront of you just when you need it and weapons reseting their modifications, to bigger bugs, like you shooting a burst with LMG to the enemys chest and the game doesn't even register them (happened frequently) or enemies seeing / shooting you through a wall, all the way to game breaking bugs and just crashes the game or you go through walls never to come back, besides using maybe fast travel.Indefinitely spawning enemies at certain locations.There is no manual save and the auto save feature isn't is shoddy at best, compared to most games.Soundtrack became repetite after 15 minutes and caught myself thinking ""Still these same blatant tracks?"" and the soundtrack itself isn't good or even decent.Still suffers console port issues, albeit minor, but still enought to fit into the annoyances-category.The AI, especially ally AI is most of the time so utterly disappointing, it's more fun to watch them run in circles and try to kill one enemy with 9 allies, than to shoot the enemy yourself.The good? Well, while the characters aren't really memoreable, the plot has it's moments. The weapon modification is a nice addition and when it does work perfectly, it brings so much into this game and some of the parkour-type climping is also thing I tend to like. The far cry-type outpost takeover missions is also something I like to do and the freedom to do it when you want.However, as much as a like the good parts of the game, I would only play this with most of the bugs squashed, not like this... Not like this.			"

Tried out the Revolution mode joined to terrible lag which again eventually cleared up. Finished the game and closed out game and steam and seems my ram was at 85%. And I got 16Gb of ram. I was thinking it was a rare memory leak that the game didnt release the memory back. Played it again and so far think it was a one time thing. Strange the game was on sale 3 months after release.

Side missions are a joke photograph a couple of things shoot a few people and thats it. Only aim seems to be to get better gear that you don't need.Sum up  no atmosphere, pointless missions  enjoy.

Bought it yesterday uninstallled yesterday. It could be an outstanding game if not for the worst graphics I've ever seen. Forty bucks down the tubes.			"

												Had a jam on the Free Play weekend and thanks for doing this!!Played the original Homefront. Really enjoyed it.I went into this with no expectations after 'following' the issues around the game for a while now.The game played well on my old rig and in the 5 hours I played there were no crashes. Spent the first 3.5 hours 100% completing the first area. Clear Base, move to next one. Push button, move to next one. Like most people are saying very Far Cry like but I dont mind that as have played FC3 and 4.A couple of things got me going however. The ally AI. They tend to block you in door ways when under fire. Often give you position away. Then not providing the fire support that you may need.The enemy AI.They will charge at you the take cover 6 feet infront of you. I found one bug that really annoyed me. At long range even after 'spotting' snipers I could not take them out. Shooting them and even getting hit markers, I would send 20 rounds their way and nothing. Seemed they were invincible at range. So then would flank them and get right up next to them and one shot with the pistol would do it.The camels back.I was very close to purchasing this game as was on special for $28.79NZD / $21.07USD and thought that it would fill some time in until Forza Horizon 3 and Mafia III arrived in my collection. Had entered into the 2nd area map and been playing for an hour or so this time doing a couple of the story missions and base clearing. One of the 'pop up' objectives appeared just across the road from a building I was leaving. It said Stop the House from being raided (or something of the like). Ok, I'm here and ready for a fight so go across the road. Nothing happened. Looked around, no one there. Then a breaching explosion. The front door flew open about 3 feet from me so I charged into the foya which is about 6x6 feet box room. Nothing there. I turn around to leave and just as hitting the forward key the doors shut and I am perpetually trapped in here. Honestly WTF?I tried to like it but just too many cons for me and this could have been my kind of game. When I found the motorbikes a thought struck me. This is what The Division is missing. Vehicles that can get you around the map quick.Once again thanks for the Free Weekend but I will have to pass on purchasing.			"

												I recommend this game, its fun.The main and side missions are fun.The story and cutscenes are good.The gameplay is great.The lvl design is good, the bad part is: buildings.Buildings are used like copy paste, the good part about it is: A bigger part of the world is open.Secret stashes are better, not copy paste.Areas are also great in not copy paste.I have read that, alot of users think the voice is bad in this game.Me i think its alright/quite good.As long its not like: All voices sounds like they are recorded in a cave, no worries on my part.It's an open world without the rpg element, money and side missions is what u will use to get better weapons and items.

I would also pay full price gladly if I had to, well done Devs for a great game. Let's give this game some positive reviews because now it deserves it.			"

												This game may not worth the orininal price,to be honest, I bought it,because it was on sale.Compared to some nice games, such as The Witcher III,it is nothing.The plot is kinda boring,the AI is dumb,the character in the main campagn cannot speak,too few weapons and atachments....I will not say it is a good game to purchase. It is not  a bad game either. It is just incomplete. I can see there are some excellent ideas through the  whole game. If it is produced by some big studios, I will give a bad review without even hasitating. But considering the tough time this game's developers been through,It is not a surprise to be an ordinary game. Compared to some other lame games ( Tom Clancy's The Division, the campaign of  Black Ops III), I even find it acceptable. Anyway, it is not that bad to earn my bad review.			"

												Played on the free weekend, so it didn't cost me anything.Spent a few hours playing the coop mode with a friend. Very repetitive ""kill these people, then install a virus which takes 5minutes, then escape"". Heavily reliant on ""get money and xp, make self better, play again on harder mode, or buy upgrades with real money"".So that was a bit naff.Tried the single player campaign for a few hours, and that was actually quite fun. Open world, choose which objective to do next. But the AI is pretty dense and the scenery is quite boring. After the first area I was put into a ""be sneaky zone"", which really didn't translate well in this game.The Enemies have a habit of just appearing behind you which not only destroys any immersion you had but makes any form of tactics a bit of a nightmare.All in all, I didn't pay for it so it's alright if you need a distraction, but don't pay for it			"

												Well here's my feeling so far:Pros :  - You get to shoot and climb (I've died way more times to falling than to enemies already - it's not so fun if you climb high to collect valuables and then fall to death and lose them all by thinking that ""this doesn't look so high"" - can't even recollect them later, 'poof' gone) - You got this cool weapon modification animation - It's like Far Cry (Open world with stuff to do + crafting and there seems to be some random stuff happening from time-to-time)Other : - If you're all about USA patriotism then that's a pro for you in this game. (I don't like it, it's a turn off for me - they would have been better off by creating fictional countries)Cons :  - It's like a lesser version of Far Cry (the gunplay isn't as good and stealth seems not possible / at least at my current level) - The weapon animation becomes tedius to watch and the menu isn't helpping it. One wrong move and you're dismantling your weapon for no reason at all. - The phone menu -> trying to take a picture in secret or reading some lore for example. The time keeps going, so you could easily get shot while reading - since everyone seems to hate you. - Iron sights seem to be way off for the handgun (aim for the throat to get a headshot). Rifle seemed better with a 1.2x scope thingy. Might try the other guns when I have the time. - The biggest problem for me with this game is that the resistance doesn't seem likeable at all. If I had a choice, I wouldn't help them after how they treat you. unfortunately your character follows them blindly. I'm sure some people will turn out to be snitches, wouldn't even be surprised. But seeing how they do things, I am surprised they still exist.tl;dr : No I do not recommend this game. Get Far Cry 3 or 4 instead. And if you already have completed them, then re-playing those seem like a better option than playing this.			"

												Awkward gunplay and this still has too many glitches. NPCs are always floating when walking (their movement is weird, like if they never touch the ground). I got stuck on stuff on the ground so many times, went through walls with the motorcycle. NPCs love to get in front of you on doors and not let you pass, and you can't push them away.The game might be something fun, but if an FPS is not a good shooter, that is a bad thing.			"

												(SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW ONLY, did not mess with multi)Imagine you're 13. Imagine you came up with a game that smashes together Far Cry 3 and Spec Ops: The Line. That's the quality of this game. A hamfisted 'gritty' story with characters that are so one dimensional you'll be surprised to find out that the game is supposed to be a FPS and not a slideshow.The weapon system is very interesting, but never really felt fleshed out. Because the enemy's AI is also directly boosted from FC3 I never had to worry about fighting. Which means that I never really experimented with all the weapon types. I'd just run up a stairwell, and shoot them in the face with a shotgun as they ran up one at a time.It is VERY pretty, but if you wanted more FC3, I'd recommend playing Blood Dragon instead.			"

												First of all, this game runs great on my older setup with everything on medium or high, so it seems that a majority of the performance issues from launch have been resolved. As a CRYENGINE 3 game, it looks spectacular.That's all good, because the graphics were a big selling point, as well as the setting and ability to mod your guns. As a game, it fees like a more shooter-heavy, stripped-down version of FarCry 3/4 in an urban setting. If that sounds good to you, now is the best time to check this game out.Here's a quick run down of some notable features I found to be either good or bad:THE GOOD:- Excellent graphics with a lot of options, runs well on my older machine. Nice weather / day + night cycles with lots of rain (but no night vision goggles)- Open world missions that you can sneak or gun through- Modify your weapons on the fly (like in Crysis), or change them entirely (pistol into an SMG, for example). There's not a TON of different attachments, though, so don't expect the variety you would find in, say, Call of Duty multiplayer.- You can craft items on the fly like molotov cocktails, a bomb that looks like a bear, and an explosive RC car (like the game RAGE)- Health that regenerates to 25%...otherwise, you'll need to use health packs to stay alive- Full-body awareness- Large game mapTHE BAD:- Familiar gameplay loop of FarCry 3/4...capture different zones on a map, find caches of items, do miscellaneous jobs (go here, kill this, go there, flip that switch, etc). Not necessarily BAD, but definitely not new or unique. - The only driveable vehicle in the game is a motorcycle- The cover system doesn't work very well. You crouch behind an object, hold the ADS button to pop-out, and then release it to shrink back into cover. However, there were far too many times for me where, upon releasing ADS, my character would just remain standing up, leading to some unexpected deaths.- You can't turn-off the mini-map without also turning off your health bar / number of health kits icon (it's manageable without it, but still...)- I've heard it can be glitchy, but I've only experienced a glitch once (fell through the map)- Lacks features like being able to pick-up enemy weapons or drag dead bodies out of sight- You can't manually save, and the game only keeps 4 recent saves (buried in the ""LOAD"" options of the main menu)- You can't flat-out kill friendlies...you can shoot at their feet or blow them up, howeverOTHER NOTES:- Have not been able to get into a co-op game via the public lobby, although you can play the missions solo (where unfortunately you can't be revived, given there aren't any A.I. partners. However, there are consumable items to revive yourself, although they are hard to come by). Otherwise, these separate standalone missions can accomodate up to 4-players, where you complete a series of objectives to earn cash and XP to get more gear, weapons, abilities, and items. This is a mode where I really wish there were other players more readily available to play because the missions are really well-done. Soloing these is definitely doable, but hard. - There's a Homefront App and website with a bunch of great videos and  features that aren't in the game but really bring the setting and backstory to life....like this lengthy documentary-style video about North Korea's rise to power and takeover of the USA. Note that the backstory is completely different than the first Homefront game, so this is technically kinda like a retcon / soft-reboot of the series.CONCLUSION:This is a really fun game for someone who can get past its relatively minor flaws, and at least deserves a second chance after the developers patched out a lot of the initial launch issues. At the end of the day, it's still a FarCry 3/4-esque game in an urban setting, so let that be your starting point. I paid $40 for this and have not regretted it. FINAL SCORE : 4 out of 5  "

												I don't really understand why people are hung up on the flaws on the game.There exists a few problems, sure. Such as the AI, the acting, the writing of the story (Pretty obvious turns and twists).Don't forget the performance bug, I had massive stuttering, which I fixed by going into the task manager -> processes -> homefront + right click -> affinity to one core -> the set the affinity again to all cores. This fixed the problem, but I had to do this every time i launched the game.Not everyone would like this game, some weird controls (RC car and the hacking part) but I liked the setting and I think that for a game which I bought at a sale it gave me the enjoyment I wanted. It's a different kind of game, but if I am going to be honest, I liked this game more than Far Cry 4. If you think that the game seems fun, then I recommend that you buy it on a sale and try it out.Overall rating: 7/10			"

												I am, admittedly, not far at all into this game. However, after about half an hour of gameplay, I received an error message about not being able to load a shotgun animation and a ctd. I also witnessed NPCs falling through the floor and numerous cloth physics on characters bugging out causing their clothes to appear as if they were in a spastic thunderstorm. I had a little red flag go off when I noticed that the screenshots used on all the DLC for this game are basically the same. Can't we be provided screenshots of what the DLC actually includes? Unfortunately, when you're a lazy developer or are half-heartedly supporting a game, these sorts of things fall through the cracks.Also, the story about North Korea taking over the US via some technological backdoors just fails to strike anything resembling plausibility and I have a very hard time releasing my suspension of disbelief. I really want to enjoy this game, but it hasn't been easy.			"

												Take the worst parts of Watch Dogs and Fallout, put them together, and you get Homefront: The Revolution. This amazingly badly written and full of cliches game sees you surrounded by so-called ""revolutionists"" that don't seem to do anything but watch your every move and tell you want to do like they would to a dog. You even get the same kind of praise. The game is full of glitches like objects teleporting around and ledges that are obviously in reach but which you can't grab because you're not supposed to. It only partially explanins what you can and can't do and leaves you to discover the stupidest of mechanics suchs a ""hacking"" a rusted, long-dead forklift to get it to lift you up to a ledge. The whole world feels horribly centred around and created for the play, which makes you feel bad more than anything.By the end of the campaing, which takes about 12 hours and forces you through about 3 grinding sessions at various time, I felt that my side (the revolutionists) were so hopelessly stupid and lacking any common sense, let alone reason, that I actually felt bad they ""won"". I quoted ""won"", because it is blatantly obvious that had there been an epilogue to the game, you would only see everyone wiped out.I played this game for free as part of a Free Weekend, but would not recommend you spend any money on it. With so many choices out there, even if you pick something that's below average, it would still be better than Homefront: The Revolution.			"

												Steam is currently mixed about this game, and so am I.  It has some great elements and some godawful elements to it, which balance it out to the point of... being mixed.The guns and gear are very satisfying to use, but the UI can be infuriatinly unintuitive at times.There are good maps, plenty to explore but after a while it starts to feel repetitive.  Combined with a 'hearts and minds' mechanic in the game (where you have to win the hearts and minds of the citizens for the next stage of your revolution) which is also infuritatinly slow, this reached the point of boredom - note that there's a difference between patience and boredom, and this particular mechanic managed to stretch that patience.  I managed to force myself to slog through this but I had simply stopped caring, all the fun was sucked out.  From what I'm reading, this is a formula similar to the Far Cry series - so if you like that kind of mechanic you probably won't mind this.  The good bit is that I have learned that I should be avoiding Far Cry!  The story is poor and at times feels extended for the sake of extending it.  The characters involved are... morons... with no clear purpose or goal, who have no idea what they are doing.  The ending was OK.  With all of this mixed it's really difficult to say.  If you're looking for a story, stay away from this one.  If you're looking for exploration and good gear, then have a look - but be prepared to understand what you're getting into.			"

												I don't get all those bad reviews about the game itself. Since the beginning I found it really good and various. Storyline looks deep enough to me, it brings you really in the atmosphere of a revolution, and this time you have no russians, no east enemies, this time you have North Korea, which dominates on the USA, bringing all the States to the starvation and to the poverty. It's a scenario we usually don't see in videogames but movies too. So I find it really very interesting from my point of view.Gameplay looks various, you can customize your weapons, you can craft a few things to build stuff such Molotov, Bombs and so on; you can drive through the map, something I thought it would be not available in this game; you have secondary stuffs to do and find, to unlock. Really I don't get why it has so a bad reputation.Technically I'm also surprised because I thought that Devs would never make a good use of Cryengine, and I expected something like Sniper Ghost Warrior, which graphically is so poor and weak, but it isn't. Devs did a really good job. Playing it on very high settings Homefront looks pretty well done.My only con it's the optimization, since I can handle Crysis 3 running a bit better than this on my rig at ULTRA settings. Here I have unfortunately a lot of issues to face trying to handle everything on max settings, except the antialiasing which is something that I turn on low or I set on off regardless of everything else about grapchic settings.But in the end it's still playable.I can only reccomend it if you're looking for a good FPS with a good storyline and various things to accomplish. Technically it shows what Cryengine is able to shows, you will only have to deal with the bad optimization of the game which makes it in some circumstances not completely smooth, and that's a bit annoying, but you can still enjoy this experience.I will buy it! Thanks to Steam and/or Devs for letting us try this title this weekend! :)			"

												I had higher hopes for this second installment. TL;DR- Awkward controls, glitching and clipping issues throughout. Don't buy.Pro: Longer single player campaign than I thought it would have.  A bit redundant at times, but enjoyable, mostly.Cons: It seems that there's a delay for everything you do- granted, it may only be 1/100 of a second, but you can feel it.Motorbikes are slow and oddly controlled.  I ran everywhere unless I needed a bike for a jump or activation.The RC vehicles suffer from the same delayed controls.Throwing hackables is a joke.  For some reason, you can throw a brick 50MPH across the load zone, but a hackbomb either clips through the world and sits there on your screen below the level for the rest of your load- or it flops 4 feet from you.Patriot launcher would be fun- if it was even moderately accurate for more than 20 feet.Obvious previously posted clipping and seizure npcs aside.Not recommended.

												I don't really understand why people are hung up on the flaws on the game.There exists a few problems, sure. Such as the AI, the acting, the writing of the story (Pretty obvious turns and twists).Don't forget the performance bug, I had massive stuttering, which I fixed by going into the task manager -> processes -> homefront + right click -> affinity to one core -> the set the affinity again to all cores. This fixed the problem, but I had to do this every time i launched the game.Not everyone would like this game, some weird controls (RC car and the hacking part) but I liked the setting and I think that for a game which I bought at a sale it gave me the enjoyment I wanted. It's a different kind of game, but if I am going to be honest, I liked this game more than Far Cry 4. If you think that the game seems fun, then I recommend that you buy it on a sale and try it out.Overall rating: 7/10			"

												I've been enjoying this during the free weekend. I have a few issues with the game, and I'm not sure if I can justify the purchase right now, but I might pick it up in the next sale. The gunplay is okay, doing collectibles in the open world might get old fast, though.Issues:+ When you die, you have to press Return to respawn. I'm probably one of the few people with a broken Return key, but I get by using my Numpad's Enter. Throughout the game wherever you're expected to hit return, you can press enter. Except for when you need to respawn. You can hit escape and load checkpoint, but I'm assuming respawning outside of a mission means less lost progress. Doesn't seem like it can be re-bound, either.+ Filling consumables. It seems like I need to buy them one at a time, and while you can just mash enter, it'd be nice to have a Fill or Fill All option. I've not tried co-op, and I've not crashed at all.			"

												I've bought this game in hopes it will be a similar experience to play it in co-op as it was with Dying Light. It turned out to be completely different. The co-op missions are separate from the single player story, and even the first one was designed for experienced players. I didn't mind failing the mission twice, but during the third try we've realized that we don't have the ammor or the grenades that we used up in the previous trials, so we didn't even have a chance to complete the mission.The graphics is nice, but it's really disappointing that the story is single player only.

												*Disclamer*I do kinda spoil some stuff so if you don't want any spoilers dont read this*Disclamer*I loved the first homefront and as soon as i saw this game a pre-ordered so i might be a little biased, but this game is really fun the only downside would be the glitched and less than optimal optimization. For example a glitch i keep getting is when i customize the AR15 varient rifle with a sight my iorn sights seem to pop of my gun and just float in mid-air wherever they where when i customized it. and the frames constanly hover around max 50, but i have a GTX 980. overall there are some problems but its still fun. now into the semi-spoiler part, The biggest issue i have with this game is the goliath is supposed to be a mega-tank somthing no resistance has taken out before. but when you go and take on the ♥♥♥♥ing thing gets detroyed in two seconds by small arms fire. i get that you have to make it tough in order to be fun. but ♥♥♥♥ dude why are we risking so much to take a tank that can be destroyed by small arms? this is rediculous. and we are supposedly using this to break into a huge heavly guarded area later? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that will never work if this thing is as weak as it is in this mission. other than that i love this game.

This game is not that fun as Far cry or other similar games.Good this was a Free play weekend. Even after the patch there are lots OF BUGS. Some enemies can see you through wall and shoot through walls while we can't.

The Story sucks though.. not as compelling as Farcry.So if i say will i recommend this game?No ...			"

												Updated/removed original reviewThe concept of Homefront, the IP itself, is a great idea and it’s something fresh. I feel like everytime this name gets used it’s already tainted because the original game had issues during development but not to the same extent this game went through.There are sooo many issues with the game I cannot simply go through them all, the game felt rushed and was simply an unfinished AAA title. This isn’t acceptable at all.Even after being completely aware of the issues the game has, they even mislead the consumer in the 1.4 patch by saying and I quote…“Save Stalls– We have optimized the number of checkpoint save locations throughout the single player campaign. This means that the short ‘pauses’ that the player encounters are reduced and the game will now inform you that it is saving.”How can you sit there and say that you fixed save stalls when the game stalls/stutters get worse the deeper into the campaign you get?I do want to ask, it is great that you finished a project but why did you accept it as is? I cannot understand how this was accepted by Deep Silver as a final build or a finished product?For a full review check out my video here.

												The game runs horribly, even after a load of patches. I can't even get it to not drop below 30 FPS on occasion on all settings set to lowest. And my Specs are above recommended.In addition, the game is a bugged out piece of crap, that softlocks more than any other game I ever played. For instance you can softlock an NPC you're supposed to follow, by running ahead of them far enough. They'll just freeze in place, no way of getting them unstuck.  It's really easy to get that one, since outrunning NPCs is, as per usual in any FPS, totally easy cause you sprint faster than NPCs.The other softlocks I had were a wrongwarp after meeting the resistance in the underground, and jumping effectively out of bounds, behind a wall, with no way back.That, combined with the really dumb AI and graphical glitches and physics glitches make this really not an enjoyable game.All in all, this is probably the worst AAA release of 2016, and I'm disappointed that they managed to fuc­­k up the sequel to a pretty good game that much.

												It's a pity when I go online, I can't find any players.  Also, the AI is truly awful and glitchy.  But unlike most FPS's, you don't necessarily have to finish every goal.  Sometimes, it's fun just to run around shooting North Koreans instead of going for the next flag.  And if you don't want the next flag and you'd rather get on with the story, that's cool, too.  You can always return to the previous area for a ""full complete"" anyway.So, yeah, the dev's had lofty goals, many of which are incomplete.  But the world is so well-built and the atmosphere is just right and the controls work just as well with a controller as they do with a mouse...  It's totally worth it, just not at full price.  Get it on sale if you can.			"

												Ok I have no idea why this game had several bad reviews. I had a blast playing it and had no frameworks issues until maybe the endgame were a couple of times my dude would not move but I did finish and enjoyed it to the last minute. Sure many of the quests were repeatitive all these games pretty much are but I did enejoy killing eveyone without mercy to the point the airship would hunt me and send thousands of troops to hunt me and literally would not stop until they killed me but I killed hundreds of them before I died it was a blast. I did think they could have updated and added several more weapons types and YES it is alot like Far-Cry but once again the game was a blast and would recommand it for $10. i am looking forward to getting the DLC and finishing the whole game.

												Frustrating in the end.It starts out as a single player campaign but as you progress you're sort of left feeling like the game is too open. The graphics look great and are pretty demanding.The gameplay is centered around liberating areas in a map. The more areas you liberate the greater ground you acquire against your fight against the North Koreans.The concept is good but frankly the layout and execution is beyond flawed.After a while it seems a bit odd that the North Koreans would simply stay put in occupied areas. Having an AI just sit there and do nothing as you gradually take over their space strikes me as odd - the devs should have instead had the AI try to control or regain lost territories for a real-life challenge. Instead, they just sit there waiting for you to confront them. Missions are repetitive, gun customization a rehash of Crysis and after a while it gets boring. Purchase if it's massively discounted, but it isn't worth the current price.			"

												Dead Island Riptide set in Philadelphia.The characters are the essentially the same.  The map structure is the same.  The gamepad controls are the same.  The motion sickness inducing restricted FOV is the same (only goes to 65) so short gameplay spells are all I can tollerate.The same mission structure exists - main central story and tasks, with side missions and characters tasking you. Riptide Deadzones are now Strike Zones, hotbeds of baddies in a compound for you take out.Modding of the the weapons is the same, albeit there are no blunt instruments and double-handed axes, but instead more emphasis on shotguns and pistols.  Hell, the throwables are the same - molotovs and explosives, but with additional hacking chips and distraction firecrackers.  Modding of the the weapons is the same style, requiring a multitude of items that you find from searching boxes, bins, corpses and lockers.The charcter animations, facially, their movements and sway are visually similar, and at times I forget i'm not in Palanoi.If you liked DI Riptide, you'll enjoy this too.  However, it is all rather slow and repetitive.  Personally, i'll stick with Riptide only and I am glad of the free weekend to save me a duplicated game in my steam library.			"

												After completing the main story whtchc took about about 8 hours or so, I can recoomend this game if you enjoy the setting and the RPG elements that the game offters. The open world that the game boasts isn't ""true"" open world. It's devided into several districts that you have to load into using tunnels connecting the safe houses. I personally have no problem with this as it fits the worl really well. The districts are all open world and you can move about them freely and they all feel alive and breathing, and they all look beautiful.The performance is a bit awful, I have to admit. With an Intel Core i7 4790k as 4.5GHz with a GTX 970, I was getting an average of about 50-60fps when walking around at high presets, and about 45fps in hectic fights, really needs optomising, but it was play able for me and it looks great. The story is interestig and gripping, and it feels like you're walking around a living, breathing world. I have to admit that the game does suffer from the ""unkillable protagonist"" syndrome a lot, being able to run through a hail of buller fire and Goliath shells, but it's fun to play nonetheless. The characters all feel developped, if a little expedable at times, giving me the sense, if Ethan Brady exists, the KPA should never have been able to ivade the US seeing as he's a literally one man army at times. Customisation is a decent eddition to the game, if a little underwhelming. In about 4 hours I had all the major upgrades the weapons and all the gear I needed, but it is nice to be able to convert a sniper rifle into a rocket launcher when the situation calls for it. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I would say it is a little steep for the price they are charging for it, but I got it for £16 off of♥♥♥♥♥ and for that price, I would reccomend the game to anyone.			"

												I have a thing for underdog games. Games that have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reception, that are bashed and hated, mostly because, whats so fun about cheering on someone you know you will? the new DOOM was a bit like that, before it came out we all expected the worst. DmC also, with the first trailer being HATED and being one of the MOST negative disliked to liked ratio at the time, and it came out fair and actually, honestly good and won over some fans, that was a nice story.After years of hearing how bad this is, i saw it on sale and decided ''why not''. So, 8 hours into the game, and counting, here's my toughts on Homefront The Revolution :- Starting off, it's buggy, it was reported to be buggy when it came out, and it is still buggy, mostly physics, i've got stuck in places and had to restart most often than not. Don't expect all the patches to have fixed that.+ Despite that, the game is quite beautiful, it's clearly a dystopic world, and there's little details like seeing the people going from doing nothing to raving the streets the more you free it.- It is just an open world ubisoft like game. Do this, do that, follow the marker, take down this place to see more of the map. It's the same tired formula BUT if you're not tired of it, or you know, don't play ubisoft games which is basically corporate cookies, servicible but without grandmas passion, then you'll like this a bit. I think because it's more condensed and less ''big'' than those, it's a bit less tiring.+ Combat is good. The game is hard. It should be, what, you think you can get shot like ♥♥♥♥ing terminator and walk off easy? - Said that, the AI is bad, either they have the all seeing eye of thundera and spots you BEHIND OBJECTS or they are said objects, lifeless and dumb.+- The story...could be more really, it's a nice word they built, with interesting backstory but it does lack an OOMPH to the main plot and characters. With the exception of Dana Moore (Who looks suspiciously like a certain Veruca, you know what im talking about. You perv.) which is an entertaining ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everyone else is boring. Especially that stupid high morals doctor, screw you, this IS war you♥♥♥♥♥♥ get out of that stupid window of yours. Also let's talk about Ned Sharp, it is not listed who voices him. I could find no info on it, but he sounds like Rick from Rick and Morty, our character, Blank Slate Brady has a name that ends with an Y and everytime he says ''Brady do this'' it clearly is the same voice actor. I can swear it's the same voice.+ Level design. Yes the areas are really cool designed, it's a bit of a parkour-ish design, and i wish they went all out of it, having nooks and crannys that you can freely free-run through. Instead of getting stuck.- Not greatly optimized, my machine is fairly good, and i dont even crank things to max to avoid any framedrop cause ♥♥♥♥ it. But it freezes. It freezes sometimes, for no good reason and bye-bye progress. That blows.With that, would i recommend it? Hmmm, maybe. Either you play for the setting, for the addiction to ubisoft-like soul-less cookie open world type or for Dana, which was my case. So...if you're willing to close your eyes to the bad, you're gonna have some fun. Also play with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controller, this game was made for console first and it shows. I'll leave the reccomend as an Yes, there should be a Maybe steam. Dummies.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is a really great game. It has its bugs and apparently the launch wasn't so smooth but a year later the game has very few problems. I've played the full singleplayer campaign but I have yet to touch the multiplayer.Pros:- Graphics, while not amazing they are pretty good- Performance, there's a few areas where it is not great but the majority of the time my fps was well above 60- Story was good but some it it felt forced- Movement felt like Dying Light without the parkour- Gunplay was good, requires spray controlCons:- The main story ending felt forced Dana's death was pointless, it seems like they just wanted to kill her- No replay value- No freeroam after beating the game- Your character doesnt talk at all but he does in the DLCBugs:- Climbing through solid objects- Bikes can get stuck in stuff			"

												Played abit, it isn't that bad. Although there are several lackness for texture, and weapons. Graphics itself is a mixed, the lighting is great but the texture can use improvement here especially the weapons texture. There are still some bugs, such as AI bugs. Overall, for a less than 1 year title and already dropped price, I can say it is fairly worth it. If you can get it on sale, it will be more worth.			"

												Sadness intensifies. Running in this game makes me annoyed because of how slow the viewmodel (your gun, arms, etc.) bob compared to how fast you run. Shooting has so much damn recoil, and it'd be fine if it didn't feel like I'm using a controller while ADSing. AI is just as bad as always.There also seems to be major audio bugs, such as hearing gun shots that happened maybe 30 seconds prior but the enemy is:A: Already deadB: Sounds like it just reactivates the sound in the right ear for no reason.Thought that after the ""patches"" the game would be good enough to buy. Nope.Don't recommend buying this even on sale. The better choice would be a farcry game in all honesty or even metro.			"

												So, I really, REALLY wanted to love Homefront: The Revolution. I really did.The game is really fun, the guns are nice to fire and the atmosphere is just amazing. The graphics are also very good.But that's all. In almost two hours, the game crashed two times in very random circunstances. After quitting and coming back, the game sent me all the way back twice, even though it kept all my progress. So after that, I had to run and run until I get to the location I was before and guess what? It crashes again.Now, I'm very confident in my rig. i5 3570, GTX 970. The game runs pretty well on high 1080p at 60fps, sometimes it drops below and you can even get it to work at 60fps on ultra, but I just don't like the drops when things get busy or the weather a little too ugly. The crashes are the real issue.Other than that, I tried playing in the highest difficulty but the AI is dumb as hell. They line up so you can headshot them one at a time. There was no reason to buy the sniper upgrade since the rifle with a scope is more than enough to snipe anyone. The game also bugs the entire time, you can see people clipping on the floor and some on the walls. I got to see all that in less than two hours.This game could have been the Far Cry I ever wanted, but sadly the technical issues are very glaring. So much lack of polish for a game that could have been awesome.			"

												I really liked the game and wanted to give a thumbs up, but the game bugged and froze when Ned Sharpe was calling me in one mission... Gamebreaking bug! So until this is fixed, I can't recommend you to buy!I will change my review as soon as my problem will be fixed.Edit: I found a way to set back the mission and start over. I changed my review to positive, because I can see that the devs put much work in it and the game is just beautiful. Many people are hating, which I can't understand! It's a good game!If you like FARCRY, you will also like this game because it's Farcry in an urban scenario.I would like to see some bug fixes for this game and hope people would stop to be so harsh about it. People put a lot of effort into it and it's sad to see it get tarnished. Cheers and best wishes.			"

												I don't know what the complaining is all about. I do understand why the negetive reviews when it first came out but I started to play after all of the patches and it runs fine for me. I think that the people who are saying that their games are crashing after the updates aren't being honest with themselves or people about what their computers can handle or if it's even stable. I am running this on a 3-4 year old Alienware 18 laptop at medium settings at I have no issues at all. It's even locked in at 60 FPS and the game still looks amazing. I'm pretty sure that most people are trying to run the game at ultra when we all know that this has the cryengine and it's a very demanding engine.  As for the game review. I've only played 1 hour and 15 minutes so I don't know the storyline that well yet but I'm enjoying the open world aspect of it. I love games like this so it's my cup of tea but not for everybody. I think that people wanted a call of duty type of game when they bought into this game and was let down. I personaly believe that people have too high of expectations these days and do not remember back in the day when you got a glitchy game for $60 and it was like 5 hours long.  The AI isn't that great on it but I am going to try a harder level to see what that's like.One thing that annoys me is that I keep seeing reviews on people that are hating the game and not recommending it have 40+ hours soaked into the game. I don't know about you but I refuse to put that many hours into something I really hate. I also do not take bad reviews for people that have spent .2 hours on it as well. Not even sure if my 1.25 hours count but I just wanted to say that it's stable and like the game. As for the price? I do think the $25 I spent on it is worth it and I also think that the developers are trying real hard to make the game great. Definately wait for the next sale. There you go, my two cents worth. You can either hate it or like it but either way I'm going to keep playing this game because I enjoy it and do not care about people that whine about everything.			"

												First, the game isn't as buggy as people claim. It's a Cryengine game, all you need to do is not play it at max settings and suddenly the game works perfectly fine. Know the limitations of your own system.Second, this is not a sequel to Homefront. It doesn't have any connection to it besides 'North Korea is the bad guy', and 'There's a tank called the Goliath'. If you're especting the crap from Homefront or some oddball story, don't. They're not related. With that said, this is a good game, one of few games I recommend. Beyond the usual positives and negatives with the Cryengine, between it looking detailed and well designed, Homefront The Revolution has the good gameplay of Crysis 3 with the simple design of Farcry 3. If you liked the landscape of Crysis 3, or liked the open combat of Farcry 3 and 4, you'll like this game. Half the game is going from base to base capturing them, and running into the odd patrol, or having multiple ways of doing the same thing. The story is kinda eh, but so is the story of all open world games. What really shines is the other half of the game, where you're in 'yellow zones', making it really feel like the world is believable. You can't just walk into a yellow zone, that is residental areas in the Philly turned Bagdad, and gun down everything in sight with no consequences. You open fire, suddenly you have 3 humvees on you and 50 guys on you. You kill a civilian, people react and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ More than that, not every problem is solved with killing either. Some cases it's better and easier to distract soldiers away from whatever they might be harrassing than you flat kill them. While it's not a terribly deep game, it's more realistic than the majority of games you'll run into on the market, not just story wise, but gameplay wise. It also has multiplayer, which I will say is good on it's own. They're effectively stand-alone missions with friends, with a progression/RPG system tacked on to give it more content. The amount of content is enough for me to say it's like a DLC expansion given to you by default; Extended missions, with a second character/mechanics system, with friends. That said, because of the bad rap the game's gotten, there's not a lot of people playing the multiplayer. It really does shine when you have other people obviously, but with some smart playing and decent skill you can play alone. Again, think of it as extra, standalone missionsAll that said, it does have bugs. It's open world, it's bound to have bugs. Besides the usual Cryengine garbage, some geometry will trap you, NPCs might sink into the ground sporaticly, and enemies can spawn in impossible places. Beyond that, this is one of the least buggy open-world games I've played. Between FO4 and FC3/4, this game is very solid. Again, if you're having issues, turn down the settings, it's the Cryengine. Oh, and if all that's not enough, you get a second free game added in, albeit and old game :P			"

												I nearly didn't buy this game because of the negative reviews. The complaints about the slow frame rate and stuttering reminded me of the complaints about Just Cause 3. When I played JC3 with 6Gb of RAM, it stuttered to the point I couldn't play it. I upped my RAM from 6Gb to 24Gb and all problems ceased. Great game, plays great with plenty of RAM. I figured the complaints about Homefront were the same, so I bought it anyway. This is one of the best games I've bought in a long time. Lot's of fun, great graphics, physics, and storyline. So, bottom line, when they say the recommended RAM is 8Gb,, just plan on 12Gb or more. These newer games with massive amounts of texture maps, lighting, and action require more than they recommend. I'm running all settings on all games at max on a 2009 Alienware ALX, GTX 970, 8 cores at 3.3Ghz, RAID 0 with 2 500Gb SSDs. 24Gb DDR3. I run all games at highest settings possible. This one is a 9.5/10 rating. Buy it if you want Far Cry 4 - Urban. Well worth the price!!			"

												If you enjoy the single player campaign  of Homefront: The Revolution,  you must not have much experience in these games because the story is dreadful.  Right from the beginning, they make it so both sides seem appalling.    The occupying  forces and the resistantance treat your character horribly.  I felt like gunnning both sides down.    Also at the opening, there's a minor character that's killed.   As soon as the first mission starts one of the very first NPCs on the street  is her twin.  I don't expect to see such a lack of variety in character modeling in the first two minutes of gaming.   Graphically it's decent, but not anything spectular.    I am having  no performance issues except I'm stuck at 1080p.   My pc is connected to a 4k tv.   The desktop resolution is set at 1080p.    From what I have read in the discussions, Homefront will not set to a large resolution that your desktop.   It gives you the option, but it will not apply it.    That is ridiculous.   Every other game I can set the resolution to 1440p or 2560p and there's no problem.  I wouldn't recommend buying this until it falls to the price it deserves:  five bucks or less.    If you want a modern shooter with a decent story-based campaign, COD IW is infiinitely superior.   Heck, the original Homefront is superior.    "

												So, I really, REALLY wanted to love Homefront: The Revolution. I really did.The game is really fun, the guns are nice to fire and the atmosphere is just amazing. The graphics are also very good.But that's all. In almost two hours, the game crashed two times in very random circunstances. After quitting and coming back, the game sent me all the way back twice, even though it kept all my progress. So after that, I had to run and run until I get to the location I was before and guess what? It crashes again.Now, I'm very confident in my rig. i5 3570, GTX 970. The game runs pretty well on high 1080p at 60fps, sometimes it drops below and you can even get it to work at 60fps on ultra, but I just don't like the drops when things get busy or the weather a little too ugly. The crashes are the real issue.Other than that, I tried playing in the highest difficulty but the AI is dumb as hell. They line up so you can headshot them one at a time. There was no reason to buy the sniper upgrade since the rifle with a scope is more than enough to snipe anyone. The game also bugs the entire time, you can see people clipping on the floor and some on the walls. I got to see all that in less than two hours.This game could have been the Far Cry I ever wanted, but sadly the technical issues are very glaring. So much lack of polish for a game that could have been awesome.			"

												PLAYED ON FREE WEEKEND.This review has been made using my feedback from playing during the free weekend.I am one of the few who actually enjoyed the first Homefront game made by THQ. However I'm not a fan of this one. Performance wise, I had a rather poor experience, I had numerous game crashes and freezes. The longest I went without one was about 15mins. The framerate was ok on ultra settings using a 1070 founders, but not as high as I anticipated. Otherwise the game visually does look pretty good.However, my main issue is with the free mode style gameplay, after the first 10 minutes of interductory cutscenes/gameplay, the story completely fell apart for me. Instead of a group of resistance fighters, the game turns into a one man resistance, you single handedly taking on the whole occupation forces of the KPA. This ruined the story for me as at least the previous game had a sense of a group of people not just a single man, even with it's fixed mission based playthrough. Another thing I wasn't keen on was the repetitive nature of getting to missions, the motorbike controls are far too poor to use and also wasn't very immersive just driving past an entire platoon of KPA, and running 200+ meters made me feel like I was playing ARMA at some points of the game.However on a side note I do like the weapon customisation to a degree, the way in which a pistol can be made into an SMG, or a Marksman Rifle into a Sniper Rifle is an awesome idea expecially when done in the game, not in a menu. However, on the counterside, I would have wanted more customisation as It's rather lacking. In comparison this review may be biased as I haven't played the whole game, and for a more in depth review for longer playtimes should be considered alongside this review. However I recommend this game, ONLY if you are really interested in the purchase and the franchise, and when the game is discounted as even I wouldn't buy this game for less than 50% or more of retail price.

												Played abit, it isn't that bad. Although there are several lackness for texture, and weapons. Graphics itself is a mixed, the lighting is great but the texture can use improvement here especially the weapons texture. There are still some bugs, such as AI bugs. Overall, for a less than 1 year title and already dropped price, I can say it is fairly worth it. If you can get it on sale, it will be more worth.			"

Luckily the latest pactch has finally fixed the major performance issues, and we are finally able to play the pretty decent Far Cry 3 clone that lies beneath.If you loved Far Cry 3 but are sick of replaying it, I'd give this ago. Lighting looks amazing too, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												updatedafter foundout about graphic glitch was related to my overclocked setting, i've lower the setting and the problem seems to go away. but occasionally hic-cup occur if you got 2GB card and use texture resolution at HIGH . recommend to set it to LOW. (gtx960 strix 2gb) others is medium with 1080p still looks cool.as for the game i'd give it 7/10 , if Farcry 3 is a good cold beer, this one is like a watered down version of it with better graphics and particle effect.i beat the game while free-weekend, and i'm looking forward to get it on winter sales. achievements to collect and coop mission to be play.as much as i like the game even it is not a great game just mediocore one, but an annoying issue is graphic artifact and black screen. i'd recommend it but i do hope they fix it for good.when you engage a firefight / sneaking into enemy base and suddenly and goes black and everything screw except map market isn't help. and i fall from roof top which can only access by a motocycle twice because of it.

But it doesn't take away the fun element. Given the circumstances on how it was released, I would say they have done a pretty amazing job. Go ahead, it's definitely worth a shot!			"

												After completing the main story whtchc took about about 8 hours or so, I can recoomend this game if you enjoy the setting and the RPG elements that the game offters. The open world that the game boasts isn't ""true"" open world. It's devided into several districts that you have to load into using tunnels connecting the safe houses. I personally have no problem with this as it fits the worl really well. The districts are all open world and you can move about them freely and they all feel alive and breathing, and they all look beautiful.The performance is a bit awful, I have to admit. With an Intel Core i7 4790k as 4.5GHz with a GTX 970, I was getting an average of about 50-60fps when walking around at high presets, and about 45fps in hectic fights, really needs optomising, but it was play able for me and it looks great. The story is interestig and gripping, and it feels like you're walking around a living, breathing world. I have to admit that the game does suffer from the ""unkillable protagonist"" syndrome a lot, being able to run through a hail of buller fire and Goliath shells, but it's fun to play nonetheless. The characters all feel developped, if a little expedable at times, giving me the sense, if Ethan Brady exists, the KPA should never have been able to ivade the US seeing as he's a literally one man army at times. Customisation is a decent eddition to the game, if a little underwhelming. In about 4 hours I had all the major upgrades the weapons and all the gear I needed, but it is nice to be able to convert a sniper rifle into a rocket launcher when the situation calls for it. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I would say it is a little steep for the price they are charging for it, but I got it for £16 off of♥♥♥♥♥ and for that price, I would reccomend the game to anyone.			"

												Updated/removed original reviewThe concept of Homefront, the IP itself, is a great idea and it’s something fresh. I feel like everytime this name gets used it’s already tainted because the original game had issues during development but not to the same extent this game went through.There are sooo many issues with the game I cannot simply go through them all, the game felt rushed and was simply an unfinished AAA title. This isn’t acceptable at all.Even after being completely aware of the issues the game has, they even mislead the consumer in the 1.4 patch by saying and I quote…“Save Stalls– We have optimized the number of checkpoint save locations throughout the single player campaign. This means that the short ‘pauses’ that the player encounters are reduced and the game will now inform you that it is saving.”How can you sit there and say that you fixed save stalls when the game stalls/stutters get worse the deeper into the campaign you get?I do want to ask, it is great that you finished a project but why did you accept it as is? I cannot understand how this was accepted by Deep Silver as a final build or a finished product?For a full review check out my video here.

												Frustrating in the end.It starts out as a single player campaign but as you progress you're sort of left feeling like the game is too open. The graphics look great and are pretty demanding.The gameplay is centered around liberating areas in a map. The more areas you liberate the greater ground you acquire against your fight against the North Koreans.The concept is good but frankly the layout and execution is beyond flawed.After a while it seems a bit odd that the North Koreans would simply stay put in occupied areas. Having an AI just sit there and do nothing as you gradually take over their space strikes me as odd - the devs should have instead had the AI try to control or regain lost territories for a real-life challenge. Instead, they just sit there waiting for you to confront them. Missions are repetitive, gun customization a rehash of Crysis and after a while it gets boring. Purchase if it's massively discounted, but it isn't worth the current price.			"

												I nearly didn't buy this game because of the negative reviews. The complaints about the slow frame rate and stuttering reminded me of the complaints about Just Cause 3. When I played JC3 with 6Gb of RAM, it stuttered to the point I couldn't play it. I upped my RAM from 6Gb to 24Gb and all problems ceased. Great game, plays great with plenty of RAM. I figured the complaints about Homefront were the same, so I bought it anyway. This is one of the best games I've bought in a long time. Lot's of fun, great graphics, physics, and storyline. So, bottom line, when they say the recommended RAM is 8Gb,, just plan on 12Gb or more. These newer games with massive amounts of texture maps, lighting, and action require more than they recommend. I'm running all settings on all games at max on a 2009 Alienware ALX, GTX 970, 8 cores at 3.3Ghz, RAID 0 with 2 500Gb SSDs. 24Gb DDR3. I run all games at highest settings possible. This one is a 9.5/10 rating. Buy it if you want Far Cry 4 - Urban. Well worth the price!!			"

												Shoot once, gun keeps shooting. 10/10 bullets wasted.That bug and the cursor sometimes remaining on screen after using the phone and enemies respawning very quickly within an area (like a drone command or such).Has an almost early-access feel with the number of bugs and graphical glitches that I've encountered (slow texture loads in some places, lighting quirks, almost falling through the world a couple of times while climbing areas).Has a very dumb AI.Needs major work but is fairly fun.Edit: So I play games with keyboard and mouse, but if the game has a vehicle I'll also use a control pad because better control over the vehicle. I don't know if the combined controls is a factor or the cause but sometimes when I shoot the weapon will continue shooting after I release the mouse.Bugs are a massive issue, as is the initial tutorial - I was stuck at the initial part for 30 odd minutes before realising I could just walk past the NKs.Shifting to a non-recommend because the bugs have worn down the level of fun.

In fact I actually liked it, the graphics were great, it ran smoothly, gun modifications were fabulous.I've always enjoyed the capturing stronghold element of games like far cry, so I was happy it was included here.Yes the story felt predictable, and the hype around walker died down faster than a boner after watching a porno with an actual story...

												While it does have short bits of fun in it which I enjoyed, I just couldn't bring myself to recommend this game. A ~12 Hour Campaign made up of boring characters, a predictable story, and generic gameplay makes this not really worth the purchase. It's clear that the developers tried their hardest to make this game good, they tell you this in their message in the end credits, but it's just not enough to satisfy.Pros- Graphics are pretty good- Soundtrack is nice and helps the atmosphere- Dark and Opressive Aesthetic- Cool Enemy Armor Designs- A Timesplitters 2 Easter Egg that's more fun then the actual game :DCons- Predictable Story- Repetitive Side Missions and Main Missions- Boring Characters- Generic Shooter GameplayOverall Score - 3/10			"

												Basically, this game is Far Cry 3-4 in the urban setting NOW WITH LESS TOWERS HOO-FREAKING-RAY.So, the AI sucks, optimization (Radeon R7 265, AMD FX-8320E) is kinda bad, there is lags and FPS problems, but for me personally it's not the biggest problem, as i am used to play games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate. Occasionally game can hang up, but it happened two times and that's probably the ""hue hue i load wurllld"".Equipment upgrades are, well, how to put it politely... There is none. Slightly less damage, slightly more medic syringes things and double money things capacity, that's it. Really. What? Stealth upgrades? Is there STEALTH in this game? I don't believe you.To summarise, game crashed at the exact moment as i liberated another settl... I mean outpost. 2.5 hours of slow-paced gameplay and almost 100%-ed first level. It's not that exciting, although in some places you can practically spam your screenshot button.If you like new Far Cry games - this is for you. Also, get ready for VERY EXCITING storyline.			"

The gameplay was basically shoot people, hack thing, do that again. The game feels to chaotic and confusing at points and kinda takes away from the expireince.

												This game got quite a lot of flak, but considering it took 4 years of development time by a new studio and with quite a few people...... It wasn't all THAT bad, for me at least. In fact I actually liked it, the graphics were great, it ran smoothly, gun modifications were fabulous.I've always enjoyed the capturing stronghold element of games like far cry, so I was happy it was included here.Yes the story felt predictable, and the hype around walker died down faster than a boner after watching a porno with an actual story... BUT that ending redeemed it for me. I for one am looking forward to a sequel.			"

												This game keeps freezing when I get my first pistol from ""Cookie"" in the beginning. My character's arms hike up while clutching the pistol and the two guys just keep staring at me with their animations fully playing out and looping. No pop-ups, button prompts or anything. I'm starting to see why this game didn't do so well initially.			"

												A good game.I managed to finish it in about 27hrs so it's pretty consistent. The main story is nice and pretty immersive. The game kinda forces you to play with hit and run strategy but it's not that bad since it is about guerilla warfare. What i did not like was the enemy respawn system. They just keep coming until you either run and hide or you're dead. But again, it's a game about guerilla warfare.The voice acting is very good, the graphics are rather nice. It's very well optimized. I heard they had fps problems in the begining but i had absolutely no problems. The game ran at 60fps all the time and i had not one single framedrop on a gtx970 and i5. It seems unpolished in some areas, for example the weapons system. I like the fact that you can customize your weapons (very nice actually) but i would have liked it more for a larger variety of weapons. It's also a little frustrating when a KPA drops a nice futuristic weapon (looks like a FAMAS) and you cannot pick it up. The secondaries are quite nice and although sometimes they might seam to repeat, in the fact they always have something different. So no, it's not boring at all but it might be frustrating if you're on a thight schedule. Don't know what else to say... It's kinda like a Far Cry game. If you liked those, you'll also like this one.			"

												Basically, this game is Far Cry 3-4 in the urban setting NOW WITH LESS TOWERS HOO-FREAKING-RAY.So, the AI sucks, optimization (Radeon R7 265, AMD FX-8320E) is kinda bad, there is lags and FPS problems, but for me personally it's not the biggest problem, as i am used to play games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate. Occasionally game can hang up, but it happened two times and that's probably the ""hue hue i load wurllld"".Equipment upgrades are, well, how to put it politely... There is none. Slightly less damage, slightly more medic syringes things and double money things capacity, that's it. Really. What? Stealth upgrades? Is there STEALTH in this game? I don't believe you.To summarise, game crashed at the exact moment as i liberated another settl... I mean outpost. 2.5 hours of slow-paced gameplay and almost 100%-ed first level. It's not that exciting, although in some places you can practically spam your screenshot button.If you like new Far Cry games - this is for you. Also, get ready for VERY EXCITING storyline.			"

												A really good port of the Gamecube/PS2 era Timesplitters 2. Unfortunately, I kept running into some kind of problem, as the game ended after the second level and wouldn't proceed.The framing device about Philadelphia under seige and occupation by North koreans was pretty good fun, but I don't understand how it relates to Timesplitters at all. It was almost like they were trying to sell the framing device as a full game for some reason.			"

												So I've been following this game basically since it was announced and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. I dont see why a lot of people are whineing about clunky gameplay and all that other Sh*t when i just play a game to have fun. this game give you the feel of being a normal human. You WILL die easily and you have to play smart. There is no real health regen and the gunplay is balenced. To the people who say that the enemys are bullet spongy, GEE I WONDER IF ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE WEARING A FREAKIN EXO SUIT OF HIGH TECH BODY ARMOR. That and the fact that you have to use rebuildable guns and the enemy's have every possible thing that is top of the line. its no wonder that they are bullet spongy and hard to kill. You are the resistance, not master chief. Normal humans fighting against a impossible enemy where you are outmanned and outgunned in every possible way. I applaud this game for creating that environment as I have been looking for one like this for a very long time. Please ignore the people who want a very easy game with little to no challenge because they cant handle it. Get this game. I rate it 10/10.			"

												So far this game is pretty awesome! The game plays alot like an ""urban warfare"" Farcry. The graphics are awesome, gun customization is amazing (so are the animations of it).  So far I have no complaints, i'll update the review when i've beaten the game, but i'm happy with my purchase :D. Ps. The game is getting alot of bad reviews, mostly seems to be because of optimization issues (or just people hating on new release games with the other cool kids). While the optimization could be much better, this game has incredible graphics and i'm running it fine at 4k. Hopefully Dambuster will keep the game updated and maybe add some cool stuff to it like the devs of dying light did. This game is pretty awesome already but with some love and care from the dev's could become a 9/10 or so. So, if you are having problems running the game, these issues should hopefully be fixed soon. 980tii7 4790k at 4 GHZ16 GB of ramGame installed on a 1tb SSD			"

												I have been highly anticipating this game, reading every article and watching every interview. The game is finally released and the first 25 minutes is just cutscene (to be expected from any singleplayer game) then the first few minutes of gameplay are awesome. Ultra graphics settings and 60fps in a very rich enviroment full of people. I get out into the actual game and struggled to keep 45fps on a pretty nice rig. The ""open-world"" aspect was bland and had no story to it at all. I got on a motorcycle and tried to drive it, but that didn't really work. The camera angle was always off and I would crash within seconds. Inside of this bland story-less game even on normal difficulty were hundreds of drones and soldiers that killed me pretty quick. It got to the point where I wondered why I was even torturing myself with this brutal terrible gameplay and 30 fps. I then realized that there is no point because there is no story. If the entire game was like the beginning part of the game it would have been amazing, but it wasn't. I refunded this game as quickly as a I could. Extremely disappointed.			"

												I've had some time now in both the single and multiplayer game. First of all I have NO ISSUES with the graphics. I am using a 750TI (stop laughing) with the latest driver and even on medium am getting no slow down that I can see. The single player game at first feels a little on rails and with that being the biggest complaint of the original game that was scary, but once you get out of the ""tutorial"" it becomes much more open world and feels sorta similar to like the Gotham games and Assassins Creed in that you can run around the map doing a variety of activities and follow the story mission as you please. The multiplayer is more similar to a game like Vermintide ... you start off in a lobby where you can customize your character and set your loadout etc .. but then you join missions in four man groups and run them. This was a tiny bit disappointing to me as I was hoping for a open world co-op campaign, but that said I loved Vermintide so I am also enjoying this. As you progress you earn money and XP to unlock skills and buy crates that have all kinds of things from guns to gear to customization opens in them. Combat feels fine to me. The guns are responsive enough and I am especially enjoying both the shotgun and marksman rifle. The cover system works well enough and theres a good enough variety of norks to keep it interesting and force you to think through encounters. Overall this was a game I was waiting for and so far I dont feel let down by it. Or at least not enough that I would recommend against its purchase. In fact I am trying to drag my friends who I played Vermintide in with me. :3			"

												3 hours in and so far it's a really fun game. The visuals for a torn apart city are really good and I like the stealth elements. Deep Silver's involvment is definetly noticable, as this game has a lot of similarities with Dying Light. Just substitute hordes of zombies for well trained and armed korean soldiers and instead of having a lot of melee weapons, it's a ton of guns.The customization part is really cool but I quickly found myself using specific guns and configurations, though side jobs force you out of that by requiring so many kills with a specific weapon.Honestly, I was worried, given a lot of the initial bad reviews, and I don't think it's warranted. I can see where some people are having performance issues though, cause even on my i7/980ti rig there are some hick ups, but not during combat (whenever it autosave it pauses for a moment). Hopefully a few patches take care of those.Have not tried the co-op yet.TL:DR version - If you liked Dying Light and enjoy stuff like Red Dawn (old or new), this game is really entertaining.			"

												To anyone who loves a true single driven story mode game, this game is honestly not for you. The beginning of the game fools you at first with its nice intro but then completely loses its edge when it goes upon your first mission and goes down hill from there... if you want a game that is a clone of ""the division"" go on.... keep playing or buy this game...if you want something more fun...look someplace else and save 60.$ of your hard earned money.

												Final Verdict:If you have the cash or you are able to burn money....buy itIf not, get Doom and wait for this to either go on sale or have a price dropALL ISSUES ARE TECHNICAL. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THEM, WAIT FOR UPDATESMAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS OR THE GAME WILL RUN LIKE POOSo far, it's better than expected....And before you get all mad cause there is tech issues and I am reccomending it, let's be clear here. I got the game running pretty well now. This review is based ON GAMEPLAY ALONE. Yes 60 dollars is a lot and yes there is no excuse. But it's why I put the disclaimer at the top. If you can be ready to fix the game, then read this reccomendation, if not....don't buy it.IT'S THAT SIMPLEI am enjoying the little time I have in it so far, I suggest trying it!!!Reminds me of a lot of games that got mixed reviews that I actually loved.Now here is the truth, I am waiting to refund on the sole purpose that I am not sure how Dambuster will improve the issues I bring to the table. The game is there, it's amazing at times, but the immersion killing and pre-2012 feel reminds me of another game that had a horrible release....Sleeping Dogs.If after Day one...two...maybe three there is no patch from the devs. I am refunding until stuff gets fixedFor now here is a brief review.+Farcry in the city+Customization+Loads of things to do+A huge world+Havent experienced any game breaking bugs like people claim to be having+Gunplay is amazing-optimization issues-lip sync sucks-graphics kinda blow-AI sometimes block door ways-Cursor Bug if you alt-tab-AI is pretty dumb when it comes to path finding--Will update review as times progresses--			"

												There were a few big surprises in store for me when I first started this game. The first surprise was that the FOV slider was terrible and only ranges from 40 to 65, and the highest you can go through configs seems to be 90. The second was that despite what I thought, this isn't actually Homefront 2. The first Homefront was flawed, but interesting. It took a semi-plausible story of a unified Korea becoming a global power and invading the US, and while the game wasn't great the presentation was on-point, using a mix of out-of-context real news clips, fictional newspapers detailing the various fallings of the US infastructure during the invasion, and the use of real-world brands as stores and locations. There were moments where you were able to stop shooting and listen to civilians in their encampments, and most of the time they only had criticism to offer because of the KPA's retaliation efforts to the resistance, taking away the ""you're the hero"" feeling that other shooters like Call of Duty tend to revel in. It all gave the game a uniquely realistic approach that I haven't seen in any other game. It was unfortunate that the main supporting character was an unlikeable dork and the gameplay was the bog standard CoD shooting, and so it was forgotten until now - or so I thought. Homefront: The Revolution actually seems to have forgotten the original entirely, and the backstory has been completely rewritten into a generic mess that depicts North Korea just kind of magically becoming the new Apple and even arming the entire US army before using a deactivator chip that they stole from Black Ops 2 to disable our military, and so it begins from there.As you've probably seen from the other reviews, the game is fairly buggy. It doesn't always run well, and even when it does run well seemingly random things will eagerly tank your framerate, like looking at a burning car. The AI is terrible, and the only reason they have any chance of killing you is because they seem to respawn constantly. If you die, you reload at a checkpoint, but the ammo and medkits you used don't get restored, and I'm still not sure if it's a glitch or intentional. You'll no doubt run into various other bugs that I didn't, but suffice to say the game could use some work.With that being said, if it does run, it's not bad, and that's the only reason I'm recommending it positively. It's essentially an offspring of modern Far Cry games, and with that you can pretty much tell what to expect - taking on outposts, stealth that doesn't always work, exploring for caches, equipment and upgrades, etc. There are other new features, like parts where you have to work in a particular city area to rally the public to fight against the KPA, but for the most part it plays it relatively safe, and I'm okay with that. The two weapon limit is used interestingly in that your character is apparently a gun wizard and can change guns into entirely different guns by swapping everything except the handle out on the fly, so your pistol is also an SMG and a pneumatic launcher while your assault rifle can be an LMG or a grenade launcher at any moment. There's also 2 full Timesplitters 2 levels in it for you to play, for those of you who are familiar with Free Radical's older games.I'd recommend waiting on this game if you get it at all in case it doesn't run for you as well as it does for me, but it's all around pretty decent. The story still feels a bit rushed and anticlimactic just like the first game, but it's passable and doesn't detract from the entertainment. Even though the game plays it safe and ultimately still copies another game, they at least picked a good one to copy this time, and differentiated it enough to keep things from being stale. I'm sure for now there are better games you could get, but Homefront not-2 isn't a terrible choice either.			"

												I cant understand that the gaming market does have alot of multiplayer games but homefronts multiplaer was one of the better ones, and to release the game without this is just admitting defeat and calling yourself failures,  you can still save this game... there is till time... multiplayer will bring more people to this game...  or maybe you dont care about the game... please listen to your community not your investers. This is a great franchise with alot of potential, listen to the fans and you can make this title alot better.  Dont do what you want, do what the fans want. multiplayer is huge right now but co-op for this type of title is weak. You guys either had one of two thoughts: 1. Muiltiplayer is too much work lets just release the game...or...2. Co-op is massive right now, ""thats a great idea"". NOOOOOOO co-op is good but not for a title like this, if you do not implement multiplayer, then you fail to listen to your public.			"

												30 minutes in the main ""character"" gets strapped to (another) chair and almost tortured by one of his fellow resistance fighters because he is immediately mistaken to be a spy. What is his response to this? Absolutely nothing. Because he's a silent protagonist who was going to sit there and have his nipples cut off by some chick who he is allied with. Oh, but lucky for him the leader waltzed in and checked for his ID just in time to save those precious nips.Other than that, a 980Ti handled the game on MAX 1080p like garbage (stuttering/constant drops in FPS at 60Hz) while just running around the starting area.

												From what i've played of the game so far it seems to be pretty decent, It's not gonna win any game of the year awards, but the world is gorgeous and very atmospheric. The gunplay is borderline exceptional IMO. There are a few glitches,but nothing ground breaking. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty  and it seems this is how the game was meant to be played. It's not SUPER hard,but instead makes the AI pretty competent for the most part. The story is what you should be buying the game for. If youre a fan of single player story campaigns give this game a shot. I would probably give it like...UMMM 6.7/10 something like that. its worth buying,but once you finish the story your unlikely to play the game again.			"

So that's it for the optimization. The vehicle physics are cool, the feature that you can upgrade your weapons and attach everything on it.Also if you don't know the multiplayer experience is awesome, and it's fun with friends.So please don't look at the fake negative reviews and buy this, it's worth the money.

												So I was pretty excited for this game, but had mixed feelings. Turns out I should have listen to my gut. This game is a terrible mess. I have a few hours in now and all I do is run around and kill the infinite enemies that spawn randomly. I honestly don't think the develoupers of this game knew what ""Guerilla"" warfare was. However I will give it credit in some places. So here goes my pros/cons listPros:-Driving around in the motorcycle is suprisinly smooth.-Weapon mods are cools to watch putting on/ taking off.-Melee kills are smooth and generally pretty good-You can knife kill vehicles by hitting then in the glowing yellow spotCons:-The AI is utterly stupid-No real benefit to actually attacking in a guerilla style-Graphics are very dated-Gunplay is pretty bland-Enemies have a magic ability to transfer your location to ALL enemies in the area-Feels like an arcade shooter that tried to be tactical "

The open-world is great, full of loot and the gameplay features plenty of weapon and gear upgrades to chase. The weapons themselves have been fun, and the on-the-fly modding is fun. It's possible to recruit several AI followers to help you with quests, and you have to think a little bit before attempting to tackle them - it's not always possible to run in guns blazing. There's verticality in the environment that you have to use, and more than one kind of stealth that is necessary.My main complaints would be that the enemies are capable of killing you within a few shots, which has led to a few frustrating moments where I've been sent back to square one. It's not always clear which way is the best to tackle missions and quests, but having said that, I'm still playing. I think this is a way better game than what the reviews have been saying. I haven't had any performance problems, though, which would probably change my opinion of the game if I did have them.			"

												It's so great to be back to unfold after the Golden Bridge! This Homefront 2 is inspire from orginal Homefront when North Korea invade to America. It's remind me of ""Turing point: Fall of Liberty"" for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC, when Nazi take over New York. I really enjoy to be imagine what look like and WHAT IF it happen to our country, it make me roll up my sleeves to take action to protect our nation. I like it.Just ignore those BS negative attack this game, they just WHINING over frivolous things.  I give this game TWO THUMB UP AND FIVE STAR! :-D Kupo!			"

												Playing through this game designers single player campaign for about twenty five hours (deathwish or hardest difficulty setting), here is a review from an individual that has played FPS and TPS for over a decade, as well as actually having played this game. The combat of this game is very strategic, visceral, and frenetic with fluid navigation (including parkouring) providing mobility and stealth options with quality graphics and a believable immersive experience utilizing Cryteks CryEngine. As this game went through about three iterations of game designers, the completed product is a testament to persistence and the ability of these game designers to bring cohesion to a game for release to the marketplace. The subgroup of areas or yellow and red zones provide the player with unique challenges and game play styles. The start of the game requires thought and some previous FPS experience, played through the first area for five hours with only the side arm. Those with negative comments of this game might not have either the patience or skill to play this type of game, intuitive strategies such as knowing when to fight or retreat is a valuable trait during game play, this is acquired as an individual moves through the game and combat encounters. Knowing trigger points as well as upgrading abilities and weapon upgrades is vital to enjoying the game. The importance of approaching this game with the perspective of just learning to survive, to become strong enough to competently engage in combat and overpower the enemy A.I. is very challenging and rewarding, as every victory brings you closer to turning the tide against the oppression of the occupying force. In game rise of the resistance as the player completes objectives empowers the player with a sense of actually affecting the game, characters, and story. The day night cycles are very well incorporated, with night scenes immersing the player in a desolate wasteland of a nearly recognizable civilization, the amount of detail is exceptional with some clever game design such as utilizing motorcycles for generating power within the game designed world to advance, searching for resistance stashes with vertical movement through city dwellings. Every component in game has a reason for its existence, this enhances the feeling that one is truly working as part of a resistant movement to regain ones liberty. Variety of locations design is remarkable with memorable landscapes and environmental design. Weapons utilities are various with unique modifications empowering the player with about fifteen unique weapons, each upgradable and customizable for specific scenarios, including the clever utilization of weapons delivery via Remote control vehicle. Gear upgrades are very valuable, acquired through looting environmental objects and disenfranchised enemy A.I.. Pacing is important for enjoying this game, as well as a sense of awareness of your surroundings, and understanding how to effectively implement the various strategy exploits that the game designers have designed into the game world. Such as the resistances schematics throughout the resistance strongholds describing these advantages over the occupying enemy force, that these NPC have lived through this enemy occupation, and mainly in game cut scenes, all this increases the sense of immersion with this game world. The ability to travel through the world with a motorcycle adds for some exhilarating experiences, or the option to recruit up to four comrades to fight through specific objectives is vital, as these recruits actually fight with you, where some games these crew are a distraction to absorb bullets. Everyone that enjoys a quality FPS gaming experience will find much to enjoy with this game. Thank You and much appreciation to these game designers and everyone that had the determination and perseverance to bring this game to the marketplace, Good Work.			"

												Just a quickie on the single playerLike far cry but with a subjectively more interesting setting and motivation offset by poor performance that greatly impacts the flow of gameplay (specifically the shooting). Be ready to run it low in order to preserve framerate (becomes a much better experience) and make the shooting feel a lot better. Play it for...- the world- the environmental storytelling- the yellow zones - the general feeling of being a member of an outnumbered and out gunned resistance- chunky guns  be aware of...- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI - Poor optimisation - Shallow characters- debatable motorbike handling - a general lack of polish If you like to get lost in a world, don't mind making your own fun/ narrative within the loose story and have the hardware to ignore poor optimisation or make it passable then you will probably love the gameplay and feel of it. Ignore the story			"

												This game was supposed to be something I was always going to get when it dropped down in price, and now it has. But alas, the game is unplayable as you are force to play in 10 min intervals (Freezeing and crashing on a rig it shouldn't) As someone from Philadelphia I wanted to explore the game and get a real feel for how a team makes my city in game. I wish I could have witnessed it but it froze over 5 times in a short 88 min play.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is an interesting game, and it does split the masses a little due to its hardware antics.First things first, I can run the game fine, despite not having the latest hardware. It runs around 45-60fps on high @ 1440p, so I'm happy. It has Denuvo - so what? Far Cry Primal had it, TW Warhammer has it, again, doesn't really matter to me.So, let's talk about the game. Visually, it is quite pretty, on occasion actually REALLY pretty, the CryEngine does a really good job displaying a grim, broken city, with amazing nights and reflections, okay looking explosions, but overall believable looking effects, rain, fire and smoke, Music and sound wise, it is a bit bland, the background music is overall a bit forgettable (as it is quite repetitive), but some of the set pieces have a really nice background. Sounds are good, weapons sound good, explosions sound fantastic, and soldiers and civilians sound great and add a lot to the atmosphere.Gameplay wise - I struggled a bit. There are many cool things you can do with regards to ambushes, distractions, a couple of free-running places and lots and lots of gunfire. However on occasion it feels a bit unbalanced, but I guess that comes with an ""open world"" kind of feel of the areas you are operating in. Do I find it bad? No, but it could do with a bit of tightening up, if that makes sense (once you played some of the different objectives you'll know what I mean).Now, story: This is sadly the weakest point of the game, mostly because it feels a bit weak by comparison to the setting. I played the original Homefront, and while the acting was hit-and-miss, it felt more connected and pushing you forward. From what I've played so far (and admittedly, I did not finish it yet), there are a few pieces that are fantastic and show what kind of (positive / negative) impact you do to the civilians by your guerilla actions, and there is one scene where I felt properly immersed (I'm not talking about the intro), so it does have its good bits.Overall, it is a good game. It isn't a great game, but it isn't a bad game either. Considering what the game went through (publishers, starts, stops, developer changes, etc), it has its quirk and its own charme, some elements are done really well, others could have done with a bit more love, but it does feel like a worthy successor to Homefront (which I liked a lot back then). I can see myself getting my money's worth out of the single player campaign alone, and I imagine I will be enjoying some of the co-op elements for a while. Based on that, I recommend this game, I'm having a lot of fun with it, visually it is great, and I do want to finish it and try the co-op this weekend.			"

												Being a person who really enjoyed the first game, I bought Homefront: The Revolution, and finished it through. It certainly is different than the first, but not necessarily in a terrible way. I don't think it is as good, but definitely does have great elements of it's own. Here is what I found:PROS:-You are not too powerful, the KPA can take you down easily if you are not careful (when faced with a part of town completely occupied by KPA, you must sabotage KPA tech and save citizens. After you've proved that the citizens can  take back whats been taken, more will join the resistance)- Graphics are amazing, this is probably one of the largest factors that really add play value - It is very exciting when you get into conflict. The mechanics work very well when fighting, again being a large factor in          play value. Plus, when any freedom fighters are near you, they'll help you.- Customization is unique and flexible- Ideas for the visuals are real atmospheric - You can ride motorbikes!- America!CONS:-Glitchy Textures- Spawning is pretty bad (units will pop up and disappear out of nowhere)-  Voice animations very unstable-   Story is not so strong (you can't really ""feel"" the characters)-    Weapons look bulky/oversized in the hands of the Ai-     Optimization is tricky for many people's computers apparently, but if you figure out the right settings, it'll run just fine-       Dramatically different from the first game(the first was awesome) -        Not worth the full price, if you are looking forward to it, buy it on sale""Home Is Where The War Is""			"

That being said Co-Op is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sale its mission based survial at best.

												firstly, this may change as I have yet to put in 1 hour of game play as of yet (pizza delivered and catch up on gotham so, you know priorities).as of now I am already in love, no firefights as of yet, just some walking around through the streets, beaten up by resistance members,but wow! the graphics are beautiful. not encountered any bugs as of yet, and had no lag in game play.all graphics on max and running beautifully.my only con is, I am confused as to if this is a sequel to the original Homefront. the opening story leads me to believe it is not,as it gives a slightly different story to the KPA being on the east coast, however with that aside, I am beyond happy with the wait so far.

												I REALLY want to recommend this game, but this game does not want me to recommend it to you. This game has a bad case of Duke Nukem Forever, it is obvious that this was not a completed product but since it was move from one developer to another they felt the pressure to just get the game out on market. I was looking forward to this game quite a bit, and it did not fail completely out of my personal return policy requirements, but I can not recommend it to other people in all fairness. If they can fix their broken crap I would happily change this review into a positive. Right now though wait to buy this game. If they fix it great pick it up, if not you will save your money on a 85% finished product. Full once over here

												The most important thing for an FPS shooter is the shooting! Go figure, right.Using mouse and keyboard is just awful. IT's totally meant for console. No M & Ksetting except sensitivity.That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! it's like the mouse lags and can;t catch up to my movements.Also If you shot your weapon at any time in the game the KPA will swarm you and never stop! This game just doesn't work any an ""open world"" shooter. It's just that awful. God why did i buy this even for $25 it's not worth it. People always say games are terrible. Il ike to judge for myself, and this is terrible. There's no fixing this game. it can't be done. It would need a wholw year give or take to redo the shooting and AII feel like im on ice or something. Controller isn't much better. For now the game is running decentat !440p on a heavily OC'd 980 SC and 3770k 16gb ram What's worse for me is the shooting is about the worse i've come across since Aliens colonial mariens.As i see the game right now, it's not worth it. Not even the $25 i paid. So i will try to what for some moreupdates from the devs before i give a full review. As it stands now, i can't recommend this game.As of 9/1/2016 still no fixes. Still runs, and looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Weapons are boring and no fun to use No cool loot to find, NPC's are still dumb as hell. Over all the game is just boring, simple as that.Those who gave this a good rating, and recommended it didn't play the game  more than 3 hour's.But, it's the best game ever, right? those wh ogave it a bad review, and didn't recommend it, played it 8 hours or more. Game is a snooze fest, don't buy even at a discount. Dev's don't deserve your money.			"

												CAUSE OF LOW PERFORMANCE IS: WINDOWS 8 AND WINDOWS 10Users with weaker systems but Windows 7 have higher performance than High end systems using any version of Windows that is higher than Win 7....There you go. That's the culprit...If your windows version is higher than Windows 7 ...you're gonna have problems. Devs need to work on optimization for Windows 8 and Windows 10 If not, this is the cause: ""Don't see what the problem is...I'm running it with a stock GTX 970 at 2103x1314 (Nvidia DSR). Performance is 50+ FPS in combat and stable. I don't see what all the crying is about. Probably the same thing as always. People blindly turn all the graphic settings to the max like idiots. Keep in mind that , just like any game, some graphical settings make absolutely no difference in visuals but reduce FPS immensly and more importantly, also keep in mind that some settings not only reduce your FPS by a lot, they also downgrade the visuals. Settings like post processing for example that just make everything look blurry and remove 20 FPS from your performance. You can have the game look amazing and run great with the right settings..... Max Graphical settings does not equal max visual quality...as I said. Turning up / enabling certain settings will reduce visual quality ( and FPS) in this game just like any other game.... NOOB: "" OH, if I want the game to look as good as possible, I have to turn up the settings to the max"" Nope, that's a fallacy. As for gameplay it's an enjoyable game. I think that people are having their experience ruined and calling this game trash because of their poor performance that they cause because they don't know what each setting really does and blindly try to turn everything to the max like idiots..""

												This is quite early for a review, but who knows, I might alter it later ;)For the time I've played now I enjoy most of the game. I really like the guerilla like warfare, where you have to think before you act, and not just run out guns blazing. Running pretty much all settings on low and with 1360x768 (I really need to upgrade... x3) But the game still runs smoothly. Got a GTX 760 and some kind of AMD processor, don't look at me for figuring out if you'll run the game ;DOnly encountered a few problems during the first hour, like a mission wouldn't get triggered, so I had to load the last checkpoint for it to work, and when I first triggered it it was a little confusing to understand what I was supposed to do. (Might also just have been me not paying close attention, who knows) But as soon as the first mission was done, and I got my second objective, it was easier to get into, and to start to learn how things work in the city. This review is already far too long for my short playtime, so I'll just stop here. Overall I recommend this game, I guess xD(Might turn this review more seriously and informative as I play the game more)			"

												This Game... where do I start.Ok. First I can defintley say that doom is down right better than this. BUT, its not to say that this game is bad. It has many issues with optimization and lip syncing. But those as of now is pretty meaningless to me. Hear me out. The story is pretty lacking to say the least. but with enough beer its pretty fun. The gunplay is a bit choppy prob due to the random frame drops (its not my pc, 4770 and 2 Titans in SLI, 1440p 144hz, ussually 60-50 fps, but will drop to 20 sometimes). The gameplay is almost like far cry 3,4 (more like 3 but aspects of 4 is there) and is pretty fun for a run and gun kind of guy. the stealth is down right horrible with the frame drops, and the ai to be trolly at times, is just painful. The customization is awesome, it was the best thing in crysis if you ask me. And the Soundtrack is not that bad, the composer shoud get a raise.All in all it has its problems, but if this game is ever on sale for $30 maybe $40, its a good pick up.7/10			"

												There is a crossbow, that you can turn into a flamethrower.11/flamethrowerIn all seriousness, I've been waiting 5 years for a sequel to Homefront, and this game is not it.What made the first one such a great gem?Fast paced movie like singleplayer with a great story, amazing geared koreans who look badass AF  and best of all an AMAZING multiplayer experience that is a perfect balance between CoD and BF yet creative and original.Where did HF:the revolution go wrong?The multiplayer, where is the godamn multiplayer? where are the unlocks, the vehicles, the kickass weapons like the PWS diablo and the T3AK? The singleplayer is fine as far I have played and the koreans have amazing gear, but where is the iconic PWS diablo? After all this game has been trough(RIP thq) I think it deserves a reccommendation, but only because the singleplayer is far better then the last Battlefields and CoD campaigns.I think they can fix the game by adding big multiplayer maps like the first one, add the same killstreak system, vehicles, unlocks, more guns, drones all the crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥that made the first game so enjoyable.You guys literally took the weakness of the first game and made it your strongest, make a singleplayer that last longer then 5 hours, but you forgot the rest of it that made such a good game.my real score: 7.5/flamethrower crossbows.

												There really should be two kinds of reviews - one for those who actually played the game, and one for those who didn't get to play it for any number of reasons. Of course you wouldn't recommend a game that doesn't work, but that unfair in the overall review percentage for those of us that actually played the game with ok framerate.There's a number of techinal issues with this game, but so have a lot of games, and there's not (for me in any case) enough of them to ruin the game. The overall gameplay and visual style is really good, and if you like Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4, there's not really any good reason why you wouldn't like this as well (provided you can actually run the game).The story is boring and uninteresting, but so were all the Far Cry games and I don't think the story is the point in this one. As good as no multiplayer game ever had a story, but since a story isn't expected, no one cares. This game is about looting for cash to upgrade and taking over bases and absorbing the post-apocalyptic landscape and atmosphere.I see people dislike the game for being repetetive, but I can't really remember any open world game that wasn't.  If you like what you're playing, repetetiveness isn't negative - you just want more of the game. If you don't like the game to begin with, then of course the repetetiveness is like walking though Hell. The game really feels like a Fallout reskin of Far Cry 4 (with a dash of Dying Light), and that's more than good enough for me, even with the technical issues and silly AI.The mixed reviews is really unfair, it's a good game if you take it for what it is - a postapocalyptic FPS shooter with some minor RPG in it. And it even has a coop mode with characters and levels (although I haven't gotten around to that yet).  People tend to complain that the game is short. I'm well over 30 hours and I'm not finished yet, although I do everything there is to do. I also don't rush trough on easy. I recommend playing at Deathwish difficulty to make the game last and to have an actual challenge.I'll leave you off with a 7/10 rusty nails and a warning: It's not really open world, it's just not linear; the levels are big and square instead of straight - that way you can choose your own entry points when taking out bases.

												I have been reading the reviews and i am completely shocked. The game is wonderful in my honest opinion. I have a R9 290x, with a i7 5820k. On default settings, I haven't dropped below 70 FPS. The voice acting i feel is a little lopsided (Important characters are louder than unimportant characters, but what game isn't like that?) The opening cutscene, the gunshots are not synced up visually to audibly. Other than that, the premise of the game, the story (so far) and the character bonding is great. I feel like people are destroying this game in the reviews WAY too early. Soon the devs will release patches to fix any issues people have with ""tearing"" and ""hiccups"". Until then, people may have to deal with a few issues, but what game doesn't have issues 10 hours into the release. Also, it feels alot like Far Cry 3 story, and mechanic wise. 8/10 no doubt. the -2 is only due to the sync issues i saw at the beginning cutscene. Seems like an easy problem to fix, so kinda confused on why it wasn't fixed before release.			"

												BUYER BEWARE!!! So this is what i sent steam.          This is my 3rd attempt refund of this crappy game i am disgusted to have in my library. As i said in my 2nd request,i started the game again(after about 1.5hr not aware of 2hr playtime limit) with a friend for second opinon to see if he might like to buy, also i would of spent at least half an hour adjusting graphic settings in game. I like to not rush my games , as this game has a nice intro/start,but when you finaly start to open up the game to see its true colours i was thourghly DISSAPOINTED. After using up 35.5GB i wanted to play enough to be sure i didnt like it ,and starting the game again to show friend put me over 2hr limit(when you try to refund for the first time you find this out). 2hr playtime limit for some games i think may not be sufficiant because these days games are alot involved and need some time to get to terms with? STEAM PLEASE REFUND, as this has been an expensive first time lesson! Saved money for summer sale and would like to swap for GTA5 please, cmon steam be a good sport.   After all this im just a little girl and they still declined me.....$#@!			"

												Why not recommend this game?Well...  at first it seems like a decent game but when you are playing on the highest difficulty and the AI is so dumb that you can run straight throught a group of enemies and shoot some of them on the way and they just keep standing and perhaps turn to the direction where you came from BUT they don't do anything to stop you before you've gone so far that they despawn. Please, the AIs' reflexes are on the same level as a potato is.The devs tried to make the weapon system like the one in crysis where you can change parts on the go which is nice and otherwise it seems like a decent game, but I just couldn't take the dumbness of the AI.

YouTube™ Video: Homefront: The Revolution - Review 

			Views: 133		

			♥Follow Me♥ SUBSCRIBE►https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRWyiUnZCM_430gqrQ6F5Q?sub_confirmation=1 PLAYLIST►https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVeiB6pURlIUtqS5-HV4WP3vlTFCcuLFd Homefront: The...		

Text Review,Taking place in 2029. The game opens with an exposition dumping cinematic that tells the tale of a what-if America. What if Silicon Valley developed in North Korea, instead of California? What if America owed North Korea a bunch of debt, and defaulted on said debt? What if we dabbled in geo-politics but then quickly ran from it as soon as we remembered that’s not what your average first person shooter fan enjoys in their video games?Homefront could have been something unique, and that’s its greatest crime. It’s got a cool premise as far as video game storylines go. The issue is it does absolutely nothing with it. You play as Beef Stock, a mute freedom fighter working alongside other non-characters. Early on you’re involved in a raid that sees the Christ-like hero of the revolution captured. It’s bizarre seeing all the side characters talking about the hero character while you carry the team. They begin giving you more credit as the game progresses, but you never become the chosen one despite being the people’s savior. It’s sort of refreshing, but again, the game does jack all with it. I’d love to play as a substantial side-character alongside the protagonist, making my mark on the story but having my sacrifices ultimately forgotten. I thought Halo Reach did a great job of this. It’s a Revolution story and I’m not a martyr? All Homefront needed to do was take some chances. Instead it plays it numbingly safe.This predictability isn’t confined to the game’s story. The mechanics are cookie-cutter Ubisoft, complete with zones to “liberate, and towers that reveal portions of the map. You’ve seen this checkbox gameplay before and better. Not a true open world, Homefront’s maps are more akin to a Deus Ex than a Far Cry. Hubs are small city blocks sectioned off by fast travel points. When you enter a new zone, you’ll need to keep your guns tucked away while you disable speaker systems, blow up gas tanks, and generally cause enough havoc to inspire the populace to rise up. This is cool the first time you do, not so much the fourth and fifth. The shooting feels solid and surprisingly like the first game’s despite being on a different engine. Shots feel impactful and enemies react accordingly. You also can’t take too many hits, adding an air of lethality to the world and your struggle. Homefront isn’t a hard game, but it can be if you get careless.The only vehicles include a motorcycle, though the enemy uses drones. Even the near-future technology isn’t all that intriguing. You use a smartphone seemingly hacked to use the North Korean’s infrastructure, but everything is assumed. You’re also constricted to using your own antiquated weapons, but the game never outright says why. A simple mention by one of the characters about finger print safety measures would go a long way. It’s little details like this that make worlds engaging. Homefront feels like a with a thousand ideas without the gusto to go for any of them. The game had a complicated development cycle that I rather not get into. What you need to know is that Free Radical of Timesplitters fame, worked on this game. This even manifests itself in-game as an Easter egg arcade machine lets you play two levels of Timesplitters 2. This juxtaposition only serves to make returning to the world of Homefront even more difficult.On a positive note, level design is diverse with zones ranging from chemical wastelands, to dictatorial idealization. I don’t have much else to say that’s overly positive. The game has maybe two antagonists, while all enemy soldiers are masked nobodies. This makes it hard to think of them as people. The game runs well but I’m really digging at this point. It’s all so by-the-numbers, I was surprised humans made it and not a computer. After 20 hours, it’s difficult to feel any kind of emotion towards Homefront. All I ask, is for a game to have an identity. Homefront chose to wear a mask instead.			"

												I noticed a lot of negative reviews on here... Still purchased.  I have a custom system I built of 2x 980 Ti Hybrids in SLI that are OC and a 4790k on water but stock @ 4 GHz. I'm running 1080p @ 144Hz and I have 32GB RAM. I'm running Nvidia driver version 365.19. I should also mention that my rig has been a labor of love that's been a rollout upgrade since 2014.Turn off super-sampling and the stupid motion blur so you can play and drink without vomiting and I've had no issues. I ran into several issues with super-sampling and motion blur on but once that was kicked, the game is VERY enjoyable even though it needs to be tweaked. I can't honestly give this a bad review after seeing the graphics and the gameplay. Yes, there are some shortcuts taken that are obvious. However, this team spent a lot of time on this game and to me it shows. I've been able to play this maxed out (minus motion blur and super-sampling) on my 1080p @ 144Hz monitor no problem and even though the voice acting is bad according to some reviews, (BARF who cares) I like the game so far. Once into the game, it strikes me very much like Farcry 4 where you conquer territories (Philly) and upgrade weapons with the option of advancing the main mission at your leasure. I forgot to mention that the Korean voice actors seem spot on!       I'm honestly not trying to come off like a♥♥♥♥♥♥when I say I have had no issues and I enjoy the game. I've been told that my specs make everything awesome but I assure you that is not the case on custom builds by people like me who know just enough to be dangerous to risk losing lots of money if I failed at the build. Been there, done that. Sometimes different manufacturers products hate eachother and you realize you made a bad decision...Anyway, I am the honest and dissenting voice it seems and I like this game so far and at this point I would purchase it again. I have had no crashes, no graphics issues other than mentioned, and I love the game so far.EDIT: Finished the game!! Noticed TONS of FPS issues in late game to the point where the game was not playable at ALL even on my high-end system. I closed the game enitrely and restarted but that didnt help. Only a complete reboot of my rig would allow me to continue at playable FPS. I suspect game data remains in the GRAM and RAM unless a reboot is performed or real-time data is poor and bogs down the system. I still recommend the game but wow did they waste all of that effort with extremely poor optimization. What a kick in the nuts to those hard workers... It's like building a skyscraper on a Jello foundation. Why? Just why? I also find it hard to believe that an employee did not bring up these CRUSHING PROFIT PERFORMANCE ISSUES before release. I know these issues were brought up at BETA from players but for some reason the decision was made to press on and ignore. Seriously, think of the money and accolaids that could have been had if you released a quality product instead of releasing pig vomit performance and play catch-up as you go... Also, a free upgrade of digital crap does not satisfy anybody if you CAN'T PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!			"

												Pro's- I was really grabbed in the beginning by the story about a revolution, it has very good characters and the voice actors really make the characters feel real! No repetitive main missions, every new main mission is a new experience. I never got bored with the main missions. Great animations including finishers, reloading guns, and interactions with other NPCs. Not a COD cliche story and action like the first Homefront. Has over 30 hours of main story gameplay.Con's- Graphics can be better because they are working with the Cryengine. The permocrence needs a lot of work I have a AMD FX 8350 and a GTX 970 and I can't play above low so wait for performance patches. There are MANY glitches and the AI is really bad very easy compat on easy I would recommend going Normal or Hard difficulty. The multiplayer is a full rip of any other ♥♥♥♥ing shooter barely no guns, repetitive team deathmatch, choosing classes doesnt matter its who ever pulls the trigger first and bad connection issues.6/10 It's ok			"

												I really wanted to like this game. In fact, I preordered it. Unfortunately, the gameplay is mediocre at best.The AI is plagued with pathfinding problems. More often than not you will get stuck in a room while your recruits block the exit; forcing you to either dismiss them of kill them. The enemy AI is very poor; at medium difficulty the game is way too easy.The theme appealed me a lot, but because of all the problems, you do not get immersed in what was supposed to be a rebellion against foreign forces.The graphics obviously suffer from the fact that this is a multiplatform game and textures have to be toned down for the PS4 and Xbox One.Lastly, there are some serious optimization issues. I have a fairly decent PC with a 980 TI Strix and still I get poor frame rate from time to time.Sorry, I cannot recommend this game. "

												Why not recommend this game?Well...  at first it seems like a decent game but when you are playing on the highest difficulty and the AI is so dumb that you can run straight throught a group of enemies and shoot some of them on the way and they just keep standing and perhaps turn to the direction where you came from BUT they don't do anything to stop you before you've gone so far that they despawn. Please, the AIs' reflexes are on the same level as a potato is.The devs tried to make the weapon system like the one in crysis where you can change parts on the go which is nice and otherwise it seems like a decent game, but I just couldn't take the dumbness of the AI.

												Not a great game, but still a good game. I won't say that everyone else reviewing the game is wrong or lying, but personally I didn't experience a single performance issue and I'm running on a pretty old graphics card on medium, solid 40fps. The story wasn't great, rather boring actually, but the gameplay was absolutely brilliant. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 or 4 then it's likely you will like how this game handles as it's very similar, just a little more clunky. This is definitely a game you rather hate or love, and I loved running around the street of Philly shooting up soliders for the resistance, and the weapon customisation was very helpful for changing up your gameplay on the run. Plus who doesn't love a shotgun that fires bloody incendiary grenades?Don't buy this game for it's story, it's mediocre. This game is worth it for about half price for the gameplay.			"

												Just played the single-player campaign. Didn't experience many bugs, some odd AI behaviour here and there, nothing serious. And by far not as much as some write here. Characters are somewhat stereotypes but that was to be expected. Not sure if 60 bucks is justified, but I had fun and that's what counts. Pretty decent game.			"

												Pro's- I was really grabbed in the beginning by the story about a revolution, it has very good characters and the voice actors really make the characters feel real! No repetitive main missions, every new main mission is a new experience. I never got bored with the main missions. Great animations including finishers, reloading guns, and interactions with other NPCs. Not a COD cliche story and action like the first Homefront. Has over 30 hours of main story gameplay.Con's- Graphics can be better because they are working with the Cryengine. The permocrence needs a lot of work I have a AMD FX 8350 and a GTX 970 and I can't play above low so wait for performance patches. There are MANY glitches and the AI is really bad very easy compat on easy I would recommend going Normal or Hard difficulty. The multiplayer is a full rip of any other ♥♥♥♥ing shooter barely no guns, repetitive team deathmatch, choosing classes doesnt matter its who ever pulls the trigger first and bad connection issues.6/10 It's ok			"

												Don't know why this game has so many bad reviews, its not getting the credit it derserves. Probably people crying about the Online mode not being pvp.Compared to the first homefront game, it has completely changed. With it being open world and all.ProsDecent GraphicsOpen worldI found the story quite goodThe gameplay is unique with cryengine, feels alot more realistic than all the Call of Dutys i have played.The gun upgrades i liked quite alotGun Customization is really unique ConsLimited GunsCan feel reptitive at timesAfter a few hours of play a day you can get bored.The game can be abit annoying at times Overall its a decent fps, with a good story,  with an open world. You can tell the guys that made this game put alot of work into it, and i believe its better then any Call of duty story you will play, but the Online multiplayer is cooperation, its not so good, which i feel that its a bit of a let down, would of been good if they adopted the PVP from the first Homefront game.I would recommend buying the game as it can be a lot of fun most times, and if you looking for a FPS to kill alot of hours and liked Homefront 1, you most probably won't be dissapointed. I wouldn't listen to guys reviews if they havn't even gave the game a chance with like 2-4 hours of play. "

												This game is getting a lot of greif, simply because most computers seem to not be up to the task graphically to support this game. The game was a 35GB download, so you knew it was gonna be massive and that it was going to be graphically demanding. Besides a few FPS shuttering here and there, the game is great. That being said, I feel like this is a MAJOR improvement over the original Homefront, but there is still some room for development. The story could have been better developed and the map could have been a bit larger. Otherwise, this is a solid game!			"

												HTR is an awesome game, the story was exellent however I would have liked a character customization to make me feel like I was part of the game, seeing how we didn't get to see Ethan Brady's face through the entire game. The weapon customization is sweet but some of the attachments would have been used for more of weapons. The sound of the game was not okay, it seemed that the sound was taken from videos of weapons. The weapons didn't sound right, the gameplay sound was awful and backround sound was plain assault to the ears. The cut-sense was average, not 2016 graphics but more like 2013 graphics.Resistance Mode is a dissapontment, you can customize a character but you are given little to work with and items are unlocked through game play. You play on maps with other players trying to complete the task. If one of your team is down, you can revive them but if every player is down then its game over and you have to restart the mission. Players can even drop-in or drop-out of the game. The game is good to where you will keep playing it to the very end so i'd give this game a 6/10 score and would recommend gamers picking this game up.			"

												I bought this game because I liked the other homefront and I thought the trailers looked pretty cool. I downloaded the game and started playing, everything was fine until I beat the tutorial and actually started combat, Aiming feels akward, almost like your mouse is lagging and when you actually fire your weapon the recoil is very hard to manage, I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but either way it makes the experience suffer. Another thing that was unsatifactory was driving, I couldn't make any turns without crashing into walls and there was absolutley no way I could go up ramps (It was like driving a car in Hatred). Considering that those two things are major mechanics of the game it threw off the entire experince and I ended up refunding the game. However I will say that it had a few good parts; the graphics looked very nice (Although I feel like the devs put more time into them than the actual game mechanics) and the hacking bit that you could do with your phone was pretty cool too.

												The story isnt so formulaic as many on here claim it is. There are also some quality historical echoes involved with being a freedom fighter against a foreign power in Philadelphia amongst the twists in the story arc.It is less an open world shooter then it is a single path shooter with some extra areas to explore. I find that to be different enough from the mainstream games to be fresh. The graphics are top notch as well and I have had 0 issues with optimization. The only drawback as with many open world games is not all the terrain is smooth to operate on and there are some platform aspects that do not carry over so well.The voice acting? I grew up around Philly and I gotta say. The voice actors they chose are top notch. These people sound exactly like I would imagine the Philadelphian resistance to sound like. Gun nut philosopies and all. Even the dirt bikes fit the theme of Philly although I wish they were actually useful and controllable.Enemy AI is bad and the endless spawn in the open map is annoying. If you kill them fast enough and get cover away from the airships though, you're golden. A silenced pistol and skill with the crossbow are your friends. You will also learn to run away from your ambushes quickly .... that part is very realistic and I believe that to be their goal. This isnt a Rambo game. This isn't DOOM. You have to plan a bit before the shooting starts. Fortunately the AI is predictable and planning can be done with a minimal amount of scouting.Overall. This game is getting a bad rap. For what exactly? idk. I've played many games with overall positive reviews and worse mechanics/coding.This isn't The Division or Far Cry or DOOM. Apples and Oranges. It is a bit of everything and a little bit of the original Assassins Creed too.			"

												First off this game is not as terrible as everyone makes out. If you can look past the terrible story line and the poor graphics optimisation the game is fun, the open world combat is good, and weapon customisation is nice. I wish there was more weapons though.  It can be challenging at times which is good because most shooters these days such as BF4 and COD are just not challenging enough.  Being able to recruit soldiers to fight with you is good aswell.  I don't recommend paying full price for this game as there are better games out at the moment for the same price.  This game in my opinion is much better than Rainbow Six Siege and The Division which were huge disaspointments for me.			"

												Tried this on the free weekend. After sitting through the tedious, unskippable intro/cut scenes and boring tutorial sequence, I finally got to the resistance base and had to sit through obnoxious handholding and more dialogue. Made the fatal mistake of accidently exiting the area without crafting the molotovs as instructed, now I can't progress with the mission and the game won't let me go back into the base or load an earlier checkpoint. This left me with two options - waste another 10-15 minutes by starting again or quit out and uninstall the game. Have a wild guess what happened next.			"

												Just tried playing the single-player campaign for free because the previous one was good. After downloading it for over 2 days, I must say was terribly disappointed with the overall experience the game provided. Everything felt below par like a game developed perhaps five years ago. Story takes place in what feels like a post-apocalyptic world which was very much reminiscent of Metro 2033. Missions feel a tad like they are taken from Far Cry. Game-play doesn't feel smooth or enjoyable. Was pretty much hoping for the free duration to be over.			"

												I bought it for Eur 30 (thirty) and until now I've played for 6 hours, completed in Single Player a ""hearts and mind mission"" (star a revolt in a zone) , and I enjoyed it.The engine is quite fluid and also the graphics is good in my opinion. I have AMD FX 8350, 8 giga RAM DDR4, ATI Card 4 Giga.Also the AI BOT are quite good (at hard difficulty): they search for you in the zone if the spot you, they jump on building roofs (!), and also take cover, and start to shoot from far distance.Sometimes there is an AI bot bottleneck into bulding: they all come from the same door, you shoot and eliminate them all of them, they were 4 bots (but it happened only once).You can also engage allied AI bots, max 4 people, they automatically follow you: they essentially cover you when you advance.Eventually you also have to reach rooftoops, searching fo the right path (such as liberating tower in far cry). Nice ""mini-game"".So all in all, as the game is now patched, it is fun to play.The game style is a mix of far cry 2, far cry 4, metro last light, original homefront 1 (the setting).At last: Coop gameplay. I had today a coop match (3 people, infiltration mission). It was very fun to play. The gameplay was fluid.Hope this short comment will help in choosing the right game for you.			"

												1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsThe most mediocre Far Cry game ever.... oh waitHomefront: The Revolution is the 2016 apparent sequel (but really loosely) to Homefront. It was published by Deep Silver and developed by Dambuster Studios.It's not a bad game, but it's far from a great game either, it's got some really big issues, for instance a lackluster story, some really bad graphics at some points (This game uses CryEngine...) and a terrible AI. But the game has some big positives as well, for instance it's gameplay is actually really fun, it pretty much plays like FarCry and that's not a bad thing, it also has some really satisfying gunplay at points, and the world is actually pretty decent as you see the effects of the revolution take over certain areas, it really gives it a lively feel. I cannot give a comment about the multiplayer as it is dead most of the time, but I will say that taking away the amazing multiplayer from the original Homefront and opting in for a mission type multiplayer was a bad option and is ultimately just not worth it.The game is at times broken, there have been many points where I have just got stuck on an object or in an area for no reason, there was even one time where I fell through the map, now luckily the developers have been working their♥♥♥♥♥off to fix issues and comparing to what it was at release, it's pretty damn good, but not perfect yet.The story is bad, and it's a shame because at times you can see effort being put into the game, but there have been parts where I wonder ""Well where did this plot point go?"" and the answer is really, it ends either too suddenly or it was resolved in a pretty mediocre ending mission, it really seems that the story was rushed as like I said, it has some of it's ok moments, but it gets broke down the next moment by an awful segment where you go survive an ambush or destroy♥♥♥♥♥♥ and seriously if you don't like the concept of 'Go here, destroy that, kill this person' then you'll hate this game as that is all it is for pretty much the whole game.The AI is the biggest offense in the whole game, if anything I could say this AI is the worst in this type of game, i'd really put it to the point where I'd say it can be compared to Alien Colonial Marines AI, it's just broke, there was one mission where You had to escort a Goliath to destroy Drone Launchers, but he kept getting stuck on just the smallest piece of debris. Another moment is where you had to escort 2 SAM turrets, 1 got escorted fine, the other got stuck immediately after the 1st was escorted, and I had to go back to a checkpoint which luckily was right after the 1st got to it's objective. And really the addition of stealth is badly used, it's really not neccesary except for 1 mission, and the AI can either see you through objects or cannot see you when you're in front of them, it's actually a joke.Luckily as said the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing superb, it taking the style of FarCry's gameplay was a good option and it works brilliantly here, it's so satisfying to go around claiming areas, the gunplay is amazing, getting a takedown actually feels really satisfying depending on the situation and the feel of just being able to go all over the place wrecking havoc is great.And finally the world is mostly well done, the effects of the revolution are there, you can see you're actions taking effect over places, and it's so damn satisfying to look around areas that were once under complete KPA control to be now under revolution, it really gives this sense of success and victory, that your actions actually do something, and that surprised me because many other games don't do this well at all, but this game actually does.TL;DR+ Superb gameplay+ You're actions actually make an effect+ The Revolution!~ Multiplayer is swapped for a co-op.... it's also dead~ Graphics can be awful at times, this is a CryEngine game.~ Can be buggy at times, but is mostly under control now.- Terrible story- Crappy AIOverall it's a strong 6/10 game. I recommend to buy this game on sale.			"

												Okay, First of all-This game is not for those looking to have a pleasent gameplay experience, it is for those who had enjoyed the first homefront story (althugh this isnt a direct sequel.)You must know, this game is clunky as all F*ck. There are random frame rate drops, Vehicle controls are dodgy, Audio sometiems desyncs and slightly repetitve gameplay. (move to an area, capture all points, Start anarchy)However, even through its clear flaws, I'd still say this game is worth giving a shot. But not at full price (unless you're a homefront fan)On to Pros and Cons:Lets start with the cons:-Laggy in some bits-Controls are clunky-Reptitve in some parts-Vehicle controls are terrible-Lack of ambient audio/ ambient soundtrackNow, For the pros+Attempts at an innovative ""On the fly"" weapon switching+Has its moments+Take Downs are satisfying+Variety of weapon mods is.....interesting.+RC Car simulator 2016+Freeroam+Story.Now, Some might be thinking, Why the hell did i get this game AND give it a thumbs up if the gameplay was less than optimal?Simple. I loved the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the First Homefront, And i really wanted to know about other areas of the same universe (Number one was set in sanfran, 2 is set in Philly). The ending of the game was a little satisfying. But lack of audio made it kind of dull. But, there is no awesome soundtrack in war. So in conclusion:GET THIS GAME IF EITHER:+You are a homefront fan+You're looking for a story based around anarchy and revolution+If you dont mind doing reptitive things (I didnt in the case of this game)+Looking for something to get you motivated to shoot something. DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF:-You want Smooth gameplay-You want Smooth Mechanics-Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack-Repetitve tasksOn one final note: Guys and Girls, you need to play this game for the STORY, not the actual GAMEPLAY.Happy gaming!

												Good game but with some real game faults !!!- FPS´s in the game are a real mess, with average from 15fps on a real confrontation battle and 70fps on quiet places (running on Asus GTX 980Ti 6GDDR5, I7 3770K 4.1GHz, 16GB DDR3).- Can´t customize all weapons (ex: I cant´put silencer on M4 or Shotgun). - Enemy respawn is at your sight (they just appear on front of you).

												(NO SPOILERS)I like this game so much already.The activities which you can do are so great.Sneaking, hacking, upgrading (weapons, gear etc.) and more. The story itself is also great including some horrific moments.And yes there are some (small) negative points but not that huge so far i have discovered, and doesn't bother me that much. The game-play its fps is locked around 30 and further more you might discover some bugs/glitchesExample, an Nork (North-Korean) sniper inside a tower, the walls of the tower are invisible and you might see through it.Or few invisible walls on the ground at some corners (i just discovered two of them but that's it).Recruit innocent civilians and prisoners and let them join the Resistance against (North) Korea. Let them feel the uprising, show no mercy, take back what's rightfully yours, restore and show freedom to the world.I recommend and rate this game 7/10.			"

												Pretty mediocre shooter. I had hoped to see something different from the annual CoD iteration but they pretty much wasted the theme - liberating areas is way too easy (interact with the objective to make hostiles vanish instantly), and once you have liberated a zone you get plenty of allied redshirts, an infinite supply of rockets and will never be bothered by the KPA again.To be fair, the campaign is no worse than the annual CoD - less flashy explosions, but a slightly more original theme but then again you probably wouldn't buy CoD for the singleplayer.Multiplayer is dead, which is just as well because it's just a generic cheap ""farm missions for cash to buy loot crates"" Skinner box. I didn't encounter any massive bugs other than the fact that the photographic quest didn't progress (blindly stabbing the target did work, but frankly that entire mission should have been scrapped given how utterly inadequate controls are - e.g. you cannot stand up while holding the phone, so designing a mission around holding the phone is utterly stupid).Performance wise, FPS seemed to hover around 50 (with a few drops, including one brief case of FPS dropping 5 for no apparent reason in the prison area) in a R390, i7-6700k, 16GB VM i.e. it runs a lot worse than better looking games like Fallout 4.

												Game honestly has good foundation but it needs work, the fps and stuttering and lag issues really make the game unplayable i have a decent beefy system and i still manage to get really low frames and lowering the quality does not do anithing i get the same frames as in high settings that low , due to the engine optimization. Everything else i like the style of homefront and its weapon modifications are one of the best things in this game, for now i dont suggest you purchase this game because it is not worth 60$ at the moment in later future or after the updates it might but at this stage its not worth buying.

												Review after playing the free weekend (Approx 12 hours of play). Well, I kept running into problems like one piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥said to pick up medical supplies from one location. I cleared that location and walked up to the vehicle that was marked as the location I had to go. I walked up to it and the marker faded away and I couldn't access the back of the vehicle or drive it or blow it up..nothing. It was a dead/bugged task. I decide to clear the police station. I found a vantage point to take out all of the enemies from outside the walls. Then I waltz up to the doorways to enter and they're locked. I look for a way to open them. Nothing. After a while I read online that you have to blow them open. I place a remote explosive on the door. Back up. Detonate it...Nothng. Not a sscratch. So I watch walkthrough videos on youtube. All of them show the doors already blasted open. I can't get into the police station. Dead task. Most jobs/tasks work but it's the ones that are broken that ruin it. Also the constant repetition and the fact that noe of this gameplay is really original. We've done all of this in Prototype, Splinter Cell, Deus Ex and multiple other games.  Whoever developed this game was NOT American. The body movememnts when poorly designed characters like Dana move and her voice acting/lines were horrid. I checked multiple professional game reviews and they all agree the character creation sucked the left nut. I am glad I played it for free. I wouldn't have paid for that and I am normally willing to pay full price for good games.			"

												Its bad. I played the whole game. At the first area i did all the side missions, which is basicaly 1) go to a stronghold, 2) kill everyone there,3) push a button.Acualy, you dont even need to do point 2. Just get to the button and push it. All the enemies will hust go away. Not that its very hard to kill them all. The AI is the worst since a long time..... actualy, even the main missions are pretty mush all build this way.The setting of the game is great, but the main story is terrible. You dont mind the fist missions, but its gets boring fast. I played homefront 1 too. A much better game. It wast great, but the first 3-4 hours are good in homefront one. The bad part is that homefront 1 is just 3-4 hours, and than your premium prioce game is finished. Still homefront 2 is much worse than homefront 1.It kinda looks like they created the diffrent maps first. I guess half of the maps is ok, but not by 2016 standards. Games like fallout 3 look better and they are much older. After creating the maps, the terrrible AI, and a couple of lame charater skins (sometimes you are in a room with 4 people where 2 are exactly the same) they realized they needed some sort of story line. My best guess is that one of the programmers asked his 12 year old son to quickly make up a story to get a icecream as reward. The story is thin as f*ck and pretty mush every character is predictable and boring. Onle that Dana girl is somewhat alright. But dont worry, even she is preditable and cheesy.Unless is you are really bored, loved the first game and really dont want to spend your money or another game, I strongly advise you not to buy this game!Its a shame the screwed up this game again.

												This game...oh boy this is gonna be hard.So I started playing it and I was thinking ""people said♥♥♥♥♥♥about it but I still want to try it"".What was I doing to my £7?I could buy a medium pizza at Basilo,but noooooooo I just got the game instead.The story is somehow weird,I still don't understand it apart from ""go here and help these stupid civilians shoot those drones and robots look type of guys"".The weapon customization is somewhat ""good""...wait,that was a joke because I played the new SGW3 and that let me tell,that is a real ♥♥♥♥ing good customization.I'm sorry I can't give you a good reason to like this crap,yes I only played 3.5 hours but that is because I played most of it on playstation and then got it for steam because ""why not?"".Let's make it like this,you promise me not to spend more than £10/10$/10 euros (yeah my keyboard doesn't have the euro symbol...descrimination towards the european market everywhere) and I won't say you're being ♥♥♥♥ed right in the♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Literally a game you can play if you just have time to kill or want something to shoot at. Dont expect well designed combat though, the KI can shoot through walls while you cant. The character are cliche and even cringey to an extend and you will do nothing but shoot things while doing the same task over and over and over again. Now it was fun for the first 12 - 15 hours but it just gets worse the further you are into the story. Some characters die with overdramatic scenes and sad music while you basically never interacted with most other than them telling you basic ""get me item x""♥♥♥♥♥♥via the radio. So when these characters die and its clear that the game want you to be like ""oh noooo"" but in the end you just watch it and continue on your way Of course the renown never talking super rebel you play as doesnt help there either. Pro Tipps to enjoy this game: Step 1 - Get a trainer Step 2 - Blast your favourite aggressive music through your media playerStep 3 - Get yourself unlimited Ammo and health Step 4 - Get upgradesStep 5 - Shoot everything that moves (Because the LMG and Shotgun are basically the only enjoyable weapons in this game since everything else seems to be shooting with softballs for bullets) Dont buy this for more then 10 dollars / eur whatever			"

												So; I bought and refunded after about an hour of gametime -- And I'll quickly explain why. First the good -- From a technical stand point I didnt encounter a single problem; smooth 60+ with everything maxed. I was pretty surprised after hearing the Internet rabble prior to playing, so I was happy to see I wasnt one of those affected by tech problems.... But then I started playing, and I kind of have to end It there on the ""good"".  Because thats really the best I can say about this particular game. And even completely maxed out (At 1080) It still looks a bit dated at best, unimpressive for a game that released this year; maybe If it were a few years ago...This game immediatly reminded me of Metro (Take your pick) In Its gameplay and mechanics, and thats not really a good thing -- Granted both Metro's were, and are awesome games; like I said -- dated.  Everything just feels ""off"", even hopping over obsicles, or just walking/running looks weird and jerky.The story and characters were pretty forgettable (IMO) for my short time, & after my small hour or so Ingame I was not willing at all to push past that 2 hour mark to ""see If It gets better"".All In all; I simply did not enjoy this game, and I wanted to.

												This game was better than i expected it to be, an open world-ish FPS Shooter was amazingly fun, it could get repetative with the bases and stuff you needed to take over for the people to rebell but still fun.The story was okay, I enjoyed it at least. Somethings i didn't get (probably beacus i can be a bit slow)I wish it wasn't as easy for the police oe what you want to call it to recognize you in the city, if they start to spot you, almost the only thing you can do is kill them, run away or try to get behind some people, which is hard because it's not that many npc groups to hide in.I would still recomend for anyone who likes FPS shooters, and might want some story to it.

												This game has had potential. A open world shooter in the scenario of urban guerilla warfare? Yes please!Since everyone and their uncle are already talking about the bad performance and immense bugs let me point out some problems  of the gamedesign:- AI is simply stupid. They are okay at traversing the terrain, but none of the really fight together or act in a way that maes sense (aside from scripted events. Especially in battle all the various NPCs do is run around without any plan or coherence not even to think of any kind of teamplay.- The Ai also has laserfocus on your position as soo as one is alerted. You can come from behind, not having given off a sinmgle shot and enemys will imidiately turn towards you and know you are there.- All your equipment is inneffective. What that means is the following:- Even the populated territories are rather sparsely populated.Using any explosives is cumbersum and especially not something you should do in full combat since it just takes to long to take out the approbiate explosive/tool and then use it and then to change back to one of your weapons. I often died trying to take down a heavy enemy, impervious to my normal weapons and then was overrun by normal enemys because it takes so long to do anything involving the equipment while your allies are uterly useless in preventinmgt enemys from flanking you.Your high rate weapons are all inaccurate as hell except if you shoot from the hip (wich is totally stupid) althugh it has no crosshair. Headshots with most weapons and especially silenced ones, do NOT kill in one shot. That means that everything stealth is useless and damned to fail because an utter comment by that enemy will imidiately alert all surrounding enemys to your presence.It also doesn't matter if have better equipment. Even with the heaviest armor you die as quick as without it.- Enemys spawn constantly even in Bases that you can only conquer when all enemys are eliminated. What. The. Fcku.- Enemys seem to have no walking sounds. So you don't hear them running up stairs or along a street. That with the last point repeatedly leads to them coming up from behind you and killing you while you try to clear out a base and killing you because you simply couldn't hear them coming.- The extra sidemissions called ""jobs"" are super tedious and it simply makes no sense that you can only take on four at one time. Wich i sad because some of the ideas, like taking pictures of you fellow freedome fighters are super interesting. The game just doesn#t do anything with it.- The game fails to makle something interesting out of urban and guerilly warfare overall.-The Story is terribble. I don't mind a silly alternate history story. But the start of the story was totally braindead, ESPECIALLY the totally senseless torture scene. The longer the story went on the more i had the feeling the Nortkorean Invaders were actually the good guys and the rebells i worked for were psychopathic, unempathic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I just didn't want to realy fight for them after a few hours.And sorry, but there is NO WAY and entire citys people would not break out in bloody riots when an invading force takes all the children. That is just absolute nonsense and a cheap excuse to make the onvaders look like the evil giuys and have no kids in the game. X-PThere is more but suffice to say is that i can't recommend this game except if you are curious and it is on sale.			"

												The developers of this game put absolutely no time in the making of the game. I read all the negative and positive reviews and decided not to buy it at full price. Then it was on sale for 10 and so i decided to try it. The game was shaky but not too bad, however when i tried to play with a buddy, who has a GTX 960, an i7 and other hardware that should allow him to play the game on high graphic settings, he was had a framerate of 20 and had a 2 second lag, even though he gets 60 ping in other games. We couldn't play together at all because the game wouldn't work at all for him. So i decided just to play the campaign. In the cutscene in the begininning of the game, you are tied up and your friends are killed and a guy comes in and saves you. In that scene the voices were right on but when someone would punch someone or shoot a gun you didnt hear the sound until two seconds later. It ruined the whole cutscene. Afterwords I finally got to run around a bit. The NPCs consist of only like 6 different kinds. Walking through one road i saw the same NPC 3 different times. On the same road!! The gunplay was difficult as well. It was extremely difficult to aim and when you hit a guy the recoil was so intense you would never be able to hit him twice without taking three seconds to get back on target. The one thing i like about the game was the environment. They did well on how  Philadalphia looked and the way the streets and the insides of buildings looked intrigued me. That however is the only good thing about this game. The developers seemed to not care at all how this game would turn out, instead they just wanted to sell a game, that shouldnt  even be offered for free its so bad,  for 60 bucks just to make money. Don't buy this game. I know their are positive reveiws about this game saying if its on sale then to try it out. Don't. I tried it out for ten bucks and it just turned into a hassle trying to get it to work, it not working, and now having to return it.			"

												Standalone + Voice of Freedom ReveiwThis by far is one of the best games I have played for a while and i enjoyed every second of it.First play through on this game i put 27hrs into it unlike most 6-8hr linear games out there.This game delivers you in stunning graphics great combat open world story experiance with Endless ways to approach your objective switching up your weapon style on the fly using The primary guns frame and attaching other mods changing the gun style completely. After a while it may seem repeataive but this game keeps it fresh with new areas missions feels like your fighting for something.This game is a big improvement from the first gameand it stands alone you can not compare it to other games.This game deserves to be a Triple A tilte and a spot in your library and I give it 9/10 with my seal of approval.-The voice of freedom dlc reveiw, 9gb download with a 30 minute campaign really! 9 gb I would expect 8-9hrs this is the shortest dlc i have ever played. i love this game but not this dlc, It should of been heaps longer like getting recruits as you progress through the campaign leading upto the events of standard game (more story driven). But not this I don't understand this dlc i give it a 1/10 very dissapointed.			"

Homefront The RevolutionHomefront The Revolution (HFR) is a First-person military styled shooter set in the future area (2029) the US has been invaded by North Korea.  HFR is the sequel to Homefront (2011).  The game continues along the same plot but the story is new and takes place on the east coast in Philadelphia 2029, just two years after the rebellion movement on the west coast (Bay Area) in Homefront. The game project was started and sold multiple times before finally ending up in Dambuster Studios/ Deep Silver.  As a result this is a project with many developers hands in the mix so it shouldn't be too big os a shock it wasn't exactly what many had hoped for.  For starters, the best part of Homefront (2011) was the multiplayer, which was very similar to CoD, only to be ignored and left out of the sequel.  Instead a Co-op mode was provided in its place. This did not set well with the community which caused a backlash of predicted negative reviews before anyone even had a chance to play the game. GameplayThe game is open world but you have to follow a progression to go to each new section.  In each section you will follow the main story as well as have the oportunity to complete side missions.  While these can be fun and even challenging at times, they feel repetitive.  The plot is interesting but the delivery is lack luster. The gameplay is the standard FPS feel.  The controls and UI are adaquate but do not invent the wheel, just more of the same things sound in other FPS shooters like the Fallout and Farcry series with weapon/item selections and crafting.  The coolest thing in the game is the weapon mods that allow you to turn you weapons into just about anyhting bt switching upper receivers and other items allowing you to carry an arsenal without carrying 20 weapons.  The gameplay is smooth but there is a collision problem when taking cover up against walls where you can see thru them. BugsI wish the collision problem was the only bug but it is not.  The game's release was bug infested to the point I gave up trying to play it and waited months before trying again. Most of the game breaking issues like the fps drops and crashes seem to be resolved, but the collision issue is ever present. There are also issues where you can jump thru a window but not back in which makes no sense. Co-op is difficult to find matches for and inviting friends isn't as easy as it should be. AIThe AI can be deadly with aimbot skills killing you with only a single shot to the head. However, the AI also feels broken in that at times you can kill someone stealthly and move along with your mission. At other times, you take someone out stealthly with a silenced weapon only to be rushed by multiple enemies, overrun, and killed. The AI will also see you in a building if you stand to close to a wall and begin shooting at you or alert other AI to your presence. This is usually resolved be stepping away from the wall, but not always. GraphicsThe game is built on CryEngine which is used in games like Far Cry, Crysis, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance, and Roberts Space Industries Star Citizen. Needless to say the engine is capable of breath taking visuals.  While the game looks good and is immersive, it was poorly optimized and felt as though it did not have the graphical fidelity other other titles on the same engine.  MultiplayerAs stated earlier, the team deathmatch/domination style multiplayer modes were removed and replaced with a multiplayer co-op version of the game.  While the co-op game mode is fun, it lacks the replay appeal of a true multiplayer game mode provides. People have complained of connectivity issues with multiplayer as well as isssues of teaming with friends. ConclusionThe game has been patched and runs well enough to enjoy now although the gameplay does feels repetitive.  If you're ok with completing similar missions throughout the game, like you would in a Far Cry game, pick it up. The game isn't bad and I have had fun with it, but it does fails to deliver that I cannot stop playing feeling I have experienced in other games. I do believe it is worth playing especially if it is on sale so I am going to give it a Yes on my Recommendation.			"

												What can I say about Homefront: The Revolution?PROS-Weapon part customization-Motorcycles-Stealth-Challenging-Parkour..Ish-YOU CAN THROW BRICKS!! Some windows will break if they're apart of a small building (Not a safehouse)-You can holster your weapon like a sane person (Mostly if you need to blend into crowds to hide from the KPA or if you're ""roleplaying"").-'Murica...CONS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FPS drops-Die WAY too fast-Okay storyline♥♥♥♥♥♥♥voice acting-AI is the most annoying thing asides from the FPS drops (They don't move out of your way, they sit there and give you a big flucking speach about looking where I'm walking, which is troublesome because if you're hiding from the KPA they corner you if you're in a tight space)-There's not continuation after the end. You must load a previous save.TL;DR: The game isn't really ready to be sold yet, due to the lack of optimization and content. The game is fun until you beat it, then all you can really do is take back strongholds, explore, parkour, and kill. I'd recommend it if you're okay with bad lag on a great system, death almost right after the 6th shot, and kinda wasting $59.99.Wait until it's on sale at least 30-40% if you want to save your money and pay for what this game actually is worth.

Heavy loading, frezes and stutters abound and can't run more than 10 minutes without pprolems like a complete system crash or 20 second-long freeze which even impedes the task manager from loading.My rig can run Arma3, fallout 4 and other big and heavy titles for hours. This is a badly coded piece of beta software pushed-out by the editors and publishers before it was ready for prime-time.Asking for refund.			"

												Definition of ""meh"".I can't really recommend this game, but I also can't say that it is a total waste of time. The biggest issue I had is the acheivements are bugged to Hell. I don't consider acheivements a top priority, but they do add an extra bit of fun and playability to some games for me, especially open world ones like this. The stat tracking is laughable, and there is really no excuse other than bad developing/optimization. If it were just the acheivements that were not tracking, it'd be one thing, but the in-game challenges only registered when they felt like it, and some mission objectives forced me quit the game and log back in in order to progress.That being said, is the game fun? Yes. Is it worth buying? Not really. I picked it up on sale for $23 and that still felt overpriced. I love the Far Cry games and I read many reviews saying that this was a similar setup but in a wartorn urban environment. What's not to love? Well for starters, the environment is rather boring and repatative. The map is small, and the traveling system is somewhat of a joke. Honestly, this game would probably have been groundbreaking if it had been released 7 years ago, but it just can't compete with any modern comparable games. I really can't even tell you about the story because it seemed like nonsense. I ended up actually muting the voices about halfway through  because I just could not bring myself to care about what was actually going on. There are a few extended dialogue heavy cutscenes that I alt-tabbed out of until they were over,I don't want it to sound like I am completley ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game, because I really don't feel that bad about it. After I locked in, I found it hard to pull myself away from because the gameplay is fluid. I had very few techincal glitches, no crashes, and was able to maintain 55-65fps on high settings with a GTX 970. The graphics are beautiful and it feels well optimized. The crafting system is intuitive and well-built. The gadgets are pretty cool, albeit not very special or exciting. The real place where this game seems original is in the weapons system. I really loved the on-the-fly modding of weapon types/attachments. You can carry two primary weapons and a secondary pistol (that can be standard, an SMG, or powerful silenced pneumatic variation). Your two main weapons are actually 6 weapons and allow you to build what you need to adapt to most situations. The only thing that I didn't like was that you couldn't attach your suppressor to your marksman rifle. I just don't understand why. I'm guessing it was to encourage/force you to use the crossbow in long range stealth encounters, but I just hate crossbows in video games for some reason, especially this one. Anyway, I think your money would be better spent on many other games (Fallout 4, Farcry 3&4, & Borderlands are all better options that scratch an open world FPS itch far better than this one).  If you've played everything else and are just looking for something new to pass the time, this game is not the worst option you have. It really is just ""meh"". "

												This game was better than i expected it to be, an open world-ish FPS Shooter was amazingly fun, it could get repetative with the bases and stuff you needed to take over for the people to rebell but still fun.The story was okay, I enjoyed it at least. Somethings i didn't get (probably beacus i can be a bit slow)I wish it wasn't as easy for the police oe what you want to call it to recognize you in the city, if they start to spot you, almost the only thing you can do is kill them, run away or try to get behind some people, which is hard because it's not that many npc groups to hide in.I would still recomend for anyone who likes FPS shooters, and might want some story to it.

												TL;DR Fun, but not ""full price"" fun. Get it on sale. I haven't got a ton of time in the game yet, so I'll only be reviewing the single player game for now. Pros:Looks really nice.Lots of customization.The guns are pretty fun.Motorcycle riding is kind of a blast.Most major bugs patched out.Cons: Weird FOV. (vertical and not horizontal; makes the game feel a little strange at first)Weird sound decisions. (black guy with a white guy's voice, etc)Story isn't very good.Obviously made first and foremost for consoles. (controls, options, etc)Summary;This game is OK. The graphics and effects are beautiful, and the game play is fun, but the story is boring and predictable. I wouldn't recommend it for full price, but I got it on sale for $30, and that seems like a fair trade to me.			"

												I did like the first Homefront, making me part of a very small group of people.For better or for worse, this game is entirely different in all regards except for the setting; instead of story based linear missions, it is an open world liberation fest that allows for almost unlimited freedom to do what you want (past the scripted intro segments), which in theory should be great.However, the game just doesn't feel fun to play. The gunplay is unsatisfying on keyboard and mouse because of some funky mouse handling (and I tried the acceleration fix, so I'm not sure what exactly the problem is, but it just feels wrong to me, like the sensitivity is both too low to aim rapidly, ala SMG, but too high to aim precisely, ala sniper rifles. Now, some people might say ""But you can fix it"", but honestly, who wants mouse acceleration? If you use a mouse for anything other than gaming, you're used to how a mouse works. It's a stupid idea and always implemented in such a way as to make it worse for players who are proficient with their mice) and gameplay (getting shot at is tedious because you never know exactly how much damage you'll take, so you die unexpectedly while other times you can survive incredible amounts of damage, seemingly based on a coin toss). The aesthetic is also a bit tedious; it feels like someone took Homefront and was like ""But what if it looked like Terminator?"" which is not a terrible idea except for implementation; on low settings, it looks like sludge (and my rig can't hit high) with performance hits and unholy amounts of bloom when you transition from a lit area to a dark area, to the point where operating during the day is tedious because your screen will wash out if you step into shadows. While the performance was stable, it was unimpressive for the graphical fidelity delivered.			"

												Proberly the most boring game I ever played. It was ok in the first hour of gameplay but after the first hour it was boring. I got this game when it was free and I regret downloading it and wasting two hours of my life on it. The combat system is decent but the actual story is boring and the characters are uninteresting.The only thing that surprise me is that the game is able to run on my old 2012 PC which is a +2 in my book.If you like games like Far Cry or Gurilla warfare go for it but I don't want to waste 40 dollars on this game.

												What can I say about Homefront: The Revolution?PROS-Weapon part customization-Motorcycles-Stealth-Challenging-Parkour..Ish-YOU CAN THROW BRICKS!! Some windows will break if they're apart of a small building (Not a safehouse)-You can holster your weapon like a sane person (Mostly if you need to blend into crowds to hide from the KPA or if you're ""roleplaying"").-'Murica...CONS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FPS drops-Die WAY too fast-Okay storyline♥♥♥♥♥♥♥voice acting-AI is the most annoying thing asides from the FPS drops (They don't move out of your way, they sit there and give you a big flucking speach about looking where I'm walking, which is troublesome because if you're hiding from the KPA they corner you if you're in a tight space)-There's not continuation after the end. You must load a previous save.TL;DR: The game isn't really ready to be sold yet, due to the lack of optimization and content. The game is fun until you beat it, then all you can really do is take back strongholds, explore, parkour, and kill. I'd recommend it if you're okay with bad lag on a great system, death almost right after the 6th shot, and kinda wasting $59.99.Wait until it's on sale at least 30-40% if you want to save your money and pay for what this game actually is worth.

Not  just for this choice. But in general too.Throughout the campaign is has the different peoples opinions and thoughs.Adds a good deal i think.Multiplayer:Network errors. I dont think you can play online at all.Overall. Good Game for singleplayer.Though i wont risk buying this game, cause the multiplayer doesnt seem to work at all.And because i allready completed singleplayer. So i have no more interest in the game.			"

												I've played through the whole story line and let me say, this game is well worth the buy. The storyline is action packed mixed in with some touchy moments. This game, I will say, is NOT call of duty. You cannot just run and gun the whole thing, even on the lowest difficulty setting. This game puts you in the role of a resistance fighter, not a soldier, and as such you fight in the style of guerilla warfare. You will need to run away sometimes but that's what they were going for.The visuals are gorgeous and have very little loading screens, however as a result there are some frame rate drops which I hope they can address, all in all very minor. The cut scenes are brilliantly animated, hats off for that as well. With a few patches I'd give this game an 8/10, but for now I'll give it a 7/10, which for a game that has been in developmental hell for the better part of 5 years I say is fantastic. Also just as small note I have not played Coop yet. I'll edit this when I've played it for a few hours.*EDIT* Dambuster Studios acknowledges the the optimization issues and is working on a patch			"

												I really enjoy the approach this game takes, and it's a much needed change in pace from the multiplayer scene it was trying to be a part of if it wanted a chance in the industry with Battlefield and COD as such heavyweights, Homefront needed something different.If theres one thing this game is, it's different. Not only from the older homefront games, but even while it tries to take a Far Cry ""Approach It Your Way"" theme, it still manages to be its own game. I've only played a few hours, and have only touched the surface of the story, but so far it seems promising. Gameplay is smooth, and I've had nothing but fun playing with it so far.			"

												Decided to give this game a chance after seeing all the bad reviews, turns out I did the right thing trusting my gut on this purchase. Have i7 3770, gtx 970, and 8 gig ram and I'm running the game on ultra setting with no problems, only a few frame drops here and there but doesn't last long. For all those people hating on the game because of bugs upon release, take a look back at all of the games that have been released in the past several years, there are some exceptions but most of them had bugs upon release aswell with some that were much worse than this but almost always they patch the game soon after. I understand that it sucks you can't play the game right now, but you cant just base your review off of that either. For those saying the weapon handling isnt that great well think of it this way, you are an ordinary citizen with no prior training who decided to join the uprising. Ofcourse you arnt going to have the perfect aim and your weapon will sway alot, you can fix those by upgrading your weapons over time. I like the fact that this game doesn't have a grinding system like the division, meaning I don't have to first become like a level 30 to do certain missions and things like that. I think this game could be great after several patches fixing some of its issues. You should also trust your gut rather than other peoples reviews for this game and try it for yourself. Play the game for 2 hours, if for any reason you don't end up liking it then you can submit a refund for it.			"

												This game is just plain bad. I am running a i5, 980ti, with 16gb of DDR4 ram and the frame rate drops like a lead brick when things get busy. The audio is terrible as well, walking through the town my ears are assaulted with a cacophony of garbled murmurs and what I assume was supposed to be backround noise. Bugs, bugs and more bugs; I had to restart the game 3 times because for some reason i would get stuck on ""auto-walk"" after I concluded dialogue with an NPC. Hands went through doors, interaction were unavailable, enemies walked through/saw through walls... I could look past the technical garbage too with the hope that patches and updates could solve these issues, but only if there was a story and characters I cared about. The writing and characters are archtypical, trite re-hashes of♥♥♥♥♥♥we have been seeing in action films since the 80s. Don't expect anything original or compelling. The enviroments and NPCs are boring and uninspired,  playing this game is akin to playing counter-strike in a server full of bots.The lore is interesting I suppose, except for the fact that the US would never purchase weapons from an enemy state, that's just absurd to me... Graphics (when the game runs properly, which is about 35% of the time): 8/10Sound/Audio: 1/10Gameplay: 3.5/10Story/Characters: 2/10Overall: 2.5/10I requested a refund, I am tired of getting burned with paying for premium titles and getting flaming dog turds in return... i.e. Farcry: Primal BLAH.

												I think this game is fun for the average gamer. I'm an average gamer that plays lots of games that I think are interesting. This one, while the setting is dumb, is relatively fun. It isn't the most optimized game, I get random major frame drops right after a section is loaded up.  But it only lasts a couple second. there are some bugs and glitches, but nothing that is game breaking. Personally I think this game is fun, if you find it interesting. Look up some gameplay first, then decide if you want to buy it.			"

												Good game. Granted the plot line isn't all that and there are a fairly limiyed number a guns, but there are a ton of side missions to play through. If you want a PLOT RICH revolution game, DON'T get it. If you just wants to shoot some Norht Koreans and blow stuff up, DEFINITLY GO FOR IT.			"

												Once you get a bit used to the aiming(took me 3 hours)Homefront can be a great game.Amazing graphics but if you have a potatoe pc(laptop whatever)don't buy it caus' it seems like the kind of game that would have a great amount of lag for those without a pc that can run these kinds of graphics smoothly.

												Completed it on the hardest difficulty and - well - i've enjoyed it. Most of the times i had to think before an ancounter or completely avoid it, like in a guerrila. Sure it has many tecnhical flaws but the game still looks nice. The setting is fantastic.Homefront: The Revolution is way different than the first one though, this has different open areas of the city where you have to complete missions (in a sandbox way) and conquest every outpost on the map, to let the rebels secure their position inside the city and get rid of the filhty NKA (North Korean Army). Look at it as some sort of Far Cry mixed with a (this is subjective) STALKER feel, but here instead you do feel like a real rebel fighting for his own people's freedom.My performance weren't great but still better than what people are yelling around. Considering that i'm on a GTX 980 Ti i got 54-68fps on @1440p.In short, it's a fun - and beatiful - game that even with its flaws (bugs and some animations) doesn't deserve all this hate. Grats to the devs for finally delivering it, despite all the issues tha they've had during the development.Just don't buy it right now, wait for the next 50% sale.About the co-op:I managed to play 10-11 missions in co-op at normal and hard. It's really fun but may be bored pretty soon. There are A LOT of unlockables and skills to buy but only 6 missions (that you have to repeat). Anyway it isn't the main focus of the game.			"

												I havent played this game long enough to comment on the gameplay yet and will update later, however I'll comment on the visuals and optimisation on the game after an hour of gameplay. I've managed to max out everything apart from shadows and it runs flawlessly on my gaming laptop Gtx980m i7 4810MQ (3.8GHZ when turbo boosted. I am really not sure why some people with a GTX970 are getting issues with fps and I saw someone claim their GTX970 cannot achieve more than 30fps with low settings! Well, this isnt the case for me at all, the game is running superb. Anyone who has played crysis before will feel the similarity with the weapon customization (cryengine). Graphically this game is pretty good but nothing ground breaking.			"

												So, quite frankly you can throw out most of the bad reviews saying this game is terribly optimized. I'm on a laptop, and was apparently the most popular Steam Streamer for a while - While playing this game.So,  even with the graphics at max, i get no studdering or frame rate issues. Which really makes me think it's not the games optimization. but the people's systems who are complaining about said optimization. The game itself, so far seems like a great sequel - though I don't actually know if it's even directly related to the original homefront. The game is a Red-Dawn story being told in a game format which is very exciting. Especially when set at the most difficult difficultly, it makes you play the game much more stealthy-guerilla warfare-y or you'll die a lot. It seems like the AI really know what they're doing and how to respond to you for the most part.I don't know much about the multiplayer, but as soon as a friend gets the game and plays it with me. I'll update on my thoughts on the game.Also It's midnight and I just worked a lot. So I'll probably edit this thing tomorrow or the next day to word it better.			"

												Edit: So after a few updates, there has been basically zero improvement for framerate. My advice to anyone interested in buying this game is to try it out for the two hours you can and if you like it and performance is fine, then keep it.  The game is a solid B as far as story and setting are concerned.  Performance is ""meh"" throughout. If it runs well in the first two hours, you'll be fine.  If it doesn't run well, it won't get any better so you're better off refunding it.  I just finished the game and had a good time.  I'd recommend it for people who like open world shooters, but there are other games that do this formula much better and have a better story.  Still fun though. Solid B.I am not refunding this game as I think many of the issues are tech related and can be fixed in a patch or two.  If you're not sure about buying this, just wait unti a patch is released.  I have a 6700k with a 980ti and I haven't had significant problems, though the game isn't optimized well and has fps drops.  There have also been a number of bugs in shadows, hand motions freezing, sounds not matching with voices/guns, and textures not rendering.  It's not as bad as Arkham or Unity as others are comparing it, but is suffering from bugs that are annoying. As far as gameplay is concerned, it feels like a lesser version of FC.  The gunplay isn't 'addicting' as FC, but is satisfactory though it takes some getting used to. Don't know enough about the story to weigh in on that, yet.  One problem with the game is its release date.  There are many games releasing this same month that are FPS and that are significantly better (gameplay wise).  It's a hard sell, honestly.			"

												If you like resistance like games and enjoy tactical based shooters rather than running around like Master Chief or COD spraying everything to pieces then this might be for you.Firstly, in a response to all the negative reviews about optimisation, I honestly don't know what they're on about. I'm on a GTX 770 and I'm playing on high without any issues. The only time it stutters for a few seconds is when the game autosaves which if no one has noticed, a few other games do that tooPersonally I like the game, I think fighting against a stronger opposittion using hit and run tactics is enjoyable and you're prone to dying a lot, even on medium difficulty.Weapon customisation is pretty badass, especially as you can see things being changed physically in front of your eyes.You've got two different zones in the game, Yellow zones and red zones. Yellow Zones are heavily policed and are filled with civilians and security. Yellow zones are you living and breathing occupied neighbourhoods where stealth and planning is more prone.The red zones are areas where the the resistance is actively fighting the KPA in a more straight up kind of way. Red zone is shoot to kill and you'll often come across various resistance fighters going toe to toe with enemy forces. The red zones are also pretty rough looking with destroyed buildings and burnt out cars being common.The only real issue I could say I have with the game is the introduction, it throws you too quickly into blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with no build up. I'd have liked it if we had more build up and were without weapons for a while rather than being given a pistol after the first mission and throwing molotovs are armoured cars. Within 40 minutes depending on how you spend your money you can buy an Assault Rifle (M4 Carbine) which seems a little rushed and not much of a build up to it.You can't use enemy weapons, and it's never explained why so you'll be using whatever you've got/bought to fight the KPA and spend time searching bodies for ammo and supplies.The campaign is basic but I'm finding it to be pretty fun so far, same with the COOP resistance mode which is fun to play. If anything the online mode feels to have a bit more build up in the way you look and are equiped. You'll start coop mode with some simple clothing and a weapon in each catergory (Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Battle Rifle) and from there you'll level up and go from grime covered Joeblogs who's picked up an M4 to someone wearing heavy battle armour and a gasmask.All in all I'd give the game a 7/10 I'd sayTL:DRPros- Pretty fun gameplay- Weapon Customisation- Loot Simulator- COOP-  Graphics- Red and Yellow zonesCons- Not enough build up- Weapon variation can be a little lacking (Only one assault rifle)-  Vehicles aren't too great (Been on motorcycles only so far)- AI can be a 50/50 sometimes with being stupid or out right ruthless.This game isn't for everyone, but it's not as bad as people are making it out to be so far. Take into consideration a lot of people are complaining about optimisation which can be fixed.			"

												It ran well, played well, looked good... but it's essentially Dead Island with North Koreans instead of zombies. Once I got past the ""ooooo"" and ""ahhhh"" phase of the weapon customization, and the detail to the models... I got bored. Go to this location, kill these guys, blow up or hack this... congrats the resistance has a new base. Now repeat that. OR completely skip all that, sneak in.... steal some stuff. Congrats all the enemies disappear and are replaced with allies in the blink of a loading screen.If my opinion changes from more gameplay, my review will change.			"

												To be honest, I think this game is getting harsh reviews. I decided to give it a chance, and I really don't regret in doing so, I've been having lots of fun. I'll explain briefly the pros and cons:Pros:*The atmosphere is very good, it really feels like a post apocalyptic America, the world feels real. *Reviews tell shooting feels generic, I disagree, weapons have recoil and don't feel like they do no damage at all, I really like the shooting. Other games have more generic shooting than this one.*The option to customize the weapon on the go is pretty awesome and add versatility to the game, I think it's a great idea.*Graphics, like face animations look awesome. There are some textures that look dull, but of the game looks like other current generation titles. *Lots of customization.*There are stealth areas that add variety.Cons:*My specs are a i7 3770k and a gtx 980, and the  games does suffer from some technical issues, like volatile framerates and stuttering. (Keep in mind I'm playing in 2k resolution)*Same type of side missions and objectives (Far Cry type), so If you didn't like FC, stay away of this game. Can get repetitive.*The story is average at most, a lot of things are predictable.*Multiplayer is only Co-op (Haven't tried it yet).So in conclussion, if you want a game with a good atmosphere and fun shooting, similar to Far Cry series, you should give Homefront The Revolution a chance, just don't expect a GOTY.

												Have to say this game has already given me some memorable moments.After the prologue the first two times i found a bike i drove it like i have never driven any vehicle in a game, and proceded to nearly run over the koreans and my allies while barely missing buildings and vehicles. I don't use them anymore.But honestly the game has enough flashy parts to keep you interested and the game has a nice difficulty so that i can't just grab the marksman rifle or assualt rifle and treat this like the coop missions in CSGO. The characters are detailed, better than than that one game..... Division..... so you can easily like or hate people.Honestly i was expecting something more like this from The Division. My biggest gripe is that the campaign is not co-op, i enjoy even bad games if i can bring my friends with me, and this isn't bad.			"

They do have onlione co-op but there are allot if network issues and its very hard to find other players to play with.I would rate this game 6 out of 10 stars and so low becuse of the lack of PVP for a game that was built for it.I would say if you want a game that you would like to blow stuff up and shoot people and save people then this is your game.

												Homefront holds up pretty well, plays a lot like a “capture the base” game, but on the medium difficulty mobs are a bit bullet-sponge-y while the player dies super quickly. Also, there is almost zero bullet-tracing so tracking shots is very hard. Crossbow bolts get stuck on all sorts of invisible things :(Also, when you get spotted by the zepplins you have about 20-30 seconds to get into a safe-haven or else you will certainly die, plus even if you get back to a compound you own, it will still be under assault (though the enemy will never re-capture it)			"

												Alright,before i start speaking in details,i would like to talk about the graphical part firsti have a GTX750ti,i5-3450 CPU and 8GB RAM and i am playing this game from very high to high settings.So far its working smoothly,and i am not having any graphical problemsBut please note,i have turned off the SUPER-SAMPLING because it was making the game unplayable,so i will advice you to keep it down because i guess it is the primary reason for low FPS for other players,even if you have a great pc. I didn't face any glitches or bugs till now,like others have mentioned,so i guess i am lucky so far.Now i will talk about the gameThis game is not for everyone.Even though it has influences from Far Cry and Dying light,still it has distinguished itself in a very unique way,for me at least. How ? i will come to that laterBut let me tell you,if you have played Far Cry or Assassins Creed series,you will like this game.It follows the same formula.Capture bases,do side Jobs for money,help random citizens or assassinate a KPA general,collect all the collectibles,capture an enemy base to create a safe house....so if you are a gamer who loves this busy work and doing all the side quests and all,you will love this game...but if you are tired of Ubisoft's formula then you will hate it.So first decide what type of gamer you are,then only buy this game.Now coming back to the unique thing about this game i had mentioned,this game is brutal.This game is brutal.This game is not COD,.that you will just run and gun or like Far Cry,that you will have regenerating health and there will never be a sense of danger.This game will ♥♥♥♥ you up,if you just approach it casually. The A.I is good(if not the best),they will hunt you down, if you are not careful.You need to create a strategy,of how you would like to approach a target,how you have to spend you currency because everything is expensive.Eg:The protective gear is 5000 in cash,maybe you will decide to start saving money,but you also need health kit but you dont have any ,either you can go looking for it in a stash or buy it.Looking for it might be risky because you have to get past the KPA guards but it will save your money.Buying it will be easy but you will lose money.I loved this aspects of this game coz it made me feel like i am a normal person.I am not some God-gifted character who will just survive everything easily.My character will develop only if i end up buying gear and upgrades that's it.So theres a sense of progression.So everything needs to be carefully planned out in this game ,like a guerilla. You cannot just stand there and shoot everyone.You have to make the decision to run away and come back with a different plan.Capturing the bases is not easy.Its you style which will make it unique.The story so far is simple.I am in the yellow zone and i am working to motivate the people to start uprisings and all.I mean its a 'Revolution' game,what else we should expect ?The open world is distinctive. Till now i have unlocked two zones: red and yellowRed is where you can go with your guerilla buddies and screw everyone up,yellow is where your enemies are stronger and you are mostly alone,so you have to use stealth,or they will ♥♥♥♥ you up.So i can say so far the two zones are different and not similar which is nice.So at the end ,this game is not broken,not the worst game you will ever play blah,blahEvery game has an audience and i think it will only appeal to a particular audience.I found it great coz i am a part of that audience but i understood that it will not cater to other eveyone here.So if you have read all my points and you think this is your game,buy it....If not then don't waste your money.

												I had some hope for this game but nothing unrealistic. Graphics - fairly okay graphics, nothing anyone that's played shooteres hasn't seen before, decent night lighting, and using the flashlight at night actually illuminates like a flashlight. NPC character models are just okay copy and pasted NPCs with maybe a duifferent weapon or helmet.Sound - Okay sound quality as well, voice acting is okay. Actual voice from characters in the game is wonky, Sometimes too loud, too quiet, some times screaming at your face and then whispering to you.Gameplay - The meat and potatoes and I'll sum this up to be quick.- A to B Ultra linear progression,  example, you start off in a district, and then follow story points, rinse repeat. The only difference is that there are some side stops you can make on the way and loot. On that topic, you have an EXTREMELY simple craft and loot system, nothing crazy just 5-6 ingrideints to make a grenade or two, or a couple of devices.- Side missions, pop up and repeatable usually the Same AI's in the Same exact area doing the same exact thing.  There are other Side missions to do that arent repeatable.- The AI, is weak at BEST, most don't engage you, and if they do all you need to do is find a corner or doorway preferably, and then simply wait as they single file rush the door one at a time, if they even manage to find the doorway pathing. Most will stand in the open waiting to shoot at you, some take cover... very few react to seeing you, unless you let yourself get scanned. Friendly AI is even weaker, there's a half parkour system, the AI does not use any of it, and won't follow you unless there's a walkable path. On top of this the enemies here are pretty much actual robots, they take upwards of 2 headshots to 6 nody shots to bring down,  unless your using sniper so if your expecting realism this isn't going to be your sauce.AI spawn points are pretty terrible too as it's possible to clear a building or containers and have enemies spawn where you just cleared. even if you were undetected.attacking enemy walled strongholds is a joke, the enemies attempt to leave the stronghold or buildings to come kill you, or simply run arund ground level in the middle of it. Instead of using cover and tactics to try and fight you.AI -10/10Alot of the Gameplay is just repetative go here fight take point move to next point and its from a pool of the same 5-6 side mission pools, mixed with bad ai is just bad, with a very small customization pool , it's just not a game it's a pro longed demo TBH. TLDR - Not a complete game. Is Long Demo. Not worth anything more than 20$. DLC is even bigger waste.Another game that again just seems to over anticipate itself. Already claiming to have  ""Seasons"" worth of DLC ready to go, well perhaps if any of the DLC were in the game  it would have been more fun.			"

												Well, I never really had serious high hopes for this game to start with, but after playing a bit of both campaign and Coop; I do have to admit that it is fun in it's own right.I definitely do NOT believe the game is worth it's MSRP of $60, especially with the lack of optimization, poor keyboard and mouse customization support (changing keys in menu revert back to defaults as soon as you exit back to game), and the lack of content in it's semi-sandbox world. Now, after saying that, I have to admit that I bought my key off of♥♥♥♥♥for half the retail price, so IMO; The game has enough to justice my paying price of $30, but definitely doesn't hold up it's justification of being $60.AT CURRENT STATE = Date of Review 05/19/2016PROs:-Latest version of CryEngine 3 (Looks great in most areas).-Solid gameplay mechanics bundled with dedicated coop (coop is a blast with a group of good buddies).-Decent arsenal of weaponry at your disposal, including attachments, craftable equipment, and gear.-Voice acting doesn't suck nearly as bad as I assumed it would.CONs:-terrible optimization. Running on a GTX 980, I am only able to run most settings at 'High', even then frames bounce well between the 50s down to the 30s when there are more than a few AI on the screen (with enemy vehicles).-Horrible Keyboard and Mouse support. Changing certain keys will save in menu, but once exited back to gameplay, changed functions maintain default key press on top of what corresponding key that function has been assigned to.Overall: 7/10Final Verdict: With the certain flaws this game has, it does shine with a fun coop experience even if just for a few hours at a time. I'd still recommend this game to a friend, but I'd urge getting a copy from a respectable key site for cheaper. Once patched and optimized, this game will surely be bump to a justifiable 8/10.			"

												While giving this game my full attention for months and watching it, hoping it'd be good since I loved Homefront 1, I am appalled by the pure lack of awareness for this game's optimisation.Not to say Homefront: Revolution is a bad -game-, it's far from that. The story is a fantastic idea, dare I'd say fantastical, and the voice acting is superb. The sounds are fine and the gun mechanics are fine (for someone who mostly just buys CoD or Battlefield for it's campaign. Where it lacks, though, is just the technical side. With a 65 Field of Vision lock my nausea kicked in almost 15 minutes in. I was sick to my stomach and everything I did from turning off background processes to disabling an entire secondary display did nothing to aid my growing physical sickness. To add salt to my wounds the FPS lock of 30, while I don't really care wholeheartily, no doubt added to my sick feeling. Now add in the fact the loading screens lock up for 15 minutes or more and in the middle of combat awful blurry lag spikes seal your fate and normally if a scanner UAV sees you from afar the game poops on itself attempting to render th elong-ranged detection. I would not recommend buying the game in it's current state, but I would recommend keeping an eye on it. Maybe an optimisation patch will come out in a week or month. Perhaps I'll re-purchase it at a later time when it's cheaper and wont cause my brain to flip upside-down. For the sake of TL;DR, I'd give it a 6/10. I had fun playing what I could before actually becoming sick, and it is a fantastic story just like the first. All-in-all, don't buy it yet, but at least buy it later if/when it's improved technically. "

												If you're reading this chances are you already know what this game is about. I'm not usually a person to call out a game for not being perfect for everyone, but this game is actually disappointing. I love the setting, I love the idea behind it, and I love how it looks, but this is honestly a terrible game. It feels empty and non-engaging. The A.I. is a joke. I bought it under the impression that one would constantly feel outclassed and outgunned, but the opposite seems to be the case. I am a god compared to the A.I. North Koreans, slaughtering them without any real challenge whatsoever. The city, although beautiful and well contructed, is empty and without much going for it. Everything just seems empty. Again, this game just feels empty and non-engaging. There's constant radio blare while playing but none of it means anything. Perhaps they're trying to make you feel part of the revolution but it honestly just feels like any other FPS on the market, if not less so because there's no reason to play this. Literally, it feels like they didn't even try to make an actual story. Whoever gave this the green light should be fired, because this isn't even close to finished and it feels heavily rushed. It was a perfect setting and a perfect idea but they seriously messed up somewhere along the lines when making this. I don't make video games so I wouldn't understand the resources and what not this would require to make but damn, this is just a job poorly done. Save your money and spend it elsewhere, because this isn't it.			"

												This game is bad. Like really bad. The gunplay is one of the worst Ive seen so far. ZERO recoil, only visual recoil. The guns feel like toys, if you kill an enemy they simply drop as if theyd had a heart attack or something. Guns have zero kick and feel as unsatisfying as possible to the point where the game has me wondering whether or not they deliberately did that, for whatever reason.And if that wasnt bad enough the mouse controls are broken. If you aim down the sights your accuracy isnt reduced: its the same as before even tho your camera is zoomed in which makes it impossible to control. There is no seperate setting or slider for ads accuracy even tho thats the like the most basic game if you port a shooter to pc.So yeah they mightve fixed performance but the gameplay is nothing but a mess, which is sad, because the game has some interesting mechanics otherwise.

												 I had some pretty high hopes for this game. But in all honesty this game amounts to a steaming pile… The controls are very loose and they really don't seem like a FPS should be at all. It doesn't look like it even uses V cried – engine to me. What the graphics and lose control reminded me of is ""thief deadly shadows"". I would like to play this game a bit more but I don't want to go over the Time to return limit.Three thumbs down...  and to everyone complaining about the frame limit and optimization I don't really understand, I get between 50 and 90 frames Per second and my system isn't special.

												Games pretty good for what I wanted. It's got an interesting customization feature where you can change stuff on the fly. It's got the conversvion system which allows something like a pistol to become an smg. While I can see it getting tedious in the future I don't mind the hearts and mind system. It's a system where in each zone you must do things like strike points, forts, and protect the citizens. After you get to a 100 you do a couple story missions then on to the next zone. I can see how this might get repetitive to some but I enjoy it. I'm also playing on deathwish as i heard the enemies were a bit braindead. They are but playing on deathwish made me use the recruit system which basically means you can recruit resistance members, and have them fight for you. I've also heard the optimization on some specs are bad, and numerous glitches but I haven't ran into any yet. If you're looking for a city far cry this game is right up your alley. If you want something with more substance, and less busy work look somewheres else. I give this game a 7/10.			"

												I just want to start by saying; if there ever is another game, i wouldn't hesitate to buy it..Well... Here we go..As a major fanboy of the original Homefront game, I was hoping to see a more polished/ extended version of it. In actuality, this game seems completely different (i'm not even sure if it's fair to compare the two). While I was certainly suprised by what by what was delivered, the story seems fun enough, I am a little disheartened by the multiplayer. Which was something the original game did better than Battlefield 3 (before it became an ""unoriginal reboot every last detail except for the color of their eyes"" style game). I understand that ther was quite a bit of trading hands over the lifetime of this game's developement, and im happy that it didn't turn out to be an utter mess. The story was greatly elongated and completely unique compared to the successor, which i consider a plus.In the end, there are no other games quite like it, and i cant stress how refreshing the story was compared to the ""find enemy, shoot enemt, win"" monotony of most games these days. Ithink that most AAA titles could learn a thing or two from this.			"

												Many of the negative reviews criticize the optimization for this game, which honestly i have had very little problems with.  My game runs around 50-60 fps constantly with a 960 graphics card, so thats no problem at all really.  As for the game itself, i personally think the game is very fun, and has a good mix of stelath combat, with open combat as well.  When played on the hardened difficulty, the game offers a good mix of realistic damage, where you can die in as little as 3 shots, but enough survivability to make the game playable.  Probably the best feature of the game is the amazing gun customization, where on the battlefield, you can turn your assualt rifle into an LMG, or a grenade launcher, and so on.  The only thing that i found weird in game design was the lack of player dialogue, as you kinda seem like a spectator the enitre time during cutscenes.  I think the devs were going for immersion in the cutscenes, but didnt turn out so well.   But I honestly recomend the game, and although i believe the first homefront game had a better story and was more captivizing, the revolution is a pretty good game, and doesnt deserve as many negative reviews as it has gotten.  Is it worth teh 60 dollar price tag?  I would lean to saying no, because there are other games coming out right now that should take preference over this.  If this game ever goes on sale, it would be a great purchase then.			"

												LATEST AND FINAL UPDATE: I finished the game, 30 hours all told, and I really enjoyed it. I had one lockup after 27 hours, but that was it, otherwise it was great and mostly glitch free, one small bug that prevented a minor side mission from being completed, but nothing that effected the campaign. So, as before, I give the game a definite thumbs-up. UPDATE: I now have over fifteen hours in and I'm still enjoying the game. The game world gets even more interesting when you reach the Ashgate Yellow Zone (which is the third Yellow Zone, if you include the first one you see at the start of the game). There is color and a whole different looking environment than the first couple of Yellow Zones.And in those fifteen hours no crashes, no glitches and most smooth 60fps gameplay. It has slowed down at times, but the only way I knew was via the Steam fps counter, otherwise I never would have even known it's was doing 60fps. And damn, it's a really pretty, very detailed game.ORIGINAL REVEW: I have in just under eleven hours on the Steam version and I’m really enjoying it. It does have some rough spots, but it’s a lot of fun to play. I like open world games and Homefront scratches that itch. I think combat is a lot of fun and the modular weapon system works great and is a nice change. The plot is rather thin, but really so was the plot in Watch_Dogs and it didn’t bother me. The game map is fantastic. I don’t have any issues with the “greyness” of the Red Zones, there is a lot of color and objects around all that concrete. And there are tunnels and high catwalks and all sorts of paths to use.I do have issues trying to access some of the harder to reach locations, the game doesn’t make them easy. However the designers included a clever system of using blue paint or flags to let the player know that there really is something to find and gives hints on how to reach them.Some people have faulted the AI, but I’m finding them a challenge. They do seek cover when fired on, call in reinforcements and will flank you. And in the Yellow Zones, your stealth techniques really do get a workout.It’s not a perfect game, but it is fun. And if it doesn’t break new ground in some areas, it’s better that the recent Assassin’s Creed games and as interesting (in a different way) as Far Cry 3 or 4. Fair warning however; it does take a good half-dozen hours before you really experience the complete gameplay.			"

												Despite the complaints of all the reviewers, this actually is far from terrible.With a bit more polish this would have been a great game, in the state it's in currently it's merely ""good"". There are a few bugs and some features aren't as fleshed out as they should have been, but none of it is gamebreaking and it won't severely affect your enjoyment of what is ultimately quite an engaging experience. The combat is as good as any other AAA FPS, the environments/level design is gorgeous and varied, and the exploration is very fun. The devs have obviously put a lot of passion and work into this project, and through no fault of their own it's been hampered by studio bankrupcy and a slashed budget. Despite this, the game still shines and is very fun to play. A lot of effort seems to have been put into reducing the repetitiveness, preventing the player from getting bored. I'm about 10 hours in and I'm not getting that familiar dragging bored feeling I usually get when playing open world FPS's. If you enjoyed games like Just Cause, Dead Island, Red Faction Guerilla, and Far Cry, you'll definitely like Homefront: The Revolution. If your PC is powerful and you're good at FPS's, you'll have a blast. BETTER THAN: Farcry 3 and 4WORSE THAN: Fallout 4			"

												The game isn't that bad, but the technical issues does make it a pain to play. The game is basically FarCry in an urban environment, and I like it just as much. However, the technical issues does take me out of it some what.The game lacks polish, and it shows. When you climb over objects, your camera snaps in a weird angle after climbing over the ledge, not at all smooth like Dying Light or FarCry. Sometimes when you reload the magazine moves faster than your gun which creates a hilarious effect of you using the Force to reload. There's still plenty of other technical problems, such as the stuttering and graphical anomalies, but these were the little things that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most (for whatever reason). All it takes is an NPC's mouth moving slightly off sync from the voice to take you out of a game, and it only gets worse when there's a lot of little things nagging at you at once.Maybe wait for a patch before buying, but behind all technical issues lies a competant shooter. It isn't breaking any new ground, but If a competent shooter is all that you're looking for you might be pleasantly surprised.If you want to play a similar game, like, RIGHT NOW, go buy FarCry 3/4.

												My first impression is that this game is basically Dead Island with North Koreans instead of Zombies. Although it is accurate, I still enjoy this game as it is a breather to all other shooters out there that focused too much on just graphics or DLCs. This game was even better than Dead Island: Riptide, but not as good as Dying Light. Still, nice one, Deep Silver. Kudos on the efforts.In short, the game has potential, though I do say the game requires more tweaks on the AIs, Voice Acting & other parts of the game, such as the vehicles. I give it a 6.9/10. Will be waiting for fixes.			"

												1. I am loving the game the more I get into it, I love the concept the enviornment and for those of use that the current patch helped, the graphics are impressive when not even maxed out.  This is just a really cool concept and I thiink it's been done very well.  I am very excited about the add on content of the DLC's  As mentioned before little things like the best rain effects I've ever seen in a game really make the enviornment immersive.  It's been a long time since I've been this vested in a game.  If 1.5 does makes no improvements for me, I'd be happy anyway if it fixed it for a lot of the people still having problems.  I want them to be able to enjoy the game for what it is.2.  It's impossible to not have repitition in this type pf game, but with the exception of flashpoints they manage to keep it from feeling like you are just doing the same thing over and over. Maybe it's because there are so many viable way to take over a base/point of interest.  Even though some have very similar layouts, I've taken them all over in different ways.  The flash points are usually pretty much the same, but it's a free $250, so I'll take it!3. I'm a gamer.  To some degree, almost all titles offer some support at launch, these dev's have been pretty awesome with the feedback and responsivness.  If you surf a lot of threads, you see them reply to a lot of posts.  This is unusual for a AAA release, many issues have been resolved and I feel very strongly by the Dev's interaction with the community more will be solved.  They even reply in a positive manner to posts that are nasty.  This is why I would not be a good Dev, I'd be inclined to tell more people to go f themself.  People ♥♥♥♥♥ at them a lot and they have been really proactive.  Go to Doom's forums and see how many times the dev's post there.			"

												Take note that I have not come across any game breaking buigs yett nor many FPS issues like some.  Gameplay wise, the game feels great! Its a Far Cry mixed with CoD feel.  I love Far Cry and I like the fast paced gunplay that CoD brings to this game.  Also, the gun customization is amazing! Feels great and is a lot of fun to make different combos with the weapons! This game is a solid 7/10 for me! With some patches maybe even higher! Still waiting on the Day 1 patch though!			"

												Alright, I'm not good at reviews, but I tried playing this game, and seeing all the reviews, I went in with low expectations. At first, the game was a bit good. From the start, the audio was unsynced, the framrate was dropping, and the controls just feels... clunky. In it's current state, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, not until they fix it.			"

												INFO: -Intense, interesting single player campaign.-Multiplayer consists of various coop missions, independent of the campaign.-All optimization and framing issues I had-- outside of the opening cutscene-- were solved by adjusting the graphic settings to fit my system. PROS: -The game is difficult. It forces you to realize that you're not some COD badass, you're just some idiot with a gun and something to fight for.-The game areas change as you play. It's amazing to see this pro-KPA zone full of collaborators and such go and turn to rioting and uprising against the KPA because of your actions.-The guns feel real. They look heavy and slightly bulky because IRL they are heavy and bulky. You're character acts like they're heavy and bulky and this affects your ability to fight with them.-The strike areas and strongholds are each unique and different-- no one location mirrors the next. Sure, each relief center or whatever will have similar goals to capture it, but the layouts between them make each location unique.-The journal entries and other textual documents are actually really interesting and fill in a lot of the backstory.-The open world is legitimately open. You have your missions, but there are numerous side objectives to make your journey easier. Even how you complete your objective is up to you. For example, if the game wants me to capture a stronghold, I have a couple options. Do I use my RC car, attach a hacking device to it and hack open the gate? Do I set charges on cooling vents and blow a hole in the wall? Do I grab a motorcycle, find a ramp and jump the wall? Once I'm inside, do I go COD style, pull out my LMG and mow everyone down, or do I move quietly through, killing when I have to and biding my time? Of course there are many more options than this, but you get the idea. To be honest, different areas require different methods to succeed. CONS:-Occasionally during scripted scenes, and especially during the opening scene, the audio won't match up with the video. It's more annoying than anything else.-The ""Hearts and Minds"" missions are fairly repetitive. These missions are where you're trying to get the people in one of the zones to rise up and fight the KPA. The results of the missions are generally different, but the mission itself is the same.-The motorcycles and RC cars are difficult to navigate. The accelerate too quickly and get stuck really easily. -Once you get into your rhythm with your weapons, there's no need to buy the others. This can happen fairly early on in the game.-The AI is sometimes inconsistent, i.e. when they'll spot you and when they won't, etc etc.			"

												After few hours of playing I can recommend this game. I had a few visual bugs but nothing game breaking. It looks like the main issue for performances is that people do not know how to configure the settings. You can check two hours of my playing to confirm that on my twitch channel: https://www.twitch.tv/mukumihfr/v/67938952To come back to the game itself it's a nice mixture of FC / AC / Escape from LA. The gameplay is fun and easy to learn, the guns have a nice feelings. DO NOT FORGET TO TURN OFF AIM ASSIST else it'll be really bad. I only did the two first zones until now and I've been enjoying them. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it at full price but if you can find it from 45€ and if your configuration can run it flawlessly (I personnaly use a 980ti + i7 5775c) then you will have fun. Of course you have to enjoy that type of game. As for the graphisms critics, I guess that no one ever went to Philadelphia. Go check on Google Streetview. Once that you leave the center you arrive in those area where most of the houses are not recent. The work made on the city is really good and the game makes a nice representation of what Philadelphia looks like if it was invaded.So not the best FPS of the world but a nice game anyway. "

												This game is a lot of fun and the DLC for it is even better, the only issue is the frame rate, the game is still rather unoptimized therefore most rigs will not be able to run this well unless you have a beast of a PC. However the story for the game is fantastic and really make you believe your part of a resistance force fighting a revolution. I would recommend this game to people who have semi decent PCs but be warned, you may have to play on lowest settings and still only get 30fps depending on your rig. I have listed my specs below and I get around 30-50fps at 1440p 144Hz on about high settings.I hope this review helps, i'm not the best at writing these but I enjoy it so here you go ;)PC Specs:Processor - Intel i7 4790k @ 4.00GHz with Custom Watercooling loopGPU - Nvidia GTX 970Motherboard - Gigabyte GA-Z97P-D3 (rev. 1.0)RAM - 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RedPSU - 1000w Corsair gold HDD - Seagate Barracuda 2TB 7200RPMHDD 2 - Western Digital 3TB 7200RPM Caviar BlackSSD - SanDisk 500GB SSDCase - Phanteks Enthoo Primo Full Tower (Black/Red)Monitors- Asus ROG Swift PG278Q 27 inch (2560x1440,144Hz, 1ms) & Acer K242HLbd 24 inch (1920 x 1080, 65Hz)			"

												I am enjoying this game very much actually. I have a gtx 970 and had to turn a few things from ultra to high, but it runs smoothly for me. Graphics are great, aside from the dated looking npcs. The world is immersive af. Gunplay feels very gritty with every bullet that hits an enemy making them jolt. Story kinda sucks so far, but you love to hate the enemy in this game, thus wanting to just go around and take out every post of theirs. I should also note that this game is NOT easy. You die quickly and guns have quite a bit of recoil. Cover is a must, and you must always watch your back, because although the AI can be dumb af sometimes, it also will flank and get a nice surround on you. But it is a good and welcome challenge, unlike Farcry where you just blow everything up and then wingsuit away like ♥♥♥♥in batman.It must be noted though that there are numerous SOUND glitches, with some physical bugs as well. But the sound glitches are pretty bad at times. But if you can get over the bugs, which is totally possible with this game, and want a farcry game but with that feeling like you are actually making a difference along the way, then don't let the negative reviews turn you away. Just make sure you have a good rig, because it is demanding.			"

												Homefront: The Revolution is an ""open-world fps"" with some cool weapon conversions that change the way your guns behave and of course....maim your foes(KPA). And the game is just....Solid. Its not that great and its not that good. I have played for about 8 hours and cleared about half of the game. While the game is advertized as an open world game, it is actually more like open world segments that you can fast travel to and from. The story is pretty standard as fps games go. The characters are not that great, and your player character is silent. You take outposts held by the KPA and earn money for new attachments, weapons and gear to improve your silent character. Honestly it feels alot like Farcry,but with a slight post-invasion like feel. The graphics are quite nice on a GTX 960, and i dont really have any really bad bugs to talk about. Ign posted saying enemies just popping in, Ive never had that problem.As stated before the game is nothing to write home about. I was very stoked for this game when it was revealed, but now i am slightly dissapointed by the final product. The game is still fun with all of its weapon customization and solid fps gameplay, but the story is lacking. I was also dissapointed by the fact that there is no competitive multiplayer, however there is a coop mode but there is only about 6 missions that you can do as of now. And there not very intresting to say the least.Overall i give the game a 6/10 Im only recommending because there is no ""Meh"" option. I am enjoying the game thus far but its just a solid game. Ill play it for maybe another 15-20 hours then uninstall and let it sit in my library.			"

												Grabbed this+DLC on sale for 35 bucks, it's worth 35 bucks.Also grabbed it because I wanted this kind of game from ARMA III, but haven't got it yet... It's not really ""free roam""; you do roam freely, but the world is made up of comparment levels, interconnected by tubes, so still that old school Deus Ex, Postal 2 type free roam; not GTA or ARMA free roam... THAT SAID; this is a fairly solid game so far in my experience, I turned most all details down to low and can run it fine on my 1 gig 550ti, 8 gig RAM five year old system with no sweat.Story line and cinematics are pretty standard dramatic BS fair, rebels dress like rock stars; and don't seem fond of helmets... I donno... Anyway... Game play is good; shooting is good; explosions are good; lots of loot; could use more gibs; I haven't seen any gibs yet; why do all these new games fear gibs?			"

I have a famously low tolerance for bad open-world games, but this tested even my virtue; it's so bad.  Real bad.  Don't buy bad.   Maybe at less than $10 on sale, but even that's iffy; this game has very little redeeming features.  The story is frustratingly horrible at the start, the gameplay is uneven and just poorly laid out in the beginning.  Ugh.  And the performance on a GTX 970 is close to vomit-inducing; I've neverplayed a game that made me have to turn it down to keep from hurling until now.			"

												TL:DR: Game is clanky and buggy. Feels like it needs another 4 years of dev time. Some may like the game it's setting and atmosphere. Non TL:DROut of any game that I have ever played at launch, few have been as buggy, clanky and awkward to play on mouse and keyboard than this game. After a bumbling tutorial filled with the deaths of several disposable characters, the game drops you into what should be the meat and potatoes of any game, but instead of shooty tooty goodness you receive one of the most bland and robotic shooters I have laid my hands on. If you like the series then this may be something you can force yourself through. If not, you may want to avoid it like the plague, praying that you don't catch what this game has.			"

												Co-Op is a lie. ""HomeFront: The Revolution"" is tagged as Co-Op but the Campaign is single-player only and the co-op mentioned is an added section to play a couple of short missions together. If you want real co-op then you need something like Borderlands, or Call of Duty III; those give Campaign Co-Op.The game overall is pretty fun but has several bugs, like AI that constantly turns its back on you, or marked missions pieces that you can't do, or a map that doesn't remove something you've already accomplished. Hoping these bugs will be fixed in the near future though.It uses the CryEnging and plays a lot like FarCry 4 but on a much smaller map, not as open world, but in a city environment. If you are looking for something like that then it should scratch the itch.I can't really recommend for or against it and would sit on the fence on this one. But Steam requires you to Thumbs up or Down, they don't offer a sideways, so I'll go with an up since there is nothing majorly wrong with it.			"

FarCry in America.That's probably the best way to describe the game.  It's open world with a bunch of little tasks you can do... take this outpost, defend these friendlies from an attack, etc. while you have the option of following the story as closely or as loosely as you want.  So the structure of the game essentially is like FarCry in America.  Instead of open valleys, tall mountains, and little ravines... you're exploring a dense urban landscape with door to door, street to street, and rooftop to rooftop fighting in Homefront: The Revolution.If you've been a fan of the Homefront franchise, you'll like this game.  You'll get your dose of warfare that pits you against an invading army on American soil, a premise that's usually just briefly touched on or completely ignored by the FPS genre as a whole.The game itself, however, feels largely like a work in progress instead of a fully polished game.  The animations are passable, but not great.  For example... something simple like lifting a dirtbike up off its side and getting on it doesn't have a smooth first person animation where you lift the bike and climb on.  Instead, you press F and the bike lifts itself upright, then you press F again to climb on.  Looting an enemy for supplies shows a progress bar on your HUD, at which point when its completed you quickly pat down the body and you get your items.  Now neither of these really stand out on their own nor are they game changers, but when alot of repetitive actions have a placeholder-esque animation tied to them... they do add up.Bullet registration on enemies can be hit or miss at times (look at me making puns and stuff), which again adds to this rushed feeling the game seems to leave you with.  Often enough you'll see a few inches of an enemies head exposed while he is behind cover, but none of your bullets will do damage until they stand up.  Similar things happen to arms and hands when they are behind cover... seeing a small sliver of them exposed sometimes isn't enough to score any hits (which you know because the game has hitmarkers).I'm only 3 hours in so far, and while it has small things like that which I feel could have been done better... I'm still having a blast at the game.  I usually never play any game for 3 hours straight, but I just played Homefront: The Revolution for that long in one sitting and it felt like only an hour has passed.  It keeps me engaged... always wanting to capture the next objective, loot the next crate, and kill the next enemy.  It's hard to put down even with its shortcomings.  It has enough going in its favor in other departments that it makes up for where it falls short.So for people like me who want a shooter that does something different and explores new territory in more ways than one, I recommend this game.  It is fun to play.  I think it's definitely worth $40 at least, but I'm a Homefront junkie so I was willing to pay full price because I simply didn't want to wait.But for people who want to play a Call of Duty or Battlefield on US soil, they will probably be disappointed.  The game is heavily story and setting based, and feels unpolished as a pure shooter.  The gunplay and movement doesn't feel as smooth as Call of Duty and the environment and vehicles don't feel up to par with the Battlefield series.  The graphics are good enough, but doesn't really have the ""wow"" factor that FarCry has been able to achieve with each passing release.So in the end, it's difficult to have a universal answer to the question of ""Do you recommend this game?""  It depends on who you are and what you're looking for.  For me, if I want to play a pure FPS I play Insurgency.  It's an awesome shooter... even with approaching 2,000 hours in that game I don't see anything replacing it because its movement and gunplay is so spot-on.  But sometimes I want to play a game with good storytelling and a good narrative.  So for that I'm enjoying the hell out of Homefront: The Revolution.Overall I think it's a good game to supplement your other shooters.  It won't replace them, but you'll have a hell of a time in Homefront: The Revolution while taking a break.			"

												Its okay it is very frustrating and a bit stupid that i can fall 4 metres and die and take 20 bullets.I do love this game very much and do recommend it if u like fuctaristic games and a bit of war.I would love to say if you hate North Korea well this game you can burn them and shott them and tourcher them.If you like gurrila games this is your choice oh and you will need a fast pc i have 32gb ram with a itel i5 4700k and it can some times have frame drop and the ram is hyper xI enjoyed this game with a issus and bugs but its playable hope you enjoy it> "

												FIRST OF ALL EVEN THOUGH I SAID DONT BUY THIS GAME I DID THAT SO I GOT YOUR ATTENTION So I wanna start with saying that the idea of this game was very good, the graphics were really good with certain places and lightings, guns were cool and mission fun. However this game had a lot of glitches when it comes to driving motorcycles, fighting enemies, and a lot of other things. and also, i still have a ton of questions like (SPOILER) why Ethan doesnt talk, what happend to sam the doctor and much more. And btw, ai isn't that good, people run away and get stuck, and so much more things are buggy, multiplayer is not ok, I have the newest HP Phoenix with WIRED network and can't find any matches, upgrades are easy to get since you get a fortune for everything you do. I expected more out of the 'open world' thing they said it was, but instead, after you completed the game (which is completed in 15 hours with everything you can and may do) you get back to the homescreen. I also expected a lot more options in upgrading and techniques for brady. so in conclusion, Is the game worth buying?: yes, but only on steam sales. Is this game enjoyable?: Yes but do know that the ending is the worst. and the biggest question of this game is: Game director, did it really take you 4 YEARS for this short story?			"

												So, a big dissapointment. I'm not gonna write anything nice except for the graphics and weapon modding system. Other than that? meh. CoD MW easily topped this PoS. They said the updates are gonna be nice and such, but after the very first update I can't even open the game anymore. It's doesn't even crash bcs it can't be opened. Without warning, without anything. Just silence. And the multiplayer on PC will take ages for you to find one game, ONE!3.5 out of 10P.S. Seriously, this is a warning. I had high hopes for this game but they just dissapoint me. Very frustrated, not to mention it takes too much space for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game -_-			"

												I bought it, played it to completion and I would say that it was mediocre in most every aspect.The modular weapon system is annoying more than anything and baffling in some of the constraints (I can't have a grenade launcher and a marksmans' rifle at the same time what?)Enemies randomly and infinitely respawning is really annoying - especially when they respawn right next to you or in a place they couldn't have gotten to (because you were in the way of the only entrance, for example)While it might in theory be possible to evade line of sight of enemies and play cleverly, the placement of enemies on maps makes this improbable as there are groups of 2-4 enemies placed every 30-40 feet in some areas which means that any direction the player moves will result in detection by a new enemy.Vehicles feel clumsy (with mouse and keyboard, anyhow).One of the biggest annoyances in the game was that later on, my cooperative teammates were usless - they couldn't keep up with me and the lethal situations I had to bypass they would just run into and immediately die.One or two of the missions are poorly done and extremely frustrating.  In one mission you have to stay close to a vehicle that drives out of the area while being quickly destroyed by rockets.  There are absurd numbers of other enemies around and if you happen to become their target you will quickly die.  The story is baffling, too.  In the end you're left with no real feeling of victory and no reasonable expectation that the limited success you've attained you could hold.  The story is less open world than semilinear narrative, and in some places very narrative.I can't recommend it for the price that it is listed at.  This is a 30 dollar game, in all fairness.MULTIPLAYER I have not been able to join a multiplayer game.  I don't know if they are working, or how they work but I've never been able to join one and never had anyone join mine when I waited.			"

												Game seems fun but I haven't play long enough to know but two things I'm sure off, it's glitchy and the AI is dumb.I had to reload a checkpoint cause G-Man (an ingame character) not doing what he's supposed to do in the first mission. Other time, I saw a rebel NPC disappear out of thin air, glitching. Don't let me start with the AI, it's dumb as hell. They just run around with no cohesion. I get it, you're rebels, freedom and things but at least act like one, don't just run around in the street, alone, no one else to back you up. You're rebelling damn it, not playing some online action shooter (technically it's a game but still) where you can freely run around and do anything you like.I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's on sale. Will do a refund and wait for sale.			"

												It's the launch of Aliens: Colonial Marines alllllllllll over again.I haven't preordered a video game in over a year, and Homefront: The Revolution was the one to break the ice. That being said, the water beneath it was highly acidic, and here's why.The lag is real. The game engine itself is my biggest complaint, since I can't even really play the game due to it. There's lag, and tons of gigantic black splotches on the screen that decide to obscure my line of fire at just the wrong moments, so that in tandem with lag and shaking around forces me to wildfire towards the Koreans, and absolutely forces me to avoid stealth gameplay, which ironically is the whole focus of this. It probably doesn't help that you move like Buzz Lightyear, blasting off all over the place when that isn't your intent.The graphics in Alien: Isolation are far better than this, and A:I came out about 2 years ago; Isolation runs smoother than snow on a mountain in a Bob Ross painting, and it has phenomonally good graphics, and IT is (sort of) an open world experience, so there's absolutely no excuse for there to be such abominable lag.

												A lot of the issues at release have been fixed. loved the 1st one and this is more abitious offering. And a great one. Love the story and gameplay. Campaign is like Far-Cryish; capture camps, salavage materials, upgrade weapons. Graphics / Sound / Music are top notch. Great DLC as well, the freedom fighter versioin is primo.  Every DLC they released brought progress. Every patch they sent out made the gameplay better. These are the types of developers that should be encouraged and celebrated. Art teams did a great job, atmospherics are good, especially at night. It's also a kinda cool to see civilian districts change as you tackle objectives and inspire them to rebel. the shooting mechanics are solid. Each weapon has it own feel and you'll grow to love one over the other depending on your play style. The equipment you are given and can upgrade will make your play style individual - whether you go in guns blazing, stealth play or build a RC car with a bomb attached to really spice things up. Worth every cent now. GRAB THE FREEDOM FIGHTER BUNDLE...the additional content is a steal at thebundle price.			"

												From maybe ""bad"" to ""really good""Having played the first Homefront, which was quite...annoying (i really wanted to like it), the second comes in differently.SP is not the philosopher`s stone of gaming, but quite good, ""nice"" story, very good gameplay and handling, AND!!!the developers CARE for their game, still bringing updates and even new SP content.But what i like most...the COOP MP. Good Coop games are rare, but this one is a real jewel and it`s different :-) Starting off with little ammo, gimmicks and guns, it can be annoying in the beginning, mainly because one is not used to playing a ""Rebel""....Doom/CoD style is a NOGO ;-) but with 4 friends it`s really fun. Mainly, because playing COOP here doesn`t just mean ""playing on the same map and not trying to shoot each other""...you have to play COOP ;-) Things in the game (guns, attachments a.s.o. have to be bought in a store, where u can only buy boxes of unknown content...which is quite ""Rebely style""...u never know waht u get...and have to get by with it...brilliant!Only sad thing is, that there are ""not so many maps""			"

												I really tried to like it.  I fell in love with the first one when it came out and the first one got me questioning what extremes will everyone be willing to go to.  But this game???? it shouldn’t be considered a sequel, why??? well the first one set a good tone from the beginning with the economy going downhill and North Korea discovering it's become a powerhouse by uniting with South Korea.  The story for me went downhill when they changed the introduction to the game to the US buying too much into Korean tech and to pile the economy on top of that, rather than the nation rising up and becoming a real threat.  So ok I took a deep breath and started playing this hot mess.  I am running 2 980m's and even with setting the GPU to single performance the game is just horrible.  The shooting feels off, the AI cracks me up and yes it feels more like a Farcry game than something special.  The characters are interesting but that is about it.  This game is more like worth 20 buck, I paid 30 bucks on amazon for a hard copy of the game and after playing it I felt like I spent too much money on it.  The game itself is not unplayable but it’s not worth anything over 20 bucks in my opinion.			"

												I just downloaded the game as it's free for the weekend....however after 15-20 minutes I've quit and now I am deleting this peice of s**t! Poor optimisation, graphics aren't that good, but the worst part is the gameplay...tons of cutscenes(that you can't just pass) not much of action and cheesy line from the characters....I woudn't take this game even if it was free!

												DONT BUY ! Save your money...This game has really serious texture and fps problems. (yes, after the patches...)Some textures are not loading, in addition some texture like ps2 version. Examples, furnitures, graffities...And of course the artificial intelligence is really bad.(worse than assassins creed) I just played the prologue and the first mission and I send request return...Sorry , I really want to play this game but it is not like what I imagined. Dear producer,Just stop selling this.			"

												TL;DR Not good, not bad, but its probably better priced at 20 bucks or less.I want to like this game. I want to like it so bad. The things I heard about it before I bought it made it sound great. I got it... and... well... It's not bad, necessarily, but it's also not very good.The game is, in a word, repetative.Now, that wouldn't be such a big deal, but the repetation isn't all that fun. The guns are rather limited, sort of, and you get the equivalent of a single magazine for a few of the guns. The customization is actually pretty cool, but you can only ever take one main gun with you - even those it turns into 2 other guns - and you'll basically save up for all the weapon attachments you give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about in the first couple of hours.I honestly was disappointed with leaving the first area and having anything worth a♥♥♥♥♥♥already unlocked.The second area is a LOT better, but only because there's a lot more enemies everywhere. Stealth mechanics - or what exists of them - play a bigger role in the second area, but they're still somewhat weak. I spent basically the first 2-3 hours of my playthrough in the first area and only died a handful of times due to stupid mistakes. In the second zone, I basically just died every time I aggroed anything - and so the game takes a weird turn in that zone with only a bit of warning, especially given how medicore of a challenge the first zone was.Honestly, I don't think the game is BAD, but again, its also not very good.I'd totally recommend this if you're bored and its 20 bucks or less. Get a couple hours of enjoyment, or something to do, and then move onto something you'd rather play.This try at Homefront, while still interesting, is basically a sort of indie, alternate-reality shooter wrapped in a AAA title's clothes. The first Homefront was better, in my opinion, but at least this one lasted longer.Haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but then Homefront 1's multiplayer was probably better given the progression system it had.

												I enjoyed the first Homefront, I love that kidna♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also loved Red Dawn. This however doesnt get a pass. The story mode is a bit broken and confusing, they set you in a linear world with an open world around it. If this game was playtested by anyone else  but the idiots that did, they might have help this be a AAA game. Its so far alright, its kinda like Farcry had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. We all love that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but he doesnt belong.  Maybe some patches will fix some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥Steam wont let me reply to the question ""Why the thumbs up then?"" Because Ive been gaming on PC since 1998 and im well aware games dont come out perfect. I Still enjoy this game, and even like it with the mentioned problems. Hopefully the team gets this figured out as I feel Homefront was easily a surpassed gem of a game for many people due to poor marketing  and other AAA games out at the time.			"

												jfc,, this wes,,,,,, really bad. its not worth it. please. save yourself. the movement is buggy, you get stuck on low hanging ceilings if you have to crouch. the ai is,,,,,,, bad. I dont see the appeal, they dont shoot at you if you are far enough away, but once they are close they are pretty decent but they seem a bit omniciant at close ranges. Stealth takedowns arent actually stealth, all nearby enemies are alerted. Eventually i ended up refunding it because i got stuck and respawned into the same location from where i was stuck. and to clarify, not stuck as in couldnt beat it, stuck as in could not move. I dont want to sound too negative and i did have some fun but, if you look at this game too close it falls apart. if you are into this kind of game its worth it, but its hard to reccomend with the game feeling broken, like with the buggy movement. its too easy to get stuck and then it forces you to reload from the most recent checkpoint.

												I really tried to like it.  I fell in love with the first one when it came out and the first one got me questioning what extremes will everyone be willing to go to.  But this game???? it shouldn’t be considered a sequel, why??? well the first one set a good tone from the beginning with the economy going downhill and North Korea discovering it's become a powerhouse by uniting with South Korea.  The story for me went downhill when they changed the introduction to the game to the US buying too much into Korean tech and to pile the economy on top of that, rather than the nation rising up and becoming a real threat.  So ok I took a deep breath and started playing this hot mess.  I am running 2 980m's and even with setting the GPU to single performance the game is just horrible.  The shooting feels off, the AI cracks me up and yes it feels more like a Farcry game than something special.  The characters are interesting but that is about it.  This game is more like worth 20 buck, I paid 30 bucks on amazon for a hard copy of the game and after playing it I felt like I spent too much money on it.  The game itself is not unplayable but it’s not worth anything over 20 bucks in my opinion.			"

												Besides the story and concept being dumb as hell, it's an okay shooter albeit a technical mess. It's a shame Crytek UK couldn't finish what could have been a more stable finished product than what Dambuster churned out.			"
