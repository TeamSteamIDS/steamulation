												Infra is not your average game. There are no guns here, but there are still bad guys and monsters. There are no soldiers, spies or saboteurs, but there is a battle taking place. There are no jump scares, creeping horrors, or panicked flights from hordes of undead, but Infra can still scare, unnerve, and frighten you. Just not in the ways that you would expect.You take the role of Mark Siltanen an industrial engineer from a firm who has just taken over the maintenance contract for the city of Stahlberg, and you are about to have the bad day to end all others, and maybe everybody else's day toboot.You could use the words 'Walking Simulator' to describe Infra, but that definition barely scratches the surface of what's going on here. You could say that Infra is a puzzle game, but you'd only be talking about the tip of the iceberg. You could say that Infra is a job simulator, but you'd still be missing the real point of what is going on.Yes, Infra is an Indie Game, and a bit of a klunky one at times. With a smattering of wooden character sprites and voice acting recorded on what sounds like half a dozen different setups that needs better post production. But that's not why you should buy it. The chewy chocolate-fudge centre of this game may take some of us a little while to get to, but when we do, it should give everyone pause.If you've ever worked in one of those big, Star-Wars-scale industrial environments where a moment's inattention in the wrong place can end your life without so much as slowing down the machinery that just turned you into paste then Infra won't take long to get under your skin. The cracks in the walls, the leaky pipes and barely functional equipment. . . If you've ever worked in heavy industry and had to find a new workaround to each successive problem, and/or deal with OHS and get management to take things like this seriously, then the reaction will be instinctive. Like me you'll be thinking about all the dominoes that could be toppled by that half-flooded generator room or tainted water pipe. I realised that the game had me completely immersed when I found myself backtracking time and again to keep turning off the generators in said half-flooded room only to find out I wasn't yet past the point where I needed to have them running.At its brilliantly mundane heart, Infra is an interactive cautionary tale, and one that hits close to home for all of us. All around us we are surrounded by tecnologies and systems that we take for granted and that is the spot where Infra builds the edifice of tension that makes up the game's core. Because despite the cinematic license with which Infra's story is presented, the Bad guys and monsters are entirely human, perfectly possible. The horrific scenarios that play out have happened in our world before and they are doing so right now, even as we sit here unaware of their unravelling beneath our feet. Perhaps what is more horrifying is that it doesn't take corporate malfesance and corruption on a grand scale for those little scenarios to play out time and again in the real world. All it takes is a moment's distraction for one person at one step along the long process of getting water from the city dam to your kitchen sink.Games like Infra should be made, they NEED to be made, and in greater numbers (and yes a little extra polish would be nice too), about things other than psychotically emotionless Space Marines turning the seemingly endless ranks of disposable mooks into hamburger (or some minor variation thereof). Because if Infra can give you pause the next time you take a ride on the subway, the next time you flick a light switch, or turn on a tap, then it has succeeded in a way that few other games can, because you don't have to suspend your disbelief very far at all for Infra to work its magic.

												INFRA is a game that I first saw on Greenlight about a year ago. I was getting worried with the time it was taking to deliver BUT now that I have seen what they delivered I am blown away. The puzzles are great. They almost reming me of Myst in some regards. And the enviroments are amazing. I wasn't even aware the Source Engine could look this good and run so well. There are a few bugs at the time of this review (launch day) but I have confidence that they will be quickly attended to. The price of 14.99 USD is a very fair asking price for this game.  If you decide to purchase make sure you spend time to explore each area to it's fullest. There are little goodies hidden all around the map.  The subject of the game really is interesting. I found myself wondering about what sort of underground cities are beneath the city I live in and how much effort it must take to keep it running. When walking around INFRA I feel less like I am walking around river controls and steel mills and more like I am walking through an ancient tomb that has become overgrown and has started to decay. I can't wait to see what else these developers have in store for us.EDIT: This game has no real horror elements. It is more of a puzzle game. That being said  there were several points where I had a chill run down my spine or a feeling that something was not right was felt mostly due to walking through the decaying areas alone with nothing but the sound of wind and the structure creaking around me. It is no walking simulator with the amount of puzzles and a few fast paced scenes. There are no zombies or slendermen or Nazis but the enviroment and the structures are working against you.			"

												Ok, here's the quick and dirty on INFRA: It's a first-person, non-combat puzzle game (much like Portal 2 or The Talos Principle). You'll follow an interesting and mysterious story, explore fantastic urban environments and solve environmental puzzles to progress.The game has some flaws, which mainly come from a lack of time/money: the voice acting is dodgy at best, the character models are hilarious (and not in a good way) and even the written English texts have the occasional grammar error and misspelling (the devs are Finnish so that explains it somewhat).But none of that matters. After the first level, voice acting is scarce and there's no hideous characters models to look at, only the amazing environments (look at those screenshots!).If you like exploring atmospheric worlds and solve clever and logical puzzles don't even think twice. Buy it.THE DREADED ""VALUE"" QUESTION:It's a known fact that most indie games nowadays don't offer much in terms of length and sometimes ask a hefty price. INFRA is the exact opposite. The game costs just 15€ and the first part alone can last you over 10 hours. The second part is coming later this year and it'll be FREE if you already own part 1. That's a lot of high-quality gaming for just 15€ and more devs should follow this example.			"

												INFRA is possibly the best puzzle/exploration game I've played-and I've played them all. I've played through part 1 about five times now and I keep finding new secrets, puzzles and alternative routes.Urban exploration or infrastructure enthusiasts will especially love it, but I'd recommend it for anyone who likes good settings or atmosphere.A note on horror: INFRA gets its scares from the oppressive atmosphere of abandoned industrial settings, and its danger from industral hazards and accidents. There are no dogs leaping through windows or posessed pizza parlor animatronics to be found- no jump scares or bleeding walls, either. If you favor that kind of horror, best to look elsewhere- or better yet, try this game for a subtler flavor of fright!			"

Infra is an Indie atmospheric mystery adventure that doubles as a physics puzzler by day, with minimal and realistic platforming.It is a must have for anyone who likes mysteries and crime dramas. I love the genre myself, so was delighted to find something new. With the narrative of Stanley’s Parable, and the stimulating puzzles of Portal, Infra is sure to be worth the price. Physics in Motion:Things move, and you move with them. The world is more than just a traditional set of “maps.” Each map location contains physically responsive pieces of machinery. These provide open-ended exploration opportunities for the gamer to solve puzzles that were not spoon-fed to him. This one will not insult your intelligence with big arrows on screen shouting, “click here.” Either you find them or you don’t and you keep moving. Nobody’s holding your hand here. And there is none of that, “pile everything up and see what you can craft” mechanics either. Graphics:The artwork is well done and often panoramic in outdoor scenes. The platforming gives you great chances to see more of the view around the countryside. The graphics are satisfying in a nostalgic way. For a game that makes such low demands on the hardware, the graphics come out mid-range. The locations are mostly dark and dingy so, it is a whole different type of atmosphere, as in Late Garage-Sale/Early Thrift Shop antique furniture. Hitting things causes dust to rise.Sound:It’s easy to get immersed in the sound effects of birds and nature when in the outdoor areas. Ambient effects like birds whistling give it an airy and peaceful feel. I have the deluxe edition with a soundtrack of the ambient music. Lighting Matters:Colors on puzzles often play optical tricks in less than true color if you don’t check them with the flashlight. Ignore this at your own risk. Batteries, though plentiful, have to be located and collected as you go. Only turn on the flashlight to see then cut it right back off, moving without it when you can or you’ll be whining in the dark later. Telling Story:Infra is a story of corporate disillusionment, where corruption has left a man’s dreams as a rotting nightmare. I haven’t finished the game yet, so I have no idea where this is headed. But, I feel like I have walked into the middle of a conspiracy. The story is definitely intriguing and draws you in to complete the missions.Photographer:You are chronicling the story as you go, but the mechanics of the camera are highly restrictive in what is considered “correct” evidence of structural damage. Limitations of batteries will force you to think and evaluate machinery, rather than just randomly snapping photos, hoping for something to come out right.The game presents puzzles and keys to proceed through doors, and therefore the story is quite linear. However, the detective work consists in sleuthing out all the hidden codes and evidence alongside the linear route. This lends replay-ability to the game, since you will need more than the first run through to locate all the things you missed. I found it important to take screenshots of codes, numbers, and puzzles for further analysis after the first run through, as I have not memorized binary code, and I am not experienced with code-breaking. There are undoubtedly numerous types of codes located throughout for you code-breaking junkies out there. The locations in the story are extremely dilapidated and hazardous to your health. In the first chapters, I thought I would die traversing the electrified water spots. But, I made it through those just fine and broke my neck trying to jump off a roof onto a window ledge. It makes it all the more realistic, because accidents happen when you get too comfortable in a hazardous environment.Choices:As you play you will find chances to repair things yourself. Your decisions affect the outcome of your play-through. Everything matters. The map is highly accessable, with multiple routes for many of the missions. Pros: Not cartoony, and decidedly adult in content/ Not another Nancy Drew or Sherlock Holmes MysteryTechnologically and Environmentally relevant plot User-friendly game-play mechanics, real life toolsVoice acting is enjoyable. Real adventure gaming at it’s best. Mentally challenging / Intelligent puzzlesCons: Not an adrenaline ride thus far, just serious crime sleuthing in hazardous environments.No guns… you’re shooting pictures here. No inventory to collect, except those batteries Not a point & click Mystery, & no Hidden Object puzzles, I’m sorry. I highly recommend Infra to gamers in every genre, as it has something for everyone.Time in game is sure to vary depending on your code-breaking experience. A simple speed run through could be done in just 3 hours by experienced gamers, where I have 5 hours already and just into the 3rd chapter.  Achievements are nicely aligned to provide something extra for fastidious types who like to find all the details and enjoy the atmosphere. I will certainly be watching Loiste Interactive for more great games. Meanwhile, I have some more clues to find in Infra… and this is just the first episode.			"

INFRA is a puzzle walking simulator that starts you out investigating problems with a dam that is falling apart in a small town of Stalburg and uncover a conspiracy behind the events leading up to the mismanagement and downfall of these important areas of the town.  You use your camera to find disturbances and clues as to what is happening, as well as taking pictures of any documentation and other evidence that could ""aid the cause"" of the company you're working with.I will go through my rundown of what I thought was good and bad, and give a few more tidbits of why I like this game overall, and how I came to giving this one a ""thumbs up"".Pros:Nice environments and scenery.  Easy to learn the controls, as with many walking sims.  I like the camera in the game.  It's cool seeing the picture in picture, and taking pictures of things that should be repaired, or were neglected.  I enjoy the idea of having to be very observant in order to find things that are not quite right.  It is nice since I don't like rushing through games, and promotes slowing down and examining your surroundings.I like finding the pieces to the broken elements or fixing things along the way.  Expansive game, with a lot more to it than I first thought.  Trying to figure out the puzzles took me a while to complete many sections of the game.I like the various traps to overcome, and the changing environment as you get deeper into the game.  Cons:I don't much care for the voice acting, especially when I first started out.  It took some getting used to for me to adjust to it.  I don't really feel much connection with the protagonist either, so that is a little bit dry for me.  I would have liked to have a little more dialog, but at the same time I guess it is in the character's personality to be very matter-of-fact and not the talkative sort.  I did not know you could throw objects you pick up until a good bit later, so I would have liked seeing this in the initial part of the tutorial phase.The backtracking and trying to figure out what to do to go onwards can get a little bit frustrating.  It's easy to miss something, only to have to backtrack quite a bit in order to move forward in progression.I can't really tell where each save has me at, if I am curious.  I would really like an area select, so I could work on particular areas again if I wanted to go back.  I'm not sure if there is a way other than the four save slots.Loading screens are a bit lengthy and break up the continuity and fluidity of the gameplay.  They can take a bit of time.Glitches: Heard the train horn go off after the train was stopped on the other side of the bridge.  Also I turned around at the train tracks for a second, then when I turned back the train was already at its destination.Sometimes on reloads, certain sound effects would cut out for me.  I had a few times where I got killed in strange ways.  A box near a ledge might turn, and I'd suddenly die.  If I was not careful on my exploration, I might get trapped beside rocks, or other obstacles. I also trapped myself by doing stupid stuff with items I was able to carry, so use caution when moving these types of things around.  I had to reload a checkpoint or two because of my carefree attitude with things I could grab in the game.Not so much a glitch, but the controller for me was a little bit clunky, when compared to the mouse.  For example, if I was trying to select something on a computer screen map, I couldn't be nearly as precise as with a mouse.  The same thing if i were interacting with something by looking at it.  Hard to determine where I needed to focus with the controller at times, but zooming in could help a bit sometimes.  I liked having the ability to move between one or the other though.Other Thoughts:Save often, as you can get stuck in places, or die, and it will become your checkpoint.  Collecting the items is a nice bonus as well for achievements, if you're into that sort of thing.  They are not so easy to find though, in many cases.  While not gigantic, the game is fairly expansive and immense for something of a walking sim/puzzle.  From my experience, others I have played were much shorter.  After finishing one playthrough, I would have to play through again to get the achievements I have missed.  I would have liked to have some kind of level select to try to complete more of my achievements too, but I could not find anything like this.  I believe that would improve the desire to replay the game.  I would love to have some sort of map feature, so I could tell where I am at certain times.  It can get a bit confusing while moving from place to place, and I think this would have enhanced my experience just a bit.  As for resources, I didn't really ever come close to running out of batteries for flashlight or camera, and with proper exploration, they are very plentiful.  I also used both fairly sparingly whenever possible.  Overall, I really enjoyed this game, and I am glad I played it!  I would recommend to people who are into a more laid back and somewhat relaxing cinematic-style experience.  I could see most people enjoying this game though.  It was a breath of fresh air for me to see the combination of elements put together in the game.  It worked well, I thought.  For me, this fell more in line with that cinematic style, but there are moments where you have to act fast to survive.  I liked the dynamic changing world around you too.  The colors and textures were pleasing to the eye, and I wanted to keep playing, which is a great thing.  I wish there were a little more story involved during your own personal struggle to get through though.  With the place falling apart around you, there were many times you just could not go back, and while I expected bad things to happen, it was still surprising in the well done placement of many of the various dangers.  Great game overall!** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.  This had no impact on my rating** "

Job Simulator that's compelling, atmospheric AND fun?!You play as Mark, who is quite possibly one of THE most unlucky structural surveyors there ever was.  Stalberg's power and water networks are failing, and you must see whether you can repair them enough to keep operating, and also photograph every hazard and failing you notice.  Now, if all that sounds terribly dull to you, believe me when I say that INFRA is quite possibly one of the most atmospheric games today.  It soon becomes clear that there is something currupt or even more sinister going on, and that perhaps you're not as safe as you think you are.  There is also a tinge of horror with a couple of jump scares that you might or might not encounter depending on where you go and what you do.  INFRA is essentially a combination of simulation, puzzle, part-platformer, hacker and escape-the-room gameplay with a small touch of horror on occasion, but it is all in such perfect context that all these aspects blend seamlessly.  For example: the early game necessitates repairing and reconnecting a flooded dam to the power grid, which entails figuring out how to override security doors, power up machinery and repair as much of the damage as you can without getting yourself killed in the process.  You don't feel like you've been presented with a set puzzle at all but instead are carrying out your routine day-job in a simulation.  Some people describe the game as a walking simulator but it's really not just that: you're mostly not JUST walking, but figuring out a puzzle or photographing as many aspects of damage as you can spot, as the atmosphere becomes creepier.  The game's puzzles range in difficulty but none are impossibly obscure.  The most difficult aspect of the game is that it doesn't follow through in a predictable linear path: for example you might find you can choose Route A which will give you a whole new area to solve, or alternatively take Route B which leads to a secret but skips the new area offered by Route A.  As gamers we're more used to being able to follow ALL parts of the game (ie see the secret AND access all puzzles) but it isn't always the case in INFRA and you might need to reveal different parts of the game in different play-throughs.What's to like?The atmosphere and the rich variety of INFRA's different environments are superb.  INFRA is an absolute dream for anyone who either likes the idea of exploring urban decay or tinkering with industrial structures such as pumping houses, sewers, power plants and even a dam.  The puzzles are engaging and well thought out, helping the game feel more like a simulation rather than a pure puzzle game.  The world is large and, although linear, there are multiple paths you can take and there is realism in what you can and cannot do (jump off a 20ft ledge in this game and you'll crunch a few bones and die).  A lot of the graphics are truly stunning, let down only by some low-resolution textures on equipment and posters.  For people who like to solve a mystery, there is an optional code to crack (sorry - not giving ANY clues here) in various forms.  The game reveals a story through audio tapes, letters and newspaper clippings that you can choose to read or not.  For an indie game, and one that has only released two of its three parts, there is a lot of content already, offering excellent value for money (the third part is to be released for free).  Anything not so good?Not much, to be honest.  Sometimes movement can be a bit glitchy - especially in parts of the game requiring a bit of platforming, but I suspect this is due to the engine rather than the game.  The voice acting is not so good and (at first) breaks the immersiveness (but you get used to it).  Finally, you can find yourself inadvertently past a point of no return which might mean you can't complete an aspect of the game unless you reload one of the four limited game-save slots (or start the section again).   There are a few complaints in reviews about the speed batteries are eaten up, and while that is VERY true, it is the game's metric needed to create an urgency and sense of survival, so I can see why this has been done.In summary...INFRA is a superb indie game packed full of atmosphere - of particular delight for anyone who likes the idea of exploring and fixing derelict and decaying industry.  It's a bit glitchy here and there but the gameplay and simulation puzzles make up for this ten-fold.  Even though the third and final part of the game is yet to come, there is plenty of game already (it kept me busy for close on 50 hours).  If you like atmospheric puzzle and/or escape games, then this is an essential title to add to your collection.			"

Posted: May 16, 2016
												(Forgive me if the formattings terrible i havent written a Steam review before)Let me start by saying I really enjoyed INFRA, it wasnt what I was expecting (I dont really know what you could expect after reading you get to be a structural analyst in the first line of text but yeah...) but I felt it was a really rewarding and relaxing journey.So what actually is it?INFRA is a kind of mix between a game like Amnesia and Dear Esther, you get the puzzle elements from one, and the story elements/walking from the other (mostly the walking). I thought the puzzles were extremely well done personally, they dont have a sort of mad science feel that some other games like this have, its mostly about you controlling stuff to progress on and complete your job (which is to monitor how bad the spot is wrecked so you can begin fixing it).I've noticed it had the tag of horror but I wouldn't really agree with that, I didnt come across anything that made me feel uneasy at all, it was just quite atmospheric throughout. By the way you dont get attacked by anything like in a survival horror game. I felt that was something I should mention because I was concerned about that throughout. The story is pretty decent to, the game tells the tale of an economic collapse of an entire region, and you get to experience how it progressed to where it was by looking through notes and areas that you experience when going through the game. I began by not really careing all too much and didnt pay that much attention to the newspaper articles littered through the world, but then towards the end I started to read through them and found them to be quite interesting, so my recommendation was if you get it do that from the start :).This game has a great atmosphere too, in particular theres a section where you go into an abandoned steel factory and lose connection with the outside world, and it feels really earie which I guess explains the horror tag. The sound was done really well in this area too, mostly silent with a low bassy hum of I guess the old poweplant? Speaking about sound, I really liked the soundtrack for the game and I felt that it fit well with each section, so if you have a few extra pennies I'd say its worth buying it.My time played shows roughly how long the game lasts, and I'd say its not bad for a small indie game, infact quite good. Theres also multiple collectables and stuff you can go back and do for the achievements giving you a reason to play it again, which you know, its always a positive. Bad Bits:Although I really enjoyed my experience with INFRA theres a few points I think you should know: 1. The voice acting at the start was pretty bad, the characters other than your own didnt feel genuine at all and the animations of the people were lacking quite a bit (but this goes away after about the first 15 mins or so, so dont worry about that too much). 2. Its got quite a walking simulator feel to it, aside from the puzzles, and is more of a relaxing experience than an intense one. So thats something to watch out for if you don't really like those types of games.Anyway to sum this up, I also had a crack at making a video review which you may want to check out to see what the gameplay is like and get my full view on it before you buy it:

												Unequivocally the best first-person puzzle since the dawn of single-celled organisms.The game is layered with interesting mechanics, immense and immersive environments, incredible sense for detailing, and a story so good, you'll curse the day Jeff Walter set foot it Stalburg.An absolute must-play.

												INFRA is a mixture of walking simulator and puzzle game.  On the outside looking in a person may shrug and think to themselves, another walker, ugh!!!  (in walker I mean Walking Simulator not the walking dead silly goose).  While this game isn't your typical walking simulator.  The scenery is beautiful, the puzzles can be quite challenging, the game is billed as the first part of a larger series of games, with the sequel set to release sometime in the ""near"" future..  If you go into the game expecting to whip out your arm cannon, or unload your boom stick, or even blast away creepy crawling monsters you'll be disappointed, no weapons, violence or monsters exist in INFRA, but you will get an amazing experience and a good story, told through various memo's notes, and character dialog.  Tech IssueI had a few technical issues with my main computer, which was far above what the recommended specs are, and the game crashed to desktop when pushing play, white graphics in doorways, and a few other minor graphical issues.  I could get the game working but typically the moment it had to load, between stages etc, it would crash to desktop and require more tinkering to work.  I did however manage to play the game on my older PC which was barely above the minimum recommendations and it worked flawlessly and looked beautiful  I used every conceivable work around I could think of in order to get the game working on my updated computer but nothing would do the trick for long.  With that said, I'm not sure if it was the game or my computer which caused the issue, so I just wanted to put in here my experience.  The StoryYou start the game as a man named Mark, he's currently sitting in on a board meeting, the ""boss"" goes through the specifics of what is required of Mark and his fellow teammates (although you're flying solo this time pal).  The basic story is Mark needs to visit a location and document damages to the structure, while at the same time keeping an eye out for documents which can help explain what brought about the demise of the crumbling buildings and town.   Sounds easy enough, after the meeting which is a 6 to 9 minute affair, you're tasked with searching out supplies, ""getting some new markers"" and collecting the car keys to drive yourself over to your eventual destination.  What follows is a relatively uninspired trip through an office.. Unfortunately if these guys are ""structural"" anything, they haven't done a good job as their building has many technical issues, and the elevator can only travel between a few floors...   ANYWAY, after getting your supplies (minus the markers... aww) you make your way to the parking Garage...  after that it's onward to your destination, for puzzles, walking, and possible even a few deaths..  (I totally suggest the moment you get out of truck, head to the left and take a dip in the water.. so warm it's awesome..  sike.. if you do that you're totally gonna die, did I say the game was a swimming simulator?)   From this point on you search around looking for clues, looking for batteries and broken structures to photograph. Pros:Beautiful scenery, Can be quite challenging to spot the structure issues.The lands are fairly large and interestingDoesn't hold your hand... (you won't find no glowing yellow streams in this one)Puzzles can be rather difficult to figure outCons:Puzzles can be stupidly easy (although the easy puzzles are few and far between)Technical issues (may have been my computer?)Voice acting (the voice acting is like something out of the Playstation 1 era)Total lack of direction or explanation of what your goal is (it's ok to not hold your hand, but at the very least give some idea of what is required to move onto the next portion of the state)Backtracking (goes hand in hand with the above mentioned con)Loading times can be upwards of a minute (this could be my computer as it had other issues with the game)Some clipping issues, which can cause you to get stuckRecommendationWhile I had a few issues with my computer it did sour me a bit, I understand it was probably something on my end rather than the game's end, so I set that aside and will recommend the game based on the merits..  Unlike many of the other Walking Simulators out there, this game actually did a good job of getting the atmosphere right.  The puzzles are challenging for the most part and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.  If you go along and photograph the various documents the story will unfold and as the story unfolds you'll see a grim picture of what happens when a towns infrastructure begins to erode away.			"

												I was expecting a 4-hour game at best, but instead I got 18 hours of enjoyable exploration and puzzle solving set entirely in Finland, as it should be used more as a setting and not just for sports games. And that's just Part 1. I can't imagine how many more locations are in store in Part 2, which will be a free update, when I've already experienced the length of at least two modern FPS games for €15. Not only is it a refreshing change of setting from your usual New Yorks or what have you, though any city would work here, it's also inspired by a documentary about deteriorating infrastructure. That fact alone fills me with confidence that games as an art form is in safe hands. It's a fascinating choice of subject matter for a developer's first game and not in any way presented through a prism of science fiction or a military conflict, which is usually the choice for first-person games set in crumbling cities.Instead of having a decaying city as a backdrop, it's a character of the story. A victim of neglect, rivaling companies and corruption. You're tasked with surveying the structural damage of the city of Stalburg by taking photos of the damage. Finding documents and tapes people have left behind, you start to piece together where it all went haywire. You work your way through a maze of different locations, each of them detailed to the point of being believable, but not impressive by standards available to those with a huge budget. This being a crowd-funded game however, the scope and level of detail achieved here is shocking for a team of just 6 people, according to the credits.INFRA removes the guns, the aliens or bad guys with guns and you're left with elements that every great FPS relies on: exploration, environmental storytelling, quiet moments, puzzle solving, dealing with obstacles, etc. It's a game of valves, switches, key cards, buttons, turning it off, turning it on, reading notes and instructions to operate machinery and I loved every minute of it. You can find most of these in every notable FPS since the days of DOOM. The reason I'm emphasizing these is because the devs have honestly described what their game is about. It's not overburdened by pointless distractions that only create the illusion of immediacy and importance. What you're doing here is important in and of itself. The game sends a strong message of being responsible with the world around you, which is, among all these hugely expensive and ultimately pointless games, thoroughly heartwarming and commendable. Not to mention rare.Couple of moments where I couldn't figure out how to progress, so I consulted a video walkthrough, but I'm more bummed about the the stuff I didn't know how to repair. You're stuck between analyzing and trying to leave a place in a better shape than it was, but many of the bigger puzzles tied to achievements I just couldn't figure out, so grudgingly I had to move on. Thankfully there are no easy-to-use guides out there yet, so you can actually enjoy the puzzles as opposed to following a step-by-step guide on how to restore the functions of all these different facilities. There is damage, or scripted moments, that's unavoidable, but instinctively you try to be responsible where you can. These places have been abandoned, reminiscent of Pripyat, but the machinery still has life left in it, which continue to do damage.The overall aesthetic reminded me of STALKER meets Half-Life 2, so a big thank you for Loiste Interactive in filling a gap that certain developers have failed to do for too long. To crawl through vents and solve puzzles is not to be underestimated, guns or no guns. While I eventually gave up on reading newspapers or longer notes, towards the end, I'm very much interested in how the story will progress in Part 2 and I look forward to taking more photos and solving puzzles. Somehow I've managed to ignore the elephant in the room. The voice acting of the player character is atrocious, but it steadily grows on you at a snail's pace, cos it's just so bad that it becomes almost cute. There is a lack of polish here, but that didn't stop Shadow of Chernobyl in becoming one of the best games of all time. You have to let a few things slide in order to get something special out there and that's fine, cos it's important that we get to play this in its current form than not at all.			"

												Before critizising the game, I got to acknowledge that a lot of work, especially in detailling went into this game. But it seems like the devs put their manhours to the wrong tasks. The levels look pretty but feel very unnatural (unless blocking pretty much every fire escape door and denying access to all non-important doors is some sort of inside joke). The puzzles range from ""too easy/obvious"" in the form of ""get this item and put it here"" and simple ""read the code on this paper and then switch the right switch"" where the code and the switch are always directly next to each other to almost impossible to figure out parts of the game... more often than not you are supposed to pick up or pay attention to things before you see the actual puzzle. Exploration in this game isnt rewarded. I was constantly running low on batteries especially in the mid section of the game since even when exploring you wouldn't find any supplies. Exploring, well the parts that you could explore, lead to nothing and often you just ended up at places you were before. You keep picking up keys (they all look the same) without knowing what they are for.The only cool thing that I discovered were a hand full of easter eggs (smaller stuff) and a bunch of codes that seemed important  like the code on the sheet over the corpse, although that one wasnt really ""hidden"" at all  but even that part didnt save the game. There are better Indie games out there that look better and have a more solid story plus better gameplay. If youre interested in this game, you definitely want to check out The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, as it has a somewhat similar setting but is a better game all around for the same price. I do not recommend this game although I don't think it's terrible. But it's just no fun.			"

												I was very pleasantly surprised with the game. It looks great considering the aging engine. (It would be amazing on modern engines) It's very atmospheric and I just love crawling in every place looking for easter eggs and more things to photograph. (and if you're careful you can find plenty of batteries. I had 10/10 for both almost all the time in last episodes) Some people complaing about the protagonist's voice acting but I find it very fitting for what I imagine the guy is like :) The game has a lot of easter eggs, hidden things, things that only Finnish people understand (+/-) and on top of that extreme attention to small details. I found a phone number in random poster after the cave early in the game and much later I could call the number for some additional fun. Plenty of things like that. The basic gameplay consists of walking around looking for structural damage / other things that need maintenance or documents exposing corruption and then snapping a photo of them. May not sound very exciting but the beautifully aged environments make if very enjoyable. For me at least. The game really rewards exploration. There are also a number of puzzles which vary from simple to slightly more complex ones but  you don't have to solve them all (Unless you're looking for 100% completion) Good thing about the puzzles is that usually they are rather logical. There are few places where you have to do some precision jumping but if you've played any fps games it's nothing too difficult. There is also bigger plot behind the whole thing which slowly unravels as you find new clues and stuff. I have to pay more attention to it on the next playthrough but it seemed interesting enough. Anyway I'm really looking forward to part 2 and want to congratulate the devs for great work so far. As a sidenote I bought the game for my 70 year old father who enjoys playing Myst type games and he at least seems to have enjoyed the experience even if some areas that require nimble fingers were causing additional grey hairs for him :) As a final warning I'd like to point out that if you're looking for continuous action and get bored of exploring places just for the sake of exploring you may not enjoy the game as much as I did.

												Found this game on Greenlight a while ago, took part in the beta and I'm still impressed by the quality of the experience.This game really is something else. What sounds like a boring job is about to become a whole lot more dangerous. No guns, no ennemies, just your flashlight, your camera and your hard-hat protected wits. Will you just rush through the game and try to stay alive or will you risk your safety to accomplish your duty and potentially save hundreds of lives down the line ?Amazing environments, fitting soundtrack, interesting mechanics...I really hope the first title of Loiste Interactive does well, because they deserve it.

												This atmospheric, well optimized  game (Source Engine) has exceeded all my expectations and it is definitely worth the money! You dive into this beautiful, detailed designed, vast open world to explore all these unique, abandoned locations and solve all kind of environmental puzzles. Please be prepared for unexpected challenges resulting in death. You can even blow yourself up with dynamite. ;-) But the checkpoint and save-game system is excellent.  I do have 6 hours on record and barely finished chapter 3 out of 5. The only criticism is the main characters voice acting. And of course it is made for exploration enthusiasts. ;-)			"

												If you're into urbex, stop reading and buy this immediately.  This game is a gift to us.For the rest of you, this is an excellent first person puzzle game, with a huge variety of really interesting environments.  It might not be the most beautiful game in the genre, but it is extremely well polished in gameplay.  Also, it's educational!  I now know how things like water treatment plants work (the game concepts are broadly based on how the things actually work, just modified to make it a game).There's one awful thing, which is a headache throughout the entire experience, though it's worth it for all of the pros.  The battery mechanic.  You have a camera and flashlight, and they run through batteries, which you must find in the world (limited supply, though plentiful).  The idea seems to be keeping players from running around with the camera out like a teen walking with a cell phone - but limiting the few people who would actually do that [which is harmless, anyway] by making a problem for all other players...it's unfortunate.  It feels like it wants to make all the wonderful puzzles into time-based ones (which most puzzle gamers hate) - if it's dark, you now have limited time to work on an otherwise clever situation.  Or maybe it feels like you're constantly playing a horrible minigame.Developers, please, everything but the batteries is amazing - finding secret items is cool, but they can be anything else.			"

INFRA is a first person puzzle adventure game with a very mysterious tone to it. While some may call it a “walking simulator”, I personally disagree, most of all due to the fact that INFRA allows you to take different routes and solve puzzles in different ways. First off, it is necessary to say that at the moment only Part 1 of the game is available. The developers are already hard at work on Part 2 but, as of now, there is no estimated release date and the first part ends somewhat abruptly.I was really surprised as I began to play this, that right from the start the game doesn’t hold your hand. Even though it is a linear game, you are able to explore your surroundings within certain limits. The game also doesn’t give you an objective so sometimes you might have a hard time figuring out what exactly you have to do or where you need to go. That said, even though you’ll encounter multiple puzzles, they are not mandatory but they might give you access to documents that can provide you with some background information on certain events that could potentially shed some light on the mystery you’re trying to solve. Story:You play as Mark, a structural analyst that is sent on a job to survey some old structures for potential degradation. What begins as just another day at work, quickly turns into a series of events that test his dexterity and resilience. At the beginning you’ll most likely find yourself lost and with no idea of what is going on but slowly throughout the game you’ll find clues that will reveal why these events are taking place and who is responsible for them. This was one of the reasons why I ended up exploring a lot and looking for as many documents and audio logs as I could. The world surrounding you seems so mysterious at first but you’ll gradually get to know the city past, its history, how it became an industrial power and what led to its demise.Gameplay:INFRA mechanics will be explained to you very early on and they are really simple but yet, they add a whole other layer to the game. The most important one is your camera. You can use it to photograph evidence of structural damage and documents that contain information relevant to your case. Assuming you’re actually interested and immersed in the world, this mechanic adds a lot to the game. I often found myself looking at every single structure I came across looking for damage, and still, I only found around 50% of the evidence in the game. One other mechanic that also plays a huge role is climbing. You can climb any object, assuming it is not very high, by just getting closer to it and jumping. Of course you can also jump in the “normal way” like in most first person games and this will also allow you to overcome some of the deadly traps that await you.The puzzles in INFRA are varied but most of them involve activating switches or finding missing electrical components. Some of them are very easy and its answer will be obvious you right from the start. Others however, left me going back and forth on the level looking for hints and activating several switches in order to get them right which sometimes was rather tedious, especially on larger levels.Visuals & sound:One thing that became pretty clear for me since the very start, was the fact that the voice acting is very subpar. This kind of voice acting combined with the lack of dialogue didn’t leave a lot of room to get attached to the main character.Still, the game has great sound design with background noises and overall the music is pretty great as well. While the graphics close on are somewhat dated, from a reasonable distance they allow for quite the scenery. You’ll be exploring gorgeous open door environments, dark tunnels and abandoned buildings. Each of these places has its own unique markings, either it’s an old dam, an ancient tunnel or an abandoned industrial complex from the early 1900’s which make the game world feel a lot more real. All these aspects combined, provide for an amazing and relaxing experienceComplaints:- Loading times can take up to 30-40 seconds- I experienced some framerate variations (even though I’m way above the recommended system specs), one second I’d have over 100 fps and the next moment it would dip down to the 40s and sometimes even lower- The game auto-saves but there is also an option for manual saving. The problem I have with this is that you have 4 different save slots but it easily gets very confusing which save is which because the game gives you no indication other than “Save Slot 1”, “Save Slot 2”, etc.Final thoughts:Even though only Part 1 is available, INFRA is well worth your time. It is a mysterious and engaging experience that conveys the story by narrative means other than dialogue. It has its relaxing and tense moments and, most importantly, it lets the player choose if they just want to storm through the scenarios or explore them meticulously looking for clues of the towns past and the whole mystery surrounding this structural degradation. I highly recommend INFRA to any fans of adventure or mystery games or to people who are looking to enjoy a nice and relaxing scenery.			"

												Brilliantly designed, with superb production values and a clever, intriguing storyline. INFRA doesn't even look, feel or play like it was made using the Source engine, but it's a testament to the engine and Source modding community's versatility and ingenuity. The game essentially plays like an old-school adventure game, but with a first-person exploration twist. Worth trying out!			"

Plus, the community and the developers are very nice and friendly. =))  It's worth getting it. 10/10 Can't wait for part 2!*Update* as of 2016. 11. 23. Part 2 is just as awesome as part 1, if not even more, I've been playing it since its released and the developers have put a lot of work and improvement in both parts, plus in the appearance of the achievements. Well done! :) I'm more and more excited how it's all gonna end...			"

												INFRA is definitely one of the best indie games I have played that have come out of the source engine. It takes wondrous care in it's level design and mechanics that topple many of the other games out there. It scares you with every day things, nothing supernatural except you own imagination. Even though I do recomend this to anyone with any interest in puzzle, exploration, story or even real-life urban exploring there are a few major problems that this game have that are purely to do with immersiveness, user learning and user preferences.First off, there is no options menu in-game. You can save, load and all that but no options to find keybindings, change mouse sensitivity, or any of the normal stuff. This is really quite irritating especially when there is no information given during the game as to what buttons to press for the flashlight and camera. That said, there is a pop up telling you to press R for switching batteries when you have to. This needs to be implemented for when you get the devices. tutorials are important, especially without an in-game keybindings screen.Secondly, it is very annoying to me when I find this many grammatical and spelling errors everywhere in the game. In a discoverable office early on there are some logs that are written with many spelling mistakes and general sloppiness like ""close of bankcrupty"" and ""waiting receiving the funds"". These errors really take away from the immersiveness of this lovely game for me. Not saying that these errors can't be good if done right, but there are just so many and the game offers no lore-friendly explanation for them. Finally, the voice acting is really quite bad in some areas, with much of the scripting following the errors in the writing. I actually feel like I am in The Room (movie) with everything combined. Something I think also ties in with this is when you talk to the office workers at the beginning. They have voices, but no animations. All that in consideration, this is still an amazing game with even more amazing potential in the future. I am judging this at the same level I would judge games by EA and Valve, which is saying a heck of a lot for an indie title. If you read all this and are still considering whether or not to buy the game, do it. The gameplay is unique in so many ways it just doesn't compare. Fantastic job devs, keep it up!			"

												(TLDR version below vv)Generally not a puzzle kinda guy, shooters and builders are more my thing, but this one tickled my pickle. The tag ""puzzle"" is a bit misleading anyway, as this game has more characteristics of an unlinear adventure game.The plot is immersive and just the right amount of complex, even my good-for-nothing brain could keep track of all the people, conspiracies, fraud and general timeline of these events, which all stitch together nicely as you progress further in the game.Not only is the plot cinematic, but so are the sceneries. Especially for an indie game, the landscapes are beautiful and the surroundings highly, if not even meticulously detailed. You can barely notice the ""indie"" in this game.Sure, it's an indie game so it has its bugs and quirks, but so do the AAA titles- only they cannot compete with this kind of originality and storytelling.TLDR VERSION!!IS GOOD, I LIKED, MUCH STORY, VERY FASCINATE, SHOULD BUY!WHY IS BUY??-Story-Landscapes, graphics, general outlook-Attention to detail+humouristic details, easter eggs etc.-Originality-Not annoyingly difficult, but rewarding and stimulating- a bit like Portal-Open-ish world-Part 2 is coming as a free update(!!!!)WHY IS RECONSIDER BUY??-Clunky dialogues/voice acting-Has random bugs, although fairly rare.-I didn't recognise some NPC characters as humans at first. Doesn't affect gameplay however, just pointing it out for you nitpickers.			"

												INFRA:~~~~~   The National Consulting Group is a structural surveyor company and won a contract with Stalburg City. As you are one of the most talented surveyors within the company, you have been called to a very important early meeting. The gig is very simple; you are assigned to a specific area to check on all the buildings that were not maintained properly by your predecessor. INFRA is a first person/adventure/puzzle game where you play Mark, a structural surveyor who has to check on buildings in a specific area of the Stalburg City region. You will be armed with a flashlight and a camera. As you go alone in your journey, you will spot damage on buildings and record it by taking shots with your camera. You will encounter dark, enclosed areas and will use more than once your flashlight to navigate or to find additional batteries for your camera and flashlight. In your journey, you will gather information about your location by reading posts and letters, which, by the way, can sometimes give you valuable hints.You will encounter interesting puzzles to solve in this game; they are not that complex but might take you some time to get it right. Just make sure you read every post and letter. I must admit I was taken by surprise with the stunning graphics and scenery in this game - just brilliant, to be honest! The voice acting is just ok in my opinion.I had some loading and crash issues here and there, but nothing too drastic.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Stunning graphics and scenery-	Good story-line-	Interesting puzzles-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	A couple of crashes here and there.INFRA is an interesting game with stunning graphics!8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I also covered this game on YouTube: 


YouTube™ Video: INFRA (PC) - PXA Peeks 

			Views: 141		

			In this episode of PXA Peeks, I take a look at Infra, a wholly unique first-person narrative exploration game/walking simulator that stands out from the pack because of it's length and story that's...		

INFRA's a fascinating title. It's most definitely a narrative exploration game, often known by the semi-derogatory term ""walking simulator."" I'm not a fan of this genre. I thought Dear Esther and Gone Home were pretentious, overpriced dreck. Yet, there's something compelling and fascinating about this game because it deals with what seems like an utterly boring and bland subject in a fascinating way.INFRA tells the story about an engineer who is sent to a dilapidated, rural power generation site to assess and document the damage. This place is not only a wreck but along the way, you'll discover a twisted story happening behind the scenes. There's no combat and so overt scares, though you may get started a couple of times. The core of the game involves exploring the surprisingly large environment, solving clever but often infuriating environmental puzzles to progress and taking pictures along the way. The pictures are optional but help flesh out the story more and are also tied to achievements.There's a minimal amount of voice acting, though what you do hear is pretty cringey. It's a minor part of the experience though and doesn't detract much. What surprised me is the amount of content here for the money. INFRA's environment is massive and even though it runs on the Source Engine (it was originally a mod), it looks absolutely gorgeous and provides a really immersive environment. While researching my video, I regularly just stopped and took in the environment, something I rarely do in any game. Though you're in a wrecked environment and it is stressful, it's also frequently relaxing and zen. Most people are taking between 16 and 18 hours to finish INFRA and this is just the first half of the game. It was split up into two parts but the second part will be free and the developers are saying it'll be a similar length. Given that Gone Home was 90 minutes for $20, $15 for what could be over 30 hours is a frankly staggering value proposition.If you're really opposed to any game in this genre, INFRA won't change your mind. However, this team took something as seemingly boring and uninteresting as photographing a run down power dam and made it a compelling, beautiful experience with a great mystery behind it. If you're unsure if INFRA is for you and my video doesn't help sway you, give it a try. It may surprise you. It certainly did me.			"

												WOW, it's Half-Life 3!!!Not really, but probably what it would be like if the Combine wiped out everybody and just left. LOL This game is one of the best uses of the [can-still-always-tell-it's-the] Source engine that I've ever seen. The attention to detail with the environments is pretty astonishing! (Occasionally the framerate can take a hit when it overdoes the physics, though.)So, the game… Well, it's strange to me. On one hand, I'd definitely call it the ultimate exploration simulator, so if you don't like exploring for fun and for trying to figure things out, you'd probably want to pass on this one. Otherwise it's a pretty cool realistic discovery type of game.On the other hand, the game kind of keeps you on edge because you're expecting something horrific to happen at any time, but other than a few ""jump events"" there isn't any horror at all. The atmosphere is fantastic nonetheless. The world you're in is essentially deserted, except for a few places you can see actual normal life happening.All in all, quite the cool game worth the time if you like to explore realistic, dangerous, abandoned environments and solve some puzzles, as well as discover an interesting backstory, all the while wondering where everyone went and why the heck you're even bothering. :>			"

												Fantastic game. Currently I don't know if it's worth $15, but the developers are going to add further parts for no cost to those who own it, so it will be worth it in time.Plot: The story feels a bit forced, but it is interesting, and fits very well with the concept of the game. It has a lot of potential for advancement, and is left on a cliffhanger that does work. I'm looking forward to the continuation with the updates.Puzzles: The puzzles are Portal-style; built into the level, completing them is the only way to get through. There's a mix of physics puzzles, jumping puzzles, and others that incorporate many different concepts and features into them. Some are easy, some are very hard, but I was able to get through all of them except one without having to look on the discussion forums, and in that case, it was because the instructions were poorly worded. Here's a tip; remember to always look at EVERYTHING in the area. There are a few puzzles that I feel are unnecessarily hard, and one or two instances where the instructions themselves are unclear (water treatment plant...) but you can work past them, and the developers are very active on the forums answering questions if it comes to that.Graphics: The game is gorgeous. There are some incredible locations, both outdoors and indoors. Some of the locations remind me of the coastal area in Half Life 2, but much more beautiful. So while the game produces plenty of great outdoor scenes, the indoor locations also do not fall to the tendency that games have to make their indoor locations boring and dark. The indoor locations feel varied but familiar, with new visuals every time.Sounds: The sound design is pretty good, nothing to phone home about. There isn't much you can do with this kind of a game, but it feels atmospheric, which is about all is needed, I guess. Voice acting could use some work, particularly the main character, but it is far from game-breaking. The music is pretty average throughout, but there are a few points where just the right piece starts playing at just the right moment, creating a fantastic feeling.Overall, if you like puzzles, I would recommend this game. The first part of the story took me about 9.3 hours to complete, with a pretty average amount of struggling, so with the updates, there will be enough content to make it worth it. If you've always wanted to be able to explore infrastructure (like me), this will be a blast. I can't vouch for its accuracy, but it feels realistic, and that's pretty much all I care about. I'm looking forward to what kind of new locations I'll get to explore in the next chapter.			"

												INFRA is a different type of game – a first-person exploratory puzzler. No guns – the only things you'll be shooting are pictures; minimal inventory – just your camera, flashlight, batteries for both, and whatever random bit of the environment you're lugging around at the moment, whether that be a fuse that belongs in a fusebox somewhere, a crate you'll need to cross a pool of electrified water, or an empty beer bottle that's just lying around, waiting to be smashed. Infrastructure Isn’t SexyYou play an engineer who works for a fictional Baltic country's infrastructure inspection service (in case you're wondering, the developers are based in Finland). Your job is to go out to inspect dams, highways, bridges – all the little things that make life easier, but could cause disasters if they break. And boy, do they ever break.In a nice nod to just how things work in the real world (channeling John Oliver here), the nation's infrastructure – and the agency itself – is pretty blatantly underfunded. Even your starting office area is badly in need of repair, and only sparsely staffed. The workers hanging around complain about unsafe – but heavily used – tunnels that they refuse to drive through because they know just how bad they are.The plot of the game kicks off with a typical, monotone office meeting (which, mercifully, you can skip), explaining where to go (a local abandoned dam system) so that you can gather photographic evidence of the repairs that need to be done, as well as doing patch jobs on whatever you can. Using your camera (or flashlight) drains batteries like crazy, but you can find plenty of them as you go along. The only downside is that there is no real way to tell how many batteries of each type you have left, aside from your character's comments when picking up fresh packs or installing a new set. The digital camera – which helpfully adjusts its viewfinder whenever you point it at something you need to photograph, has a battery meter; the flashlight just grows dimmer and dimmer to the point of uselessness, as its way of saying “Feed me!” The whole short battery lifespan thing is par for the course for a video game – but, obviously, they only drain when they are active (this includes looking around with the camera out).Your secondary purpose, along the way, is to figure out why the place was abandoned in the first place – and you can even find some evidence pointing to this in your home office if you explore it thoroughly enough. It looks like a profound lack of funding might not be the only problem with this country. Dam ItINFRA uses standard WASD for movement controls, E to interact, R to reload batteries, F to toggle the flashlight; jump, crouch, pickup/drop/throw – you know the drill. All fairly standard FPS-type controls. Spinning the mouse wheel toggles the camera, and clicking it zooms in or out. For better or for worse, there’s no HUD, and no inventory screen.If you don't quite make a jump, you just get kicked back a few seconds of gameplay. They want you to play the game, not re-do ten minutes of running around every time you miss a jump by a few pixels. There are no enemies save for the environment itself – a few feet of water, most falls, etc. will one-shot kill you if you're not careful, along with the more obvious deathtraps such as the aforementioned electrified pools of water. For certain scripted, survivable falls, your character will have something to say about that, complete with some colorful language. Graphics and SoundThe game is simply gorgeous at maxed visuals, even on a mid-range graphics card (GeForce 660). Old crumbling bricks and concrete, rust-covered metal, faded glass, and flowing water all contribute nicely to the atmosphere of the game, while providing an effective contrast to the relative sterility of your equally-in-need-of-repair home office. The dam and its environs feel abandoned and empty, even if most of the vehicles you find look brand new, and have been polished to a mirror shine!The ambient noises that comprise much of the soundtrack accompany the visuals well – birds chirping out in the wilderness, winds rushing down deserted corridors, water dripping off of rusty pipes, etc.[Eric Kei]SummaryINFRA is a nice break from the run-of-the-mill first person games. They take a topic that most people find exceedingly dull, but with a touch of mystery, some entertaining gameplay mechanics, and excellent visuals, turn it into something worth sinking several hours into – and it's longer than you might think. A true exploration game.http://www.dlh.net/en/reviews/2128/infra--pc-.html "

												Note: This review is of INFRA Part 1.  The developers have indicated their intent to produce Parts 2 and 3 and release them as a free upgrade for owners of Part 1.  Even so, if they'd restructured the ending of Part 1 to be more definitive and called the game finished, I honestly wouldn't see much reason to complain about the length (though it is possible to blast through Part 1 quickly if you want to skip all the extra puzzles and content).Alternate title: ""Loading Screens: The Game"".   Perhaps it's because I had all my settings cranked up as high as they'd go, but my first time through INFRA (Part 1), I had loading screens that would take a full 30 minutes to complete.  That's not an exaggeration - I was watching the clock.  It may have been generating a Shader Cache or something because loading times on subsequent playthroughs could be lengthy, but never quite that long again.Alternate title: ""Bridge Inspector: The Game""One of INFRA's greatest strengths is its unique subject matter.  I can't think of another game offhand that's focused on Civil Engineering slash Municipal Infrastructure Inspection.  Sound boring?  Sometimes, yes.  INFRA is largely a walking simulator, and much of the content can be safely ignored, but the realistic setting provides for an Urban Exploration vibe where seeing the ""underside"" of everyday locations is the reward.  There are puzzles scattered about, though nothing too mind-bending.  Most major obstacles will have a couple of paths around them, so a single puzzle isn't likely to stymie your progress, though obesssive explorers will want to backtrack and see what they missed.  There are a few moments of panic where quick action is necessary to avoid an untimely demise, but nothing too taxing.  There is a single jump scare, but it's located off the main path and you have to work really hard to even find it, and once you're headed toward it you'll probably be expecting it anyway.Alternate title: ""Markku Siltanen and the Most Power-Hungry Camera in the World""A central gameplay element is your charge as structural analyst Markku to document structural defects in the infrastructure of the fictional Eastern European city of Stalberg by photographing them with your camera.  The camera has a voracious appetite for batteries, which can be found scattered along your path through the game world.  You can carry up to 10 packs of spares, which would be enough for a year-long tour of Europe in reality, but here you'll be changing batteries every handful of photos.  I tended to be judicious about only pulling the camera out when I was pretty sure there was a subject to be photographed, and I explored every nook and cranny, so I never actually ran out of batteries completely.There's also a flashlight which requires different batteries, but the same experience applies.Alternate title: ""Alt-Tab and the Infinite Sadness""Again, this may just be my particular setup, but INFRA would not recover if I Alt-Tabbed out to the desktop or another application, or clicked on something on my 2nd monitor.  This wouldn't be as much of an issue except that I had a couple of reasons to want to do so:First, did I mention the 30-minute load times?  I would liked to have done something else while the little white bar crept through the darkness.  I had to get out my PHONE of all things (hashtag first world problems).Second, I'm an achievement junkie, and four of the achievements are particularly brutal because of a specific requirement.  They're awarded for finding 90% of the collectibles in the game IN A SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH.  Since running around with your camera out searching for hotspots burns through batteries, it's nice to finish the game and then go back for a second round with a walkthrough open to make sure you're not missing anything.  But don't try to Alt-Tab to your browser (or scroll in the browser on your second monitor) because INFRA won't recover.  (And then you have to force it closed and endure the loading screen again to get back to where you were.)Alternate title: ""English As A Second Language: The Game""The voice acting is...hard to pin down.  I can't tell if it's bad, or if it's genuinely trying to be an Eastern European speaking English as a second language.  After a while, you just get used to Markku's accent, but I did find myself wondering why he was thinking out loud in English instead of his native tongue.All in all, I enjoyed INFRA.  It's a Source engine game so it's showing its age, but the setting is well-built and immersive and the plot is compelling.  Despite its shortcomings it's a worthwhile purchase on sale, even in its current incomplete state, especially for fans of more low-key exploratory experiences.			"

												Extraordinary! I love games with atmosphere and mood with a cold finger pressing on your brain somewhere you cant quite reach. INFRA is massive. Logical puzzles. Awesome modelling and texturing as well as sound. The positives far, far outweigh any negatives. Its quite unique and has me hooked.Awesome job, well worth the money even at full price. You'll love it.			"

												INFRA appears to be a walking simulator on the surface but there is so much more beneath the surface. If you want a game that will allow you to explore abandoned structures and offer you some great puzzles along the way I highly recommend INFRA.INFRA manages to separate itself from the pack of walking simulators very quickly by making every area of the game worthy of exploring, but also having so many puzzles that immerse you into the world and contribute to the tone and atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are very creative, often involving many different variables and there are often puzzles that you will miss on your first playthrough (I know I did!). The enviroments are large and open ended -  exploring the enviroments never ceases to be interesting. In fact on my second playthrough I found many areas and passages that I had missed on my first playthrough which I thought I did a thorough job on. However even on my second playthrough I still didn't get the 90% repaired achievement. The amount of content is amazing and with part 2 out and continuing the line of excellent puzzle design, interesting world development it pains me to see the game so underrated. The voice acting at times sounds weird. As if the voice actor wasn't a native English speaker and was fighting with his accent. It isn't a big deal and I've come to find some of the lines endearing over my playtime. Overall INFRA is a game I highly recommend. A gem that cannot - should not - be missedYa'll better nominate this game for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.			"

												INFRA is the story of a structural analyst who seems to enjoy ending up in life threatening situations, and has scant regard for his own personal safety, working for a consulting firm who clearly sees hard hats as the pinnacle of heath and safety, happy send their staff alone into potentially unsafe bits of infrastructure.OK, snark mode off, INFRA is a very impressive game for the price. It has it's flaws, and it can be frustrating at times for all the wrong reasons, but the effort put in to the locations and enviroments shines through. The one thing that stood out for me the most was the realism I got from the sheer attention to detail. The devs have clearly done their location research, starting all the way with the office at the beginning, through to every piece of infrastructure in the game. Occasionally some breaks from reality are present for gameplay reasons (our protagonists rather liberal interpretation of health and safety protocols included, as well as the general lack of safety features within the infrastructure, though the story may give some reasons for this), but from the offices to the shop floor, there was a definite sense of immersion that came with such realistic detail.My main critcisms would be that it relies a little too much on ""first person platforming"", much like half-life did back in the day, the puzzles often rely on obscurity rather than logic (though this may have been a good thing, real infrastructre doesn't want to make you solve the soup cans before shutting down a malfunctioning turbine!), and sometimes it's not obvious what your immediate objective is, particularly as there are often multiple paths which can leave you worried you've missed something.Overall, a great game for the price, and worth it for an enjoyable weekend play.

												Don't understand me wrong, this game has potential.It has good graphics and environment(oh well ... beside that you are mostly alone in an area that has no people and the only animals you see are some birds).I also like the small jokes/eastereggs hidden within the game.The map itself is big and has a lot of small details.Now comes the bad Part:Basically this is like a walking simulator and no real adventure game.There are some small puzzles inside, like geting Key. push the right buttons, place boxes etc.but it somehow does not feel like you could enjoy those puzzles for some reason ... it's missing something.You have only one tool(a camera) that basically only helps you to give you some additional information.(if you are lucky)I was disappointed because i somehow expected more about it.It would have helped if thes atleast would have added a collection page for photos or something that makes it feel like a challenge to find everything.(even if its optional)Although its Tagged as ""Horror"" you should not expect anything like that.It has some low shocking moments but that won't make it a ""Horror"" game.The game is somehow different from others, but it probably won't be a game for everybody.

												First of all...I HATE puzzles.......because I SUCK at them.That being said this was a pleasant surprise.I still HATE the puzzles but,it is still quite fun.The story is amazing albeit a little vague(for good reason I am guessing).The suspense in the game comes from the ""suggested""twisted nature of an apparent company mogul that went crackers.The inferred nature of the insanity is irresistable.You can't wait to get past the next puzzle to hear more of the story or read it in conveniently placed newspapers and notes.They really helped me a lot with some of the puzzles.(Thanks Devs)The level layout is awesome and the vista's are beautiful.Assuming there is another installment of the game I can't wait.

												I'm absolutely loving this and looking forward to the rest of the story. The research work that the devs put into making this must have been phenomenal - to make all the machines and infrastructure work as we all take for granted that it does in the real world. My only complaint is the jumping/climbing mechanics - it would have been better if they had just left the physics to work like it does in Half-Life 2.			"

If you want an episodically adult adventure, with puzzles, platforming and no gore, you probably need this game.First of all I have to say that this game is pretty good and deserve an upvote more. It has a very nice graphic, a good background sound, nice gameplay and a decent story. Everything, a good game needed. The game starts in a conference room where you wait for your boss and some work colleagues, they talk about work and what to do in future and you have to click some “PowerPoint”.  Then you get your mission. Go to a dam in a ghost town, documenting everything is broken or wrong and find documents, so far so good, first I search for my office to get my stuff I really need (flashlight, camera, helmet), as I found it I see, oh nice the boss gave me the new car. So I go throw the bureau and find all the things. That is how the game is all the time only in little.  Now I have to find the garage in basement, everything is broken, oh my god, go down the stairs, use the elevator, find the door key…ten minutes later…get into the car. (Short sequence) Get out of the car and the game starts finally. There I can make some pictures and I hear a gentle ringing (sound if you found something what broken or wrong). There are some items to collect but not many, batteries for flashlight and cam and the keyitems like keys, boltcutter etc. You can move some items like crates, in some situations its really necessary. The puzzles are mostly logical and aren’t hard, sometimes you will run in circles to search for the solution.This game has no GUI, no inventory, no journal and no hints. If you collect or use batteries the character say how many packs left. This kind of style is OK for me. BTW save you batteries for later game, you will need it.Graphic is very good, not an eye-catcher but still good. Environment and buildings very nice created. The price for the game is good, not pricy and there will be added more content.Game: 8/10Graphic: 8/10Sound: 9/10 "

												It is a really awesome game like I never seen before. The saga begins like that: ""Once in ethernity our hero decided to do his job properly..."" Your job to make photos of damaged structures and your hero is so pationate that he is ready to do some damage himself (and make a photo of it), by turning on things that shouldn't be touched and even using explosives! At first it is quite strange to have no health points, inventory, map or anything else, only batteries are stucked and their number is announced by picking or using them. But soon it seems very normal. Puzzles are also weird and unusual. You might think that if there is crank or fuse, it should be applied somewhere? NO! Sometimes you need it, sometimes not. Also, stacking boxes is often a nice way to make a shortcut. Normally I'm quite sceptical about Indie games, but this one is out of the pattern. Definitely strong 9/10.			"

												Engineer Simulator 2016.There's no combat here, you basically just walk around facilities, taking care of problems. It's not just a walking sim, though, as you need to use your head: Documenting problem areas with your camera, turning valves and flipping switches to solve the puzzles and progress in the game.  Voice acting is pretty bad but the game has a great, slightly eerie atmosphere to it. Quite impressive attention to details, especially when it comes to indoor locations. Outdoors, however, the Source engine is showing its limits and it doesn't look much better than HL2.All in all, I must say I'm enjoying it. And apparently Part 2 and 3 are coming later, as free additions.			"

Decent Game but Poor Parts Ruin ItI'm disappointed by this game. The idea is nice; pure exploration with some social commentary and light puzzles. Unfortunately, a few design decisions are just so poor that it ruins the experience. Some examples:At one point, as soon as you step onto a rickety raft, it launches and it's incredibly difficult to steer. If you hit anything, it breaks apart and you ""die"" because you touched deep water.There are several places where you have to jump around like a platformer. You even have to place boxes in exactly the right place or your feeble jumping skills won't make the gap.In another area, the instructions (which are generally good) say ""do this and that opens"", but what they don't mention is it doesn't open immediately after you do ""this"". Because the ceiling is collapsing (which will kill you), you are looking for immediate feedback.The level design is generally good, but in a few places, very vexing. There are several places where once you go through a particular door, you cannot go back and there's stuff you missed.There are way too many places that require you to crouch (which makes you move very slowly) or are very dark (which requires the flashlight). I understand this is realistic, but after the umpteenth ventilation duct and dark room, it just becomes a massive drag.In short, this game seems to want to be too many things. It's not an action game, so don't make navigating a raft of death hard. It's not a platformer, so don't make me do precision jumps. It's not a repeat play game, so don't prevent me from getting to areas because I went left first instead of right first. It's not a stealth game, so stop forcing me to slowly crouch through unlit areas.Lastly, this game would be perfect for VR which it doesn't support. VR is lacking good games and I think, with some of my other issues addressed, this would be a great experience in VR. It's clear the dev's tried, but I think they missed the mark a bit too much for me to recommend this game.			"

												What a game. I usually have no interest in these puzzle games but INFRA is an exeption as I've followed the development for many years. And I also love games using the Source engine so of course I had to give it a go. I don't want to bore you with a long review where I point out every single thing that I liked or disliked so I'll keep it short. I also hope one of the developers read this review as I think that I make some interesting points.So what is INFRA?INFRA is a game based around puzzle solving and exploration. It's based in modern times but you spend the majority of your time in abandoned buildings/areas. You encounter some puzzles along the way that you have to solve. Some are easy, some.. not so much. The goodThe level design is absolutely amazing. To see how much they managed to squeeze out of the good old Source engine is beyond what I could have imagined.There's an interesting story to it which encourages you to progress and explore further.There's a good amount of puzzles to keep you occupied throughout the game.And then there's multiple approaches to pretty much everything.The developers are showing great interest in the people who are playing it and are helping them out here on Steam!The badI'd like to mention first of all that I got stuck twice in my first playthrough due to crashes and bugs. Most of this has already been fixed though. The game is confusing at times. There's not much guidance for what you're doing so you keep asking yourself if this is the right thing. There are notes throughout the game that can help you solve the puzzles but you're not guaranteed to find them due to the multiple approaches. The multiple approaches makes you wonder if you've missed something. Would I have found a key to this door if I had gone the other way? Am I even supposed to go this way? The voice acting is not great. I don't mind the accent, it just gets annoying at times, especially the player's voice. He keeps pointing out the obvious. ""Somebody should fix this"",""I'm pretty sure that's not meant to be like that"", ""A pack of spare batteries for the flashlight"", ""A pack of spare batteries for the camera"", ""I should have brought my other boots"",""Fascinating"", ""Interesting"", and so on. You really don't need to point out the obvious, after all, I did make you pick up those batteries. Why not use the player's voice to help out the player? Something like ""I wonder if I could get up there"" or ""Maybe if I can find a way to smash this"". There's a bit of this towards the end of the game but I really would have liked it earlier on. (And it certainly could have helped me) I don't want it to give it away but maybe if you can tell that the player is struggling, help them out?All in all, a very solid game and I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a bit of puzzle solving and/or exploration! If you want to avoid getting stuck because of bugs, wait a few weeks before buying and then I'm sure they've been fixed.And a shoutout to one of the developers, Oskutin, for helping me out! ( I broke the game :D ) "

												Just finished it, I love this game alot.Sometimes the puzzles were hard to understand what you had to do, but taking a step away and coming back to it, then being able to solve the puzzle was very rewarding.The game, in most areas, looked very good, especially the foliage and the tunnels. The glowy lighting was also pleasnt to look at. Wandering around all the abandoned environments was such a unique experience. I think I will play through this again in the near future, just for the atmosphere.The only negatives I have with this game, are (for me) finding frame drops in places with lots of water, sometimes my player would just get stuck in between machinery sequences, and finally,the biggest negative I have with this game, is the fact that Part 2 is not being released tommorow! :)Excellent game!

I bet being a structural analyst is a lot more fun than this gameI had really high hopes for this game, but it's just a reaaaaally boring walking simulator. It pains me give this a thumbs down, since I can see the great effort that was put into it, but all that effort just didn't make this game enjoyable in any way for me.Let me break this game down for you. You'll spend: 85% of the time walking around with awkward controls and no BGM 5% of the time solving ridiculously easy puzzles 4% of the time trying to take pictures of what the game considers to be worth reporting to your boss 3% of the time trying to make sense of puzzles that just don't make any sense (or maybe they don't work as they should? I'm not sure by now) 2% of the time finding out bits of the main story, which is not one bit captivating, or maybe it takes too long to become interesting 1% of the time doing some very clumsy platformingSeriously, it's been a while since I got that bored by a game. Here are some more cons (I honestly can't think of a pro, except all the effort that you see put into this game): Flashlight and camera have limited energy, fed by the few batteries you find lying around, and they deplete REALLY, REALLY fast, so it ruins the part of exploring to take pics Autosaves seem to trigger only the first time you move by a specific spot. If you backtrack for 5 minutes, slip and fall to your death, you have to walk back for 5 minutes again Graphics are not beautiful, and I'd even say ugly if you considerer how much of your PC it uses (in comparison, Ethan Carter is stunningly beautiful and doesn't stutter at all for me) You can take photos, but you can't see them. You don't have a map, and you can't take a picture of the many maps you can see around (only as a screenshot, but...) I've mentioned controls are awkward, and I meant that with M&K. I love playing with a controller, but that was just way to bad to be playable. No in-game remapping for controller, either, No way of changing camera speed etc etc etc. Terrible, terrible VO (I know some characters, as the main character, are not native English-speakers, and I take that into consideration when I say that).So I've played this longer than I should, because I really wanted to like it. Well, I didn't. I'm glad I won this game and didn't spend my own money on it, but I feel sorry for the guy who did. =/			"

												Basically it's Myst if it were set in the real world with puzzles revolving around decrepit city infrastructure, and using a modern free-movement 3D engine. That's good because it's got some interesting puzzle-solving and exploration, and sometimes bad because it can feel arbitrary. (Why can't I climb up on this thing? Because there's a barrel in the way and the designers decree that I shall not be able to move barrels.) You have to do everything one specific way, which can turn into a game of guessing the designers' intent. More than once I've imagined going back to tell the boss, ""I'm not going back down there without a crowbar, a non-awful flashlight, breathing gear, some of those red fuses, and all the keys you can find."" Still, it's pretty interesting.As for the story, I barely know more than you can gather from the voice-over trailer: massive corruption scandal and terrible infrastructure maintenance leading to a city about to collapse. I've read many in-game documents and still can't tell you much more than that, other than that there is a serious hobo problem and a long-term conspiracy theory. One interesting thing here is that there are no supernatural elements (aside from one hidden achievement) despite how much the outdoor parts resemble Skyrim and the indoor parts, Fallout. Just terrible industrial maintenance threatening people's lives... which is scary in its own way.I played for 12.5 hours and just now finished Part 1 of at least 3, so there's a good amount of content for the price.

												Hokay, let's do this.First thing to note: This is a review for part 1 and 2 of Infra, the third part isn't out yet (Though oh how I wish it was.)I played through the initial (part one) release a few months ago. I was delighted! It's surprisingly engaging, as a game, to seek out and take pictures of corruption, damaged INFRAstructure (hurr) and explore the delightful environment on offer. Of course, the delightful part doesn't apply once you get to the nitty gritty of dingy tunnels and life-threatening situations (Of which there are many, and I feel sorry for Mark at this point. Guy needs a pay raise.)What I like about the game:The story. It's surprisingly engaging as you explore, uncover more and more corruption (and it gets worse than a few smudged reports, sure enough) and generally uncover more and more deathtraps in every single corner of the city. The puzzles range in difficulty from common sense to the downright nasty (I had to use guesswork a lot.)In spite of a serious story and scenario of a city crumbling at the foundations, there's also an underlying sense of humour in the scenery itself. Little eastereggs break up the monotony of dreary tunnel after tunnel somewhat well. And on that point, though the game (No doubt at least partially by necessity) involves a lot of tunnels, it still manages to keep them varied. You know you're in a different section from part to part, for example.The atmosphere is pretty good. Hit the nail on the head in some of the more dramatic points, though there's plenty of more normal trudging about too.What's not so hot about the game?Voice acting - Not brilliant, but I found it relatable once I got used to it. The lack of a HUD means that it is kind of essential to have some ques as to how many of those camera batteries you have left, for example. Some of the puzzles aren't terribly intuative - Frustrating at times, especially given the placement of some of the save points (Though you can mitigate it with the manual save, perhaps, so milage may vary)Lone wanderer - Other than the sparse contact with Mark's boss, your only company is Mark. (Er... yourself? I guess?) There's very little sign of other people in part one once you get past the tutorial level. It's an eerie touch in some places, but in others, it just feels out of place.What I think as a result of all this?Infra Part 1 was a solid game in and of itself, a nice length, and even an ending (in the sense of Halo 2 having an ending, anyway?) Well made (aside from the odd glitchy handling of a ladder) and challenging level designs that also provide a way to relax into the setting. Just as things get monotonous, however, the environments change, and as the game picks up pace, it can get stunningly exciting for a game about taking pictures and peering at things in wellies. There's a touch of a dry sense of humour added to it for flavour, too, of course.Part one and part two differ significantly, however, in the number of missions. That said... The entirety of part one feels like a warm up for Part 2, in comparison. The levels get complicated, maze-like and interconnected, with new and ever more frequent dangers to deal with in the underground network of tunnels, all while uncovering corruption far beyond what you might have suspected in part one.I would happily buy the game in it's current state, all consideration aside, if it ended. However, as it's being split into three parts, it inevitably ends on a cliffhanger (again) - Which, considering the third part will be added for free much as the second one was, isn't really so terrible. Though it makes me hunger to finish the job, as it were.I rambled and waffled on and on, so basically... TL;DR: Love this game, more people should experience it.			"

												so this game is fantastic if you don't want a shooting game. tremendous scenery, challenging puzzles without driving me too crazy like Obduction did (though i did love Obduction). Cons would include all the photography, which seems kind of pointless other than maybe an achievement. Also, the dark scenes required finding a lot of flashlight batteries, and at times that became annoying, trying to see in the dark when necessary to save flashlight batteries.I was able to complete all but the final chapter with no cheating using walkthroughs, and then the final chapter did me in and i had to use a walkthrough for some hints. When I got to the point in the final chapter where I had to open flood gate #4, i simply could not do it. there was a wired set of switches and 4 lights at the bottom that i was never able to solve, even after checking a walkthrough. in fact, the walkthrough displayed that puzzle with no switches, but with 8 lights at the top, wiring in the middle, then the same 4 lights at the bottom. The flood gates #1 through 4 had red lights above them. Yet in the walkthrough gate #3 did not have a red light. So i searched and searched, went as far backward as i could, but never found a way to turn the light off for gate #3. I'm wondering if i missed something or something went wrong with the game. Luckily i was able to finish the game by finding another route to the electrical generators. That was another thing i appreciated about the game.....there was more than one way to progress if you missed something. i hate when it's game over if every single clue and puzzle must be solved to continue forward. this game didn't have that issue and didn't become frustrating.anyway, fantastic game, worth more than the price. i played 55 hours and at times felt it would never end! i can't imagine anyone not liking this game, unless they need violence with their games. Thank you to the creators of this great game!			"

												One of the better games I've played for long time. Truly an exploration game, without any zombies or other monster bull****. I love it. The game has the eerie athmosphere nearby all times, and you're actually afraid the building itself, not any jumpscares or anything like that.Best part? It's made in Finland and the game seems to be located in Finland, even if it has a non-Finnish city name. So if you want to go through old Finnish industrial complexes without having to fear for zombies, this is an excellent game. The story is also really great!I couldn't stop playing, and almost finished the whole game in one sitting. Not many games have done this to me for long time.Absolutely LOVE it!			"

												All the other reviews lay out the general pros and cons well, so I just wanted to reiterate one main point with this review.Atmosphere. This game has it... lots of it. INFRA is on par with some of the greats in terms of atmosphere, like S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Metro, Half-Life, Bioshock, old school Silent Hill, or even the more recent Soma. The world is beautifully designed. The detail is incredible, and every building/area seems to be meticulously designed and unique in it's own way. Visually, the game is quite appealing, and impressive for a game running on Source. The environment strikes a nice balance; it is realistic and believable, yet remains imaginative throughout the story. Really, if you took away the poor voice acting and sometimes poorly written notes, you would be left with a game that doesn't look or feel Indie.My main complaint is that it is far too short and ended quite abruptly, though the price reflects that. I very much look forward to the second part.  "

												Thought, care, and skill has gone into the construction of this beautiful and unique first-person urban exploration and puzzle game. If exploration and unique environments are up your alley, you'll spend countless hours exploring the expansive levels looking for every bit of detail. The game is also exceptionally beautiful, years of craftsmanship and practice have gone into extracting every inch of beauty possible out of the source engine. The game smacks heavily of Portal 2 in terms of quality and scope, however this game is much less linear and provides a heavy emphasis on expansive environments and exploration.The game is a little rough around the edges sometimes, and the puzzle solutions may get a little obscure from time to time, but I required no external assistance and I'm not exactly a brainiac. The game's developers are also actively correcting and repairing bugs as they are reported on the tracker.The game, although technically incomplete, has given me over 8 hours of gameplay so far, and I'm still not finished. The value is well worth what you'll receive.			"

												To be honest, when I bought INFRA, I really didn't know what would be involved.Now, I know, And I can tell you, INFRA is more than a game. It's a real experience to master, an unexpected journey, a precious one.I had no particular expectations when I started to play and very quickly I've been really impressed.From the office, that warm cocoon you have to leave with your only ""friends"", your flashligh and your camera, to the very last dark tunnel you have to escape to.The game brilliantly alternates between the great outdoors and shabby interiors, between quiet moments and those more agitated, between easy puzzles and those which will lead you gently but steadily to madness.There's also the purpose to deeply involved the player, not only to follow a path, but to make it your own way.The more you'll explore the faster you'll understand what, why and how you need to do it.From here, the only usefull advice I can give to you : Keep your eyes fully opened and your brain fully prepared to really appreciate it.Yes, INFRA is a masterpiece. Unique and scarce one.Thanks Loiste Interactive for being more than just a company that wants to make money.			"

												You are an engineer ""armed"" with a camera and flashlight, tasked with documenting the crumbling infrastructure in a city with a dying economy, a task that soon transforms into a struggle to escape and survive. The environments are impressively immersive and require little suspension of disbelief, and while the game is linear there are a gratifying number of alternate paths/solutions to many of the puzzles you need to solve to progress.At first the limited batteries for the flashlight and camera annoyed me, but I soon found that if you explore there are more battery packs than you need, and it's understandable as a mechanic to make players think about what they're looking at (rather than just waving the camera over everything and snapping a photo when the focus marks appear).There are a few rough edges and a couple of awkward sequences (the raft in particular was frustrating) but overall it's a solid game that somehow merges the exploration and puzzling of Myst with a run-down industrial environment reminiscent of parts of Portal 2, Half-Life 2 and Black Mesa.At present only two out of the three episodes are complete but even so it's already about 10-15 hours long for a first attempt.

												EDIT: I had to edit my review seeing how the old one didn't give the game justice.tl:dr: This game is a 10/10, pick it up right now.I first found out about this game when I watched a video about it on youtube. I picked it up and instantly fell in love with it. The atmosphere, the music, the environment, is all perfect. I love the setting of the game too, exploring a ""broken"" city doesn't sound very interesting but Loiste Interactive somehow managed to make it into a game that I would argue is a direct competitor of Half-Life in terms of story quality and the amount of stuff there is in the game. I also like how they made the game feel creepy without ever having something supernatural happen. It always feels like you're being watched.This game is my favourite game of all time and probably will remain as that until Loiste Interactive release another game.			"

												I cannot emphasize just how much I love this game. One of my favorite things to do is go and explore abandoned buildings. The problem with this hobby is that arsonists, drug addicts, partying teens, and vagrants also like to spend time in abandoned buildings. Infra lets me fullfill my hobby without getting stabbed or arrested. Not to mention it tells an intriguing story and has some pretty funny, odd, and occasionally scary easter eggs. (Note, I haven't played part 2 yet)			"

												INFRA is a first person exploration puzzle survival adventure game with some mystery thrown in.  This game is divided into 3 parts.  At the time of this review, Parts 1 and 2 have been released and Part 3 is in development.  You play as a surveyor trying to determine the state of the city in which you're employed.  It soon becomes a fight to survive.  I've played this game several times (trying to get all of the achievements) and so far, I've been electrocuted, crushed, drowned, steamed like a lobster, burned alive, blown up, poisoned, washed away, had a heart attack, hit by a mini train, and have fallen to my death... more than once.  This game keeps you on your toes that's for sure.Pros:- The graphics are very well done- The voice acting is decent- Several puzzles to solve- Lengthy game play- Secret areas- Good replay valueCons:- Some of the puzzles have no explanation of what you need to do- Running out of batteries for the flashlight can “trap” you- Unless there is a surprise in Part 3, the story is only mildly interesting- Some of the ways in which you can die is goofy. For example:     - Your character dies instantly wading in waste deep water     - Your character can't hold his breath... at allOne thing I really wish that the developers would have done is given a clue or two with some of the puzzles in the form of your character talking out loud to himself, especially if you have been wondering around for more than ten minutes.  A few of the puzzles are very hard to figure out, however, it's not mandatory to solve most of the puzzles to proceed with the story.At the time of this review, INFRA (Parts 1 and 2) were selling for $24.99.  Is it worth it?  I think so.  It's a decent game with good puzzles and great graphics.  I'm looking forward to Part 3.			"

												This is incredible! There's such attention to detail, and opportunities to explore that are actually rewarded. The first 90 minutes is a series of exploration sections that I'm going to have to revisit because there were just so many paths I missed. It later gets a bit more directed as the story develops, but the environments continue to have a jaw-dropping level of detail. I don't think I found a single dead end - every side path seems to lead to something interesting, even if it's not what you're looking for.The office building section at the start may seem a bit slow. It does a good job of showing you that there are many paths to explore and lots of little nooks to investigate, but you may need to speed-run it if you're getting impatient. Just remember that it's only about 15 minutes long and then you get to the exploration section that makes INFRA really shine.			"

												Infra is a 'puzzleventure' game with loads of exploration, puzzles and avoiding hazardous environments. The most impressive about the game is definitely the intense atmosphere created by detailed industrial installations and beautiful surroundings.You play as Mark, a cynical structural analyst who's task is to document the state of the infrastructue of Stalburg city. What sounds like a boring every-day mission turns out to be a real trip: In the aftermath of a corruption scandal the whole infrastructure of Stalburg is abandoned and left to rot. You try your best to document damage with your camera, repair generators and electrical installations and generally not to die in the hazardous environments left in the once busy industrial complexes. On your way, you may even uncover the complot behind all of this.There are many optional tasks in Infra, e.g repairing installations, getting the water supply & putrification back in shape and many more, so even a 2nd playthrough may be worth your while.Infra constantly gets updated, and the developers are very busy developing chapter 2 of the story which will be free for everyone current owner.

												An excellent game with fantastic graphics and highly detailed world, a lot of work has gone into this beauty and it shows in the looks and gameplay. It starts out in an office block which I found very boring, the people are totally without facial features, the offices and corridors all look the same and again without any detail in them whatsoever. I had to ask myself what the hell had I just bought, I began looking for the refund button. The first 5-10 minutes are spent wondering around said office block collecting your equipment before setting off to the job.It's when you arrive at the Hydro Dam that the game really begins and a wonderfully crafted setting can be enjoyed to the full. It took me 11 hours to complete but then I do love wondering around these realistic worlds and taking in the views, so it can be done much more quickly if thats what you prefer. As you can probably tell I love good graphics in my games and this one is up there with the best. In places it reminds me of another beautiful looking game,The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter, although this game takes place underground a lot. I hope part two is as good as part one. I can't wait.			"

												This, to me, is exactly what Greenlight is for. This is probably one of the strangest, most unlikely ideas for a game I have ever seen actually work. If you're a fan of anything remotely like Gone Home, Firewatch, Dear Esther, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, etc, etc you'll love this. I think it's a good deal better than all of those, except for Firewatch, which I think is the high-water mark for 'walking sims'. Pros - The world is beautiful. I absolutely love the way everything looks in this game. And the detail is great. It really looks like every, single thing was paid attention to in making this game. Old, neglected rooms feel grimy and worn. Everything is dusty looking and gritty. They actually look like real rooms that haven't been touched in years. And then the newer buildings are bright and clean. Everything shiny. You don't just walk through a world where you feel like the developer just recycled the same things over and over, even when you are in a place where it's essentially the same things over and over; it doesn't feel that way.- The developer's seeming knowledge is impressive. It doesn't feel like a subject he just guessed at. It feels very convincing.- For the most part the puzzles feel logical and real. They're not 'video game puzzles'. A lot of puzzle games, particularly older point-and-click type games suffered from puzzles where you were just trying through trial and error to figure out what the developer wanted you to do and not really applying real-life thought to anything. I haven't had to check a walkthrough yet, even though some of the puzzles can get a little confusing, but I always felt like I could figure them out using the same thought processes I would use in real life.- The sound is amazing in the game. Very immersive.- The game runs fantastically. I haven't had any crashes or glitches or framerate issues or anything. It runs better than a lot of AAA titles while looking just as good as many of them.- The story sounds completely bonkers, but it unfurls in a way that hooks you. I read the description for this and I thought, 'This is not a game. This is walking sims and novelty job sims gone mad,' but decided to chance it based on the other reviews. I'm amazed at how addictive and compelling it is. I would urge anyone who hears, 'You play as a safety inspector,' and thinks that it sounds horrible to give it a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised, I think.- I LOVE the camera. The fact that it's a real camera that you bring out and use the way you would an actual camera is brilliant. I wanted to snap photos of everything. Cons - The voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag. When there are two or more people talking to each other it comes across as robots talking. Dialogue is stilted and awkward, they're speaking over one another, the repsonses seem out-of-place and devoid of any emotion. Even when people are hearing shocking news they'll say something in a totally flat, bored voice, 'Oh, really? Ok. See you later.'The game actually opens with someone saying, 'Oh hi, Mark,' and I'm legitimately unsure if this is a purposely nod to the horrible acting in the film, The Room, or not.- The only way to access the options menu is from the opening menu before you enter the game. It caused a little minor irritation when I was trying to find how I wanted to play the game early on (hints on or off, subtitles on or off, crosshairs, etc) and I had to save and exit the game anytime I wanted to experiment with any of these.- Actually moving through the world can be a little tedious at times. Your character, Mark, is almost the exact same width as every door, so it's very easy to get stuck just trying to walk around and then you have to jig left and right to get through.- There's no inventory. You can pick up an assortment of labeled keys in the game and there were a few times I picked up some keys and then found a sign that would explain where keys could be found and I would wonder if they were the keys I'd already picked up, but there was no way to check their tags again. Same with batteries. Mark tells you how many packs he has when you pick up more, but if you forget there's no way to check.- I wish that when you picked up some items like wheels and spare parts that they went into your unseen inventory like keys and batteries do so that you wouldn't have to walk around with a giant object floating directly before your eyes.- No map. This just doesn't make real-world sense to me. You find maps scattered everywhere. Why does Mark not collect them to consult later? Or let us check photos that we've taken of these maps. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me that he would go into these massive labyrinthine places with no guidance at all of where he is or where he's going.			"

												When I purchased INFRA I was looking for a slower paced game with some puzzle solving and some interesting world exploration.  INFA delivered on all fronts.  My first play through took about 15 hrs (currently at 65 hrs and have played through the game at least 4 times looking for achievements).  I'm looking forward to episode 2 (which will be free for those who purchase episode 1).  I have really enjoyed my time with this game.I would describe INFRA as an environmental puzzle game with a decades old conspiracy story at its heart.  You play a structural engineer working for a private firm which has just been awarded a contract to manage infrastructure maintenance for Stalburg, a fictional European city.  You are sent to survey bridges, a dam, a power plant, etc. and document (i.e. photograph) any need for repairs.  Along the way you uncover documents about an old conspiracy which led to the city's current state disrepair.The game starts off somewhat slow in terms of puzzle solving and ends with nearly one puzzle right after another.  There is plenty to do.  The game is not open world but offers a decent amount of urban exploration of decaying infrastructure along with some beautiful views.  There's also a pervasive undercurrent of dry humor which I really enjoyed.Puzzle difficulty ranges from almost too simple to extremely difficult.  Most deal with manipulating machinery of some kind, although there are some platforming puzzles too.  There are some crisis situations where you just die, die, and die again until you figure things out.  Not my favorite type of puzzle, but fortunately autosave checkpoints are really well done to minimize frustration.  (You can also save anywhere.)  Coded messages are also hidden in the game.  Some in binary, others encrypted.  I'm not really into that sort of thing, but I appreciate it being there for those that are.My biggest gripe with the game is actually just moving around.  I'm forever getting caught up on doorways, ladders, railings, low ceilings.  Maybe that's just a product of the Source engine, maybe it's just me.  There's also a battery requirement for the flashlight and camera.  Batteries run out quite fast in this game.  There are plenty of batteries to be found though, no need to be miserly with either.  Perhaps the batteries were a game mechanic meant to encourage exploration.  Regardless, it can get exapserating with how frequently you need to replace them.INFRA is a bit rough around the edges.  Some parts of the game are beautiful and some parts look unfinished or unpolished.  The voice acting ranges from fine to bad.  The underlying logic of why you need to solve X to accomplish Y is sometimes missing, or mystifying.  The puzzles themselves were not hard to recognize and there are usually notes or hints to guide you to solutions.I recommend this game if you are into puzzle games like Portal, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and The Talos Principle.  INFRA is roughly in the same vein.  INFRA's pros outweigh its cons and absolutely delivers on urban exploration and puzzle solving.			"

												This is not a bad game, it's rather nice, but it is unfinished.I hope I will rewrite this review when the game gets patched a few more times, and hope to change my recommendation to thumbs up. Currently the game is a drag, and that's a shame, because I really want to like this game. It has a unique atmosphere and does (tries to do) something different from most games today. I wouldn't have bothered to write this review if I didn't like this game, but in it's current state I cannot recommend it.My main issue is that it feels very much like an alpha release, and definitely should still be in Early Access. But as that is not the case, I fear some of the weird design features will not be rectified. I will list a few issues I have with the game below.The game world is not logical. It appears to be, but is far from it. Abandoned places still have electric lights on, and every place is generally too well lit; makes me wonder why do I even have a torch with me. People have left notes lying around which are obviously there to help me, but would make no sense in a real world. Usually these notes are right next to the puzzle and basically tell you how to solve it, so it's not really a puzzle but ""follow instructions"" type of a problem. I got stuck at the sawmill for several hours because I didn't notice an attic window, which for some unnatural reason had a plank protruding from it, and I was supposed to go through there. Never in my life I've seen something like that in real life, so I didn't think to look for it. It makes sense in game, kinda, but I've never liked puzzles which do not rely on real world logic but impose their own on the player. There are other kind of logical problems which break the immersion, like finding a dead body but not reporting it to anyone immediately, and halting a train but not communicating to the crew in any way, etc.There are several places in the game world where you can get stuck, like falling between some rocks. Otherwise the character can climb low obstacles, but apparently 50 cm of rock is too much for him. This wouldn't be a problem, as most of these places are off the beaten path, but the game suggests that it rewards exploration. And I like that, it's nice that there are places you can walk around, which are there just for the atmosphere, but as it is, it's way too easy to get stuck or fall into water (instadeath, naturally). This is all made worse by the save game system, which doesn't tell you which save slot you used last (nor name the saves), and doesn't ask if you want to overwrite your last save. Additionally you can also get to areas from which you cannot go back, so saves are somewhat important, yeah.The voice acting is pretty bad, but okay I guess for an indie developers budjet. The English used in the notes found in game is rather awful, with a lot of typos and poor grammar. Almost every note found has some mistakes in it. Another thing related to this is the weird nation the game takes place in, as it seems to be some sort of strange hybrid of Finland, USA, UK and some East European countries. The main character speaks like he's Slavish, but still speaks in (very broken) English, and most of the names are English as well, yet there are some Finnish products and words here and there. Pontikka is moonshine in English, so why would the characters in game use the Finnish word? This would've worked so much better if the whole game was set in Finland, or if the protagonist or another major character was Finnish living in whatever country this is supposed to be set in. Being a Finn myself, I'd love to see a pretty game like this set in Finland.The main character's camera uses AA batteries and runs out of them after a couple of shots, doesn't zoom or record video, and you cannot look at what pictures you have taken. I guess the state of decay extends to the city officials equipment as well. The protagonist should know his camera is a POS, and pack extra batteries, but no, he prefers to rely on luck, finding fresh batteries in buildings abandoned for years or decades. Feels like a producer told the dev team that if there aren't any guns, there still should be reloading and ammo pickups. Please. Hunting for batteries adds nothing to the game and is just plain irritating. The fact that you can't look at the pictures you've taken is also a missed opportunity, as taking a picture of a found schematic and checking it from the camera later when you actually have to solve a puzzle would make much more immersive gameplay than finding the instructions right next to every puzzle.The good? As I stated above, the game is unique in atmosphere. Mix of slow paced exploration and puzzle solving is a great idea, and at times works very well. The game looks good enough, but runs very unevenly, freezing sometimes for no reason for a second or two, and having other graphical glitches like doorways that are nothing but bright white light until you walk through them. The sounds are good and the sparsely used music fits the game well. The environments are somewhat unusual for games, as there are areas which seem to offer nothing but places to walk around. I like that, makes the world feel all the more real. Many of the puzzles are fun enough and most of the locations look like they could actually exist. This is by no definition a bad game, but it could be so much better than it currently is.I haven't finished the game yet, so maybe there are more things I'll like later in the game, I don't know. Had to stop playing because it got so annoying to deal with everything above that I had to write this review. Currently I can only enjoy this game if I play it 15-20 minutes at a time, any longer and I want to rip my eyes out, out of pure frustration. This has the potential to be an amazing game, and I won't give up on it. Score : 5½ / 10.			"

												One of the best games I've gotten in a long time! The voice acting is great (the main character has a pleasant tone and accent), the controls are elegant, and the music really fits the mood and the scenery of the game. It is very creepy and eerie at some parts, which I love, and the main character even has some funny little lines. There is very believable dialogue. I cant stand when the speaking in a game seems forced or seems like the characters just don't interact with each other how normal people would, so having the lines seem so natural is a huge plus for me. The graphics are very pretty and the flashlight flickers in a really realistic way when it needs new batteries.  The drunk bears and dragons are so funny, there's even a chicken dinner!	 You can even flush things down the toilets in the game, and honestly what more could you want. I've already played almost 15 hours and I have only run through the game once! I can't wait for part 3! This game is so exciting! I'm looking forward to finding out the answers to all the mysteries of the game.			"

												This game has the perfect balance for me.  As an older gamer I find the pace is set by the player rather than game (although there are a few time based puzzles), but on the whole you get to explore the environments at your leisure and solve a nuber of varied puzzles, some of which can be challenging (at least for me anyway).  The graphics are good without being great, but that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  It's one of the few games I've put in the hours and keep coming back to play again - for someone without much free time that's a big thumbs up.  Content is varied with both indoor and exterior locations usually of an industrial look, it contains enough material for many hours of enjoyment.  Definately worth the asking price.  The developers recently added another part to the game, which came for free.  Recommended.			"

												I really love this game. Has a fair amount of puzzles, the puzzles are very nicely integrated both in the storyline and the enviroment, making it quite realistic.Very beutiful enviroments, both overground and underground.Basically a indie game that is better than most commercial games out there.The puzzles are well made, a very few of them are time limited and you have plenty of time to solve the puzzles.A lot of humor in the game too... Some written things in the game make me laugh.Also all the hidden secret areas makes the replay value higher.I love the sheer amount of puzzles in this game, and all the thinking. All this tinkering with valves, alarm panels, keys & locks, keycards, fuses, buttons, electrical panels, control rooms, computer panels, flood doors and much more, and everything has a logical solution too.Solving clues, fixing broken equipment, restoring utilies and hunting for codes and access cards to progress is way more fun than boring fighting enemies.If you played the Research and Development mod for HL2 and loved it, you will especially love this game to the maximum.Forget boring Doom 4. Buy this instead. Much more fun.You should really buy this game. You will love it. Because everyone loves first person puzzling from the very beginning.Why this should win the Steam prize: Because this game is so well made. The only thing that lacks, that would make this game on Steam's first page, is the advertising.			"

												If you have an interest in urban exploration or have ever wondered what's behind those locked gates, inside those buildings full of blinkenlight panels and machinery that keep a city running, here is your chance to find out, and push some of the buttons along the way.Visually gorgeous and dripping with atmosphere, INFRA is a solitary exploration / environmental puzzle game. A highly unique and enjoyable experience that really tickled the right spot for me with its attention to detail and atmosphere.Some puzzles seem to be avoidable or optional and the reason for using the camera is not well explained. Several times I questioned my mental map of things to do, thinking about those locked doors or unpushed buttons that I'd promised to return to, then somehow managing to progress to the next section unable to return, wondering if I had maybe cheated the game. Perhaps this is an intentional design choice, I feel that the multiple paths and player choice elements could've been made clearer to avoid anxiety about fully exploring before moving on. Some kind of labelling/inventory system for keys/doors might've helped in that regard.Voice acting is cheesily bad but thankfully sparse, and I did encounter some bugs (graphical glitches, had to reload saves to progress, achievements only earned if online in Steam).Wishing the best success for Loiste Interactive and looking forward to Part 2 and any future projects.

+ Nice graphics, very detailed environments and wonderful lighting. (the world is so detailed, you can't help yourself but want to walk around aimlessly looking at all the details they put into even minor things like an office)+ Amazing ambient sounds that really emerse you in the world+ Many characters have pretty good voice actors, although your character has a pretty heavy accent.+ Very interesting concept, you are a structural analyst who goes out to a dam and surveys the area for damage and start finding out about how the whole place is falling apart and the corruption behind it.+ Light puzzles that are actually pretty fun to solve although can be challenging- While the game may look gorgeous, there's not a whole lot in terms of gameplay. Most of the time you will be simply walking around exploring and discovering new placesOverall I'd say this game is surprisingly good, definitely worth checking out.			"

												Love this game! The only parts that sucked, in my opinion, were the timed puzzles. Although few, they distracted from the adventure and thrust you into an arcade game. Most of the puzzles made sense (also a huge plus). A couple of puzzles defied how they would work in the real world so that made solving them much more difficult....if you think logically, that is. All in all I just loved the game and the work that went into it. Can't wait for Part Three to come out. I felt like I was dying at the end of Two just knowing that it was over and I wouldn't be in the INFRA world each night when I was able to play it.-Love This Game-			"

												This game really scratched an itch for an urban-exploration type game (as opposed to the plethora of wilderness-wanderers), with some still surprisingly beautiful visuals from Source. It features hyper-modern settings, some outdoors sections, a whole host of crumbling water-tunnels, and some of my favourite decaying modern-architecture, reclaimed in part by nature. It has a dusting of problem-solving to keep you going, which is mostly to either compliment or further the exploration.			"

												If you like exploration or puzzle games you have to buy this one.Pros:-Excellent music (In my opinion)-It doesn't have the best graphics but they look awesome.-The athmosphere is great, and it's my favorite part of the game.-The puzzles are ok, they are not very hard, and not very easy.-The story seems to be a good one, and I say seem because the game is not finished yet. It's separated in three (3) chapters. They already made the first one and the second one. But the story is very interesting.-The maps are great, they match the athmosphere perfectly.-The developers are active with the game and help the community all the time in the forums. If someone is stuck they tell  that person clues to find the solution to a puzzle. If someone finds a bug. The developers fix it in the next update and the tell to that person a command to input and skip the section, so the player can continue playing. This should be and example of how to be a good developer team.Cons:-Voice acting, This is between con and pro, because it could be better.-You can't change the graphics options while in game. It's not really a problem, but it's annoying.-I get the feeling that the game is a bit short, like I said before, it's not finished yet I am not sure of the total lenght of the game, but it's around 7- 10 hours of story with the content we have now. Maybe 6 if you speed run it. I love the details of the game and I finished it 4 times just to take a look at the details. There are many cool details that people should see, and they make the story a bit more clear.This is one of the best exploration games I ever played. Sure, maybe I only played around 20 hours, in comparison to my 600 hours of garry's mod, but I want the third part of the game to continue playing and to finish the story, wich seems to be great.

												Pros> Fantastic Level Design one of the best on Source. Puzzles are logic and more or less easy to solvethe developers are very active on the forums and fast to help. Cons>Not much to do but walk around solving puzzles, there's some parts with ""action"" but are far and between, but atlest you do more then you do in Dear Esther. The voice acting...NPC's look strange, fortunately you only see them at the start, then is just devoid of people.  The photografic camera is just useless, you take a picture the character says a line and the picture is lost forever. Unlike Overlast camera that really helped and was really part of the gameplay, the one on this game is just a gimic.Some machine sounds can cause physical disconfort, can't explain why, but they did to me, you can also turn on a alarm and just be unable to disable it afterwords, imagine trying to solve a puzzle as a really loud and anoying alarm is screaming.Do i recomend this game? Yes, there's problems but theres also plenty of potential from this guys, they just need to work a litle more on the gameplay, because on world making/level design they are up there with the best,			"

												The closest thing I've seen to an urban exploration game. It's a charming journey through abandoned buildings with some mild puzzling and platforming with plenty of easter eggs and terrible voice acting.GAMEPLAY: WASD controls with sprint and crouch, plus a flashlight for dark areas. You will walk, sprint, and jump through debris, avoiding various obstacles that a building in disrepair will throw at you. There's some mild physics puzzling here in the form of picking up objects and being able to carry/throw them around. This is used pretty sparsely, only being necessary for a few puzzles, and thus comes off as a bit of an afterthought or because it's a trend. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, but aren't pushovers either - they're a nice mix of nudging the player in the right direction and having them pay attention to the environment. The most unique feature of this game is the photography mechanic. The player, due to the protagonist's background (more later) must take pictures of structural deficiencies in the areas explored. I haven't seen a mechanic like this before, and I quite enjoyed it - it provides an objective without combat, and encourages the player to explore the environment with great attention to detail. The only issue is it seems somewhat arbitrarily selective with what can be photographed. I won't say here what to look out for - part of the fun is figuring it out for yourself - but there were many times where something looked very much broken to me, yet didn't register with the game. Regardless, it's fun, and isn't necessary for completing the game - it almost serves as a bit of role play, and a collection challenge.Another great feature of the game are the collectibles. They encourage exploration off the beaten path, and I had a feeling of accomplishment at having found them. Moreover, they're related to the overall narrative, which gives the player a better understanding of the events in the game. One particular easter egg, relating to a hidden stash of beer, had me grinning from ear to ear. You can tell the developers had a lot of fun thinking up and implementing these secrets, which I appreciate immensely.There are also plenty of optional notes and audio recordings that can be discovered which flesh out the backstory.VISUALS: This is the highlight of the game for me, as it looks beautiful. Though you're primarily wandering abandoned areas, there are lots of objects strewn about, readable signs, etc. Some of the foliage looks a little bit on the 2D side of things and some of the character models a bit robotic, but it's not immersion breaking for the most part and doesn't really stick out. Some of the best parts of this game for me are taking in the spectacle of exiting a building and stepping into a huge open space overgrown with vegetation, having been reclaimed by nature.AUDIO: This game is mostly on the quiet side of things, given that it's about one man traversing abandoned buildings. What audio there is fits well - chirping birds, gusts of wind, maybe a distant car in some areas. But the voice acting - good lord, the voice acting. Some of the secondary characters are acted decently enough, but the protagonist sounds like Tommy Wiseau in a PS1 Resident Evil game. It can be somewhat jarring, as it's laughably bad at times and you may find yourself wondering what on Earth his accent is supposed to be. In addition, he insists on narrating little things, like announcing ""I have [X number] packs of batteries for the flashlight!"" when you pick some up. However, the game has a slightly humourous tone, so it almost works in a Deadly Premonition kind of way. In any case, it doesn't wreck the experience, but it certainly takes away from any seriousness the game wants to have. During the sections where the protagonist interacts with other characters, there's some light banter that can be fun to listen to and helps flesh out the experience.STORY: You play as an engineer for a consulting firm, sent to evaluate the structural integrity of a building complex (hence the photography mechanic mentioned earlier). While exploring the complex, you can discover - completely optionally, from what I recall - the reasons why the facility shut down and about the people who used to run the facility. The story isn't groundbreaking, but I wasn't expecting this level of depth to the narrative, so it was a nice surprise to uncover it (especially in the form of easter eggs). It invites the player to piece together various clues that's up the them to find, so it doesn't hold your hand, and is satisfying to make the various connections.Overall, I'd recommend this game for players looking for a slower, more relaxed experience. The pleasure of this game comes not so much from challenge, nor a heartwrenching story, but from quietly traversing long-forgotten places on your own and uncovering their secrets.

												This level of detail takes some damn dedication.  Looking forward to part 3!Can be completed without guides, however some puzzles are quite frustrating and could use some (maybe optional) creative hints.  I feel like it would be a better game without some of the ""it's gonna blow! / it's coming down!"" stuff, but these are thankfully rare and, given the subject matter, perhaps inevitable.  But for me they made for the parts of the game where I was most likely to quit playing.This is a game that rewards me for what I put into it.  It is possible to just rush through a fair amount of it, but by doing so a lot of content is missed out on.  It is nice, however, as if I am just not really enjoying a level I can often head more directly towards an exit.  But the game is so good at rewarding exploration that this was never a real temptation for me.Well worth the full price in my opinion, and absolutely a steal on sale.			"

												Infra feels like an alternate introduction to Half-Life in which the aliens never show up. This game is unique, having you take control of an investigator looking into structural damage to infrastructure and its long term effects. Gameplay takes the form of slow exploration, photography, and basic puzzle solving. Characterization is minimal, and while there's a backstory about corruption and murder, the game really feels like a day in the life experience, and offers 2-3 hours of sedate gameplay. Part 2 is meant to come soon.			"

												If you've ever wandered through the levels in Half-life 2 and thought to yourself ""Why is no one taking care of this place?""Then INFRA is for you!At it's core, INFRA is really just a game about walking(or sprinting!!!) around and taking pictures of things that are broken, or damaged.However, the core gameplay is spiced up with tense creepy atmosphere, big levels, interesting puzzles and hidden story bits and mysteries. All of this combined kept me hooked for 12 hours, enjoying every second.There are many things to be fixed, atmosphere to experience, and ways to get yourself killed! Thorough exploration will reward the player with additional backstory, and help them uncover bigger mysteries. My biggest criticism of the game, is the lack of 'reward'. You get a camera in your hands, and is told to take pictures of damages and broken things. It honestly seems like there is no point to this, the achievements to be aquired for this are very very long term progresses. I wish there had been, even the tiniest of rewards for finding and photographing the most awkward of things. Perhaps have the protagonist drop a few comments? I can see that something like that would be very time consuming to implement, but would give the player more reason to search for every lose pipe screw. (I did so anyways)I will close out by saying that while i personally recommend the game, i would be careful with whom i recommend it to. If you are NOT into explorative, non-combat puzzle games, this is not for you.On the other hand, i enjoyed every second of this game, and I am great anticipating Part II !			"

												INFRA is a linear, story-driven adventure with an impressively well-realized world and engaging puzzles that are esoteric but not aggravatingly so.Let's start with the world. INFRA is packed full of little details. It definitely rewards you for exploring and being observant. These rewards range from simple easter eggs to shortcuts. Puzzles in INFRA can have multiple solutions. You can get to the other side of a door by cunning navigation or clever circumventing. Because of these multiple routes, there are many offshoots (not complete branches because they connect back to the trunk quickly) that make the game feel organic and immersive. This game is definitely replayable as you will miss things the first time through.Let's talk about the bad a little bit. So while on the whole, I thoroughly enjoy the puzzles in this game, they don't scale well. What I mean by this is that rather than having puzzles that get trickier as you progress through the game, the puzzles get harder to solve because the pieces become hidden. My favorite part of putting together a puzzle isn't the part where I have to dig in the couch cushions because I think I lost a piece. So while this can make simple things take longer it does have the upside of forcing you to explore the world more and none of the pieces were ever hidden in a way that I thought was unfair.On the balance, the experience and mystery of this game significantly outweighs the frustrations of having wasted an hour because you didn't look behind a door or in a box.My playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oRUnwXp-tzlYvT6ea990wS "

												The voice acting was pretty lame and there was a few bugs during the release, but nothing too major. The gameplay was interesting with all of the secerts and multiple routes available. It gives the player a lot to explore. The soundtrack was really good. It fit really well with all of the settings, whether it was in a creepy building or in a dull and run-down plant. I am really looking forward to the free content the developers are going to release for current owners. All-in-all the game is good and I highly reccomend it to anyone that loves puzzle games!			"

												INFRA is ""UrbEx: The Game"", which is a good thing if you're a fan of urbex. My best description of the genre is a first-person puzzle platformer. The game looks great and I was super invested in the story and the fate of Stalberg. The ending was kind of a letdown, but then I found out that this was only Part 1. I need a Part 2!			"

												Took about 14 hours to complete, at first I thought it was broken but the black load screens just seem to take ages and the white load circle doesn't move. Once i got passed that and into the game it looked crisp and well drawn, the voice actors are pretty bad but you don't get much after the first office section. A few phone calls to your boss and the funny ""That's XX packs of batteries for the camera/torch""There are enough batteries to fuel both the camera and the torch but it's often hard to know what to photograph, documents and clearly damaged areas but some things I snapped seemed to make no difference. Similarly some things I did in the game had no real purpose.The game progressed nicely through woodland, into a dam then a logging factory then into a tunnel system. I rode an underground river on a raft that would capsize if it even brushed the rocky sides, that took a few tries to complete, mainly because I am an incompetant mariner :)A few scary moments like the roof collapsing and the fire in a later level but nothing too dramatic unless you are claustrophobic or like me, scared of heights. The tower section of the old steelworks was scarilly high and my bottom was twitching as I stumbled up the rickety iron steps with wind turbines alongside me and the ground a long way down. The view of the city though was astonishing from up there and talking about the steelworks, It was huge! The scope of the buildings is very believable, you really feel like you are inside an old factory.The ending was slightly disappointing because it just stopped and the credits rolled but then it said, continued in Infra 2 so...have to wait to continue but will definately buy it.

												Very good game especially for a small budget indie developer, strongly recommended.The goods+ Electro-mechanical puzzles on well balanced difficulty; not too easy, not too hard.+ More than one way to advance.+ Believable (possible to see in real life) and interesting story.+ Surprising details in the environment.+ Immersively beautiful countrysides (although not much interactive).The not goods- Inadequate number of spare batteries depleting frustratingly fast; use them wisely! In a game where protagonist's main duty is documenting damage in numerous abandoned premises more batteries should've been provided or should they have lasted reasonably longer.- Outdated graphics especially apparent in the first chapter, but then compensated with beautifully designed, colorful sceneries. - The protagonist easily gets killed (by environmental factors) preventing total immersion.Overall, with well balanced puzzles, beautiful sceneries, a different concept and simple (not poor) gameplay this game is a successful as well as enjoyable puzzle exploration indie game.Graphics: 7/10 6 (+1) for the vistas and ambiance) Sound: 7/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Result: 75/100			"

												INFRA is interesting. I went in thinking it'd be like Myst in terms of puzzles, and I was right for the most part. I also spent a lot of the game wondering where my character's accent was from. Overall, I enjoyed the game. It had a very high attention to detail and the world was a believable one. Several puzzles were real thinkers, where it'd take me quite a while of running around trying doors and switches until it came together. My complaints of the game are that about half of the time I was playing, I was wondering, ""What the hell do I do now?"" Backtracking wasn't a huge issue, but in some of the more open levels I'd throw a switch and then run around trying to find out what changed. I also noticed several spelling and grammatical errors in letters and newspapers, which are often difficult to read because it's so small. Overall, I'd give it a thumbs up. It's worth a try.			"

												I'm glad I picked this game up. INFRA is as fun as it sounds, even if some features aren't fully implemented. The general concept is that you play a ""structural analyst"", reviewing municipal works for disrepair and safety violations. You have to manage the battery level of both your camera, which is your way of documenting violations, and your flashlight. Being able to explore sewers, tunnels, office buildings, and factories and finding every little cracked wall or broken catwalk is engaging, and I never felt tired by that. After all, you can go through the game just by walking; the documentation gameplay is entirely optional. This could be good or bad, depending on the player. I appreciated that the game stepped out of my way, and I never had a heads-up display or a minimap pointing me to every OSHA violation. At the same time, some small way to monitor how many of these issues you've found would be nice.The other aspect of the gameplay reminds me of Disaster Report or similiar games. Basically, as luck would have it these structures you explore are in such bad disrepair that they start to fall down around your head. You have to battle the environment as you try to escape before total collapse. Usually, this works well, and it's cool to see these big set pieces slowly falling to pieces. It also makes sense within the context of the story... they really should have sent someone out here a while ago. Speaking of story, there is an overarching narrative to tie everything together, and it's one of the weaker parts of the game. It's been done time and time again, and you already know it: greedy land developer puts profit in front of human lives, there's a web of corruption and coverups, blah blah blah. Thankfully, your access to the story is limited to text pick-ups and audio logs, so the game doesn't force you to buy in if you just want to play.Everything here just works. The environments are varied, detailed, and look really good. Sound design is sparse (thank you), so when the music ramps up during a collapse, you can feel the tension. The voice acting is serviceable, which isn't really a problem when your protagonist is a working engineer. I loved the game; I kept thinking it would end early as indie games sometime do, but at around 6 hours it's the perfect length to show you all it wants to show you and get out. I easily recommend it at both the $7 sale price and the full $15.			"

												Firstly, I just want to say that even though this is tagged as horror, there are no jump scares or any other traditional horror elements in this game. In my opinion, It really doesn't have any more horror in it than the Portal games. All it really has is a slightly eerie atmosphere thanks to the abandoned and derelict areas you find yourself in.I really enjoyed this game! I was a bit uncertain if I would like it when I bought it (partly because of the horror tag), but before I knew it, like 8 hours had passed and I was loving it.I thought the puzzles and level design were pretty well done. A number of times I started getting really irritated because I thought the wooden boxes were way too unstable to complete a jumping puzzle in an area, only to realise that I didn’t need to stack all those boxes at all and there was a much better solution that I had completely missed.While I agree with other reviewers that there were some elements that didn't feel super streamlined (the voice acting and dialogue, the short battery life for your camera and flashlight) none of them were bad enough to affect my enjoyment of the game. The only thing I did find genuinely annoying, is that every time you go into an area with poisonous gas, your character immediately just starts coughing and coughing and coughing even if it only takes you a few seconds to run through. Just hold your breath, man! It's only for 20 seconds! Come on, I believe in you!Anyway, if you like exploring slightly creepy abandoned areas and solving puzzles, give this a go!			"

												A thoroughly enjoyable, beautiful exploration game with plenty of great ideas only lacking in polish and general quality assurance. Some of the puzzles throughout the game are brilliant, but others are really not that good (I'm looking at you, raft section and all the elecrified floor jumpathons). I like the scandinavian aesthetic as I am a Finn myself (really brought me back to my heydays in Kontula with the above ground segments) and I really loved the nature segments as well.Above all, the game really needs some solid hints. I got through most of the game without a hitch, but some solutions are not so obvious and could use for example the player's voice to guide through them. I think there should be a prelude ""routine infrastructure case"" before coming to the office, a small tutorial course where you need to photograph, flashlight and get used to the mazelike urbex gameplay of INFRA. The game could really use one where you learn some not-so-obvious things like stacking crates and such. I really loved the office, but only in hindsight as it's a bit too good at showcasing the gameplay elements...it's just too much too fast and might scare more casual players away.I gotta hand it to you Oskutin & friends, the level design is phenomenal. There are some really amazing vistas and you managed to squeeze everything out of Source. I loved the blast furnace tower. I really really loved the little landscapes near the dam and the little suburban canal section. Top marks on the hacker den too - that place was fun as hell to go through. The waterfalls, the dam, everything is so peaceful, serene yet manage to get the atmospheric 'spooky' factor to the max. The unpolishness is making this a bit of a tough sell. There's a LOT of spelling errors, confusing sentences and overall weirdness going about. In my playthrough, none of the audiologs worked so I didn't get much out of the storyline. I'll play it through again when part 2 is out (lovely cliffhanger by the way). You really need someone to fix those quirks in text and script when you get around finishing the entire experience.There are also quite a few bugs. Physics glitches, sound issues and such were thankfully quite fast patched, but there are some lingering issues that almost all pertain to the engine itself. There's a crane that can detach its load in late chapter 5 that can kill your playthrough unless you reload a checkpoint, if you do things in wrong order with a certain forklift. There's some inconsistencies in level design where that cool area you found might not go anywhere at all. There's the infuriating pixel-perfect-or-you're-dead raft section that makes me want to skewer the one who okay'd that through QA. I hope these gets fixed after part 2 is out, since these really destroy the immersion and experience.And boy, what an experience it is. I'm almost inclined to go romping around abandoned factories and facilities in real life after having so much fun exploring these urban ruins. The camera mechanic is genius, if only you'd give more batteries to play around with. The puzzles are creative and the nice crisis scenes you get from time to time are well thought out and executed. A phenomenal title focused solely on urbex and puzzling, beautifully laid out in an urban yet natural scandinavian wonderland. Few more spit shine polish elements and I'd give this a solid 10/10, but I'll have to go with 8/10, with one point out for repeated 'electrified water' and 'stack the boxes' gags and the second one for unpolishness and the infuriating raft section. Did I mention how I hated that part yet? Seriously, it is beyond terrible.Overall, 8/10, would heavily recommend. Hyvää työtä Suomen pojat! :D			"

												Here's my running monologue while playing this game.......God I hate this, why can't I make these machines all work...This game is so badly designed, the level challenges don't make sense(quit game)...Okay, what if turned this machine on, and this other one off. Maybe its a language issue? Yep (continue to play).........(4 hours pass)Wow, This place is hugeOn the one hand, this game has some terrible character models. weak voice acting,  long loading times, sometimes obscure puzzles, horrible dramatic build, and bugs galore (though the audio one was just fixed)And yet... I love running around giant structures, turning things on, trying to understand how it works, exploring. The devs love complex machines, and their love shows in some moments of truly epic scope and scale. They clearly want this game to be one gigantic machine that you can tinker with along the way, and I'm very much enjoying the vision. Just try to plug your ears as you wade through the ""Office Worker Simulator 2016"" intro sequence. Once all of the people are gone, it really draws you in. TLDR: A flawed game, but if you like exploring, and trying to fix things, then Infra will probably get its hooks into you.			"

												Filled with numerous puzzles from simple to maddening.  Follow Mark (a building inspector) as he goes from inspecting a dam, to uncovering a mystery, to trying to survive in an environment that's literally threatening to crush him and bury him.The game does sufffer from some less that spectacular translation to English, and areas that lack any narrative to explain why you are doing what you are doing.  At one point I was literally just flipping switches and turning valve wheels because I knew that's what the game required, but had no idea what the end goal was until I reached it. (Oh, so that's what I was doing...)Still, I recommend this if you like environmental puzzle games.			"

												I have recently finished part 2 of Infra and can say that it has taken top spot on my favorite games list from the short 27 hours i have played it. The aura of the game distiguishes strong horror-like feelings through surreal atmosphere without blatantly disclosing the story to the player. The game can get repetitive and a bit confusing from the many, many complex puzzles it has to offer in order to move on from  area to area; and is very time consuming; however if you love putting investment into puzzle games and are willing to give up long nights awake, this game will do you the trick. Do strongly recommend.			"

												Fantastic game. The downsides to this game are the short distances needed to fall to you death. A lesser problem is the constant need for batteries for your only two items: Your camera and your flashlight. Use of these are very simple. Pull out the camera to snap pictures of decayed or damaged infrastructure. You're going to be taking a lot of pictures. The flashlight is exactly that; A flashlight. The batteries you find out of the field and you'll find plenty of them. I never ran out of batteries but it's an odd that the devs decided on this gameplay choice. You either ran out which would suck or you never ran into a problem with battery supply.Another nitpick for me was the slow running speed and the amount of long hallways. This game requires you to back track at times. This was perhaps the most annoying part of the game as I usually don't take the time to smell the flowers.The goodside of this game is that it is an amazing exploration game with tonnes of interactive puzzles and a conspiracy theory developing as you play. The best part, in my opinion, is that all of it is completely skippable. You can leave broken things broken, you aren't actually required to take any pictures and the conspiracy is just a side plot for those who are interested. This gives it a huge amount of replayability in my book. I've played through the game twice and though I think I've seen all that I can, fixed all that I could I'm still going to replay it again. At first the voice acting sounded a little off. The voice actors are non-native speaking and all have a thick Finnish accent but half way through the first part the accent grew on me. It is such a shame that this game hasn't gotten as much attention as it should have. The game has a secret puzzles that expands throughout the whole game and, as far as I've checked, it hasn't even been solved yet (As of 23 April 2017). I am eagerly awaiting the release of part 3.

												OMG WHAT A CLIFF HANGERS!!! Part 1 and 2 have a really good story and epic endings which makes you wish the next part came our already. You start out as civil engineer who goes around town checking structures for damage. But you get pulled down into broken ones and eventually you get stuck underground. Good luck!While being there you discover more broken and badly maitained facilities that could ruin the whole city. So... what now?You try to get back to the office to report on this, just to find more broken stuff.This game has solid mechanics, good puzzles and makes you look for hiden objects everywhere in the game.Its nice to see that they try to teach you how a city works. You can for example fix a water treatmant plant and in the process learn how these operate.I could recommend this game just for the story alone, but the whole way the game is setup, I love it. "

												I really like this game and I hope the developers contionue working on next parts. The only thing that could be improved are the graphics, I hope that the developers will use another engine, like unreal 4 for their next games. I like the challenging puzzels in this game. I recommend this game for everyone who likes puzzels with a big story and nice enviroments. Well done!			"

												It's like Project Zero games, but instead of ghosts you fight against bad maintenance.Well worth the money, but has some minor annoyances.EDIT: Developer has been fixing & adjusting stuff really quickly. Keep up the great workTo developer: consider altering the camera mechanics, either: Add a quick tutorial to explain how you should only take pictures when the camera gets auto-focus or... Increase the amount of pictures you can take before battery runs outIt's extremely frustrating when you run out of battery in the first levels, especially since the limit feels so artificial. "

The game had a bumpy release with performance issues and bugs, but the developers have really listened to solve them as quickly as possible! They are truly dedicated, and they have poured their heart and souls into this masterpiece.As for the game, it's beautiful and has a compelling story, as well as some challenging puzzles and funny easter eggs.

												I think ""environmental puzzler"" best describes Infra. As a structural analyst, you venture deep into the infrastructure of a city, gradually making your way through various factories, tunnels and facilities. Traversal problems are the main meat of the game - You need to figure out, repair and operate decrepit machinery to progress, pushing and turning dozens of buttons and valves.Some of the contraptions are rather complex, and combined with the fact that the levels in the game can get quite expansive, patience and perception are required. Be prepared to run around in circles every once in a while, since the game isn't in the habit of holding your hand at all.Other than your wits, nothing much else is required. There's absolutely no shooting or enemies of any kind, but you can easily die to a multitude of enrivonmental hazards. There are some sections that require precision jumping and swift actions, but they are relatively far and between. For the most part, you can take as long as you want to explore.Some of the industrial levels are quite good-looking especially considering that the game is running on Source, but Infra definitely doesn't put its best foot forward and the game begins by bombarding the player with some extremely dubious character models and seriously weak voice acting. Fortunately these are the only attempts at human interaction you'll have to endure during the playthrough, and things quickly get into the groove once you're alone in the rural areas.I was pleasanly suprised by the length of the game and the toughness of the puzzles - Infra took me nearly ten hours, which is a lot considering the low price of the game. You'll have to look past a lot of rough edges though; The game crashed on multiple occasions, and I even had to momentarily swap into windowed mode to get past a particularly nasty level-loading crash. More than that, there are a few map glitches that forced me to revert to a previous checkpoint because I got hopelessly stuck. Oh, and the achievements seem to work very sporadically.Anyhow, despite of its shortcomings, I enjoyed my time with Infra a lot. The environments of the game tell a way better story than the various memos sprinkled around, and there's a promise of Part Two coming in the future. I'll play that one as well for sure.			"

												The first game where you are a Structural Analyst put into the middle of danger from collapsing tunnels, random fires and even water. The goal is to take pictures of everything broken, the game doesn't have a true ending yet but Part 2 should be the final half if not a Part 3.I suggest this game right away if you are patient enough to wait through bug fixes and whatnot till Part 2 comes out, but I also suggest this game for those impatient, but they can buy when the entire game is out with Part 2 as the free update. And the soundtrack is seperate from the game so if someone doesn't want to bother with the game, they can purchase the soundtrack.			"

												Awesome graphics and great storyline. Pretty relatable to what could happen in real life. I like it because it's not really like other puzzle games. Sure it has come of the classic, overused puzzles in the game in order to say, progress through a door, but that's not really the main feature of the games. It's ingeniously interwoven in amungst an even bigger puzzle, which revolves around the under maintained facilities and what led to them being the way they are. It gives you a more indepth look at what happens beyond our day to day lives, and why things like taxes, abeit everyone hates them, are needed. Great lesson in the end. Can't wait for the second episode!			"

												I came in expecting a walking simulator with good graphics. I thought it was all there is, but this game gave me a pleasant surprise. This game was more than just a ""walking simulator"", it offered much more with fun puzzles for everyone to enjoy. It's like Myst taken out of the island into an ordinary office and adding in some exploration element, similar to The Disappearance of Ethan Carter. This game captures you into that same atmosphere and will have you stopping from time to time to admire the sceneries around you, taking ""stop and smell the roses"" a whole new level.It's one of those games that allows you to sit and enjoy it on a Sunday afternoon, after a day of hardwork.

												Loiste Interactive: INFRA is the Steam debut for Loiste Interactive a small gaming development and self-publishing firm located in Finland. The game had humble beginnings as a Source Engine mod project  that eventually grew large enough to become its own fully fledged title.  The game drew a rabid fan base whilst it was in the Steam Greenlight program attracting more than 45,000 votes and peaking at #4 on the Greenlight Charts. It wasn’t until the developers understood just how popular their title was that they ultimately decided to create the company from that – until this point it was a group of friends who were working on their mod together. Soon thereafter thanks to some investment into the company the group were able to commit themselves to their project on a permanent full time basis.Pre-Steam Release Acclaim: To show just how popular INFRA had become the game received a number of nominations and awards during its development cycle beginning in 2011 with selection to the top one hundred “Mod of the Year” list by ModDB, earning Greenlit status the following year on Steam and peaking with a nod from IndieDB as a top one hundred selection to “2014 Indie of the Year Awards.”A grand beginning: The first episode in the INFRA episodic adventure, part two will be free for purchasers of the first part, averages about ten hours in play. You play the role of a structural analyst whose tasked with the job of navigating, and hopefully surviving, a brutal labyrinth. As it says in the Steam Description, it is a gun-free puzzle adventure. Intelligence and strategy are awarded as you work your way through some of the most rewarding interactive puzzles to be seen in gaming in recent times. It’s an ambitious opening act that offers highly rewarding gameplay.Large maps that truly inspire you to explore: Almost from the very beginning you will be surprised at just how large the maps in the game are. Although I found the office section to be more than a little tedious  – it’s main purpose  is to serve as a tutorial – I was surprised at just how large the area was. This continues right throughout the episode. They are all highly detailed featuring a number of different potential routes and offered a feeling of an open world better than some true open world games. Each area is filled with puzzles and unique game play that really does make you feel that you’re not repeating the same things over and over again. The game design has been very well thought out. The maps provide you ample opportunities to explore and to try different ideas with all of this feeling very rewarding. I quite enjoyed the distinct looks and sounds of the various areas. The environments are lush and beautiful. It genuinely feels as though Loiste Interactive thought of everything to create an immersive experience for the players.It’s not perfect: There are a number of flaws in the game. However, I believe that this can be explained by the availability of resources for development and the relative inexperience of the development team. Overall, I believe that these flaws can be overlooked but they are notable. First, I was worried that I couldn’t even start the game. I don’t necessarily put games straight onto my SSD. Consequently, I put INFRA onto my HDD and it stayed there. When I first loaded up the game I got long periods of black screens to the point where I quit the game multiple times believing that the game had crashed on me. I believe on the third or fourth attempt I just said to hell with it and got myself a drink. I soon heard the game begin – so if this happens to you please wait. Secondly, the voice acting is poor. However, thankfully once you get out of the office there isn’t a lot of it and what little of it there is is bearable. That office seen, though, felt as though the voice actors didn’t particularly care for the job that they were doing. Not a good beginning. There are also grammatical errors in the English within the game but not to the point where you are dumbfounded at what is being said.INFRA is one of the best new Indie games on Steam. It offers significant gameplay value at its current cost and is perfect for those of you who enjoy good adventure puzzle games with some horror thrown in for good measure. If you don’t buy it now because you’re waiting for the second part of the game to be released then you should at the very least put it on your wishlist.For similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/ "

												Walking simulator with some puzzles here and there. Very very immersive. Though it's very linear experience it has a feeling of sprawling lining environment. In a vein like Half-Life did. Imagine if Half-Life had no guns/enemies - it'd be pretty close explanation Infra feels and plays.You play as a guy who jеrks every switch/valve/button and makes pics of everything due to his job. Or he's just wanna-be detective. That's the premise of story, and it'd slowly unfold from there with use of a bit of environmental storytelling and your good old collecting notes. There is a lot of lore underneath, multilayered detective story about corruption and conspiracy mixed with mistery and some scary things as an icing on the cake. IF you dig deep enough (and probably there is some metagame too).It's NOT a puzzle game mainly. Don't expect it being packed with intriguing puzzles. All puzzles it has can be divided in two groups - 'figure this machine' and 'common logic'. Both are pretty scarce. Machine puzzles operate on the same simplified real world logic as other puzzles. They are barely 'gamey' and barely enjoyable with some exceptions where it's either 'gamey' or enjoyable. Valves and boxes. Don't buy for puzzles, you've been warned.Infra looks good enough with it's incredible attention to detail. Though it's not that techy, since it's just good old source engine. And performance is top notch being built on ancient engine.Sounds are competent and they really build up environment and add feeling of space (use headphones pls), music is nothing to write home about, but it suits the game well.The only flaw (and it is a major one) is 'action' sections. Be it a rafting through tunnels or just 'escape before stuff blows up'. They not only don't fit the game since it's pretty slow paced explorative expreince, they are badly designed and they give away that it's not A-class title (also they look pretty bad too, in comparison to overall attention to detail in Infra). You often need to simply memorize where to go after numerous attempts. Well, not all such sections are bad (basically first one with flood gates, rafting one and walter's underground with explosions are crimes against humanity), some are great (runoff puzzle) and some are tolerable (sewers cave-in). You'll need a bit of patience for those.All in all for it's low price you get a 40-50 hours of exploration (as of today only 2/3 of the game is available - around 20-30 hours).If exploration is your thing - buy it right now. The game is packed. So big you'll feel like you rob a developer for that price to content ratio.p.s.: If puzzles is your thing... Skip. It's not a puzzle game.			"

												This is a hard game to recommend, even though there were a LOT of good things about it.  I think this is a unique setting for a game and everything in the game looks great.  I loved poking around in these old crumbling and rusting contrete buildings/structures.  There is a compelling framework for a great game...  I just think they fell a little short.For example, the puzzles aren't particularly challenging.  The mechanics are good and it could be fun if they were a bit more difficult and even rewarding.  I found myself wanting to get the equipment working again (which would've been rewarding), but really you had to get it working enough to get through the level, and then everything crubles behind you most of the time.  You actually do a lot of damage for someone who's supposed to be inspecting things.There are also some inconsistencies to the world.  Slight spoiler/valuble tip:  Early in the game, touching most water is an insta-kill (GTA3 like, even).  But then later in the game, you have to jump off a ledge into murky water and, suprise, you can walk around no problem.  I had to watch a youtube video for that.That could be better, or there could be a compelling story that keeps you moving forward.  There's a attempt at a plot, but the scraps are so far and few between that you don't remember any the names or what's going on.  There are newspaper articles that have a lot of background info, and they have general world building, but I couldn't put the pieces together.  Maybe the designer looked at this stuff as a whole, but when it was spread over 10ish hours of gameplay all the intricacies and the interconnected bits were lost.So again, this is sort of a regrettable not recommended.  I wanted to like it, but in the end I was just watching youtube videos almost right away because I wanted to finish it.  I think the designers (or you) should take a look at SOMA.  I wasn't a fan of the horror element, but it also had a beautiful world, lots of walking, and similar mechanics.  But there was a compelling story, the puzzles you solved accomplished something, and there was a lot less backtracking.			"

												BugZy's Review: INFRA - Debris, debris everywhereThe following is my opinion.In INFRA, you enter the world of a structural analyst, just another day at the extremely large and detailed office - and I say large and detailed because that is completely the case. About half of the building is unavailable to explore, but you can see through the many big windows that more than a lot of time and effort has gone into this building alone. The building is only a fraction of the game and it would already make up one of the best maps for an online FPS.Anyway, your job turns from bad to worse when you go to visit and report deteriorating infrastructure. I will avoid spoiling any more of the game so you can experience it for yourself. Just expect to spend a lot of time exploring places that the people at Loiste didn't need to add, but added anyway, which made the game just that little bit more detailed and affected the overall amenity of the game in the long run.The game can be compared to a not-so-scary version of Outlast, in that you are navigating dark areas with a camera. Unfortunately your camera doesn't have a built-in flashlight, so you carry one seperate (which if the developers had thought through, you would be able to smack some stuff with.) The camera and flashlight both have batteries that drain unbelievably fast though, so you must find some new ones lying around in convenient places. Not to worry, there are more than enough lying around!As you can see, I am so far, very impressed with INFRA. It has some very meticulous developers and the environmental graphics are brilliant (the humans could use some more detail though, but the environment makes up for that.) The sound effects in the game make the game a bit eerie and - although it is a completely non-violent game - it does get a bit spooky (especially when you take a picture of something out of the ordinary, that sound caught me off guard a few times.)The game plays nicely once you manage to load it up without crashing, Sometimes it crashes on launch, sometimes mid-game, sometimes when I'm trying to quit. No game is without problems, though.Overall, the game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes exploration, attention to detail and/or taking photos.I rate it 8/10 very detailed koalas.

""Take a camera and a flashlight and get into a survival adventure full of puzzles you will need to solve. Go ahead and survive""IntroductionI love graphic adventures, especially those who makes you think what's going on. There's a scent of danger here and you need to solve what's going on in that old facility. A great game with a great display and visuals. The puzzles are really difficult, maybe not all of them but get away of the danger, and don't forget your job, take those pics for the boss.GameplayIt's quite easy. Go to your office and forget those boring morning debriefs. You have a work to do. Take the camera, flashlights and all things you gonna need in an old facility to solve the mystery. And the puzzles. You are a structural analyst, in the middle of a routine mission but things get complicated. I promise.Don't forget to pick up for batteries! You gonna need for the camera and don't use it a lot. If you enter a place just use it once, take the picture if you need and turn it off, just to save batteries, and the flashlight. You will listen a sound when the appropriate picture is taken, take that into account.Here the puzzles are very logic so think. Use your head, that gonna help you to continue your mission. Use your eyes too, there are keys or objects you gonna need to use. Don't forget to visit every corner of the ""map"". I always do that, you never know what to find.We can forget about the music here, except in the car radio. In real life, we don't have music everywhere. But the ambience sounds are amazing, the birds, the wind, everything. Also, the voice interpretations are just great.Pros+ Very realistic adventure+ Great sound effect+ Intelligent puzzles+ Great visual and display+ Good storyCons- Sometimes you can feel frustrated if you don't pass the puzzle- No gamma corrector. Adding one would be interesting.Final ThoughtsThis is an amazing game with a lot of puzzles, realistic ones you have to solve. I really recommend this game if you like that mix of a good graphic adventure, logic puzzles, and survival. Ah, don't forget the batteries.Rating:8.5/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.			"

												Not knowing really what to expect, the premise immediately hooked me in that I genuinely cared about my job as a structural engineer going out into the countryside and city of Stalburg.  I was welcomed with beautiful hiking, urban exploration, nature, and fascinating infrastructure and overall care taken by the designers, programmers, and artists of this wonderful Finnish gem.All that would have been enough, but included are elements of intrigue, intense enviromental action, and a sense that my presence in the world is having long-lasting effects for its infrastructure!The ending of Part 1 was very abrupt for me, but Part 1 is certainly lengthy and quite varied! I simply can't wait for more of this game and more similar games to come from Loiste Interactive!			"

 Its Good Game I bought this game on 75% sale with coupon. Its really good game!  Gameplay and Story So u are playing as Mark who explore abonbaned buildings. His current job is to explore the old water treatment stations. The game have EXTREMLY good atmosphere. Playing on late night is great for this game , trust me. It have kinda good story and about ~13hrs of gameplay. There are some creepy parts  and interesting secrets. And the most obvious thing in this game is  The Puzzels  . Alot of them are easy and obvious , but some are really hard and takes alot of time to understand them. Especially the part where u have to turn on/off pipes. The game is feeling amazing and its so chilling , while you go through every mystery. All the abonbaned houses, stations , roads and tunnels hide new secrets behind them.  Problems The optimization... It sucks to be honnest. Yes , i got old and kinda useless for todays game PC , but i run all the source games with over 45 to 100 fps. This is game made with source engine. After chapter 4 i cant even complete the game , because its totally unplayable. However from chapter 1 to chapter 4 i had around 50 fps and on chapter 5 i got maximum of 15fps.  Overall Even after that I higly recommend this game. They give u ~13+hrs of gameplay , great story , great graphics , level design and athmosphere. Also they are developing part 2 which is going to be free for everyone who bought the game.9/10 Great game , bad optimization. "

												A very pretty game.  If you're on the fence about this game because of the 'horror' tag, I'm about halfway into the game and have not come across anything too scary.  You start out in your workplace and have to go out to the surveyer site, and the challenges start there.  I won't spoil anything, but it's not as simple as just grabbing your things and going down the elevator.  Once you do get out into the site, you'll have to manage your resources, although if you look, you can find more out there.  You'll be spending most of the game alone, examining the mess that you were sent out to investigate, but things go awry here and there.  There are many puzzles in this game, and there were only a few I felt as if I had nothing to go on.  Again, I'm trying not to give too much away, as I enjoy going into games knowing as little as possible so I can pick them up on my own, but this is a game with clean design as well as visuals.  If you're into first person games with no violence such as Gone Home and Firewatch, then check this one out.  Again, initially the horror tag drove me away. I've also started a let's play of this game:

												INFRA Is a game with a lot of good concepts and a style that looks somewhat similar to the Stanley Parable and Half Life 2, with a lot of simplified almost to clean models and well as a reasonable amount of appropriate clutter items to flesh out a scene.  The central story encourages exploring never nook and the game does not disappoint, at least at first.  If you go into the game assuming a certain level of exploration with fix it logic then you will enjoy much of this game, but will likely find your enjoyment level to drop significantly around the end of chapter 3/beginning of chapter 4 and I'll explain why.  There are two primary problems with the game's current set up.  The first is the scope of what is going on, which balloons in a hurry and in a way that loses credibility due to where its happening, which is a shame.  If handled on a much slower build and if the game had kept its locations remote it would have worked brilliantly.  I will avoid any spoilers in this this explanation but just know that the locations in this game start off remote, possibility believable that they have been abandoned for decades, and then moves on to locations that smack in the middle of cities in a way that they can't have been ignored that long.  The size of the levels also grows significantly, which makes there placement less credible.  If they had remained remote it would have worked much better.  The second and id would argue bigger problem is that the physics engine, or physics interactions suck.  This will not be a problem until the point I mentioned above, where you will start to encounter area after area of instant death traps which require precise object placement.  There is no rotate option, the items bounce around and one mistake and your back to your last save.  These sections, unlike the exploration and fixit puzzles that i enjoyed so much, rapidly drained my enjoyment of the game, as they involved huge set pieces of ""how do i get out of here"".  The lack of inventory interface is irksome, but i can understand the thematic reason for it.  As the character mentioned how many packs of batteries he has one picking a new set up.  A command to have character due a verbal check would have been useful.To the developer, I see a lot of good things in this game and I hope the second part is ever better.  If you don’t; want to add in human models keep the locations remote.  But please rework the controls and get rid of the water hazards.  Your strength is in useful interactive exploration, not physics obstacles.To the rest of you, despite its flaws, I would give it try, just be aware the flaws are there "

												I wish INFRA stayed closer to the ""First Person Inspector"" game it looked like it was going to be (and started off as). In the end, it was like they were trying to make a game like Half Life 2 without guns and did a really poor job of it. Unfortunately, many of the puzzles were not well designed. There was a lot of backtracking and items hidden in unknowable places.The character I was playing was pretty unbelievable to me as well. Why would you continue entering all of these dangerous situations without waiting for backup?I'll keep my eyes open for INFRA 2, but hopefully the developer takes the opportunity to improve on the gameplay. Please also get some voice actors who can have a conversation that sounds natural.			"

Basic InformationTitle: INFRAGenre: Adventure, IndieDeveloper: Loiste Interactive Publisher: Loiste Interactive	Release Date: 15 Jan, 2016Basic OverviewInfra is a very atmospheric, first-person adventure game, with some puzzles and some platforming. The puzzles themselves have a wide range, from the most simplistic, to rather challenging. The game itself looks great, the graphics and shaders really seemed to take effect to the game itself. There seems to have been a lot of work on everything on this game, from the stunning graphics and scenery to the puzzles.Game PlayThis game focuses mostly on puzzles, and have some puzzle-platforming parts of the game as well. It makes a nice change to the game rather than sticking to just puzzles all the time. Some of the puzzles that you may encounter in this game are either simplistic or rather difficult. The challenge of the game increases as you proceed through the game, the puzzles get harder and therefore require you to think more about how to solve them. The game starts at a slow pace in the way of solving puzzles, and the ouzzles seem to be one right after the other. The game itself isn't completely open world, but there is a decent amount of areas to explore if you are the kind of person who likes exploring places that aren't always 100% necessary to do so. A point that I didn't like about the rather difficult puzzles where the situations where you would just die over and over again until you can figure out what to do. This got me rather fustrated and made me stop playing for a small remainder of time. Thankfully this game has autosave checkpoints which slightly lowered my furstration when dying over and over but still pushed me enough to make me stop playing for a little bit. The story line of the game is really good, it's very interesting and made me come back to play more if I ever did break out of fustration at times of the game.GraphicsThe graphics of this game are absolutely stunning. I can't even begin to imagine how much work the developers must've put into this to make it look as good as it does. Although most of the game will be going into dark and gloomy places, there still seems to be a lot of work been put into this game. When you are platforming on the game, it gives you a chance to see more of the contryside that you couldn't normally see.Music & SoundThe game really does well when it comes to the sounds when you are in the different locations of the game, depending if you are outside or inside a dark gloomy area, it really helps set the atmosphere up for the game. The sounds of the birds whistling when you are outdoors really makes it feel like a peaceful place to be in, along with the soundtrack which gives off a really nice ambient type of music (Deluxe edition).ConclusionInfra is a very atmospheric and fun game to play. With it's vast amount of puzzles varied difficulty on some of the parts of the game, along with all of the sounds that you hear outside and in other places that set the atmosphere of thw game all togehter. Would recommend those of you who like puzzle games to definatly buy this!For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here. "

												Infra is a game where you do a lot of exploring. Infra is also a game where you solve many different puzzles across the huge and highly detailed map. I had a fun time playing it so far. Pros:+Huge on exploration+Huge map+Really beautiful graphics+The more you explore the map, the more you learn about the game+Kinda like a survival game with the settingCons:-The only thing I had a problem with was trying to change any settings (you need to go to the starting screen to change the options)There were almost none reallyThat being said, This is a really fun game and I will definitely be playing some more of itSome gameplay of the game:

												The game is visually nice and a lot of work has clearly gone in to it. The levels are big and there is a lot to explore. Yet the game feels unfinished. Most of the time you don't know what you are doing and where you are going, which could be ok if you would get rewarded (which you don't) for wandering around and checking every corner like in other exploration games.The voice acting was horrible, especially on the part of the main character. With the given voice of our hero, the letter a in the flashlight sounds more like an e, which then again might be humorous... The game was doing it's best to be funny, but managed to do this in quite a childish way. Most non-Finnish people won't probably find the ever-present beer references amusing.The game has some climbing and jumping elements, for which the character movement isn't very well suited. Especially the part requiring jumping or other athletics were frustrating as our hero can't really do these things. When this was couple insta-death situations (dropping to water etc.) or running against time situations, it wasn't really enjoyable. Is this poor map design, a challenge or did I miss some important controls when I would always end up in the river when taking what seemed to be a short cut?As for the puzzles and the story, well, I lost interest in them. The puzzles became something I had to do in order to open a door to continue and I couldn't get any joy out of that after a while. Something was missing to keep me interested and motivated, something didn't make the world believable. Still, I managed to complete the game, though I could have just as easily given up after losing interest.While investigating the problems of the infrastructure and corruption behind it seemed like a nice idea, it felt like a bad hobby (because of not getting anything in return, just to advance to next location). There was no benefit in doing it. Also there is some illogical aspect in this, a hole in the bridge or a wall should be reported but blocked fire escapes and other clear structural defect and dangerous things shouldn't be? I really couldn't understand sometimes what I was supposed to document and what not.So, who should buy this game? If you like exploring and solving puzzles, maybe this is your game. The idea had novelty value, but somehow the end result didn't feel like a ready game. So maybe instead of part 2, this part 1 should be finished?			"

												Most of this review was written after playing part 1, but main issues are still present in part 2. As such, I can't really recommend this game. The game seems to have not been playtested with people coming into the game completely blind.- Distractingly amateurish voice acting- Graphics look somewhat outdated, partly because of the Source engine- Still no adjusting options like mouse sensitivity when inside the game. Why?!- Long loading times were a problem, but they're better now. First boot will still take a long time.- Many levels have dead end sections of no importance- Valves turn agonizingly slowly, and there are plenty of them- Some key items are easily missable, or even hidden to an extent- Is it safe for me to walk here? Better toss a coin- Time critical sections are extremely confusing, needing many restarts- A completely pointless rafting sectionIf I'd have to sum up INFRA in one word, it would be confusion. Most of my playtime was spent backtracking, trying to search every corner for something to interact with or take with me, staring at panels and walls for numbers, trying a route and dying, only to figure out that the last save was 5 minutes ago, retrying a solution only to fail because of the controls, figuring out there's a path that has been deadly in other instances, but now all of a sudden it's safe to traverse etc.Games like Portal and Braid can have moments of simply staring at the puzzle, but in those situations you know what the goal is, and thinking about the problem takes you closer to the solution. In INFRA, there were plenty of times where I had no idea what I was supposed to do or where I was supposed to go. Many of the puzzles in INFRA take the form of overly complicated machinery that needs certain switches and buttons in certain positions, or certain pipes need to be either opened or closed via slowly turning valves somewhere, or sometimes you need to find the valve itself somewhere and find where to stick that valve. If there are any locked doors, you bet there are easy to miss keys and keycards somewhere. The same puzzle types get very old very quickly.It's kind of sad to write this kind of review, as INFRA was one of the first games I witnessed in Steam Greenlight, and it seemed like a fresh idea with plenty of potential. Now INFRA seems more like a TC mod for Half-Life 2 rather than a fully fledged game in it's own right, and things haven't improved in part 2.			"

												This game had the chance to be good in my book.  Unfortunately my time was spent looking through a guide with vague directions when the game was even more so with what I was supposed to do.  I'll give you a scenario right now:I after going through a frustrating 'puzzle' of moving boxes to jump across shallow electified water (That may I add any inspector with properly equiped rubber boots would be able to walk through easily) where sometimes I'd fall in a crack between the boxes that is close to impossible to be the size of the actual character, was lead into a control room with many interactble buttons that I messed with, to later find out where there FOR NO REASON BUT TO CAUSE CONFUSION, and after passing by all of those I go into a saw mill with in the darkness some sort of pulley system, I let it loose and make a hole in the floor to go down it look around and find that oddly in the basement are MORE POWER GENERATORS that I have to turn on but when I do it takes a few seconds then kills me in what looks like ankle deep water.  Again, the rubber boots thing saves lives.  Anyways I go back down there flip the lever run up hop over a wall instead of just have it locked like another door I had to get the keys for earlier, go into some cabin that's been abandoned for years in the most unlikely way possible (climb a ladder up the roof and fall down on some sort of wood shutter that's held by some string strong enough to hold our weight to climb into the attic) get some guys keys into a mineshaft that for some reason is related to the power system we're inspecting.That was only a PART of my time with Chapter 2.  3 from what I played involved a switch puzzle that only existed because the lines weren't managed professionally, and something that was literally filp all the switches on, turn it on, then hit reset and you know all this by reading a note placed right next to it all.  It was then I realised that this game is a puzzle game based on cheap tricks that are 'puzzles' only because it takes a minute at most for you to turn something on and it was also based on hiding what you're actually supposed to do, I thought I was only investigating the actual power plant, why am I in a cave now.  I only got more confused by this game as it went on.Alright now time for the graphics, while they're actually good for an indie game and the price I cant say I enjoyed a lot of the enviorment design, in chapter one the graphics were the poorest some models looked phoned in and textures were sometimes large part solid color, that was the worse of it, chapter 2 the starting area sums it up pretty well.  A lot of green outside, green, green, green making it harder to believe.  And the interior is grey dirty and overall just ugly.  I'm just going to say this ugly is ugly even when intentionally made ugly.  From what I saw of chapter 3 the game was only moving more toward that.The soundtrack was never played, its odd I remember it badly but going back and listening to it it sounds fine, maybe even good.  I hope for their ""Episode 2"" they utilize it more because while the tracks are short they're enjoyable and might be good for ambience.I am actually sad I couldn't enjoy the story it seemed like it had something written but we already know what's going to happen from our surroundings in the very start of the game we're told we were handed this place off FOR A CORRUPTION SCANDAL.  I don't know about you but when I already know essentially the end from the start the stories lose something to me, it's the same with movies recently, with their trailers showing the ending bits since those are the best.  I was hoping to hear more of the characters dialog from when the company went bankrupt, but unfortunatly I stopped myself over gameplay not story.  Also on that front voice acting is horrible not for the recording enviorments changing or anything like that but the direction, at some times the voice sounds like a COMPLETELY OTHER PERSON, some lines change from one to the next with voice and THATS why I think it's bad.Since part two is coming out I hope that these complaints are fixed by then, maybe with a update to the previous maps/levels to clarify things like objective, maybe a in game hint system, or maybe just a log/diary of some sort that records more precise thoughts of the protaganist that will give you a strong idea of where to go / what to do, maybe with a pre done or a hand drawn map to give a sense of where you've been / where to go, as that's the main thing that made my time with this game poor.  Also lower gravity or raise jump power a bit and enable always run or something to make our movement go faster as the walking simulator complaints are something I felt while playing.			"

												A locked door and nasally voiced comment simulator. Also suffers from ""rub the panda against the dust"" adventure game puzzle logiv. The puzzles I've played so far aren't that great and the peformance is kind of crappy (Specs down below) and it's crashed twice on me in only 30 minutes. I absolutley HATE the main character (The guy you control) and I can't even see him (Not even mirrors work). I wish he wouldn't even talk as he sounds like a Resident Evil 1 voice actor. The options menu is a bit of a pain to use as well when you aren't on the starting menu which is a strange complaint for a Source game. I can't access certain options when ingame and while some do appear on your phone which is kind of immersive this is a game where you can't even see your feet or reflection. The only thing really going for Infra so far are it's visuals which while not on par with Black Mesa are quite good. But it's more style over substance and as painfully linear as Dear Esther with limited interactivity and poorly explained rub against everything puzzles. It would rather you just look and not touch. You can jump and crouch but swimming? Hell no! Best to do a dumb puzzle instead. It's not the worst thing I've played it's just boring and dissapointing. For the record I checked by adding it to the Nvidia control panel and NO it was not using the integrated graphics on my GPU. Try using NODRAW on the backs or edges of things the player can't see.-Windows 7 (64-Bit) -GTX 980 SC ACX 2.0 -i7 4790k Devils Canyon -16 Gigs Dual Channel -232 Gig SSD dedicated to games			"

												Worst character controller I have EVER seen in my life. Seriously, it would feel so much less like a walking simulator and be so much more enjoyable if the devs took less than a day to make a better one. It confuses my why they don't do this because they aren't exactly lazy. I either have to turn my DPI up to insane levels or it's just too cringy to play...Puzzles are certaintly not the best but certaintly not a dealbreaker, I don't expect this to be the new Talos Principle.The devs spent too much time on the graphics and not enough time on mechanics and practically everything else. As a game developer it's important to balance everything. Here, they made the graphics way too good for a game of this class, decreasing the quality of everything else.The story is annoying because forming monopolies or trusts is illegal in almost every country. If it was placed in the times of people like Rockefeller or Carnegie where monopolies were more powerful than the president it would have been really cool.This game has(or had) a lot of potential to be something truely unique, but at this stage it's just not feasible to give it the overhaul it needs. It's a shame to see such good ideas wasted on poor execution. Unless your absolutely dying for a puzzle game and you have litteraly played them all I really couldn't recommend this to you...			"

												It looks great, that is just about all the good this game has to offer. I could not get past the first level because I couldnt pick up any items, you have to find a certain tool in the first area to unlock a door, I found it (it was glowing a♥♥♥♥♥♥so I know it was the right item) and proceeded to press every key 10,000 times and could never pick it up. Also the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever suffered through, it's like The Room level acting, and the characters are not even in sync, someone would often start talking before the last person had finished the sentence. Overall it is just an irritating experience, trying to capitalize off of good exploration games, like The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter, and Dear Esther.			"

												Right now, this is close to unplayable. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get out of a conference room because the game gave no visual indication whatsoever that you are able to open doors, or that you are supposed to use the card reader. Then, after figuring that out, I spent five minutes trying to find my own office by just trying which doors my key card could open. Then, I pressed ALT+TAB and the game crashed, because apparently it's 2005 and my machine runs Windows ME.After restarting, my boss told me to photograph everything that's broken in a power plant, so I photographed a door hanging in thin air over a river.I refunded it because I really like the idea but don't want to gamble on the devs' dedication to fix their stuff.

												I spent the first 30 minutes wandering around the office, wondering where the hell I was supposed to be going. When I finally found my car keys and flashlight, I spent another 10 minutes looking for a way down before I realized that the elevators, which had previously just been a very, very slow way to go between floors 7 and 8, would now bring me down to floor 1. I went into the parking garage, and had to click on every car multiple times because I had turned around when my character clicked his keys to make his car lights flash. Then I arrived at the first place, and was told to photograph everything without knowing what the button for that was, and I couldn't check without exiting. My flashlights batteries then ran out after being on for only about a minute, and I was stuck wandering around in the dark without a clue of what I was supposed to do. Hit escape, quit to desktop, game crashes and I have to force close it with task manager.Oh, and did I mention that the lighting system is god-awful, and every room is either fullbright or darker than Amensia: Dark Descent?

tl;drThis game is trash.  0/10Ps & Cs+ You access the menu via the players phone, that's cute- Literally everything elseNitty GrittyWow.  Just wow.  I'm almost positive most of the reviews for this game are fake.  I could tell less than 5 minutes into the game that this was going to be horrible.  Stiff animations and terrible voice acting with people who could barely speak the language.  The game is basically a Half-Life mod and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the assets were just purchased online.The game starts in a room where you review a powerpoint.  You're tasked with photographing dams or something, but who cares.  You don't know where your desk is and turning in the game makes you want to puke your brains out.  Uh-oh, the elevator stopped working for some reason.  Who cares, we have your money.Don't be fooled by the trailers on Steam, this game is hot garbage.  I hope you like collecting batteries, because that's the most excitement you'll have.  As a $0.99 game, 5/10.  As a $10+ game, 0/10.			"

The environments and attention to detail is stunning and there is plenty you can so easily miss without even realizing it that its worth a second run.This review is after playing Parts 1 & 2 and I must say I cant wait for part 3.

												INFRA is not my usual type of game - I normally stick to RTS titles. Yet the concept of walking through dilapadated ruins looking for dangerous cracks and things out of place sucked me in, and I'm very glad it did! Having played through Part 1 (Part 2 is due later and will not be DLC but an integral part of the game, which will rise in price when it is released, so buying now may save you!) I would say that my favourite part of INFRA is the incredible atmosphere the game manages to create. An effective mix of impressive visuals and ambient effects bring to life the game's juxtaposition of the natural and artificial landscapes - so you'll emerge from a tunnel to see the decaying entrace behind is encrusted in trees and plants just as a slightly haunting tune plays, giving a pleasantly melancholy feeling. The game puzzles are nice and varied, with clever use of the same elements to prevent everything from feeling too 'samey'. The game plot appears threadbare at first, but as the game progresses you can find out a lot more - nothing is presented explicitly, but if you piece together the scattered documents you find along the game you can put it all together, culminating in the final setpiece which sets the game up nicely for Part 2. The game has pretty good replay value, with a good mix of hidden achievements and collectibles (e.g. when going off the game path to some inaccessible place you'll sometimes find a geocache). After finishing my first playthrough I really want to go through again and find every little detail! Overall, INFRA is a steal for its price - I'd thoroughly recommend it			"

												The game starts off promising with interesting environmental puzzles and world-building, but gradually replaces its claustrophobic loneliness and reflections on the banality of corruption and decay with over-the-top action set pieces and overwrought conspiracies that ultimately detract from some of its best charms.To be honest, the game is downright schizophrenic with its tone and focus. On the one hand, you'll find yourself faced with some intriguing problems, and if you take the time to walk through them you'll find yourself gradually pushing back the inevitable collapse of the city's forgotten infrastructure. But you don't have to. You could just progress onward, building bridges over the rubble of the past never once looking back.This is a pretty great choice for this game, but it's implemented so poorly you wonder why it was an option at all. As mentioned before, the game loves throwing you into skin-of-your-teeth breakneck action sequences, which would be fine every once in a while but becomes the bread and butter of the last half of the game. As a result, puzzles you were in the middle of solving get swept away in a flood or a pile of rubble and you're simply pushed onward into the next segment leaving your latest project frustratingly half-finished. What's worse, there's never any subtle clue that what you're doing is about to gate you off from any previous content -- you simply walk into a room and suddenly everything hits the fan.One could almost forgive it if the game was instanced or modular in such a way that you simply can't retrace your steps due to the code. But several times you have complete and unfettered access to massive stretches of territory you casually walked out of, including an entire chapter. Speaking of which, the last half of this game abandons its close-knit and focused puzzle environments for a sprawling, endless city barred off increasingly by artificial gates and doors that you will never be able to open, giving it an awkward sense of padded uselessness.It's a pretty good game but abandons its own promise to stretch out its length at the end.

												INFRA is not my usual type of game - I normally stick to RTS titles. Yet the concept of walking through dilapadated ruins looking for dangerous cracks and things out of place sucked me in, and I'm very glad it did! Having played through Part 1 (Part 2 is due later and will not be DLC but an integral part of the game, which will rise in price when it is released, so buying now may save you!) I would say that my favourite part of INFRA is the incredible atmosphere the game manages to create. An effective mix of impressive visuals and ambient effects bring to life the game's juxtaposition of the natural and artificial landscapes - so you'll emerge from a tunnel to see the decaying entrace behind is encrusted in trees and plants just as a slightly haunting tune plays, giving a pleasantly melancholy feeling. The game puzzles are nice and varied, with clever use of the same elements to prevent everything from feeling too 'samey'. The game plot appears threadbare at first, but as the game progresses you can find out a lot more - nothing is presented explicitly, but if you piece together the scattered documents you find along the game you can put it all together, culminating in the final setpiece which sets the game up nicely for Part 2. The game has pretty good replay value, with a good mix of hidden achievements and collectibles (e.g. when going off the game path to some inaccessible place you'll sometimes find a geocache). After finishing my first playthrough I really want to go through again and find every little detail! Overall, INFRA is a steal for its price - I'd thoroughly recommend it			"

												The first half of the game was pretty amazing, the second half became tedious, at the point I got into the steel mill. I didn't finish it as it was just too much running around looking for clues and was getting booring. I went on line on Youtube and followed some other players through the rest of the game and saw the ending, which really wasn't a ending I would have been happy with at all. This game could have been a classic if it was shorter and there was a story line that would finish. Finding the evidence and taking photos should have led up to some sort of reward at the end. I could see getting through all the puzzles, returning to the main office and producing the photo evidence for the boss who would then grade me on how well I did... may a photo album I could look through with sections on the dam, the saw mill, etc. If I did well I might receive a raise and promotion in the story, or if I didn't get much evidence I might be told to go back and get more evidence or told I am fired if I did really badly. This game really needs a follow though ending. The graphics are amazing, incdedible creative surroundings with attention to small details along with excellent ambience sounds and music that comes in just at the right times and with out being overdone.  A few human characters along the way would also be a good addition.			"

												The game starts off promising with interesting environmental puzzles and world-building, but gradually replaces its claustrophobic loneliness and reflections on the banality of corruption and decay with over-the-top action set pieces and overwrought conspiracies that ultimately detract from some of its best charms.To be honest, the game is downright schizophrenic with its tone and focus. On the one hand, you'll find yourself faced with some intriguing problems, and if you take the time to walk through them you'll find yourself gradually pushing back the inevitable collapse of the city's forgotten infrastructure. But you don't have to. You could just progress onward, building bridges over the rubble of the past never once looking back.This is a pretty great choice for this game, but it's implemented so poorly you wonder why it was an option at all.

												Highly recommended! Nearly 16 hours playtime after completing part 2, and I am sure I didn't do everything that was on offer. It's a huge, detailed, intriguing world to explore, full of good puzzles and very few ""what.. the.."" spots. The story is unusual and interesting, and fits into the world. It's lightened up by occasional humor, and quite good humor at that.Without spoilers, sharing to minimise frustration, these things eluded me : you can pick up small boxes, press and hold space to climb up (many things), coffee cans have colored tops but not sides, the metro station code requires more backtracking than expected and bricks are heavy. There are 2 more things that slightly lessen how great the experience was. Firstly, the first part -> second part transition was... weird. I continued in part 2 from somewhere I wasn't in part 1, which was jarring. Secondly, and my biggest issue, was accidentally progressing (yeah!). By that, I mean there are a few places which look like two way doors... but they're one way doors, or one way events. A voice cue could say ""that looks like I won't be able to come back"". This is an issue because sometimes you're trying to do a ""side quest"" and you accidentally progress and the poor side quest is lost (I...think... I wasn't clever enough to find my way back in those cases if it was possible)Looking forward to part 3!			"
