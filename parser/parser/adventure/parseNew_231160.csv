YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: The Swapper 

			Views: 1,912		

			A new indie developed platform puzzle game is on the scene... Does The Swapper stand tall with heavy hitters like Braid and Limbo or does is it merely shovelware?		

Taking control of a lone astronaut, you explore Theseus, a derelict space station. The Swapper immediately brings to mind Super Metroid with it's open map design and emphasis on isolation. The human inhabitants of Theseus have mostly perished and it's up to you to put the pieces together. The space station is filed with sentient rocks that leave you with cryptic messages as you pass by them and, together with crew logs, provide much of the narrative; tantalizing you with little details that must be put together like a puzzle. It's a tale the wanders off in the direction of the metaphysical and philosophical, meditating on what constitutes a sense of self, what exactly the soul means to the individual and and how individuals fit into the rest of society. The esoteric narrative and heavy sense of  isolation and dread will have you mulling over the events of The Swapper long after it concludes. The puzzle gimmick employed by The Swapper comes in the form of a gun that allows your character to clone themself. Up to four clones can be made and these clones mimic your every move. In addition the gun can beam your consciousness into these clones and  allow you to take direct control of them. Additional puzzle elements like blue lights that prohibit the creation of clones where their light is cast, red lights that prevent you from taking control of clones and gravity switches that will have you walking on the ceiling all further complicate the proceedings. Your clones must be used to trip switches and reach far away ledges, they are empty vessels that are to used and disposed of and the sight of their lifeless husks collapsing after long falls becomes a frequent occurrence throughout the course of The Swapper. The goal is to our the character that you directly control in contact with orbs that allow you to open doors and progress. These simple gameplay mechanics tie in closely to The Swapper's narrative themes meaning the narrative events never drift too far off into the back of your mind. Few games are able to do this so well. Puzzle start off very easy as you learn to navigate your environment and are introduced to clever new ways to solve problems within the game world. Much like Portal, The Swapper religiously sticks to it's core mechanics. You don't get any new abilities or skills as the game progresses, instead new obstacles bring new challenges that occasionally elicit head scratching and pensive stares. The first three quarters of the game's three to five hours are really a breeze but the final few puzzles can really put your puzzle solving skills to the test. While the challenge is certainly welcome, this spike in challenge has a habit of disrupting the pacing. Your brisk jaunts between memory stations for more information slow to a crawl near the final area potentially becoming agonizing as the game's mind benders thwart your best attempts to crack them.The Swapper wouldn't be nearly as engaging if it weren't for it's distinct visual style. Everything in the game was originally molded out of clay by the team at Facepalm studios and in addition to complimenting the narrative themes it looks wonderfully alien and unique among it's contemporaries. Fantastic lighting effects also dress up the stylized art and drive the lonely desperate mood home. Seeing the dark, desolate corridors of Theseus illuminated by a beam from your flashlight as the ambient soundtrack hums in the background can be profoundly melancholy. The measured tempo of the soundtrack never leaves you with a sense of urgency and instead slowly and beautifully builds a hopeless and lonely tone befitting a game that is largely devoid of other characters.

												This is a puzzle game unlike any other. The clay animations are really well done and the whole concept of creating clones to solve puzzles, is a really neat idea. Add in the ability to swap between these clones and things become very interesting.You'll get about 5-7 hours out of this game depending on how good you are with the puzzles. They are varied and challenging in the later stages as you become more comfortable with the gameplay.The atmosphere is really moody, with a full spectrum of white light to pitch darkness. They really do a good job to make you feel like you're in space and completely isolated.The Swapper is a genre defining leap for puzzle platformers. The developers have shown originality and passion, which are the first two things I look for in any game.			"

												The Swapper is a platformer puzzle game with excellent atmosphere using unique visuals, clever puzzles and having only a few minor problems.The graphics have a distinctive look due to the developer's choice of claymation style and the careful use of lighting.  The game feels at times lonely, but not hostile; the player doesn't have to combat roaming creatures like in a Metroidvania game.  Mostly the game consists of exploring the Thesus V space station which is layed out in a clear and thoughful manner.Puzzles are the meat of the game which are solved by cloning yourself and swapping places with the clones.  All clones move in unison with you which forces careful placement and planning to solve each puzzle room.  The last batch of puzzles in the game are deviously clever and had me stumped for hours.  But if I can finish the game without help so can you.There were a few things in the game I didn't care for such as  the sentient beings comment boxes overlaying the entire screen and obscuring the view; only momentary, but annoying.  Also, despite finding several hidden console rooms I unlocked no achievements, and this seems to be a problem for a few other players.I can safely recommend The Swapper to anyone that likes to solve puzzles or wants to explore a non-combative environment at a relaxing pace.

												The Swapper is a puzzle platform game that was originally released on PC in 2013, and has since been ported to PS3, PS4, Vita, Wii U and the Xbox One. You play the role of a female explorer who finds themselves on an abandoned research station, early into the game you discover the ability to create clones of yourself. This ability is what the game focuses on from then onward. The gameplay in Swapper is absolutely stellar, we see all too many puzzle platformers release on Steam on an almost daily basis that don't really do anything new and innovating, The Swapper blows this theroy out of the water though. The goal in this game is to find orbs scattered around the space station in order to open doors and activate teleporters to progress further. There is some aspect of metroidvania style games in that you do have to backtrack quite a bit too. The cloning ability is what really makes this game standout, you can spawn four clones at any one time, and you also gain the ability to swap control over each of them too. The clones follow every action that the character makes, so running, jumping, interacting with objects (even if there is nothing there to interact with). This ability allows you to complete plentiful puzzles, opening doors, flipping switches and collecting orbs. The main element which will end up killing the player, as well as the clones, would be gravity. You will soon find that you can barely fall from any sort of distance as it will kill you. You can save yourself by creating a clone just before you hit the floor and teleporting to it though which is a trick you really need to get a hang of very early on.  You can also do this to scale walls and tunnels too.To add a little bit more challenge into the mix, the game also introduces different light sources which prevent you from doing specific actions such as preventing clones from being spawned in the lighted area, blocking the swap ability, or just plainly stopping you doing anything all together. The game presents you with a bare structure of a story line, and you are pretty much left to work it out on your own. There are plenty of snippets of story and plot to be found in the game through terminal computers if you want to delve deeper into it. The Swapper is a gorgeous looking game, playing anything on a 4k resolution should look good, but this game just looks almost photo realistic.  The lighting is perfectly done, adding so much atmosphere into each room you enter. The animation of the main character is also done very well too. As with all puzzle games, I wasn't able to figure out most of the puzzles and had to revert to a walkthrough; after reading the walkthrough there are still points in the game which are skill based, so no matter whether you know how to complete something, you still need to execute a certain level of skill to complete it. I was able to complete The Swapper in just under seven hours, if you were to do it without a guide, you are looking at about a ten hour playthrough. The game does have ten achievements, which are not related to the main story line at all. They are merely hidden computer terminals that you can try to find throughout the game. This may add a little bit of replay value, however if you aren't into achievement hunting, there isn't any reason to play this game through again for a second time. The Swapper had no technical issues at all. The game ran perfectly well on all higher resolutions, at a constant 60FPS. The options menu is rather limited, but this game is in effect a 2D side scroller so you can't really expect too much from the technical side of things. In conclusion, I have to say The Swapper is one of the best puzzle games on Steam to date; and should be played by everyone to experience this masterpiece. This is a showcase of how indie games should be produced and how quickly they can rise to being an extremely popular hit.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Swapper Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi  My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-5 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados REVIEWThe Swapper is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. The entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.The gameplay and the puzzles are far from bad, but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. The graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of The Swapper to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  The Swapper is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												The Swapper (Puzzle-Adventure)You might have noticed that I did not add 'Platformer' to the genre of the game, despite having this listed as one.  I just can't think of this game as a platfomer. There are no death traps, no enemies to avoid, no coins or baubles to collect... it's simply an adventure game that happens to have some platforms in it.Let me get some of the technical stuff out of the way before I continue.The game is configured to work with both PS and X-360 controllers, if you wish to use one.  You can adjust the sensitivity of both the controller and the mouse, if you're using the keyboard, through the Options menu.  There you can also adjust the screen resolution -- from 640x480 up to 1920x1080 -- the volume, Windowed or Full-screen, etc.  I highly recommend making sure the subtitles are ON whilst you're there -- There is an aspect of the story that I totally would have missed if I'd not had the subtitles on.  If you want to adjust the keyboard settings, it's on the bottom right of the Options screen.So how does the gameplay work?  Well, I can't elaborate on that too much without giving things away, but I will give you what I can without adding spoilers. I do want to mention that there are hidden areas with extra story (via terminals,) which I knew nothing about until I finished the game.  Also, please note that you will get to the point that you realize you are going to have to have Godlike reflexes and tracking abilities to be able to progress in the game... Until you realize that there is a way to slow everything down to a crawl, which will allow you the time you need to get things done.  Incredibly helpful, not to mention necessary, since I don't think *anyone* can react that quickly! Back to the topic at hand, which is the gameplay.  You hold a ""swapping"" device in your hands that has two abilities: First is the duplicate function.  What this does is create exact replicas of you, and your replica(s) will mimic every move you make.  You can have up to four duplicates at any given time.  If they ""die"" you can create another to take its place, and when your duplicates touch you, they disappear, allowing you to make another.  Second is the ""swapping"" beam.  Zap any of your replicas with this beam to have your consciousness transferred to that body.  The swapping beam has one more function, and I mention it only because I got completely stuck, having NO idea you could do this:  If you are in freefall, you can use the beam to ""push"" yourself through space.The game progresses through a series of puzzles based upon these abilities.  There are obstacles in that the swapping device reacts differently around colored lights.  For instance, you can create a duplicate within red light, but your swapping beam is completely blocked by the red.  The opposite holds true within blue light, and so on.There is one puzzle that requires your bodies to be in exactly the right places (only one that is fiddly that way), one puzzle requires really good timing, and just one had me completely stumped to the point I had to come back to it the next day.  Solving the rest of the puzzles ranged from deceptively easy to, ""YES!!  that felt SO good!!""You might think by reading the above that this is just a puzzle game, but no -- this is a true adventure at heart, and so deeply environmental that it really feels as if you're problem-solving like you would any day in real life.  The devs have achieved this immersion through various ways, which I will describe below. The music sets the tone so beautifully, so perfectly, that you don't really notice it at first.  Never distracting, I was more than once surprised to realize that not only was it was there, that it was lovely to listen to, as well.  ""Lovely?"" you ask, ""In an atmospheric psychological horror?""  To that I say, ""Absolutely!""  Just go with it, you'll see what I mean when you play.  The voices are done incredibly well, never feeling stilted or out-of-place.And that brings me to the story, that which binds the whole game together in this richly-woven tapestry.  The story progresses in multiple ways.  You will occasionally hear voices ( :O ... No, not that kind of ""hearing voices""!) as you progress through the game, and, as mentioned, they are very well done.  Next up are the terminals, which give you snippets of conversations and orders from the command of this place you're in.  Lastly you have the thoughts of... something(s), which I will not give away.When I first saw the graphics, I thought they looked blurry... fuzzy, even.  It's amazing how differently you perceive things when you're actually playing the game yourself, and not just looking at screenshots or a video.  Suffice to say that the graphics contribute to the overall feeling of the game.  Somehow, The Swapper reminds me of John Carpenter's The Thing.  No, there's no parasitic life form trying to assimilate and/or mutilate you, but those feelings...  Cold.  Alone.  Uneasy.  It is all of these and more.This is truly a must-play game for anyone who enjoys a deeply environmental game with a powerful tale to tell... a tale whose full implications I have yet to digest.  Better yet, this is a game that can be enjoyed even more upon subsequent play-throughs... And that is something I will be even more happy to do now that I know I missed some of the content my first time through.Highly recommended!			"

												The Swapper is an ingenious little puzzle game with a unique gameplay mechanic and eerie plotline that blend together very well.The puzzles all center around a cloning mechanic, where the device the player wields is able project up to 4 clones and also transfer consciousness of the player between them. Certain light wavelengths interfere with the device to add to puzzle complexity (for example, red light blocks transferring the mind of the player to a clone). The puzzles range from obvious to abstract, with the simplest puzzles at the start of the game. However, later puzzles vary massively in how difficult they are (depending on the player). Some puzzles may seem obvious to one individual, but will require a lot of trial & error for other players. There was one puzzle in particular that had me stumped for a long time, but upon completing it I realised it was actually quite simple and that many players would probably breeze past it quickly.TS starts with the player finding themself on a seemingly abandoned space station and very slowly introduces a plot which the player can entirely ignore if they see fit. The narrative is interwoven in the game through a few small scenes voiced by a mysterious other astronaut, some terminals with logs to read, and through messages conveyed to the player by rock samples scattered around the station. Quite like Dark Souls, it is up to the player to investigate the story and piece it together, and you are rewarding with a rather intriguing one if you bother.The creepy atmosphere of this game is realised through some quite clever visual and audio tricks. The graphics alone are not very impressive, but the way lighting is used cleverly hides the imperfections and creates a very unique art-style which I adored. The soundtrack comes and goes but always leaves you feeling isolated and alone. Whenever the silence was punctured by speech of the other astronaut, I found I immediately stopped whatever I was doing to lap up all of the audio I could just to find a little solace in the company of someone other than the empty clones. It is the interplay between the art-style, the audio, and the clone mechanic that makes the atmosphere of this game so incredible.If all this wasn't enough, I thought the one single choice you have to make in the entire game was probably one of the most poignant moments in any game I have played. It was incredibly difficult to make and left me with a real lasting impression and that feeling in the pit of my stomach that made me wonder whether the decision was the right one or not.Be warned: this game is meant to be played through in big chunks, shown by an ending that has so much impact if you have been following the plot and really immersing yourself. If you play this game in small portions then the atmosphere, plot and impact will probably not hit as hard.Strap-up, blast off, and lose your sanity amongst the talking rubble and deathly-silent human clones.

												Whether you like puzzle games or not, you should give the swapper a try. It's wonderful. The game design gives you a weightless feeling thanks to its atmosphere. You really feel lonely in space if it was not for your clones. The graphics are great and the music is fantastic. Some puzzles are a bit hard but not impossible. And once you find the trick it's a genuine reward.Jump on board!			"

======================================The Swapper Read on for the full review!======================================TL;DR:The swapper is a phenomenal puzzler with an astounding ambience, atmosphere, sense of mystery, good voice acting, and tantalizing writing that everyone should own.======================================Pros+Gameplay: Precise, simple, engaging, and effective.+Graphics: Beautiful and eerie. Good use of color/lighting.+Audio: Qualitative, effective, also eerie.+Music: Fantastic. Can be present or good background music.+Atmosphere: You will feel the isolation and mystery.+Animation: Very smooth.+Presentation: The menus and font are both beautiful and minimal.Cons-NoneNeutral+/-Placement of clones can occasionally be finicky.======================================IntroductionThe Swapper is a puzzler game where you play a swapper, a swapper is a person who swaps places with clones, a clone is a person who is a copy of another person. Beyond that, not much is known about who you are in the beginning, or what those giant stone rocks called Watchers are, or even much about what the planet or facility you are at is for besides transporting said Watchers offworld for scientific research.GameplayThe gameplay in the swapper is downright clever, but features a few very simple mechanics that allow for a lot of depth considering, especially if you keep in mind how many controls there aren't. Most of your stay in The Swapper will be spent left and right clicking to make clones and take their place, and to undo a clone you only hae to touch it, pass a checkpoint, or kill it with gravity. The puzzles will often be sequence puzzles that revolve around beams of light that remove your ability to clone or swap with said clones in that area, although timing, boxes, and movement can definitely be involved. What gameplay there is that doesn't revolve around puzzles, primarily revolves around exploration or loregathering in a metroid fashion instead.GraphicsIn The Swapper, every aspect of visual interest is masterfully handled, from the lighting, shading, detail, colors, atmosphere, and ambience. There's a major industrial vibe, with a lot of purples, blues, and yellows thrown in. Occasionally there will be a lush green area, and the scarcity makes it all the more beautiful.I also have to give a shoutout to the menu systems, they're absolutely stunning and as minimal as can be, and I adore minimal styled anything. Really, though, in the end, The Swapper is a game where the graphics shine most when shined right into your eyes while playing, and you should definitely make sure this happens.AudioThe audio in The Swapper is downright effective, and will be unsettling, mysterious, calming, and frantic at the exact moment a need arises. While the audio can be sparse at times, that's a good thing, because it remains all the more impactful due to the feeling of isolation, mystery, and silence it can help to provide.ConclusionIn the end, The Swapper deserves 5 stars in every category, it runs well, plays great, and looks amazing. There is atmosphere and mystery in buckets, and it will never make your brain hurt too much, but will still give it a stretch. It's one of the more innovative puzzlers I've had the pleasure of playing, as well as one of the better indie games I've ever played. Due to the level of polish, I can easily recommend this to EVERYONE. Have fun!====================================== "

												The Swapper is the debut title of a pair of University of Helsinki students that tells the story of strange happenings aboard Theseus, a space station and research facility located in a remote part of the galaxy. The Finnish duo hired Tom Jubert to write the script who also wrote other noteworthy indie games such as Penumbra and Faster Than Light.The Swapper is a side-scrolling puzzle game with some occasional platforming elements and zero gravity segments. The players get their hands on the titular device almost immediately. The device has two functions, it can create up to four clones of the main character and it can then swap souls between each body. No matter which body the player controls, the clones will all mimic his actions. The puzzles mostly revolve around placing yourself and the clones in certain places to be able to reach the orbs that are necessary for powering the ship’s systems. The player’s progress is impeded by three types of light. Blue light prevents cloning, red light prevents swapping whereas the purple light prevents both. Later on the game also introduces gravity-based puzzles which offer a nice change of pace.The puzzle design is absolutely superb, logical and perfectly balanced. Some of the puzzles may stump you a bit, but everything is manageable with a bit of logical thinking and simply trying out a few different ideas. The design is semi open ended. The ship is closed off at certain points which require the orbs to progress further, but for the most part, it’s up to you which room/puzzle you want to tackle first. If a certain puzzle is giving you problems, you can leave and try later, but finishing the game will require solving all puzzles and getting all the orbs.The other major part of the game whose significance cannot be overstated are the production values. The entirety of the game’s assets were created from clay and other household materials which were then digitized into the game. The lighting and color palettes are mesmerizing. The art-style and sound design masterfully create an incredibly macabre atmosphere and a fantastic sense of desolation. This is further heightened by the narrative which is crafted in such a way that provides more questions than answers. It is a sort of philosophical theme of thought and soul versus matter and energy. Sometimes it veers to pretentiousness, but overall the writing is very good and will hold the player’s interest.Simply put, The Swapper is an astonishing achievement in both game design and visual arts rarely seen in the video game medium and it is easily the top representative of its respective genre.9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)			"

												Even though The Swapper is only a four-hour puzzle game, it's still an atmospheric experience that both sci-fi fans and puzzle lovers will absolutely adore.The Good:+ Gorgeous clay-molded visuals with stunning lightingeffects.+ A unique science fiction story.+ Incredibly atmospheric, especially for a 2D puzzle game.+ Phenomenal soundtrack.+ Though puzzles bases on a clever clone-swapping concept that works perfectly...The Bad:- ... but once you've completed the game there's not really any replayability.- Very short. Four hours should be enough to play through it.The Ugly:- The visuals may take some getting used to, but in the end they perfectly fit the game's chilling atmosphere.Final verdict:For a pricetag of 13.99€, you get unfortunately little content. Wait for it to go on sale (around 6.99€ looks like the perfect price), then definately pick this up if you love atmospheric games or puzzlers. 8/10			"

												""The Swapper"" is a unique puzzle platformer with beautiful visuals, a noteworthy, strange atmosphere and a very philosophical story about clones, existence and personal identity.To solve the puzzles in this game, you have a gun that can create clones of yourself and swap your mind into them, while controlling all at once. With the different lights to block one or both of these abilities and gravity switching fields some of the later puzzles can be quite tricky, but the whole game isn't too hard.Even though the game feels very valuable, the playtime (at least mine) was definitely too short for that high price. But if you can get it at a reduced price or in a game bundle, I highly recommend playing this game.			"

												The Swapper follows the trail of the most successful indie games of recent times (Braid, Limbo etc). The Swapper can be described as a metaphysical journey into the realms of mind, set in a dark sci-fi environment. We are undertaking a trip to understand the importance of the ""self"". This is achieved by challeging the player through puzzles that involves the use of the ""Swapper"", a device which beholds the power to create clones of itself. While the puzzles get more and more complex and thus bringing out the infinite possibilities that the ""Swapper"" gives, the game brings us various queries. How can the self be multiplied? Who is the real ""self""? Those are some of the questions only the player can answer.I recommend The Swapper to people who love Braid and similar titles and to every people who are searching for a videogame that can be challeging in a different way.7,5/10			"

												The Swapper is a wonderfully compelling title in which you have special abilities that allow you to solve puzzles.Like Portal, the central premise asks the question ""How do I exist in two different places at the same time?"" or ""How do I reach the unreachable place?""  Where these games differ is that The Swapper takes the answer to this question quite literally.  You're given a gun that fires copies of your controlled character.  You can have up to four of these copies, and the clones move in tandem with you.  If you move one step forward, they move one step forward, and so forth.  You can also project your primary control into any one of them, provided you have a clear unobstructed shot at it.  Most of the puzzles revolve around this mechanic, as there's usually a task one clone has to perform to get it into a place where you can control it.  Only your primary character can collect the orbs that complete the puzzle.  What makes these puzzles tricky is that there are different areas that obstruct your various powers, making you think critically to evaluate what your clones will do.  For example, red lights will not allow you to project yourself into a clone, so you must either disable the red light with a switch or work around it.  Red light areas still allow you to project new clones, however.  Blue lights don't allow new clones, but you can project into existing clones.  Purple lights don't allow your powers to work at all.  Some puzzles use boxes, but most employ the switches that your clones must activate to manipulate the light areas.  Later in the game, you encounter gravity pods that create similar scenarios, only with upside down and rightside up clones doing the work.  A primary character can only create a clone that is standing as they are, so there's another layer of gameplay.As you move through the game, there is a dark, foreboding atmosphere.  You're thrust into a sci-fi world of moral and philosophical conflict, and the story is told through a reluctant female voice as well as ship logs.  The game's visuals are beautifully realized with darkness and light interplaying in interesting ways.  Sound design is also uniformly excellent and realy creates this feeling of isolation and dread, yet you still feel this alien presence.  I will not spoil the story for you, but I will say that there are some surprising revelations that are not immediately apparent from the outset.  The environments are vast so there's plenty to explore.  I was reminded of Super Metroid at many times, except there is no combat in The Swapper.I think the game's controls and gameplay work wonderfully together to challenge the player without frustration.  So many indie titles only have their gimmick to fall back on, but The Swapper combines gameplay, visuals, and narrative seamlessly.  Even if you fail to understand how to solve a puzzle, there are plenty of puzzles you can solve while you're thinking about the correct solution.  I normally get pretty impatient with puzzle games, but every puzzle in The Swapper is fair, logical, and rewarding.In summary, this is a fantastic game that you should purchase if you have not purchased it already.  It has enough content to warrant whatever price you pay for it, and should satisfy even the most jaded indie fans.			"

Overview:The Swapper is an award-winning title with narrative-driven gameplay. Developed and published by indie Facepalm Games, and partly funded by Indie Fund, the game is a sci-fi puzzle-platformer with exploration elements; it has traits of metroidvania and the gameplay is reminiscent of Braid. Among the awards won are: Indie Game Challenge, IndieCade Special Recognition, and Indie Showcase Develop Conference. The Swapper is available for PC on Steam, PlayStation 3 & 4, and PlayStation Vita.Story:Set on a space-station orbiting a planet far-off in outer space, isolated from civilization, devoid of people and with much environmental storytelling, the space-station is filled with atmospheric dread. It begins with an unnamed character entering the space-station and finding a device that allows her to clone herself and to swap consciousness between those clones. She encounters someone who constantly contradicts herself and who functions as a guide.As one progresses through the game it is revealed that humans have exhausted their resources, and have established seven outposts orbiting planets in distant outer space to extract and synthesize materials to send back to earth. These outposts must survive independently for decades; the one our protagonist is on is called Theseus, and it orbits a planet named Chori V which is abundant in minerals such as a more durable steel amalgam.On Chori V there are sentient rocks that speak to you about concepts of thought, physical existence, and metaphysical existence; scientists dubbed these beings The Watchers. The Watchers observed how humans lived on the space-station, they looked on as they argued over complex concepts like the ones mentioned above. The Watchers have an apparent connected network of thoughts, revealed by discoveries of electrochemical activity within them, and have been extracted and studied by the scientists to understand more about consciousness, resulting in the swapper device. Further progression reveals what happened to the space-station workers, what role The Watchers had in that, and ethical disagreements between the scientists.Gameplay:The gameplay mechanic is directly linked with its larger-than-life themes of consciousness, identity, and thought, and the story itself; the swapper device is at the core of the game. The device lets the player create clones and swap their consciousness between them. You can make up to four clones and control them all at the same time, swapping through them determines which one is the ‘original’. The platforming aspect of the game is fairly straight-forward, you’ll have to jump and walk on platforms, sometimes using timing, and will interacts with various aspects of the environments, such as lifts.There are light sources in the game that limit how much you can use the device. Red light prevents swapping between clones, while blue light prevents the creation of clones; the two lights overlapping (which results in purple light) prevents both. These lights play a big role in the puzzles of the game, which consist of using your clones to acquire orbs that open more areas of the map. The puzzles begin fairly simple, becoming harder as you progress more and more, in the end turning into complex puzzles that might take you a relatively long time to figure out (I got stuck in one of the final puzzles for an hour) but it’s never infuriating; the puzzles themselves are ingeniously designed, and along with a fair bit of logical thinking, require complete and total use of the swapper device.The map is redolent of metroidvania-style games, where one may have to advance and go back to ultimately reach a final destination. There are teleportation devices that give the player more accessibility to come from and go to previously visited locations in the map.Visual:This game is very special when it comes to graphics. Instead of using digitally made textures and 3D models, the environments in the game are handcrafted; clay models were used for the levels. That’s not to say there’s nothing digital involved in the making of the game, it is a videogame after all. Nevertheless, the game never fails to portray itself how it wants to, and the mixed media results in a very atmospheric ambience. The Swapper is relatively casual with its visuals, but once you focus on details you can see the work and effort put into making this game as beautiful as possible.Sound:The best part about The Swapper’s audio was definitely the voice acting, though the sound effects and soundtrack succeeded in completing the atmosphere of the whole game. The quietness, and the sound of nothing but your footsteps really brings the abandoned feel to life. When the game wants to be dramatic and convey a feeling of impending doom, it achieves it. In its entirety, the sound is the icing on the cake for this one.Final Thoughts:Are you still you after cloning yourself? Are you the clone or the original? When swapping your consciousness into a clone, is it still you? Does your soul stay intact? These are some big questions that entail a drive to possess comprehension on a much higher level than humans currently have, or might even be capable of. The themes of sentience, thought, consciousness, soul, and identity are what the game is all about. The Swapper explores these questions through its sole gameplay mechanic: swapping your consciousness into a clone.The fact that the swapper device exists raises some ethical and philosophical questions as well. Throughout the whole story, as the puzzles become harder the story also becomes more intense, characters begin to question one another, building up the tension and the magnitude of its themes with its vocabulary and carefully paced narrative. At the end of the game you get to make a choice, it’s unexpected that they place this decision in front of you. It’s a hard decision to make, and the unexpectedness of it made me immediately think carefully about what I would really do, and I did… This game is much more profound than I expected it to be. It caught me off guard, it was one of those experiences that make you rethink many things, like finishing a book and being left with a big message that’s for you to interpret and figure out how to feel about, and how to come to terms with it.I’m a fool for not playing it before! The two main developers, Otto Hantula and Olli Harjola (who made this game in their spare time while in university), have made a truly special and unforgettable product right here.Liked this review?

												The Swapper is a beautiful game - I felt that when starting it for the first time. What I wasn't expecting was for it to draw me in so completely, after the matter of a few levels. The mechanics are pretty much what is described on the store page, that you can create a certain number of clones, and swap control between them. That's it. No unlocks, no level ups for harder puzzles. What you can do as you delve deeper into the empty space station, is what you've always been able to do. That's one thing I really admire about this game. It makes your brain unlock, your imagination of this simple tool unlock, instead of unlocking things for the tool itself. Now back to my favorite aspect, the immersion of this game. There are no doubt many games of an abandoned site, be it a space station or historical site, et cetera. The Swapper, drew me in. I felt so utterly small, so alone. There are logs to be found as to what befell the previous occupiers of the station, but I did not feel hope. The quiet sounds, and large space station was definitely too hallow for one. For this one explorer. Or a few. You find some consciousnesses that are just those, thoughts floating in a great atmosphere. (Vague I know, but you'll see.) This game makes you think, mechanic wise, and story wise, yet it's not really trying to make you think about the ""story"", but more of all the implications.Overall, this is an excellent, thought provoking game in execution, atmosphere, and puzzle mechanics. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and couldn't put it down.			"

												The Swapper is a brilliant game that that needs to be experiencedThe Swapper has the ability to give make players feel that moment of enlightenment: the moment when garbled noise sounds like words, when tones become music, when the problem seems to solve itself. Taking the less is more approach (think Portal) there are only a small handful of mechanics to learn, but this is a feature that shows off nothing but careful and precise design. You are armed with a single device that allows you to create a few clones and switch which one you are controlling as the others follow your motions. Some lights deny either ability: one won't allow you to make clones, another won't allow you to switch control with them. Nothing more is needed to create the genuinely clever levels in The Swapper. The puzzles on display here challenge the player into utter confusion, and then elevate them as soon as the solution is found.Being fascinating from start to finish is no small feat, and The Swapper makes it look effortless. An eerie sci-fi setting, ethereal art, riddled words, and panicked voices all carry the enigmatic narrative of The Swapper. Aboard the ship of Theseus, stones speak madness, crew logs show failure and disarray, and a strange figure recedes further from you into the corridors of the ship. The questioned posed might be familiar for some, but the lens held here allows all players to engage it in a new way.  Playing with this idea as you chase answers in the halls of Theseus makes for an interesting backdrop.The brief nature of the game might be enough to turn off some, but that is where pacing becomes important. No matter how good something is, it can outstay its welcome and The Swapper knows how to avoid this. The puzzles might slow you down a bit, but the hands of the game and story seem to guide you at just the proper rate to stay engrossed.The Swapper is an amazing game full of mystery, depth, and great puzzles. It's simply a wonderful game.			"

												There's a moment in The Swapper where, for a few magical seconds, everything comes together. It's the moment shortly after you get the Swapper device where the game teaches you its potential. It does it in such an elegant way that it's a revelation; suddenly, the platform game you thought you were playing gets subverted, the possibilities seem vast, and the game exploits these possibilities in the various puzzles that it subsequently throws your way. To explain it would be to spoil it. There's a point in any puzzle game that I dread, though, and it's the point where it all becomes too much for my brain, where the developers start to throw the kitchen sink at you, and each puzzle becomes hard work rather than fun. In retrospect, The Swapper never really does this, but there were moments when faced with a seemingly impossible puzzle that my brain threw its figurative hands in the air and went off to sulk, muttering something about getting old. I admit that I had to look at a walkthrough for some of the later puzzles, the solutions to which are only elegant with hindsight. Still, I needed to progress because I needed to see how the story played out, touching as it does on life, morality and - momentarily - spirituality. The Swapper does a great job of drawing you into its cold, echoing world; it feels like Alien without the alien. The modelling style that's used to build the facility gives the game a unique look, realistic without being real, and the ethereal soundtrack completes the unsettling picture.			"

If you enjoy a game which makes you think, both about puzzles and the world around you, the swapper will be perfect.			"

Posted: December 11, 2015
												I really, really like this game! In fact of all games I played this year I can hardly find one I enjoyed more than this one! The 97% positive reviews are absolutely justified in my opinion and I concur with them.«The Swapper» is a 2D-puzzle-platformer embedded in a very elaborate, immersive and well narrated story. Actually it's some kind of a combination of a SciFi-short-story and a tricky platformer game - with a strong and intelligent connection between these two aspects (see below).☛ Have a look at the screenshots in my profile for a few impressions of the graphics, art design, atmosphere and puzzle design of «The Swapper».❖ Story and gameplay:Almost like in a SciFi movie...You are alone on an empty space station, ""Theseus"", with no idea what happened and have to find your way through a labyrinth of its rooms and corridors in order to find out what's going on there. In the very beginning you already notice that is has to be something really weird since you ""hear"" telepathic voices talking to you every time you pass one of these huge stones that are scattered around the whole station. And what they say is more confusing than explaining... at first.To overcome the various obstacles in the station you have a device (the ""swapper"") which enables you to create clones of yourself and to take control of them. And since you are alone on the station but the puzzles can only be solved in teamwork you need those clones, though their coordination can get tricky because your clones can't be moved independently from yourself and each other, they always do the exact same things you do, at the exact same time - but you can choose where to position a new clone and which of the clones defines what the others imitate. In order to create some kind of teamwork between these different 'You's you have to think outside the box sometimes.During your journey through the station you regularly pass data-terminals, which contain one file each, a log-entry, a letter, a protocol, a report and such, and reveal one by one the fascinating story of the stations history and give you piece by piece the whole picture of what happened on Theseus.(These files are relatively short though, it's not that you have to read through long texts, they are just so well-written and designed that the story that builds up in your mind around these little chunks of information is pretty complex in the end. Big compliment to the authors of the game btw.)Great story! ✿❖ Technical stuff:☑ Very pleasant, smooth game mechanics (AD: left and right, space/W: jump, e: interact, q: map, f: log, mouse-movement: look around, right/leftclick: clone/swap (use swapper-device), mouse-movement while holding right klick: position clone (use swapper device))☑ Good graphics, beautiful graphical art design☑ Sound nothing special, but  nice and supports the atmosphere very well☑ Professional voice acting☑ Puzzles/obstacles are designed very intelligently, easy in the beginning but quite complex and tricky in the end - and not repetitive☑ Two different endings☑ No glitches/bugs encountered☛ One CON to mention:Once you hit the last console and the ending sequence starts you reach a point of no return. During this ending scene you have to make a decision that defines the ending (out of two possibilities). After the game finished you have no chance to return to a certain chapter or even just some point before the ending sequence. If you would like to play through the other ending as well you would have to play through the whole game again.In the forums the devs stated, that they intentionally chose to do it this way and even not to warn the player of the point of no return - they wanted to make your final decision... well, really a final one.For me personally it's a con that you can't jump to particular chapters of the game after finishing it. You have no choice than to watch the other ending on youtube (if you dont want to play the whole game all over again) and that also complicates the achievement-hunting, since you have to play through the whole game again if you lack just one achievement at the very end of the game. So make sure to get all achievements in your first playthrough and in the correct order (achievements unlock by encountering hidden rooms that can only be found with the swapper by projecting a clone into walls - once you find a hidden passage this suddenly works, usually it doesn't).On the other hand: It isn't really a pain in the a▒s to play through the game a second time. Of course it's a little tedious to replay the puzzles you already solved once again (though there are enough of them and they partly look this similar (just ""look"".. in fact they aren't) that you easily forget about the trickier ones soon) but by your new knowledge about the whole story and the complete history of the station you get a new understanding of the early telepathic messages and files that just confused you when you heard/read them the first time. Like when you watch a movie a second time and suddenly understand and notice things that had no meaning to you while you first watched them. Quite interesting.I personally did it this way, I played the game twice. To play through both endings, to get some lacking achievements and to get another view on the early parts of the game. And I enjoyed both playthroughs.❖ Specials:What I especially liked about this game is the fact, that the game mechanics > the way you move through the station (with the ""swapper"" device) is strongly interwoven with the story. Usually in puzzle-platformers you have 1) a world full of the inevitable tricky puzzles in which you move 2) some special gadget or ability to overcome these obstacles (eg. this portal-device or the ability to shift the world around you or to jump extremely high etc.) and (at least if it's a good game) 3) a story that is told during you search your way through this world with this gadget/ability - but these things are normally three seperated elements of the game... or at least 2) is seperated. That you have this special device or ability to move around in the given map doesn't have a particular meaning, it's just the way it is, the way it has to be for the player to be able to solve the puzzles/overcome the obstacles. It doesn't matter why you have this ""wormwhole""-creator-pistol in ""Portal"", someone developed it and gave it to you, because that's how the game is supposed to work, period. It doesn't matter why you have the ability to turn the world around yourself in ""And Yet It Moves"", you just have it because otherwise you wouldn't be able to move through the map at all.In ""The Swapper"" it's different; your special device (swapper-device) and ability (telepathy) arent ""just there"" (""because it has to be this way to solve the given puzzles""), but the world around you and the story which is revealed by the time explain where this device/ability is coming from. Story and mechanics are interwoven. ❖ Fazit:If you dont bother reading all the data-files youll get a immersive SciFi short-story along with a great puzzle-platformer.But even if you dont like reading so much, you can still enjoy this game as a well designed puzzle-platformer. (But in this case it isn't an overwhelmingly great game anymore but just a normal, good puzzle-platformer. What makes this game special and legitimates this enthusiastic review is the story.)Recommended in both cases - though I really recommend to spend some time in reading and not to skip the story - it's the best aspect of the game and especially the connection between gameplay and story makes this game so special.Buy «The Swapper» - It's worth it! ❊ 10/10 ❊			"

												I REALLY hate most puzzle-platformer indie titles and somehow The Swapper really hits me hard. How? When? There are two things that make this title so awesome that I put aside my unredeemable hatred for this type of games.First one is a atmosphere. The Swapper really nails down few interesting themes that are associated with a sci-fi fiction - a creepy loneliness of space. You are on the research space station. Ambient noises comes from empty sections of the deck. Where everybody went? What happened here? The use of light, music and amazing claymotion-esque graphics is nearly perfect and you sit on the edge of your chair, even when this game isn’t a horror one. The plot, told mostly in the Bioshock manner, is really a thought-provoking, especially and the end. Presentation, story - crafted and tied together with mechanics, work well for the overall feel of the game.Second - The puzzles. This is probably the first puzzle-platformer when I wasn't forced to use a guide and game managed to keep with the high difficulty of the challenge. In one way it shows how many developers screwed up this aspect of their games. In the other: it's a really impressive feat from the creators of The Swapper. The cloning device does not look interesting on the first glance, but the Portal-like philosophy of puzzle design in simple-yet-convoluted “test” chambers works here. Game doesn't throw at you new mechanics often, but it shows how much you can squeeze out of something you already have. I think there is only one puzzle room that is not that great but it is only a single unsalted pretzel in the full basket of goodies.The device you use in the game is nicely wielded to the plot, but unfortunately the chambers and orbs that are the remaining main ""actors"" of all the puzzles in the game, aren't. There is no story explanation of those things and I count this a lost opportunity to amplify the immersion even more. Also, one may be really frustrated when the game shows the information that all in-game chambers must be solved in order to see the ending sequence. In the first locations there is an wrong assumption that you don't need to grab all orbs on your way. This can upset some people when it shows up, so keep that in mind.I extremely recommend this game, especially for those who liked Bioshock, Portal or sci-fi games in general. If you liked other indie-puzzle game then this game will show you how to craft not only a good game, but also a amazing interactive experience.Well... It looks like the puzzle-plaftormer genre IS salvageable after all...			"

												Excellent atmosphere, awkward feelings, intriguing ethical cues and impressive puzzles, even for non puzzler enthusiasts.There is no tutorial at all (except for the basic commands) but the learning curve of the puzzle mechanics isn't really steep and almost always you immediatly figure out what you need to do, and spend most of the time finding out how you're supposed to do that.Sometimes are required platforming skills, but one of the mechanics of the game makes jumping and landing extremely easy.The only one thing that I loathed was the achievements.(It isn't a spoiler, just an explanation of how to get them, but maybe somebody doesn't like it, so I'm gonna hide it anyway)You unlock each one of them finding hidden rooms, and this could be fine, if when I say ""hidden"" I actually mean you have absolutely ZERO clues to how to find them. The only practical way is check guides (on Steam Community there are a couple very well done) and just looking those you notice that they're absolutely impossible to find.I honestly don't know what's the point of this kind of stuff. Meh. "

												Super smooth side-on animations like Limbo, excellent puzzles, and fresh mechanics (cloning and swapping).  The art style is very unique (rendered from clay models) and deserving of the accolades, and the soundtrack enhances the barren ship environment.  The majority of the gameplay is solving puzzles in rooms with your clone(s) but just navigating around the ship is a fun ride and there is a perfectly implemented map that helps you always know where you are.  There is a deeper story that's fairly solid if you let go a little bit, but it doesn't require you to get too ""indie philosophical"" to enjoy it.  The challenges are really rewarding because there isn't any hand-holding.  In that way the solutions get harder and edge close to being obscure some times, but they never cross that line and they always prove to be ""fair"" once you see the answer.There's just something about the game's style coupled with how effortless and responsive the controls are that make it stand out.  If you are looking for something different, this is one of those (critically acclaimed) indie games to put at the top of your back-log list, and one to play before you dive into your next AAA first-person game.

												I know what you're thinking, and no, this isn't some weird sex thing. It's weird, but in a way that gets the gears in your head turning about existence and identity. It's also a puzzle platformer, one of the good ones like Braid where its mechanics and story are finely intertwined to make a meaningful, unified experience. That really should be enough to sell anyone on The Swapper, but I'll happily go through the details for anyone holding out on this excellent title.You play an unnamed astronaut, unceremoniously ejected from a science station onto a barren mining colony. There you find the game's namesake, a device that can create perfect clones of you AND swap your consciousness between them. If you're thinking that opens a whole can of philosophical worms, the inhabitants of the station and colony would agree (if they hadn't mysteriously vanished). As you puzzle your way back onto the station, you'll learn plenty about the device aiding you, its part in the disappearance of your peers, and the creeping existentialist horror therein.In terms of game mechanics, this is a straight puzzle game. The first few areas introduce the Swapper and its two functions, and the rest of the game challenges you to solve convoluted rooms using those same functions. The fine details help flesh out some of the puzzles; for example, your clones mimic your moves perfectly, so some puzzles call for careful clone choreography across pressure plates or platforms. Aiming a new clone also slows down time, allowing you to make fine adjustments and precise swaps for time-intensive puzzles. There are two kinds of light that can block your abilities as well, along with some gravity shenanigans to spice things up.Solving puzzles earns you ""security orbs"" which are used to unlock doors and activate important systems. In truth they function like Mario 64 stars, where you have hubs of puzzle rooms and need like 75% of the available orbs to progress, and those margins shrink as you get near the end of the game. There are logs to read, mysterious stones to examine, and some scattered cutscenes that progress the story, but much of what you're doing is moving from hub to hub, solving puzzles.This leads to the station feeling less like a functional place and more like a funhouse, but that's seriously my only knock against the incredible atmosphere. While the story and mechanics would by themselves set The Swapper apart as an excellent title, the shadowy corridors and brooding, ambient soundtrack take it to another level. The graphics are all real-world models made from everyday materials like tin cans and styrofoam, but blended together to give an otherworldly yet photo-realistic feel to the station. The detailed textures make the stark lighting pop, and the sharply contrasting colors lend heavily to the unease of the derelict halls.I'm easily won over by games that have unique plots that they explore fully, but The Swapper starts there and crafts a magnificent experience around its hook. It's similar in some ways to SOMA, touching on the same themes in environments meant to isolate and unsettle you. You'll only get about two hours out of this one, unfortunately, but there some of the best two hours to be found among puzzle platformers, or really any genre. Seriously, don't let any game this polished or intelligent pass you by.			"

The Swapper – Puzzle, Platformer, Isolation, Atmosphere, Explorationa spoiler-free reviewRelease Date: 30 May, 2013Rating: Recommended as Essential- Gameplay -Challenging puzzles, beautiful environments, soulful music and a mysterious device aboard an abandoned space station set the stage for The Swapper. This game is first and foremost a puzzle game with brainteasers that can stump even the most clever players. You control an unidentified astronaut who finds “the swapper device”, a beam gun that can create up to four clones of yourself and swap control between any of them. Your clones mirror your movements, allowing you to solve complicated puzzles onboard Space Station Theseus. There are no enemies, only puzzle elements such as lights that disable your swapper and gravity reversal pads.- Visuals -The game is entirely 2-D with bloom, soft shading, ambient blur and simply gorgeous graphics. The space station feels cold and empty, bathed in blue until you run across the gardens and greenhouses which are bright and full of life. The visuals reinforce a feeling of isolation the setting provides. Many of the objects were handcrafted out of clay and other materials before digitization.- Audio -The sound effects are nothing special but good. The menu theme is slow and emotional, setting the tone of the entire game. Most of the background music is a low drone, but there are a few sections where a soft piano plays a sad melody. I stopped just to listen to these songs during my first playthrough.- Puzzles -Game progress is limited by gates that require a number of security orbs in order to open. These orbs can be acquired by solving puzzles, which scale in difficulty from the start of The Swapper to its finish. Teleport stations are unlocked as you progress, which makes backtracking much faster. The achievements are all secret (Hint: some walls aren’t as solid as they look).- Plot - (spoiler-free)Since I can’t tell you nearly anything about the story without spoiling something, this will be brief. The game progresses the story through cinematic cutscenes and lore messages you can pick up from marked terminals, as well as other sources. There are multiple endings and you will have to play through a couple times in order to understand the story.- My Thoughts -This game plays like a “Metroidvania” game; backtracking exists but is hardly necessary. I gave it my highest rating because I really enjoyed being stumped by the puzzles and being confused by the intricate story, then figuring them out and finally understanding what was going on. It’s a hard puzzler and a walkthrough does help at points. I got this on sale, but I’d say that it’s worth the full price of $15. Buy this, solve puzzles and have fun!Not RecommendedRecommended With CautionRecommendedHighly Recommended- Recommended as Essential "

												I've just found a neat toy. Superficially it’s a strange-looking gun – with seemingly no visual clues as to its nature. Curious. I pick it up and pull the trigger expecting, as usual, some kind of interesting projectile. But rather than bullets, it materialises a human figure. It’s me! An identical copy – a clone. Surreal, I know. As I walk, he (it?) blindly mimics my action. Hmm, so more of an empty vessel then than any kind of a real person. I shoot again – my triplicate! Again – my quintuplet! I freestyle shooting up into the air. Just as before another appears only this time he is falling. His feet hit the floor first to an audible crack of bones. His limp body then collapses into a heap, lifeless. Air from his ruptured spacesuit hisses out. I stare into the middle distance. Suddenly I don’t feel quite so playful. What I do feel is uncomfortably disturbed and that, to its immense credit, is the feeling that The Swapper is able to evoke most vividly during its short but captivating journey into the heart of darkness. Right from the off, this unassuming piece hits you with the atmosphere – visuals that riff off 2001 and sound design that recalls the nervy ambiance of alien. But that’s just the introductory sequence. You then begin the lonely walk, first across the haunted landscape of a forgotten planet, and later ascending to the empty hulk of a ship haunted by some pitch black secrets.  As fast as the novelty passes you quickly become comfortable with the mechanics of cloning yourself and ‘Swapping’ your consciousness between bodies in order to traverse the environment. It’s a neat core mechanic giving The Swapper a fresh, fluid, quality to its movement. Indeed, zipping through the expansive habitats, crossing abyssal gorges and navigating labyrinthine death traps, could almost be mistaken for a liberating if it wasn’t for one uncomfortable necessity - Progression has never required such an unnatural disregard for personal safety and over the course of the game you will willingly sacrifice hundreds if not thousands of your cloned forms in order to reach the ultimate conclusion. The trick Swapper pulls is in building your familiarity with the mechanic of sacrificial progression without ever truly answering the questions it raises regarding the soul.  Once this nervy backdrop is established Swapper starts hitting a rhythm that somewhat recalls the majesty of the original portal - A masterful build-up of complexity orchestrated with the deepening overture of its narrative that makes for a rich, compelling symphony. New mechanics are deftly introduced and then layered onto the ever multiplying permutations of complex puzzle solving - The simultaneous clone limit, the gravity switches, the very portal-esque red and blue light filters, composing the constituent parts which are each time are combined in ever perplexing arrangements. What this all adds up to is a well-crafted deftly told science fiction short story. Not an extravaganza, not expansive world building, but the evocation of a distinct journey against a mood of dread and isolation. While Swapper succeeds on many technical and gameplay levels, the real magic of this experience is one that harkens back to an unsettled feeling, that first encounter with the swapper device itself and the sense of morose revelation as its true nature becomes apparent. Some have said this could be the perfect game. While I am hesitant to agree entirely, I can definitely see their reasoning – engaging gameplay built on rock solid mechanics, rich absorbing visuals and a feeling like standing on the edge of a dark precipice that doesn't quickly leave you. In truth – I don’t think it’s far off.If you liked that piece check out my game review site:http://tonnochi.blogspot.co.uk/Thanks for reading. Cheers Guys! "

It has a very unique game style and playstyle and cloning yourself is just so nice. The controls are also very well done :)			"

												The first thing I want to make clear is that this is not a bad game. It's actually a very thought-provoking, puzzle-intense, short-but-sweet sci-fi adventure with elements reminescent of movies such as Moon, or Alien (sans the jump scares). It's well done for an indie title, and its high metascore is deserved. It's just... not my kind of title, and I don't want to recommend a game based on what it does well, but how -I- enjoyed it.The core element of this game, its raison d'etre, is the ability to create clones of yourself and to swap into those clones to explore and advance, while attempting to escape an abandoned craft. There are a number of puzzles woven into the narrative that at times stunned me at their cleverness, and the story really makes you think about what constitutes 'you' rather than 'your mind'--but I won't get into spoilers.Where the game falls short is just -how- frustrating some of these puzzles can be, and frankly, a number can be a bit tedious. Games like Quantum Conundrum can get away with this because of the humorous and light-hearted atmosphere to keep you entertained, but here, the story elements can sometimes feel a bit few and few between. That, and I kind of feel like the game is a little... pretentious? Like it's trying -too hard- to make you think, and it throws you into the story in media res and makes you put the pieces together, as though that makes it deeper than it naturally is.Other than that, the game doesn't have much else that stands out to me. Visuals are decent, as is the voice acting, but there's scarcely a sound track, and the hidden secrets in this game are -insanely- hard to find without a guide. I found myself both bored and frustrated more than I did intrigued and delighted, and that's a kiss of death for me when it comes to puzzle platformers.Maybe this is someone else's cup of tea, but it's just not mine.

												I thoroughly enjoyed The Swapper. Being alone in a big empty ship provided a sense of creepiness similar to Dead Space, but instead of action and horror elements, there are puzzles to be solved by making hollow clones of yourself and transferring your consciousness to any one of those empty bodies. The story is very science fiction and extremely weird. The puzzles are pretty easy for the most part, but there was one at the end with four buttons that just stumped the hell out of me. Although fairly short, The Swapper is an extremely solid puzzle platformer--a great addition to the genre.			"

With the eponymous swapper device you can create up to three copies of yourself and swap between them which is essential to solve the puzzles. Definitely worth playing !			"

												This is probably one of my favorite games, but sadly, it is under ratted, I wish more people could play.If you like Portal 2 or Stanley's Parable BUY THIS NOW!!! >:O The Game ItselfIt's got like the gameplay of portal 2, storyline of Stanley's Parable, and very, very beautiful design.Just the game alone is a piece of art, and the message behind it, is pretty deep.This game gives me so many feels, you should get it and play it no matter what, the levels are challenging but not impossible!The great thing about it is you can skip levels and always come back to them later! (not like portal where you are pretty much stuck until you finish)Gameplay BasicsThis might give you a better idea on how the game works, in case you were wondering whether or not to buy it!Spoilers will be notedMOVEMENT:A: walk leftD: walk righttap W: small jumpHold W: higher jumpI suggest binding the jump key to SpaceBar tho :3Q: I’m the map I’m the map I’m the map I’m the map!CLONING: (hold) Mouse 2You can clone yourself, wherever you want, with the SWAPPER DEVICE.You can make 4 clones at most, including yourself, there can be 5 people on the screen.All clones will follow your movements (walk left,right jump), until they hit a wall or an obstacle.When you deploy a clone, you are in a slow-motion state.Clones will only be deployed in the state you are in (upright -> upright) (upside down -> upside down)SWAPPING: Mouse 1You can swap / teleport your soul (main player) to any of the other clones. if there are 2 clones together, it will hit the first one the swapper beam touches.You can swap in mid air.When your clone is upside down, you will be swapped to the upside down state as well.RETRIEVING YOUR CLONE: Touch the darn thingif you walk into your own clone, you will take it back. (But only if your ""soul"" is one of the clones!! If none of the clones are the player himself, they will not colide into one)OBSTACLES: Boxes: Drag with E, push with booty ;)Blue light: Cannot spawn clone within, you can still teleport through or within it.Red light: Cannot teleport in it or even TROUGH it, you can spawn a clone anywhere in it.Purple = Cons of Blue + Red : Can't clone inside, can teleport thru it or in it = you are f**king screwed ;-;Buttons: These babes open doors and turn off lights.Spoilers: Tips and Tricks  If you hold down onto the button, time goes into slow-motion, meaning you can make clones in the sky, teleport to them, and make a new clone, swap to them, on and on, you can gain incredible hightsBoxes can block a door from shutting! If you hit a wall but still press the A and D key, your clones will still walk, use this to change the distances between yourselves By jumping, you can get closer to your clone, when she is upside down and you are upright, use it well ;) This one... is so special to me, cause it took me a while to figure out, but REMEMBER, if you touch your clone, you take it back, including when you are upside down and he is upright! vis versa!Also, this can happen by jumping between a low ceiling, or even SPAWNING your clone on top of another, Good luck ;)  Took me about 8-9 hours to finish, but then you realize , wait, there are secrets too?! (The achievements) So, this game has got some replay value to it! There are also many ways to complete most levels.You can make different in-game accounts to play the whole story over again.Sadly, once a level is finished, you can’t start it over, you will have to make a new in-game account… and proceed thru the story until you get there =-=….why…Alright, typed quite a lot, as you can see how much I love this game, it must be pretty ***damn addicting! So what are you waiting for ;) ?			"

												I have very little but praise for this game.The Swapper was absolutely fantastic from beginning to end. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, and the story is interesting and fairly well delivered, with the rare encounters with other people on board the ship each being mysterious and memorable. Having said that, the text files accessible around the ship don't do the best job of explaining some of the backstory - or perhaps I missed something crucial.The central puzzle mechanic is very clever, and the difficulty scales perfectly - so that every room feels manageable, but you'll still struggle (in a good way) to have that moment of clarity and realization. The game seems to love to make you think ""I'm one clone short of being able to complete this puzzle....""  But as soon as I thought of (or stumbled upon!) the solution to every one of the later rooms, I found myself thinking ""Oh damn, its been staring me in the face this entire time!"" They always manage to do new things with the puzzles and keep it very different, no puzzle is a repeat of any other, and they'll all challenge you in different ways, particularly when they start introducing new environmental mechanics and features! Additionally, the first time you realize the Swapper gun's uses not just in puzzles but also in travelling large chasms and spaces is a joy, and it feels great to travel fast using the gun (if easy to mess up!)The story is captivating by itself -- (it took me until embarassingly late in my playthrough to notice that some of the characters were named after 20th/21st century philosophers of mind, and the ship is named Theseus for a reason..)  But what is absolutely interesting is how the central gameplay mechanic of being able to create clones and then ""swap your souls around"" is slowly related back to the player.  Think of the game as an extended thought experiment -- in order for this to be possible, what would personal identity and the mind have to really amount to? When you first progress in the game as one of the clones, and leave the original you as a corpse on the floor, it's disconcerting, but it quickly becomes a simple habit, and you'll go through hundreds and hundreds of clones without thinking at all about any of them. It's at the end that this action which has become trivial is suddenly recontextualized. It then uses these thoughts about personal identity and the mind to say something quite unique about the player's role in the narrative.   And the ending, which I absolutely do not want to spoil,  is perfect in tone.			"

												The Swapper... I saw a thread about it a couple of weeks ago with the announcement that it was coming to Steam. The graphics looked gorgeous but I didn't quite know what to expect from the game itself. Now I know. Let me just say that The Swapper blew me away.At its heart the game is a puzzle platformer, with an atmosphere that will remind most of us of Dead Space. Your character's suit and a few zero-gravity parts also reminded me of it.The graphics are extremely beautiful and moody. It has a bit of a fuzzy look, but man, does it look good in motion. I read somewhere that it used clay for some of the environments. I can't confirm this, as it's very well done in that case, but the idea behind is cool. Yes, it has been used in several other games but nowhere near as subtle as in The Swapper.The puzzles are well made. A few of them are exceptionally hard, but this also depends on the person that plays it obviously. I thought it had a nice mix of easy, medium and hard puzzles. It's all about swapping between you and your clones, hence the title.The story itself is pretty deep, even though it's all about swapping. There are several rocks located throughout the world and all of them will give you a tiny bit of information, and there are computers with log files as well. Near the end of the game things will become more clear.The Swapper isn't necessarily a long game. It might take an average person between 5 or 7 hours. A bit short for such a wonderful game. Let's hope it does well enough to give us some sort of sequel in the future.For now, go buy The Swapper as it's one brilliant game. It really is ![Rating: 88/100]			"

												The Swapper has a great atmosphere and an addictive gameplay, it has got smart puzzle mechanic also being part of platformer. There is also a fun sci-fi story with a twist you gradually uncover as you go along. I said ""smart puzzle mechanic"" but believe me you will scratch your head at some of the puzzles, but all can be solved logically by considering how to work around your limitations not anymore. Playing this felt like brain exercise. Outside of the puzzle rooms, it’s fun to clone & zip yourself around as you traverse the map. It's kinda unorthodox. Great idea and I respect that.Also The Swapper has got an amazing&gritty sounds, ambiance, music these are fits the storyline perfectly to compliment the exceptionally gripping gameplay that brings something new to an existing genre, pulled off with style. If you enjoyed puzzle platformers, you should give this a shot. Believe me you won't regret this experience...			"

												This game really was one of the most controverse games i played yet.It took a bit to finish it with 100% achievements (yup, i like ""completing"" games), but was the right amount of challenge.On the other hand, the story built up a bit ... slow. It was alot to read, if you wanted to keep up with the complete story.But - after a lot of running, jumping, puzzle solving  and swapping - the end came with a lot of mind♥♥♥♥ for me. I really was a bit overwhelmed with the decision, that needed to be taken. My brain freaked out a bit, so this game even got my nomination for the ""tears in my eyes"" award.A platformer with a nice atmosphere and a really intense ending. It's ""indie"" and not expensive - get it, if you want to try something new and choose your side of the force after all.			"

												This is one polished puzzle game. It looks pretty. It has an interesting science fiction story. The music is great. The puzzle pacing is spot on. The one negative - it is too short! I want more! While it is short, it is complete. The game didn't linger longer than it should. The puzzles didn't feel recycled.In this game, you are ""The Swapper."" You are on an abandoned (?) space station and need to get out. You find a swapper gun that allows you to make clones of yourself and swap between them. You can have up to four clones on the screen in order to solve puzzles. The completion of a puzzle rewards you with some power orbs that then allow you to access other consoles in order to advance further in the game.In the beginning it is you and your gun. Then there are colored lights. Blue lights don't allow you to make a clone in them. You can make a clone through them though. Red lights don't allow you to swap to clones either in or through the light. The later puzzles introduce a gravity well that inverts gravity. Some of the later puzzles are tricky because the game limits your clones to less than four and you need to find the proper order to place and swap.This is a great little puzzle game that anyone interested in puzzles should check out.

												I don't even know which aspect of this game to praise first.. This is one of those games that leaves you wondering, contemplating, and overthinking life as you know it. There is no earthly way for me to explain what the story is about without telling you all about it, which is probably why I had no clue the story was such an essential part of the game when it first took my interest.. Just know that if you've got a philosophical side in you, and aren't afraid of exploring every corner of the map to find out more information, and how it links together to understanding it all.. this is your game.Sure, the puzzles are great, but there's tons of other puzzle games.. The Swapper offers you much, much more than a series of fun and challenging puzzles. And last, but certainly not least, are the aesthetics, and soundtrack! They help make The Swapper an unforgettable experience.			"

Only ""weapon"" you have to solve its puzzles is experimental device able to clone the user and swap control between them. Nice visuals and soundtrack make your exploration of vast space station Theseus very deep and atmospheric. However, it's short and has no replayability.

												A great, unique game that I thoroughly enjoyed playing right until the very end. It proved to be an excellent puzzle platform game with excellent puzzles, excellent gameplay, a good atmosphere, and an intrigueing story. The art style is unique, but very well done as I think it suits the game and it's atmosphere. And to further add to that, I believe the soundtrack to be something pretty nice that also suits the atmosphere and setting of the game as well, with takes place aboard a space station in space. The puzzles in this game are definitely noteworthy and something not to think of lightly. They provide quite a challenge. Not an impossible, frustrating challenge, but a good challenge that really gets you to actually think and want to push to get the puzzle done. I had my fair share of stumps where some puzzles took me quite awhile to figure out, but I managed them in the end. Adding on to the puzzles, I also found gameplay to be another great feature of this game as well. Basically, the main feature and what this game revolves around is the Swapper device, which enables you to make clones, swap with them, etc. It's something fresh and interesting brought to the table of game mechanics. The story should also not be taken lightly either. A story if looked into enough by paying attention to the game, collecting logs, and actually thinking about it, is something that's pretty deep, good, and thought-provoking. I know it did have an effect on my emotions, which is something I really appreciate when a video game is able to do that to me.This is a game that definitely deserves a lot of praise. It's a great, beautiful game that was not only a lot of fun to play, but also appreciate things like it's story, philosophical-related stuff, atmosphere, and more. I can easily see myself coming back to this game to play again down the road and would have no issues at all with another playthrough of it. It took me about a solid seven hours to complete the game, which I think was a decent length. Overall, my hat goes off to this game. A game I have no problem recommending to other people, as I believe it will provide a good challenge with a fun, but rewarding experience. Kudos to The Swapper!			"

												Wrapped up The Swapper earlier. Done in only two sessions and two days. Really shows how much it grabbed me more than anything else. I found the length to be perfect. Just ended before it became a trudge. Almost ten hours is a good length, even more when the puzzles never repeated or even got too similar. Each has its own ""feeling"".What can I say? It all clicked very well with me. The visual style is not only beautiful but adds to the cryptic world building and desolate tone. Controls were perfect and it is just nice to learn new tactics and moves with the same basic mechanics.Puzzles almost never were a forgettable breeze, neither frustrating. That made me especially glad, since I usually don't play puzzle games. Kinda proud that I managed to solve every room on my own. All besides three measly puzzles. Bit my teeth off at those many times but once it became frustrating I called it a day and looked them up. It's fine though. Two of those had a similar gist to it which I don't think I'd come up with. And the other one was a bit cheap-ish.Once done with all rooms, I saw a guide explaining the secret rooms. They have terminals and even though I loved reading them and learning more about the world, accessing them is a bit stupid done. Reading a guide to get to them would break immersion, so I skipped them. Ending was great.Totally recommend giving it a shot. A great little gem.			"

												A well-designed atmospheric puzzle game without any hand-holding. All puzzles involve creating clones of yourself that all mimic your movements, while giving you the ability to swap between them with line-of-sight. Limited mechanics, but a good variety of puzzles, and really good difficulty progression. Sometimes the levels are too dark in places and it obscures platforms that are important for solving, making things harder than it needs to be. There's a map that you can access at any time that shows you where you've visited and what you've seen, so you'll never miss any story logs or anything else, which is great (although there are some hidden logs as secrets.) The story fit in very nicely and had a satisfying conclusion. Expect 5 hours of gameplay.			"

There were minor things that annoyed me like the really cheap feeling animation while walking and the puzzles that jumped from obvious to extremely hard and back to super easy again.It reminded me of Dead Space a lot in various aspects of the visuals and story, but the latter is what’s standing out the most to me. At first it all seemed like pseudo philosophical jibber jabber, but the ending… Oh my.If you have it, play it. If not, look at some screenshots I took and regret not owning it.Review taken from my backlog profile.[backlog-deepness.rhcloud.com] "

												The Swapper is a not so linear puzzle game with an original and unique gameplay mechanic that increases it's difficulty as you progress through the game almost without you even knowing it adding a ridiculous level of immersion thanks to the high quality soundtrack paired with the artistic design and a mysterious story that will result in addiction until you are done with it.

												A brilliant puzzle platformer with a beautiful claymation art style that gives the a great atmosphere along with the games solid soundtrack. Its well designed and you can see that a lot of thought have been put into the game. The puzzles are varied, and new mechanics keeps being introduced to keep things fresh and interesting. While the story took a backseat to the gameplay for me it adds a nice layer to the game that makes it well worth playing all the way to the end.The Swapper chooses to go for making every single achievement in the game missable by having them as optional story pickups that are very well hidden and are often their own little puzzles to be able to get them. Would recommend a guide to help to find them, and there are multiple available in the community hub.Time to 100%: 4-5 hours			"

												The Swapper is a puzzle game set almost entirely on the theseus space station. The puzzles are great and provide a moderate challenge throughout the game. But what really struck me as amazing about it was the way the story was executed. The Swapper finds a way to be a fun puzzle game while also building a story around some deep thoughts such as- How far is man willing to go to surive- What attributes are necessary for something to ""live""- Where science and spirituality meet- Where the line is drawn on scientific expirementationI found it amazing that a puzzle game could be so packed with thought and emotion. The story is good and feels like something out of a sci-fi novel, and the ending provides a perfectly macabre sense of closure. The art style is also great. You feel somewhat compelled to just stop and stare at the intricate scenery, taking a screenshot or two as you go. All in all I thought that even  it was short, it was great. So now I have to ask you ""will you do what it takes to cntinue?""I did.			"

												The Swapper is a fun atmospheric exploration/puzzle game set in space. I have enjoyed my time playing it and have found the game to be quite entertaining. The ""swapper tool"" is especially cool because of the fact that you can clone yourself with it multiple times to get through the puzzle areas in the game. Overall this is a must buy for several hours of fun.			"

It contains puzzles that require solution using yourself. Multiple times. It's atmosphere is dark and eerie and the story behind is very well written and makes you question certain aspects.Get it if you like puzzling or a pretty good story and something to think about.

GeneralHmm, how would I put it... It is an excellent game except for some things that really bothered me personally. Nonetheless, great game with thriller and slightly horrific taste.Pro's+ Atmosphere is amazing+ Puzzles+ Story & Narrative (although I didn't fully understand the story but it cleared up at the end)+ Music is intriguingNeutralPoints that sometimes I consider it a Pro and other times I consider it as a Con:* Guidance, basically you would explore areas that might ruin part of the story because there weren't enough directions to begin with. However, on the other hand it gives you the advantage of exploration.* Log UI, yes it might be authentic to mimic the spaceship's old computers console. However, it seems kind of washed and not conveying the serious nature of some logs late game (at least a bit of orange or red here and there would do the trick)Con's- Lack of tutorials in the puzzles early game (you don't know what the red, blue, or purple lights do until you experience it yourself)- No Save indicator (yes I might be picky but in order to make sure that 1 hour of progress is not lost at least show me a sign that my progress is saved!)Rate8.5 / 10Worth Full Price?No, better get it at sale (isthereanydeal site, reddit/gamedeals, ...etc)			"

Only pure logic.No cross-correlating either, every puzzle is self sufficient and you don't need knowledge acquired somewhere else to solve it.The story is interesting also, rather philosophical revolving around the ""what is a thought?"" question.

												Must play, if you're even the tiniest bit into puzzle games.The concept is rather simple but quite fresh. You get full control of the Swapper device right away. You can have up to 5 clones that respond to controls exactly the same, but only one of them is ""you"" and can use Swapper. It's easy to get into, but challenging to master. Of course, additional gameplay elements are introduced over time to always keep you interested.The quality of the game is just top-notch. Everything looks slick, physics are fine, controls and menus are very convenient, no bugs, amazing performance, even on Linux.The story is very good sci-fi, no comments here.This is not a very long game, but not too short either. It ends just before it could start getting boring.★★★★★★★★★☆			"

You can also swap to them and take control. +Puzzles are nicely layered getting progressively harder and require more creative thinking. The puzzles are really well done and solving them feels really nice. + Clay graphics and animation really adds to atmosphere +Surprsingly good story and plot+ Nice musicThe Bad- Won't be getting any of the achievements without a walkthrough - Some of the later puzzles are incredibly hard and most likely require a guide Conclusion:This is a fantastic game that I kept hearing people rave about and I can safely say that this is a great game and deserves all the praise it gets.

												Simple controls and an easy to understand game mechanic make for one fantastic puzzle platformer game. The swapper gives you the ability to create a number of clones and swap between them. A simple concept done right. Puzzles consist of small rooms aboard a space craft and include various traps that toughen the actual puzzle solving.There's a kind of atmosphere in the swapper that feels natural to what you are doing. I never felt bored or annoyed at anything I was presented with. In most cases my drive to explore pushed me forward to solve every puzzle and get to the end. It is a beautiful game in its own right.Achievements are given as secret areas are uncovered which means you can miss them all and/or give yourself an alternate goal to pursue.Try it, you wont be sorry.

This is a long review, so if you want to read why I recommend The Swapper just skip to Results and read from there.Facepalm Games chooses a winner with The Swapper. The Swapper is an amazing puzzle game where you play as an astronaut who enters into a research station.  The station is eerily empty; keeping you constantly wondering what went wrong. Throughout your exploration you find only one other person who seems relatively unstable and an abundance of space rocks. Although unlike normal rocks you quickly figure out that these ones can communicate. Will you make it off the ship or will you die a painful death. The Swapper will keep you wanting to survive, but only if you throw away your morals. Gameplay:The Swapper is a puzzle game where you must use a device “The Swapper” to create clones. These clones have no mind of their own and move the exact same way as you, except in a different space. You can use “The Swapper” to throw your soul between the clones and chance who you are in control of. At the touch of a button all the clones can disappear leaving your original self behind. These game implements a variety of features which keep the game riveting without being repetitive: jumping sequences, fast swap requirements, gravity changes, switches, insightful dialogue, amazing story, incredibly beautiful ambience, and a scary take on the ideas of reality. Are we really the whole person or just a vessel for our mind? Game Mechanics:The controls are incredibly simple, easy to use, and make for a pleasant experience. You will learn quickly that while using features of the swapper slows down time and space allowing you to pull of relatively complex moves through short time spans. There will be many times where you will jump off a cliff knowing you will die just to use a clone you created right before you hit the bottom. The puzzles are complex, require precise timing, and may require you to use every single one of your clones. I actually 100% completed this game, although I am not sure why but Steam decided to not give me the last four achievements. I would get them again, but once you complete this game you cannot go back. So in order to play again you must start from the beginning, but the positive is if you want the achievements but haven’t got them you can go through every part of the game and find them before you activate the end sequence. If you can’t tell the achievements are secret areas in the game, each of them every difficult to find. Each achievement also unlocks secret computer terminals which provide additional information. If you are a game hunter you can find them all yourself, but if you are interested in what the terminals say you can easily find very effective guides online. Results:The Swapper is a great game, it keeps you on your toes and makes you wanting more. For $14.99 it is a bit expensive and I am not sure if I would recommend paying that price unless you have the money to spare. Although if you are more frugal, like myself, I would wait till this title is one sale. If you can get the Swapper for under $10.00 it’s completely worth every penny. This game offers so much in such a little package: brilliant dialogue, amazing story development, beautiful atmosphere, wonderful puzzles, interesting concepts, fantastic character controls, and amazing achievements. Pros:+Fantastic controls+Great atmosphere, environment, ambience, and world depth+Challenging puzzles with a variety of different features.+Really interesting game map+Intelligent dialogue that gets you to think.+The perfect length; The Swapper is not too short but also not too long. Cons:-After completing the game you must start a new file if you want to go through the ship again (you cannot load any save files as this game has only one save file). -Not great if you have a multi-person household, because it has only one save file this means only one person can play the game at any given time.

												The Swapper is a slow and thoughtful game unnervingly fixated on its gratuitous death toll. It's a puzzle game that asks you to consider your actions, both literally and mentally — what they did and what they cost. It is the space marine shooter inverted. Its antagonists are immobile, talkative rocks; its environment is static and action-free; its sole weapon only kills you. And The Swapper is a fantastic puzzle game because its best riddles are the ones that can't be solved. "

We need to collect a certain amount of Encryption orbs to get past each section of the game.

												The Swapper is quite beautiful in many regards - the ambiance is perfect, the story is mysterious, and the soundtrack is engrossing.At heart this is a puzzle game. The puzzles start off fairly simple but become more challenging as you progress. I did have to look up a few of the solutions because they can become quite the brain twisters. I would imagine these puzzles were not easy to design so props to the designers of the puzzles.I can't really think of anything to criticize about The Swapper - it is executed quite well.As a side note, I found this game because I was looking under the ""Metroidvania"" tag, but The Swapper is definitely not a Metroidvania style game. So if you are buying this because of that tag just realize it's misleading. I would recommend buying the game anyways because it's simply fantastic.The Swapper should take approximately 3-5 hours to finish depending on your proficiency at puzzle solving.			"

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 9/10SoundTrack: 7/10Overall: 8.75/10Does this one have a soul?That’s the big question in indie puzzle game The Swapper, among other very deep ones. Do clones – copies of copies as it were – have consciousness? What is death for? Perhaps it’s for avoiding something, for a short time at least…You don’t see these types of questions in video games all too often and for that, The Swapper immediately gets a strong nod from this writer.Space Station Theseus is where your character – who has no name, or voice – stumbles upon. She finds an empty station that has been all but completely deserted save one other scientist, who seems busy doing something else, too busy for you at the moment.The Swapper gun is discovered among the rubble of creepily empty rooms, and this is where the true gameplay starts kicking into gear.swap4timesThere can only be four clones at a time, and you can swap between them all as you wish, provided that blue or red (blue prevents creating clones, red from swapping into them) lights aren’t blocking your way. The puzzles are very Portal-esque and will sometimes bust your brain when you figure out the obvious solution that you had completely overlooked.As you complete these puzzles and acquire more orbs (which allow you to unlock deeper sections of the station), the story of what happened here starts to become much clearer. You’ll get the chance – if you want – to read up on little holo-terminals about the crew and what it was going through while on their seven year expedition. As the story progresses there are additional dialogues – greatly voiced by the way – from the lone scientist, and you begin to understand more of what she is desperately trying to do.You see, as you explore the station, you will come across many of these almost-sentient rocks dubbed “The Watchers”, who, when passed by, will have something to say via shaky text pop-ups. The Watchers are critical to what the scientists on board Theseus were trying to accomplish. And the more Watchers you inevitably delve into the thoughts of, the creepier the whole situation gets.screaminsideI can’t shake off the creepiness after having finished the game. Everything about the station is… not right, and I approached each puzzle with determination to find out more of what had been going on here.The level of atmosphere in The Swapper is remarkable, astounding even, considering the low-budget small indie developer Facepalm Games and what they had to work with. Similar to the original Star Wars movie though, that budget tightness may have been more a benefit than a flaw. Levels and characters have all been made from real-life clay and other materials that give the game a very realistic and almost touchable quality to them.As the game ends and you make one of two very difficult choices, you’re left with a deep and hollow cathartic melancholy. Or at least I thought it was. I sort of sat there as the credits rolled and started thinking, sort of pondering questions about life and acknowledging the shakes I was feeling across my chest.I can’t give this game enough praise, honestly, and for me the only thing holding this back from being perfect is the sheer challenge of the puzzles at times. But I think that more adds to the charm of The Swapper, especially when those puzzles are backed with such a deep and smoothly told story. If you have a spare five hours, and some familiarity with thinking-outside-the-box, do pick this up.leviathyn.com "

												This was Surprisingly a hard and interesting game to play.Finally finished it.The Swapper is a Puzzle Platformer that uses some interesting mechanics for solving them, Using clones of oneself.The game certainly did peak my interest at certain points to know more about the origin story, giving  peaks and teasers as you solve the puzzle and obtain Encryption orbs. We need to collect a certain amount of Encryption orbs to get past each section of the game. Saying more would spoil the game.. :)Pros: +Graphics-Stunning+Atmosphere- Alone in space?...yeah this got it right.+Puzzles and Level design (some took me more than an hour)+Writing- for all you intellectual minds :D+Gameplay mechanics+BGMs- Defintely complimented the game+Difficulty - No Hand holding or puzzle solving cheats. Makes you think HARD(which can hurt some people). :D Cons:- The Achievements: THEY SHOULD HAVE NAMED IT SUPER SECRETS.YOU CANNOT GET ALL OF THEM WITHOUT A GUIDE.I bought in a sale, never expected to invest so many hours into it.Definitely Recommend this Game. Rarely does a game challenge the aspects of self realisation.9/10. "

												Although it looks like a platformer, The Swapper is really a puzzle game at its core. And a fantastic one at that. You play as a survivor in a desolate space station, trying to find a way to escape. In order to do so, you have to solve a series of puzzles that involve creating clones of yourself. Using the ""Swapper"" device, you can create up to 4 clones, each of which duplicates your exact movements. Additionally, you can swap your consciousness to any clones that's within your line of sight (i.e. change the clone controlled by the player). But of course, there's a catch - light. Some rooms contain blue and/or red light. In blue light, clones can't be created, but can be swapped into; and in red light, clones can be created, but can't be swapped into. Put all of these elements together, and it's a mighty fine recipe for some mind-bending puzzles. The game starts off simple enough in order to introduce all of the mechanics, but once you've been taught what you need to know, get ready for a challenge. The level/puzzle design is nothing short of brilliant. You will get stuck at some point, but eventually the solution will click and you'll feel a real sense of accomplishment. There is nothing unfair about any of the challenges you'll face. It just comes down to you, patience, and working out the solutions. One cannot ask more from a puzzle game. Gameplay aside, The Swapper also excels in its presentation. The visuals (comprised of clay models) and music (which is minimal but great) combine to create an amazing atmosphere. Think Metroid by way of Alien, except there are no enemies to fight - only puzzles to solve. If you enjoy cerebral puzzle games, The Swapper is a no-brainer. This is absolutely one of the best games of its kind I have ever played, and that it was created by such a small team is extremely impressive. Check it out.Final grade: A-Technical notes: I played the game right at launch, and apparently there were some issues for a few people running the game. I encountered no problems myself, but you may just want to take a look at the discussion forum first to see if your PC could be affected (for instance I think Intel graphics don't currently work with it). Secondly, in terms of control method, while this may look like the type of game that would benefit from using a controller, I don't think that is the case. From my experience, mouse and keyboard is the most efficient, ideal control method. And finally, as far as gameplay, one thing to keep in mind is that the final 124 Orb door is a ""point of no return"". Once you enter the final area, your saved game will not be able to continue where you left off - only restart from scratch. So if you wish to explore the station to find any secrets or collect all the logs, make sure to to do so before opening the final door.			"

												At first glance the game looks like a nice idea with amateur theatricals developed by a small, inexperienced team. However, believe you me - this game is an outstanding and magnificent masterpiece, which has a consistent, well-thought, well-placed and wonderful aesthetic atmosphere with brilliant innovative mechanics! It is a mysterious cinematic adventure, in which you are the main character, unraveling puzzles with an utmost eagerness to get to the bottom of everything! It is a joyous experience in which everything is put together in unison and the pioneer developers should be proud of this! An absolute MUST!			"

												Being a massive example for a brilliant indie game, The Swapper can make you feel inside a philosophical sci-fi novel and promises a remarkable gaming experience. I think that game is about loneliness, surviving as an undefined being in a limitless universe. In most problems you deal with in the game, no one helps you unless you are not watching a youtube walkthrough, and it grows the feeling of desperation and misery.The only problem with the game is that some puzzles are insanely difficult and you need to focus on them too much to find the solution. Maybe this is normal for games like these, but in the meantime it may cause you break off from the beautiful scenario and highly thoughtful subtext of the game. So you need to keep calm and spend some time and effort to enjoy both sides.A must play.			"

												Pretty good platforming puzzler with an excellent story. While the puzzles are reason enough to get the game, the story is even better.You play as ???. You're in space. You can clone yourself, as long as there's no blue light where you're putting the clone. You can swap with the clone as long as there's no red light blocking your shot to the clone. Purple light acts like red and blue light. That's all of the puzzle mechanics! A perfect example of how you only need a few consistent mechanics to make a good puzzle game.One complaint:  The ending has a single branch. As far as I can tell, this is the only dynamic part of the story. Unfortunately, it seems like you have to play through the whole game twice to see both endings, despite the rest of the game being the same. This kinda' sucks.  "

												I personally hate puzzle games, because I'm not all that smart and I usually end up looking for guides. Don't judge me.The Swapper is a 2-D puzzle game, one of those games where you advance from room to room and try to solve a puzzle, from easy ones, to absolutely head shattering ones. Kinda like Limbo, but a bit more complex and less about lightning reflexes, IMO.But the sense of isolation, the atmosphere, the plot, and all in all, the gameplay of this game is just absolutely mind blowing. It's quite challenging, too, the visuals are gorgeous and there's lots to explore if you want to find the secret achievements, too. If you love puzzle games, this is a MUST buy. If you don't, like me, I'd still recommend it. The overall experience was quite delightful.			"

												When I first was recommended The Swapper, I was skeptical. My friend knows me fairly well, so it wasn't that I didn't think I would like it, but rather, it felt like an expensive game for what it sold itself as. A standard puzzle-platformer with a unique art style. Awesome.But really, the game was much more. The craftsmanship and love are in the details of the atmosphere, from the minute textures on the models, to creepy sound design, to integration of the plot into the mechanics (discovering what The Swapper is). Overall, I would justify a full-price purchase in support of the studio and wanting to see more games like this, though for most people the pure hours logged into this game may not justify the price at anything more than $5. As a mirror to the game itself, a lot is going to depend on your knowledge of ""self"" in whether this game is going to be a good purchase.			"

												The Swapper is a mind bender of the third degree. From the opening scene it never discloses more than it wants to, instead forcing you to largely draw your own conclusions as to what transpires. It's an intelligent and brilliantly executed sci-fi narrative that doesn't bombard you with exposition, or easy explanations, culminating in an ending that left me completely stunned. This is a game that wants to make you think, asking questions of morality and withholding the answers, which in the end are entirely yours to decide.Gameplay is just as smart as the story, and does so without a needlessly large amount of devices or mechanics. The Swapper refers to a device that allows you to create mindless copies of yourself to which you can then transfer, or swap, your consciousness to. With this single tool developer Facepalm Games crafts a relentlessly clever series of puzzles, with solutions that are never unfair or obtuse but at the same time demand meticulous thought and execution. I was continually impressed by how ingenious the puzzles were, leaving me scratching my head only to discover the answer had been staring me in the face. Like Portal the solutions are almost always much harder to come to than actually pulling them off, which is something so few games seem to understand and makes The Swapper that much more notable.Every aspect of the arresting presentation works to construct a deliberately isolated and atmospheric experience. Thick shadows drape over the environment, with subdued lighting illuminating the stunning, hand molded character models only so much as to show the way forward. Sound effects as well as the soundtrack are used only when necessary, ensuring you are never unintentionally pulled out of the incredibly engrossing world, but only drawn deeper in.Right from the start though the four hours it took me to complete it, I couldn't put The Swapper down! It combines an ingenious gameplay mechanic with an enthralling, thought provoking narrative more effectively than we often ever see, and does so without confusing the player or pandering to the lowest common denominator. It's one of the best puzzle platformers I've ever played, easily a top contender for my personal 2013 GOTY, and a must play for any fan of science-fiction and puzzle games in general.			"

-Quick Review-The Swapper is a Puzzle exploration game, the puzzles start out very dynamic and if you play too late at night (like I did just the last two evenings) they can easily become super challenging. As a whole, I really enjoyed playing this game. The story was quite engaging and interesting.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The first thing that happens when you load The Swapper is you type out your name. The reason I say that is because I was never directly referred too throughout the game, it was mostly phrases like “hey you, guy who’s doing all these puzzles, go do this for me, because I’m lazy…but I am a girl and have a British accent so naturally you’ll forgive me.” As you progress through the game you can get more detailed by reading through various logs left throughout the game, however as soon as my screen filled with text I said out loud “too many words!” and skipped and left it. (I sometimes wonder if that’s what people think when they see my reviews…)Game Play: I’m tempted to compare this game to portal, although instead of thinking with portals you’re thinking with clones. So maybe Naruto meets Portal? You need to shadow clone jutsu yourself through different gravity, various colored lights, and on top of pressure plates to solve the puzzles.Achievements: The only achievements for this game were hidden information logs that you need to go searching for. It was nice to play a game that didn’t have me do the same type of achievement the whole game. (I.e. finish the game, kill X amount of things, beat the game perfectly, beat hard mode, and then unlock all the special biscuits.) Price: The Swapper’s standard price is $14.99, I played only 3 hours of the game and beat it. I did need help on three or four puzzles, however even if I just stared at the screen for a few extra hours helplessly lost trying to solve a puzzle, I still wouldn’t have been able to put in more than 10 hours for this game.I ended up purchasing this game in a humble bundle, (or maybe it was 90% off in a Christmas/summer sale, I can’t remember to be honest) while the game play is enjoyable and the controls are solid, the price is much higher then I’d be willing to purchase at full price. Conclusion: The story was good, the game play was dynamic and interesting, the achievements were refreshing, but the price was $5.00 too high, I think this game does deserve a play through, if you enjoy puzzle games to any degree I recommend this game.

												The Swapper may seem as a straightforward and mundane platform game at first, but if you keep at it, the game gets a lot more challenging.Different rooms imply different types of puzzles, each more challenging than the last.Story is mostly kept mysterious. From the opening of the game which seems to have you riding an escape pod onto an abandoned station to the rather dank yet extremely satisfying ending, a true grasp of the plot always seems to be just out of arms length, which actually suits the game extremely well.Accompanying the immersive graphics is a soundtrack that carries you into this environment. It left me feeling a sense of contemplation, macabre and yet at peace. I can only imagine it’s what an astronaut feels when staring down at Earth.""You are every clone, and every clone is you. And yet, every clone is dispensable. By the conclusion, it was impossible to remember which recreation of ""myself"" I was.""  "

												You take control of an amnesiac astronaut (how convenient) who wanders the dark corridors of a deserted space station, trying to make his way to… the end of the game, let's put it this way. His only tool is a device called the ""Swapper"" – a gun with the power to create clones of himself. At its core the game is yet another puzzle platformer. But what makes it stand out is its unique graphic style and its compelling way of telling the story. The story itself is classic B-movie sci-fi (in the best sense of the term, i might add), and it is presented to you in snippets (log entries of crew members, cryptic messages that appear on your screen, slightly distorted voices via an intercom system) which you're meant to piece together as if a puzzle in itself. Then, the art style. Everything in the game had originally been modelled in clay and then scanned and photographed, which gives the world a unique and very distinct look. Add to that decent special effects (a beautiful mix of lights and shadows, subtle screen distortions, and the like) and excellent sound design to complete the experience. Music deserves a special recognition as well, as it is both subdued and hauntingly beautiful, and it is scarcely used, which only adds to the loneliness and melancholy of the place you'll find yourself in. The most fascinating aspect of The Swapper is that the game mechanics perfectly mirror the story's central theme. Let me explain. When creating new clones of yourself, you can swap your consciousness into one of them and become the dominant one – and you will soon ask yourself (if you bother to think) ""Who was the original self?"". Which is just one of the questions that the story throws at you. And it stays true to itself until the very end, just like the mechanics do – you'll never level up or gain upgrades or any of that. As a consequence to its simple nature, it is rather short. Depending on how good you are with the puzzles, you might be able to finish the game in 3–5 hours. But since it never deviates from its premise, it never gets boring. Highly recommended. P.S.: There is a small issue i'm having with this game, and that is its rather silly title. (Imagine Half-Life 2 being called ""The Gravity Gun"". That would've been equally silly.) While technically correct, it is highly unimaginative and does the game a disservice. This minor gripe aside, it is a game that you should definitely pick up and play in a preferrably dark and quiet environment. P.P.S.: You can listen to the soundtrack here[soundcloud.com], but i'd suggest you experience it within the game first.			"

												As soon as I finished this game, I HAD to do a review. It is by FAR one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure to experience. The game starts off showing you, an astronaut being blasted away in a rocket ship. You wake up stranded on a mysterious Space Station, needing to find a way to escape. What's unique about this Puzzle/Platformer game is that it gives you a unique, handheld cloning tool with two utilities. You can make 4 coexistant clones of yourself, and have the ability to swap between the one that you control. These clones help you throughout the game's many different puzzles and makes it a fun and unique experience.The game doesn't look like much from the store page, and I was actually having a difficult time deciding on whether the game was worth playing or not. But let me tell you, I was SO incredibly glad that I did. Get lost (pun intended) in the beautifully vast Space Station Theseus. The storyline of The Swapper will have you addicted, trying to figure out just what happened to Theseus, who you are, and why the heck the rocks can talk. Limbo fans out there will find a few similarities with certain puzzles in The Swapper, which actually helped me to solve puzzles much easier.There are two different ways in which The Swapper can end. Unfortunately, you cannot finish it one way, reload the save and finish it the other way. That's the only downside of The Swapper but I still give it a 10/10. As for the ending, choose the option you feel most strongest with. Everything about the game is brilliant, which is why I would give it a solid 10 and recommend that everybody who likes a puzzle/platformer game give it a go. Keep note though, if you're after achievements, do them before you finish the game, that's the easiest way to get them. I feel I have rattled on too much, but everythin I said applies. You will love this game :)TL;DR The Swapper is fun, mysterious and mind boggling.Have fun creating clones of yourself and swapping between the one you control in order to solve tricky puzzles.If you liked Limbo, you will love The Swapper just as much.

												The Swapper is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer in which you solve puzzles by making clones of yourself. The game has you stranded on a spacestation. Within the game there are many rooms to explore, collecting orbs as you do so. These orbs help you get further in the game. Not that original but it works.  To collect the orbs you have to swap to the clone that is going to be in contact with the orbs. All the clones follow the same movement commands as the main clone. The puzzles mostly consist of rooms where there are special lights where you are unable to spawn a clone, swap to a clone or both. This may sound like a small thing, but the developers really thought about the many ways to use this. From my experience with the puzzles, some are done in the first try others can take a while.Often you will find out you just had to do one small trick to progress. The puzzle difficulty gets harder as you go, sometimes with large steps of difficulty. The last levels were really hard (But that could be down to me having a break from the game for a while).The atmosphere of the game is really well done with the level design, story and sound design all contributing. What made the level design nice was that the whole world was made by using clay and other real objects as background. The world had a nice metroid feel, because you could explore many parts of the world. The only sad thing that later in the game it more felt like going from puzzle room through puzzle room. Happily enough you don't have to solve the puzzles in chronological order even though you still have to finish them all to go to the next area. The only complaint I can give is that some rooms looked the same, due to the dark look. But I guess that also does help with the lost spacestation feel.The story is mostly told through cutscenes and optional reading messages. What is nice about the story is that it asks philosophical questions to make you think. One thing that can be annoying is that there are rocks in the game that when you pass them, your screen gets blurry and text will pop up. This is okay the first time, but becomes annoying after a while, especially if you have to pass by the same rock several times.  Another thing I found annoying was that some cutscenes aren't skippable so you have to watch them again should you die. The game took me around 8 hours to complete and the last critical thing I have to say is that there is not much replay value once completed. There are multiple endings, but no reason to play the game all over again except if you wish to. You may be better off just watching the other ending on youtube. The achievements are pretty unfair in the game. I collected them in my first playthrough using a guide and I often thought 'How could anybody find this!?'There are maybe parts that I am critical about, but they don't hold up in the end with the total experience you get.

												The Swapper stands tall alongside the leaders of the pack of modern sidescrolling puzzlers. Outstanding score, art and sound design come together to create one of the most immersive, fully realised videogame worlds I've experienced in recent memory. The atmosphere is exquisitely dark and suffocating, evoking the emptiness and cosmic decay of an abandoned space station in which the player solves puzzles using an ingenious ""cloning"" gameplay mechanic quite unlike anything I've seen before. Fans of sci-fi, platformers, puzzle games, and videogames as a whole owe it to themselves to play this work of art.			"

												The Swapper is one of the better ideas to come out of the 2D puzzle platformer resurgence indie games have been in for the last four or five years. Its simple set of rules, easy to understand mechanics, and ambient atmosphere are all wound together tightly with a haunting and thought provoking narrative that makes it more than worth your time if you want something that'll intrigue as much as it challenges.The concept may seem intimidating at first, but it's quite easy to grasp. You have a device that lets you spawn four copies of yourself, and you can then hop into any of those clones if the situation permits. Red and Blue light sources are your primary obstacle as they offer varying rules for how clones can and can't be spawned or if they can be hopped to. Once you've come to terms with it, each puzzle begins to feel immediately rewarding, and the difficulty curve slides up pretty decently, leading up to bigger, more confounding solutions and settling things back down with something a tad easier. You never feel too overwhelmed and it's easy to just come back to a puzzle later if you're truly stumped. That said, the back half of the game feels far too packed with puzzles that require literal pixel-perfect precision. The placement of clones and hopping into them goes from generously logic based to two or three pixels meaning the difference between success and failure. Prepare for some end game aggravation and difficulty spikes. In the end though, The Swapper is everything you could want in a modern day puzzle platformer. It's gorgeous and atmospheric, and besides a few missteps near the end, the puzzling will test your noggin to quite a satisfying degree.			"

												This is a great puzzle game. The sci-fi aesthetic is beautifully realised, with the lighting and music combining to heighten the sense of loneliness and wonder of exploration. The puzzles themselves ramp up in difficulty smoothly and require you to think about how you can manipulate the environment in multiple places simultaneously, similar to Braid and Portal. The game has garnered a number of awards and thoroughly deserves them. Highly recommended.			"

The puzzles are pretty clever and the story is quite interesting. And the ending... oh, the ending! Don't be surprised if you complete the game without getting a single achievement.

												I started playing this one just before procuring a short-term office job - one which walks that thin tight-rope between being utterly mindless and requiring just that teeny weeny bit of mental concentration - and I'm afraid that this game has been a temporary casualty of said event.  In other words I've thrown in the towel for the time being, but most certainly NOT because this isn't a ♥♥♥♥ING EXCELLENT GAME.      See, I'm over 40 now, and despite having not consumed all THAT much alcohol for a human of my years, I still only have so many brain cells to go around...and a large number of them have recently been dedicated to the practices of getting up ridiculously early (like, before MIDDAY, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake), showering and dressing (in more complicated clothes than a pair of shorts and a t-shirt with holes in it), brushing my teeth and hair, spraying on some deodorant, then getting on a bus and doing a six hour shift - that's SIX MOTHER♥♥♥♥IN' HOURS, goddammit - in which I fiddle with reams of paperwork.  So when it comes time to drag my weary♥♥♥♥♥♥home and put on some well-earned games, I'm really not up to anything which requires as monumental a mental effort as this absolute little GEM of a puzzle-platformer.  This game is SMART, yo.  Almost too smart for me at the best of times, and frankly way over my head in its current state of cerebral short-circuit.    So yes, after getting, I dunno, maybe half-way or so through it, I've had to put this game aside for the time being...but believe me when I say I WILL be coming back to it.  Between the ingeniously imaginative clay-built visuals, the cleverly-implemented cloning device your character uses to multiply himself, and the completely logical yet sometimes mind-♥♥♥♥ingly hard puzzles themselves, this game has QUALITY written all over it.  Highly recommended to anyone with an IQ at least slightly above that of a well-bred chimp (which isn't me right at this moment in time, sad to say)... Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												Trapped in the abandoned space station Theseus, you’re left to explore the seemingly empty and dark corridors with nothing but a little device which can be used to clone yourself up to 4 times. The device, while not terribly impressive at first, soon has you traveling vertically, leaving a trail of discarded clones to fall to their death as you transfer your consciousness from one clone to the next in order to get to otherwise impossible to reach locations.You’ll soon realize that your clones are useful tools needed to help you solve the various puzzles in the game. They will jump when you jump, and move in whatever direction you move in. You are almost always required to sacrifice the clones in order to progress to the next section of the game, and the implications of this are tied beautifully into the story. All the puzzles are based around using these clones, be it to press a button at the right time, or standing in strategic positions to swap to, in order to navigate the room.Now this may sound easy, and it is at first, presenting problems which only take a minute or two to figure out, but with the introduction of different colored lights, which prevent certain actions (like creating new clones, or transferring your consciousness though the space the light occupies), the game becomes a lot harder, and by the end you could be staring at your screen for quite a while before coming up with a solution.Some puzzles will be so hard that you may find yourself wondering if the puzzle is even possible to solve at first. This is in large part due to the rarity of puzzles that simply build on the last challenge you just solved, meaning you’ll have to continually think of new ways to use your clones in order to progress.While this may sound frustrating, it is negated by the fact that when you do finally figure out the solution, and grab the Trigon Orbs needed to unlock the next section of the game, it often leads to moments of incredible satisfaction, which is a rare thing these days.The soundtrack doesn’t really stand out in any way, but it fits the game well, and enforces the spooky loneliness of the vast space station you’re exploring, and, while it’s not something I’d want to listen to on its own, it does the job well enough to be mentioned.Overall, this is a game that demands more of its players, and treats them as capable puzzle solvers right from the start. It may not be for everyone, but what the game does, it does incredibly well, and the 4-5 hours gameplay ensures that it doesn’t overstay its welcome.The game is quite innovative, and definitely worth trying, but unless you’re a hardcore puzzle gamer fan, I’d wait for a discount before checking it out.

PresentationWhile it might not be clear at first, The Swapper wants to send a message and then leave you to ask the questions, without ever telling you the answers to them. Clearly inspired by space odyssey classic films such as Moon or Solaris, The Swapper puts you in the role of a stranded spaceman seeking a way out of a space station that is undeniably doomed, but bumping into different stories, messages and characters on the way out, and giving you access to the swapper, a weapon designed to create up to four different clones of yourself and allowing you to swap between them. Once that becomes a regular thing, the game pushes ideas such as what happens to the clones that you leave behind or is swapping souls really a reality, planting them in your head so you can start and ask your own questions about mortality and existence and go deeper with the story it wants to tell based on what you are seeking after processing those things through your head on your own. Even with all the messages left behind and the information you get from other survivors or the mysterious rocks, in the end you will still have unanswered questions, but that is part of the mystery, something that might instantly make a sequel something worth looking into in the future. There is no restriction on where to go and what to do, as each puzzle area solved will reward you with a number of orbs that you will later use to perform a certain action and open up a new area, but the order in which you obtain those orbs and where you want to go next is entirely up to you. On the other hand, exploring other areas of the game wishing that you could uncover more things can leave you disappointed as even with all the movement liberty, the game follows a linear pattern and your only concern is getting the amount of orbs shown about the console in order to make your way to the next area and progress the story, and most areas which are not part of a puzzle portion lack the secondary events to make them worth exploring.Rating: 9GameplayWhat makes The Swapper a unique game to play is the weapon that gives the game's title, allowing you to create up to four different clones of yourself, reproducing all your movements and allowing you to swap between them. Standing in your way are three different light beams, starting with the red beam that allows you to create clones inside it, but blocks the ability to swap to other clones if the swapper's trajectory goes through that beam, the blue beam that acts exactly the opposite and the purple beam that has both of the downsides. Combining the use of those beams with typical platforming elements such as gaps between platforms or switches results in unique puzzles that feel refreshing, but at the same time intuitive, making practice and trying out different approaches the key to succeeding. Even though you will mostly use your abilities inside the puzzle sections which are always marked on your map, making your way from one chamber to the next one is a challenge all by itself, as you will often have obstacles in your way or be forced to use the reverse gravity portal to reach the other end of the room. The best thing about the Swapper's gameplay however, is that it never feels old or repetitive as it constantly introduces new elements and making puzzles more challenging, but putting the knowledge your earn throughout the game to good use, they still feel clever and intuitive. As refreshing as the puzzles are, there are some concepts such as the zero gravity sections that feel left behind, as there are no puzzles utilizing that concept and the only portion of the game where the idea was used was when you had to move to the other end of the station in order to advance the game. Messages are also an important part of what The Swapper wants to achieve as they will detail the plot further as well as provide hints to help you complete puzzles easier and use the game's mechanics in a better way.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThis game is merely beautiful, and even though the entire story takes place in and around a space station, the environment is crafted in such a way to make each chamber feel unique and a significant part of the same set of rooms. The design feels monotone, but in this case that only contributes to the overall feeling of being stranded in space, desperately looking for the way out, only to find yourself in another chamber that looks different and at the same time astonishingly beautiful, but putting your skills to the test once more.Rating: 9.5AudioAs good as it looks, The Swapper knows exactly the way it wants to make you feel by adding thrilling tunes in the background and changing the tone whenever something significant happens. Apart from the few characters that you will encounter during your journey there is little dialogue, but you will find console messages left behind wherever you go and rocks that will leave you messages that go deeper into the story, but unfortunately those are not voiced over, which is disappointing considering the bigger impact a godly rock leaving you messages could have on the lonely ambient.Rating: 8.5ExtrasIt takes around 6 hours to get through the game's campaign, maybe another extra hour if some puzzles give you a hard time, and even though the ending is more than worth the journey, there is nothing else waiting for you afterwards. There is an alternate ending however, which can only be seen if you replay the entire campaign and take a different choice at the end, but considering the fact that you already know how to solve each puzzle, you'll probably question yourself if a second playthrough is really worth it when you can just look for the alternate ending online.Rating: 6VerdictThe Swapper is truly one of a kind experience, and while it comes with its few flaws and ideas not reaching the peek they could have, for the price tag it comes with, it is more than worth the purchase, especially if you're into platformers and looking for something fresh to bring you back into the game.Rating Overall: 8.3 Check out the full review and a lot more about The Swapper at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=266[/h1] "

In a genre so awash with titles that try way too hard to be innovative and not hard enough to actually be a good game, it's refreshing to see a game with genuinely unique gameplay that's genuinely fun to play at its core.It's short, and the plot isn't all that interesting, but the puzzles are great, swapping is simple but has a wide bredth of uses, and looks gorgeous.

The whole environment, felt truly spooky and times, because most of the game you were alone and when passing ""the watchers"" they were always saying that your time is about to come or that you will soon die, which made the game really good.The graphics were wonderous, thanks to the amazing lighting and 3D effect that the game had, though the game itself was in 2D, but the foreground and background gave the impression of a 3D game.I recommend this game with my whole heart.

												The Swapper is a game about philosophy of mind, staring Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers discussion over the question of whether consciousness can exist independently of the brain.The Swapper presents a philosophical discussion piece by piece, while you solve puzzles by swapping your mind to other vessels, your clones. It makes you ask: What is a mind? Who am I? How do I know I'm not a clone that has my memory?This game is classified as a puzzle-platformer, but does not require such skills. The theme is space science fiction. strange rocks were discovered on a distant planet. When examined, they showed an electro-chemical activity. Some speculate that they may be living, and that they communicate with each other. You can even hear their thinking. In fact, they are one mind, trying to understand the human mind. If you pay attention to the story, you will question the nature of the human mind too.It is a delightful experience from the beginning to the end. The fact that it is made out of clay, like The Neverhood and The Dream Machine, is a very nice touch too. This is an all-time favorite.Positive points* Philosophical writing made by actual philosophers.* The backgrounds are real.* Challenging puzzles.Negative points* Controls can be a problem.			"

""You can die here or you can do what you have to to go on.""See that above? That's a qoute. From what I thought was going to be an atmospheric puzzle game. But it is not only a brilliant puzzle game. It's one of the best stories ever written for a video game. And one of best sci-fi stories I've ever experienced. It's started off as a simple indie game and then took me on one hell of an emotional ride, right until the very ending. Apart from a few puzzles that I thought had a bit forced solution, this game almost never disappoints and always suprises.			"

												The Swapper is a rather simple puzzle platformer with an interesting gameplay: you are equipped with a unique weapon which allows you to create clones of yourself and swap with them. Confusing? I just may lack words to actually describe it correctly, but it really is a simple concept and will take you no more than 2 minutes to get used to what you need to do.There's no one to kill in this game, there are no quick movements (mostly) so that kind of skill is far from needed. What you really need is a brain and some patience in order to complete this game. Mind you, it's not really a brain-killer as most puzzles are really easy to complete. Sometimes all you need is a two minute break to rest a bit and it will all come to you.Anyway, what's it about? You are an astronaut on a Space Station Theseus and there's been an accident. You are trying to escape as well as find out what actually happened there. In order to progress you need to open certain doors and each door requires you to own a certain number of orbs. Orbs can be collected by solving puzzles. To solve puzzles you need to create clones of yourself (and swap places with your own clones, as I said before). These clones will do exactly the same movements and actions as yourself and you will need to use them to open doors, step on certain spots etc.As I said, the game is incredibly simple in its mechanics, but is challenging enough to keep you playing it for 5 or 6 hours until the very end. I really enjoyed the time spent on this and I managed to get stuck only once! And it was only because I didn't notice one floor tile (it was upside down and I guess I was just too tired). The real challenges come up at later stages as you get into rooms where you know exactly what you need to do - but you need to figure HOW to do it.One real good feature are teleporters that will allow you to move quickly if you ever need to go back to some room (if you missed something or took a left turn and now you want to go right). I just love it when developers think about us players and our need to cut down the lost time :)There are 10 achievements in the game as well and they are real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Not because they are too hard to get or are luck based... No, it's because they require you to find 10 hidden rooms and to do that you would need to randomly clone and swap yourself into hidden walls and corridors. Most of the time such corridors are too well hidden and you'd do better if you ignore that part of the game completely. Unless you read a guide or watch YouTube videos to find out their locations.Overall, The Swapper is a beautiful and entertaining indie game that will leave you asking for more. As for the actual story that develops as you progress - I leave that to you. It's a bit confusing... and unimportant, to be honest. Enjoy it while it lasts.			"

												A nice puzzle-platform (no shooting, no time to beat) where puzzles are based on your ability to create and control clones of yourself. Storyline is OK, graphics are nice and controls are very good. Mechanics of cloning may resemble Cloning Clyde but works in a different way:- Clones are not created beside you, instead you aim your one-of-a-kind gun and ""shoot"" to create them on the place you want (must have line of sight);- Number of clones is always limited to 4 (you need to delete clones to be able to create other clones on other places);- All clones mimick your moves, so you control everybody at the same time (some puzzles are based on this);- If a clone dies, there's no problem, but if you die, you'll return to the last checkpoint;- You can ""shoot"" at a clone to ""transfer you soul"" to that clone, so that the body you were becomes a clone and the clone you shot becomes you;- Time slows down when you're aiming to create a new clone, which is very useful. If you're falling from a high place to certain death, you can slow down time, create a new clone on the ground and transfer your soul to it before you hit the ground thus avoiding death, or you can ""climb"" through the air by creating clones above in the air, transfering your soul to it and quickly creating another clone even higher, soul tranfering again, repeat);- There are some plates that invert gravity only for those who stepped on it, so that you'll sometimes have clones walking on the ground and others on the roof at the same time (again, some puzzles demand this);The game may be a bit short, but mostly enjoyable. Two possible endings (decided on the last scene), so save often to see both without need to play all over again.Recommended.			"

												It's like playing a literally hand-crafted Super Metroid (very often the designs approach 1:1) with enemies swapped for puzzles that stand shoulder to shoulder with Portal. The story, written by one of the minds behind Penumbra, is just as equally well crafted as the gameplay. If the sentence ""Super Metroid  with a unique puzzle twist and a well written space-horror plot."" even remotely perks your interest get The Swapper.			"

												What an incredible experience this turned out to be. Incorporating the game mechanic into the story, which is brilliant and puts you in a state in which you are questioning and thinking about everything about humanity from moral to existence. The puzzles are the core to the gameplay and they are great. They are inovative and very well designed, that I didn't felt overwhelmed or like I'm visiting the same puzzle again. The atmosphere is a winner here, which is created by the gorgeous minimalistic visuals and score. The score in the last scene is haunting and beautiful. It's a must play!			"

												A suprisingly awesome little game. Has a very dark and desolate atmosphere to it similar to Limbo albeit in space. The puzzle are an interesting blend of mind-bending and reality disortion. The graphics are of higher quality than I expected from screenshots and trailers. It has a strange isolated feeling beauty to it. Sound design is also quite good however much of it consists of ominous unsettling sounds. All in all I was really impressed with what I have played of the game so far and hope to trudge through to its completion shortly.8/10			"

												This is an excellent puzzle/platformer with a gorgeous, eerie artstyle and story. The mechanics are simple and presented in a lovely, organic way  that gives the player a real sense of accomplishment as s/he learns to use each new skill to solve the latest tricky problem. I got a simliar kind of brilliant discovery from working through this game as I did playing Portal through for the first time. You are given the pieces, but the game play is subtle enough that you don't feel like you are being spoon-fed the solutions. It takes some brainwork to sort things out, so the challenge is real, especially in the later levels, and the eureka moments sometimes had me feeling like a puzzle solving badass. Beautfully designed and structured. Highly recommended for puzzle-platformer junkies. Well worth the small price, especially if you grab it on sale.			"

												This is a really good platformer.   The puzzles are unique, the game has challenge and keeps your interest.  The graphics and environment set well for the games atomosphere.   I'm enjoying this game immensly, it's different, it's intriguing and it keeps your mind thinking on how to solve puzzles.   I like how it uses color and beams to determine what functions your character can use.    The type of beams determine what you can and cannot do if your character crosses them.   You can create duplicates of yourself as part of the puzzle solving process and it's required.    The game leads you into the abilities of your character so it doesn't seem as if ""poof"" you can do these neat abilities it was a gradual process of instruduction being able to create mujltiple entities of yourself and swap with them to solve a puzzle.   I didn't find any bugs either.    If your looking for constant action packed excitement don't look here this one is for those who enjoy a unique twist to puzzle solving and does very well at it.   IF you like puzzle solving which is very rewarding look no futher this one will keep your attention for many hours and get you hooked and become a Swapper fan.  I look forward to seeing additional Swapper titles as this type of game can go really far and the story is great.     I hope the developer makes more I can't wait to see what they can do by expanding a very impressive concept.   There's nothing like it pick this gem up.Disclaimer:  Although it says 1 hour on record this appears to be incorrect.  Many hours have been played so this is somewhat confusing as the game time is wrong.   I have indeed played it for more than 3 hours and intend to do more until I reach the end.			"

												The Swapper's core game mechanics are bizarre but straightforward, and you learn most of the tricks very early. The game is clearly delineated into a nonlinear collection of puzzle rooms, but the pacing is managed well by filler sections that advance the plot and showcase the game's gorgeous atmosphere. The actual puzzles are elegant and each very short, which helps with the pacing. The game's story is cerebral and complements the atmospherics nicely while tying everything together. Overall, it's a short but well-put-together puzzler that will leave you thinking.			"

												The Swapper is an excellent 2D platform puzzler which involves two primary mechanics - cloning your character, and swapping between those clones to determine which is the primary one. Using these abilities, you solve individual puzzles to progress in the game and find out the story.Mechanically, the game is solid although there's not much to talk about beyond the basics - it's used well, but there's no specific scenarios which stand out and make me think of as being particularly creative. Where the game truly shines is how those mechanics tie into the story of the game. Anyone going into this game should be aware that the story borders on psychological horror - it's dark, and can be cerebral, so it may not be the best for younger players.Highly recommended.			"

PresentationWhile it might not be clear at first, The Swapper wants to send a message and then leave you to ask the questions, without ever telling you the answers to them. Clearly inspired by space odyssey classic films such as Moon or Solaris, The Swapper puts you in the role of a stranded spaceman seeking a way out of a space station that is undeniably doomed, but bumping into different stories, messages and characters on the way out, and giving you access to the swapper, a weapon designed to create up to four different clones of yourself and allowing you to swap between them. Once that becomes a regular thing, the game pushes ideas such as what happens to the clones that you leave behind or is swapping souls really a reality, planting them in your head so you can start and ask your own questions about mortality and existence and go deeper with the story it wants to tell based on what you are seeking after processing those things through your head on your own. Even with all the messages left behind and the information you get from other survivors or the mysterious rocks, in the end you will still have unanswered questions, but that is part of the mystery, something that might instantly make a sequel something worth looking into in the future. There is no restriction on where to go and what to do, as each puzzle area solved will reward you with a number of orbs that you will later use to perform a certain action and open up a new area, but the order in which you obtain those orbs and where you want to go next is entirely up to you. On the other hand, exploring other areas of the game wishing that you could uncover more things can leave you disappointed as even with all the movement liberty, the game follows a linear pattern and your only concern is getting the amount of orbs shown about the console in order to make your way to the next area and progress the story, and most areas which are not part of a puzzle portion lack the secondary events to make them worth exploring.Rating: 9GameplayWhat makes The Swapper a unique game to play is the weapon that gives the game's title, allowing you to create up to four different clones of yourself, reproducing all your movements and allowing you to swap between them. Standing in your way are three different light beams, starting with the red beam that allows you to create clones inside it, but blocks the ability to swap to other clones if the swapper's trajectory goes through that beam, the blue beam that acts exactly the opposite and the purple beam that has both of the downsides. Combining the use of those beams with typical platforming elements such as gaps between platforms or switches results in unique puzzles that feel refreshing, but at the same time intuitive, making practice and trying out different approaches the key to succeeding. Even though you will mostly use your abilities inside the puzzle sections which are always marked on your map, making your way from one chamber to the next one is a challenge all by itself, as you will often have obstacles in your way or be forced to use the reverse gravity portal to reach the other end of the room. The best thing about the Swapper's gameplay however, is that it never feels old or repetitive as it constantly introduces new elements and making puzzles more challenging, but putting the knowledge your earn throughout the game to good use, they still feel clever and intuitive. As refreshing as the puzzles are, there are some concepts such as the zero gravity sections that feel left behind, as there are no puzzles utilizing that concept and the only portion of the game where the idea was used was when you had to move to the other end of the station in order to advance the game. Messages are also an important part of what The Swapper wants to achieve as they will detail the plot further as well as provide hints to help you complete puzzles easier and use the game's mechanics in a better way.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThis game is merely beautiful, and even though the entire story takes place in and around a space station, the environment is crafted in such a way to make each chamber feel unique and a significant part of the same set of rooms. The design feels monotone, but in this case that only contributes to the overall feeling of being stranded in space, desperately looking for the way out, only to find yourself in another chamber that looks different and at the same time astonishingly beautiful, but putting your skills to the test once more.Rating: 9.5AudioAs good as it looks, The Swapper knows exactly the way it wants to make you feel by adding thrilling tunes in the background and changing the tone whenever something significant happens. Apart from the few characters that you will encounter during your journey there is little dialogue, but you will find console messages left behind wherever you go and rocks that will leave you messages that go deeper into the story, but unfortunately those are not voiced over, which is disappointing considering the bigger impact a godly rock leaving you messages could have on the lonely ambient.Rating: 8.5ExtrasIt takes around 6 hours to get through the game's campaign, maybe another extra hour if some puzzles give you a hard time, and even though the ending is more than worth the journey, there is nothing else waiting for you afterwards. There is an alternate ending however, which can only be seen if you replay the entire campaign and take a different choice at the end, but considering the fact that you already know how to solve each puzzle, you'll probably question yourself if a second playthrough is really worth it when you can just look for the alternate ending online.Rating: 6VerdictThe Swapper is truly one of a kind experience, and while it comes with its few flaws and ideas not reaching the peek they could have, for the price tag it comes with, it is more than worth the purchase, especially if you're into platformers and looking for something fresh to bring you back into the game.Rating Overall: 8.3 Check out the full review and a lot more about The Swapper at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=266[/h1] "

												What an incredible experience this turned out to be. Incorporating the game mechanic into the story, which is brilliant and puts you in a state in which you are questioning and thinking about everything about humanity from moral to existence. The puzzles are the core to the gameplay and they are great. They are inovative and very well designed, that I didn't felt overwhelmed or like I'm visiting the same puzzle again. The atmosphere is a winner here, which is created by the gorgeous minimalistic visuals and score. The score in the last scene is haunting and beautiful. It's a must play!			"

""You can die here or you can do what you have to to go on.""See that above? That's a qoute. From what I thought was going to be an atmospheric puzzle game. But it is not only a brilliant puzzle game. It's one of the best stories ever written for a video game. And one of best sci-fi stories I've ever experienced. It's started off as a simple indie game and then took me on one hell of an emotional ride, right until the very ending. Apart from a few puzzles that I thought had a bit forced solution, this game almost never disappoints and always suprises.			"

												The Swapper is a game about philosophy of mind, staring Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers discussion over the question of whether consciousness can exist independently of the brain.The Swapper presents a philosophical discussion piece by piece, while you solve puzzles by swapping your mind to other vessels, your clones. It makes you ask: What is a mind? Who am I? How do I know I'm not a clone that has my memory?This game is classified as a puzzle-platformer, but does not require such skills. The theme is space science fiction. strange rocks were discovered on a distant planet. When examined, they showed an electro-chemical activity. Some speculate that they may be living, and that they communicate with each other. You can even hear their thinking. In fact, they are one mind, trying to understand the human mind. If you pay attention to the story, you will question the nature of the human mind too.It is a delightful experience from the beginning to the end. The fact that it is made out of clay, like The Neverhood and The Dream Machine, is a very nice touch too. This is an all-time favorite.Positive points* Philosophical writing made by actual philosophers.* The backgrounds are real.* Challenging puzzles.Negative points* Controls can be a problem.			"

PresentationWhile it might not be clear at first, The Swapper wants to send a message and then leave you to ask the questions, without ever telling you the answers to them. Clearly inspired by space odyssey classic films such as Moon or Solaris, The Swapper puts you in the role of a stranded spaceman seeking a way out of a space station that is undeniably doomed, but bumping into different stories, messages and characters on the way out, and giving you access to the swapper, a weapon designed to create up to four different clones of yourself and allowing you to swap between them. Once that becomes a regular thing, the game pushes ideas such as what happens to the clones that you leave behind or is swapping souls really a reality, planting them in your head so you can start and ask your own questions about mortality and existence and go deeper with the story it wants to tell based on what you are seeking after processing those things through your head on your own. Even with all the messages left behind and the information you get from other survivors or the mysterious rocks, in the end you will still have unanswered questions, but that is part of the mystery, something that might instantly make a sequel something worth looking into in the future. There is no restriction on where to go and what to do, as each puzzle area solved will reward you with a number of orbs that you will later use to perform a certain action and open up a new area, but the order in which you obtain those orbs and where you want to go next is entirely up to you. On the other hand, exploring other areas of the game wishing that you could uncover more things can leave you disappointed as even with all the movement liberty, the game follows a linear pattern and your only concern is getting the amount of orbs shown about the console in order to make your way to the next area and progress the story, and most areas which are not part of a puzzle portion lack the secondary events to make them worth exploring.Rating: 9GameplayWhat makes The Swapper a unique game to play is the weapon that gives the game's title, allowing you to create up to four different clones of yourself, reproducing all your movements and allowing you to swap between them.

												The Swapper is a rather simple puzzle platformer with an interesting gameplay: you are equipped with a unique weapon which allows you to create clones of yourself and swap with them. Confusing? I just may lack words to actually describe it correctly, but it really is a simple concept and will take you no more than 2 minutes to get used to what you need to do.There's no one to kill in this game, there are no quick movements (mostly) so that kind of skill is far from needed. What you really need is a brain and some patience in order to complete this game. Mind you, it's not really a brain-killer as most puzzles are really easy to complete. Sometimes all you need is a two minute break to rest a bit and it will all come to you.Anyway, what's it about? You are an astronaut on a Space Station Theseus and there's been an accident. You are trying to escape as well as find out what actually happened there. In order to progress you need to open certain doors and each door requires you to own a certain number of orbs. Orbs can be collected by solving puzzles. To solve puzzles you need to create clones of yourself (and swap places with your own clones, as I said before). These clones will do exactly the same movements and actions as yourself and you will need to use them to open doors, step on certain spots etc.As I said, the game is incredibly simple in its mechanics, but is challenging enough to keep you playing it for 5 or 6 hours until the very end. I really enjoyed the time spent on this and I managed to get stuck only once! And it was only because I didn't notice one floor tile (it was upside down and I guess I was just too tired). The real challenges come up at later stages as you get into rooms where you know exactly what you need to do - but you need to figure HOW to do it.One real good feature are teleporters that will allow you to move quickly if you ever need to go back to some room (if you missed something or took a left turn and now you want to go right). I just love it when developers think about us players and our need to cut down the lost time :)There are 10 achievements in the game as well and they are real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Not because they are too hard to get or are luck based... No, it's because they require you to find 10 hidden rooms and to do that you would need to randomly clone and swap yourself into hidden walls and corridors. Most of the time such corridors are too well hidden and you'd do better if you ignore that part of the game completely. Unless you read a guide or watch YouTube videos to find out their locations.Overall, The Swapper is a beautiful and entertaining indie game that will leave you asking for more. As for the actual story that develops as you progress - I leave that to you. It's a bit confusing... and unimportant, to be honest. Enjoy it while it lasts.			"

												One of the best platformers of the last few years. Beautiful, haunting, deals with concepts beyond the reach of most games and does them justice. A great story with compelling themes, despite it's almost minimalist presentation, and gameplay that is challenging without being unfair or frustrating, leaving you feeling like you've accomplished something each time you finish a particularly difficult challenge. About the only slight I could make against it is that it does not invite repeat playthroughs, at least straight away, still well worth the money and a gaming experience every lover of platformers should try.

												Great puzzle-platformer. It's basically a cross between Portal and Metroidvania games with some very challenging puzzles to solve. But what absolutely sells this game is the aesthetic and atmosphere. It's a game where all the assets are hand-made, mostly of clay and it looks just gorgeous, along with the great environment and lighting effects. I think however that $15 is a bit much for 4.5 hours, and I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed so I assume people have beaten it quicker than me. And it doesn't really provide any replay value. Granted, I paid about $0.50 for it when I bought the Humble Bundle and for that it's absolutely amazing, but I'd say wait for a sale. Much of the puzzle design is in line with what you can find on the better flash games on newgrounds, but the atmosphere is well worth a purchase. "

												Another brain twisting 2D puzzle game that deserve to be bought and played. This time we have a proper science-fiction story that will make you want to find out what's going on on the planet and a very unique graphic design created using clay models (very interesting!).Most of the puzzles aren't that hard to solve if you are skilled with ""clones based games"", like World 5 of BRAID or P.B. Winterbottom,  but around the middle part (until the end)  it take more than two or three tries to solve it because you have to deal with the upside-down spaces.Great game ... good job team Facepalm Games  ;) "

												About a 7-8 hour game, around the same length (slightly longer) than an average Antichamber playthrough, and it turned out to be a really good game. Puzzles were tricky, but usually solvable fairly quickly until what's supposed to be the final three. The story and narration were engaging and sad and quite well-written in general. Very atmospheric game. No major bugs that I ran into, heck I didn't really run into any minor bugs either.The only gripe with the game are the 10 secret rooms for the achievements, nearly all of them are hidden quite unfairly and seemingly with no clue as to their existence. Throwback to the dumb days of retro platforming when you had to jump against every single wall and ceiling to find hidden stuff. If not for the guides out there anyway!Edit: Oh, that and the ""good"" ending's narration didn't really make as much sense as it could have to me, and it felt like they were reaching for too abstract an idea there.

												A puzzle game with some extremely solutions, sometimes timing and sometimes simply being extremely creative, and some puzzles have multiple solutions. The art is a unique style that is, quite literally, real. Everything in the game that's not an effect was made using clay and other real world objects, from the tin can escape pod to the lava stones and clay forms. It's a stunning effect that I've never seen in another game. The music itself is also extremely appropriate, never getting in the way, and helps set the tone for all the regions of the ship.All in all a wonderful game with good voice acting, an intriguing story and universe, and some really strong messages about what it means to have a soul and to be an individual.

												Let's start by saying that this is a puzzle game, if you didn't know.With that out of the way, if a puzzle game is what you're looking for, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. There are two components in this game: the puzzles and the story that drives you to solve them. Or, if you prefer, the story and the puzzles you have to solve in order to progress in the story. Either way, both story and puzzles hold up their end of the bargain.The story (by Tom Jubert, who was also behind the story in FTL) puts you in a derelict space station with some sentient rocks, a lunatic, dead crew and a gun that allows you to create clones of yourself and transfer your mind onto them if so you choose. The game explores the difficult subject of identity, the ethics of cloning, and what the hell is going on when you transfer your consciousness to one of your clones (John Perry being transfered to his new body in Old Man's War, anybody?). In order to progress in the story you need to hack into some consoles and you'll have to fetch some cryptographic orbs in order to do it. And that's where the puzzles come in.In order to reach the orbs, you need to carry out a number of steps that involve creating clones in specific places in the room and transfer control to them (only the clone you control can get the orbs). This is complicated by regions in space with blue, red and purple light. You cannot create clones in regions with blue light; you cannot transfer control to clones when there's a region with red light between you and the clone; and you can do neither when there's purple light (blue and red at the same time). Moreover, for every step you take, the clones take it too (they mimic your movements). You have to use your clones to activate platforms that switch off lights or open hatches. Later in the game, a new mechanic is included to introduce a bit more variety and complication to the puzzles, and it consists in switches that change the gravity of the room from downwards to upwards and the other way around.I have found the puzzles to be very clever and very satisfying. This is the best I've seen since Braid. I have not found them to be excruciatingly difficult, which is good for me. You are not required to have an outstanding mental performance. We are not talking about being able to plot in your head 100 steps ahead. You just have to ""see"" it. Once you get it, the sequence takes only a handful of steps. I only got seriously stuck in four of the puzzles, and I just solved them by going to sleep. The next day, with a clear head and a different perspective, they all went down in a few minutes. All in all it took me six and a half hours to complete, and I'm dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥for these things.Other than that, I loved the atmosphere. The art and the accompanying music really set the mood perfectly.In short: if you are into puzzle games, this is a must in my opinion. And even if you are not a fan of the genre but want some food for thought every now and then (that is my case actually), I think this is the one you should get next. Unless you have not played Braid. In that case go play Braid NOW and then come back to this one.			"

												Wow. Just, wow. I just finished the Steam indie game 'The Swapper'. Amazing. Deep. Thought-provoking. Questions of nouemenal and phenomenal basis for knowledge, mortality, consciousness and more form the basis of the deep and 'twisty' (???) story of this game. Clearly very Platonic, Neitzschean, Kantian influenced. The 'end' was 'sufficient' and playing through the game itself was the most rewarding part. The atmosphere and aesthetic reminds me of a mix of 'Alien' and 'Dead Space' and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous (iirc, they were all hand-crafted with clay or something). It's a 'pure' puzzle-platformer (no combat) that's really, really fun and addictive and at times *absolutely brain-busting*. Loading times are literally non-existant. Gameplay involves your character finding a device that can create mindless 'clones' of yourself that move exactly as you move. You can transfer your 'consciousness' / 'will' to any of them, given that you have a direct line of sight. Sometimes your previous 'selves' must be sacrificed in order to use the environment and this device to accomplish puzzles and progress in the game. Very interesting and innovative gameplay mechanics, here. Definitely recommend! 9/10, would bang.

Thank you to that awesome person!The storyline is filled with philosophical and psychological fun.The game play was fun as well. None of the puzzles felt repeated except for a minor few. Additionally some of the puzzles got a little difficult and still an even fewer got painfully challenging. And only about 1 or 2 required assistance from YouTube.Music and Graphics are very pleasing as well. No complaints. No glitches in anything either. "

The Swapper is a platform puzzler with a rare sprinkle of immersion. The puzzles are good but almost unnecessary. The atmosphere and art style alone carry the story.

												Think Portal, except instead of portals, you can create up to 4 clones of yourself and switch between them as long as they're in your line of sight and not being blocked by light obstacles.Red lights will let you create clones inside them but not let you swap through them, blue lights will let you swap but not create clones in them, and pink lights deny access to both clone creation and swapping.There's also the changing of the direction of gravity for the clone that steps on gravity panels later in the game.Most puzzles are usually solved relatively quickly and easily, while others can be very tricky and can take quite a while to solve. It's a pretty cool puzzle game and I've never seen anything quite like it, recommended for fans of puzzle games.			"

												Привлечь мое внимание к компьютерной игре довольно просто: нужно лишь пообещать, что она рассказывает о космосе и одиночестве. А можно даже и этого не делать; достаточно поместить на обложку фигурку астронавта. Именно поэтому я купила в свое время на распродаже The Swapper.И вот что я скажу: заброшенные космические станции, археологические раскопки на иных планетах, загадочные артефакты, мозги в банках, клоны, таинственная и выкосившая экипаж напасть, мыслящая неорганика, сомнительные эксперименты, — все это, конечно, «уже было» и еще не раз будет. Из этих переменных можно сложить равно эпический блокбастер и третьесортный хоррор, но нужно обладать недюжинным талантом и прекрасным чувством меры, чтобы буквально на коленке слепить из них — а также из глины (!) — философскую притчу, в которой, как и в космосе, нет ничего лишнего, и все на своих местах.

												About a 7-8 hour game, around the same length (slightly longer) than an average Antichamber playthrough, and it turned out to be a really good game. Puzzles were tricky, but usually solvable fairly quickly until what's supposed to be the final three. The story and narration were engaging and sad and quite well-written in general. Very atmospheric game. No major bugs that I ran into, heck I didn't really run into any minor bugs either.The only gripe with the game are the 10 secret rooms for the achievements, nearly all of them are hidden quite unfairly and seemingly with no clue as to their existence. Throwback to the dumb days of retro platforming when you had to jump against every single wall and ceiling to find hidden stuff. If not for the guides out there anyway!Edit: Oh, that and the ""good"" ending's narration didn't really make as much sense as it could have to me, and it felt like they were reaching for too abstract an idea there.

												True to the Indie ""genre"" (the air quotes are there for a reason), The Swapper is a short but powerful experience - if you have the mental patience to stick with it.The gameplay premise is pretty simple to explain. You have a Swapper that can create a maximum of 4 clones which copy your every move, and allows you to 'swap' with them by shooting them.In your way stand two lights which block clone placement or swapping rays, and at times are found combined. Adding in hold-buttons that switch some of these lights or a blocking stone slide, we also have a gravity mechanic that uses gravity 'pads' to change your vertical gravity and the gravity of your consequently spawned clones.You can easily imagine the complexity of these one-room puzzles, and for the most part it's to this kind of complexity that the puzzles stick to.These puzzles generally do not block your way, but reward you with these 'orbs' where the occasional gate will require you to possess a minimum amount. Gameplay wise, that's all there is to it, and your only enemy is gravity itself, as you don't require too much height to fall fatally.To pass these puzzles, thinking a little outside the box is sufficient, but you don't need to go drastically far. No need to suddenly figure out that your Swapper is an intergalactic drill that explores other dimensions while the Watchers would happen to be you from the Future...A little thinking beyond the obvious first impression, maybe the rare few feats of speedy thinking (the button to place clones slows time down when held) but in general it's all about figuring out the right order to do things. Trial and Error has helped me through most of the puzzles.Storywise... It's hard to say anything without spoiling a whole bunch.Not including the rare few 'cutscenes' from the same side-scrolling perspective, there are three main sources of story in this game. You have Data Terminals which provide some context on the 'missing' crew's experience before and during the main events of the story in shape of reports and written short conversations (presumably 'chats') ; the 'Watchers' in shape of strange boulders that distort your screen and show a few short words ; and speech of the rare occasional NPC walking by at a close but for-now unreachable location.All in all, this was a 5-hour trip and has brought up some interesting questions around the identity of 'self' or what we call the 'soul'. Whether it actually answers these... not so much.An interesting experience, perhaps best purchased at a slightly cheaper price or, like myself, in a Humble Indie Bundle.			"

Game play is about 10 hours total which is just right for a puzzle game.  Highly recommend this one when it is on sale.

												The ""artsy atmospheric indie puzzle platformer with a gimmicky artstyle"" is the increasingly stale and crowded sub-sub-sub-subgenre that nobody wants to criticize. After the admittedly great Braid and Limbo, it seemed like any dev could throw together one of these games and automatically get praised for their ""originality."" The Swapper is the first of these games to be released in a while that is actually pretty exciting. The graphics are gorgeous, the puzzles are ingenious, and the story is an interesting unfolding mystery with a fantastic philisophical premise. And the story really commits. There's no aimless ambiguity or ""look how smart I am"" secret endings like in Braid. The final choice in the game is one of the few where I actually had to sit back for a while and debate what to do. If I had to complain about anything, it would be that the story is mainly told through audio logs just like every single other game in existence made after Bioshock. But this time it actually makes sense in context, so I'll forgive that. Highly recommended. A top 10 game of 2013 that is quite underrated. It may just be the greatest of it's kind			"

												OH GOD BUY THIS GAMEThe puzzles are PERFECT. Difficult, but logical. YOU WILL NEVER NEED A WALKTHROUGH. Each new puzzle is based off previous knowledge, no sudden leaps in difficulty that cause you to get stuck.The story is confusing, but has a very satisfying ending. The themes of the story are fascinating and complement the gameplay nicely.The only thing about this game I consider a flaw is the inclusion of secret rooms that are extremely difficult to find. Each one gives you an achievement and a bit of backstory, but unless you use a guide you'll probably never find them. I think it's a shame that an otherwise cohesive, beautifully made game included such an obvious trick to try and make the game seem deeper or keep people playing. It's completely unnecessary.Otherwise though, everything about this game is a fantastic experience. GET IT NOW!			"

												I don't like puzzle games.The Swapper is easily one of my favorite games of 2013.From the beginning, I was enthralled with the game. It has an engrossing claybased art style that manages to be more haunting than anything, a somber, loneliness reinforcing piano soundtrack, and a story that gracefully reveals itself over multiple methods. This isn't even to mention the actual gameplay, which is the kind of smart that makes you wonder how it hasn't been done before. If it has, it certainly wasn't this good.You'll approach a puzzle using your handy Swapper. With it, you can create several clones of yourself that will mimic your movements, and swap which ones body you currently control by simply aiming and firing at them. The ultimate goal of each puzzle is to reach an orb at the end, as these orbs unlock more areas of the derelict spacecraft you are trapped aboard.Like any good puzzle game, The Swapper adds in new mechanics to the toybox as you progress, and these are done so with such graceful pacing that it never feels overwhelming. Difficult, yes, but not overwhelming. Lights of different colors are introduced, with blue lights blocking the ""swap"" effect, while a red light prevents a clone from being placed. Towards the end, gravity starts being played with on top of all of this. It can be a lot to wrap your head around, and I will admit I had to look up a solution or two on YouTube to progress past some of the endgame puzzles.My only issue with The Swapper is it gives a bit of a false impression of freedom of choice. You are able to freely pick and choose which puzzle rooms to enter and complete, as long as you have enough orbs to access that area, and for most of the game, you can get by with the majority of the orbs collected, but not all of them. Then, at the very end of the game, the last terminal you have to activate requires every puzzle to be completed. It was a bit of a bummer to have the story screech to a halt while I backtracked to wrap up three puzzles I hadn't finished.This game is fantastic, and the story alone is worth the price of admission. I'm still thinking about it.			"

												The quick review - LIMBO meets Portal 2 with a dash of Dead Space - combine those games with a stunning soundtrack so crisp you would be forgiven for wanting to climb into your monitor 'Ring' style to experience the atmosphere first hand along with the lone astronaut. * * * * *Want more?  The game is that kind of simple that makes other games like LIMBO charismatic rather than laborious, I won’t forget the first time I played LIMBO and pulled the boat up the shore to reach a higher level, this game captures that nice feel and almost instantly I felt a connection with the person in the space suit.  You have a gun that clones your character up to four time and you use this and a few stylish techniques to navigate the beautiful and uncomplicated surroundings. I’m about 11 hours into the game now and unlike some games I haven’t needed to scan the internet to find the answer to a puzzle; the game explains itself in a simple yet effective way. The computer systems in the game tell a story as well as a former astronaut who we hear in flashback I presume (I haven’t yet completed the game) finally when you pass some of the planets mined rocks they seem to send messages to you as well which brings in the Dead Space element to the game!  Buy this game for your friends in the sale if you want to spend a little less but honestly you won’t regret it and you friends will thank you for it. This is one of those games were you want a t-shirt and comic book series spin off. Roll on the dates where the game is ported to consoles. This game gets five stars from me, for what that’s worth.

												Decent indie puzzler, not an amazing find like Limbo or Braid, not as much variety as Fez, but still worth the asking price. Relatively short, but I didn't mind. Good for one playthrough.Most people rave about the visuals assembled from digitized clay sculpture, but I found the amount of bloom and distortion effects applied to be mildly aggravating, like an almost unnoticed headache.Replayability is nil unless you're an achievement completionist. There's a binary moral choice at the end which requires an entire replay just to see the alternative. No thanks, I'll just watch a replay.the novelty of the swapper mechanic with its challenging puzzles makes up for its faults. The voice acting is good. The story is decent; not as profound as I imagine the creators hoped, but not preachy or pretentious. The music is nice and, if you're like most people who like the visuals, complements the atmosphere.			"

												Only the highest praise I can give to the developers of The Swapper - an atmospheric puzzle/platforming exploration title that delivers an intense solitary experience, where as the protagonist[s] you must uncover the mystery behind the disappearances of Theseus Stations crew members - and the possible recovery of whatever project they were working on.The plot may seem a bit vague at first (such as the withheld information on who your character is, and how/when the story begins), but eventually forms into clearer understanding. The questions that are asked and ""relatively"" answered are: Who, what, when, why, and how? The Swapper is a story of very personal elements, which attempt to invoke self-thought and reflection. The game boasts a fantastic ambient soundtrack, gorgeous claymation visuals, and fluent mechanics. The puzzles you solve are made possible by cloning the player (the clones imitate the precise movement of the original), so careful movement and planning is required. In the end The Swapper is a beautiful, artistic, and stellar creation and is absolutely a must have for any fan of the science fiction genre!			"

												Not actually about a swingers party, but instead based around one core idea... Create up to four clones of a nameless character within single chambers, and while controlling all of them simultaneously, try to position them so they are all standing on the necessary number of pressure pads to gain access to and collect energy orbs as reward for solving the puzzle (and as necessities to power up and open new areas). There are a couple of complications, though. Firstly, your character's consciousness can only inhabit one of these five vessels and is the only one able to create clones while the rest are merely empty mimics, but he/she can ""swap"" their consciousness between any accessible clone at any time. If an ""empty"" clone dies simply create another one, but if the one carrying the consciousness dies then they all do. Secondly, different coloured beams of light impede your abilities, with areas bathe in blue light preventing you from creating clones, and areas in red light preventing you from swapping. It seems like a fairly straightforward idea, yet with this simple premise of multiple clones and swapping, it opens up some really interesting puzzles and play mechanics.The story is kept fairly ambiguous, but centres around an equally ambiguous character aboard a deep space research station, and briefly in its planet based sister station and excavation site around which it orbits. All of which looks stunning thanks to the clay modelling used to create each object and environment, with bleak use of light and sparse music brilliantly conjuring a sense of desolation and foreboding throughout. On and around this planet the crew have discovered large, ancient rocks found to be sentient and begin taking them aboard the station for investigation, unwittingly exposing themselves to the telepathic powers of the rocks which leads to the crew's subsequent madness and eventual death. You are introduced to the game near the end of these events, with your character being jettisoned from the station, seemingly against their will, and setting about trying to return and uncover the mystery of what plagued the crew as well as how to save yourself from it. But this process unravels greater puzzles than you might expect, raising questions of the human mind, body and soul as it explores what all of these mean and especially how the greater impact of your actions tie into these matters. Sacrificing clones is essential to progression, but who are you anymore if you now inhabit a copy of your body while the original has been destroyed... or if this process has been repeated dozens, if not hundreds of times? If the body is so disposable then how are we defined? How can we truly understand ourselves when something so nebulous and so seemingly intangible as the mind and the concept of our consciousness so easily evades our comprehension?Granted, it could easily be argued that these issues of mind swapping and cloning aren't going to be all that practically applicable to us, but it still does an amazing job of making you think, not only about the puzzles, but also about these greater philosophical quandaries that can enlighten us if we're willing to try. Such things seem to be rarities these days, especially in gaming, so I think anything that can make us question more and expand our mental horizons is most definitely worth checking out.			"

												Another short, glib review.I enjoyed it. It was melancholy and approached some philosophical themes that I enjoy.The puzzles were interesting and fun, and amazingly, I didn't have to look up solutions for them to progress. However, some of the hidden logs are deviously well-hidden, on the level of some of Super Metroid's secrets where you may only find them by testing every tile of wall.			"

												I just finished this game and WOW, was it amazing. The puzzles instances were progressively challenging (I had spent 4 nights on one particular instance before I succumbed and looked up a guide) and add new mechanics over time. The puzzle I used a guide for was useful because it introduced me to a mechanic I had not even thought of yet.The atmosphere and soundtrack are both beautiful and fit perfectly with the overall gameplay and story. Although some of the puzzles drove me crazy, there was still a relaxing aspect to playing this game.The story, wow the story and its philosophical elements were given at appropriate moments in a very smooth way. The ending reveal...I had been thinking of something completely different.If you like puzzle platformers with a nice story, this game is for you. I was fortunate enough to get it gifted to me, and I in return passed it along to someone else. Short and sweet, definitely worth the price if you want a nice journey.			"

TLDR:If you enjoy puzzles you'll probably enjoy this game. The story touches some interesting philosophical points, but the delivery isn't good enough to make it stand out.I can't recommend this game at its current price (13.99 EUR). There isn't enough content to justify it. Wait for a sale.Pros:The puzzles were fun. There was a good mix of easier and more challenging ones.The atmosphere was great. The visuals and the soundtrack complemented each other very well to make me feel stranded in space.The story visited some interesting philosophical points.Cons:The puzzles were detached from the story. I went from one to the next to unlock the areas, but that was about it. They didn't contribute to the story in any way. Walking around the ship got a bit tedious after a while.There was very little replayability and I had to complete the game twice to see both endings. My second run felt more like a chore and I would have prefered to be able to finish it once, reload before the ending and see the second ending.The storytelling should have been better. Finishing the game didn't feel very satisfying and the dialogue was often hard to follow (I had trouble telling which of the 3 minds inside the scavanger's body spoke).The current price (13.99 EUR) is too high. The game doesn't offer enough content to justify it. "

												The Swapper is an atmospheric 2D puzzle game which takes place on a mostly-deserted space station.  The puzzles primarily consist of making clones of your character (which jump and move in unison with you) and then “swapping” your current self with one of your clones.  While the story is a bit abstract, the puzzles are expertly crafted and strike the right balance of difficulty and creativity.  In the Swapper, you play an astronaut who is exploring a mostly-empty space station.  It is quickly revealed that the inhabitants of the station found a unique type of rock species which contains a shared conscience.  The rocks are seemingly benign, but as you solve puzzles and make progress deeper into the story, more is revealed on the nature of the rocks and of the researchers.  By the end, Swapper asks a lot of deep questions about conscience, the soul, and existence.  Some of it is genuinely intriguing and thought-provoking, but I would be lying if I said some of it didn’t go a bit over my head.  One thing is for certain: the Swapper absolutely oozes atmosphere.  The vastness and emptiness of the space station which you are exploring is really incredible; a top-notch music soundtrack and the claymation graphics certainly help.   Of course, the puzzles themselves in the Swapper are truly the star of the game.  At the beginning of the game, puzzles are relatively straight-forward but are still interesting and creative.  By the end, more mechanics are introduced and there are some puzzles which I found quite difficult -- one in particular had me walk away for a bit and I literally thought of the solution while taking a shower.  Most importantly, all of the puzzles in the Swapper never feel like they are cheating you; the solution always feels on the tip of your fingers and, once you reach it, is always extremely satisfying.  Anyone who hasn’t played the Swapper and loves puzzle games, especially along the lines of Portal, should absolutely play this game.  The story is interesting (if not a bit confusing), the puzzles are excellent, and it’s all accented with excellent music and graphics.  It’s a short experience, but definitely one worth the price of entry.			"

Although these games are completely different they share the same atmosphere of sincerity as if developers put a part of their soul into the every piece of the game. Maybe I'm fooling myslef, but The Swapper feels very personal like a somebody's revelation. Even if my impression has been thoroughly calculated and assessed by a genious salesman I still want to say ""Thank You"" to people who created this masterpiece.And in the end I feel sad and lonely...Try this game.

												TL;DR: ""Look at all the fun stuff these NPCs are doing. Boy I wish I could be doing some of that.""Basic Gameplay: Walk forward, find a door that needs X Macguffins to open, go do random self-contained puzzles until you have X-many of them, open door, watch another character do something interesting on the other side of a wall, realize they were never introduced, realize you have no context for this place at all, rinse and repeat.The whole ""Clone-n-swap gun"" idea is nice, but either it's not as fun in practice as it looks on paper or they just implemented it poorly. I don't feel like I've ever accomplished anything once I've finished the puzzles, I just sit there doing a group of five or so until the game decides to let me enter a hallway that branches off into harder puzzles.The mysterious beings scattered around are boring as heck, and the only other character that you see is incredibly confusing and yet is your only source of motivation in game. I literally start out having no idea who I am or why I'm here. Am I part of the crew? no, everything indicates that I'm new to this place. Am I some sort of rescue party? Not likely since the one other person who found this place is bringing in an actual rescue party in a day, so nobody knew about this place. Am I an amnesiac? No, that trope would at least be giving me an excuse for having no character and no motivation (and might have some interesting storytelling potential involving the nature of the swapper). And despite all this, I'm being led by the nose by a completely bipolar astronaut who is not doing anything to make this game world easier to understand. Or is it many astronauts? Multiple hard-to-differentiate voices seem to be talking to me during these scenes, and they each have their own name in the subtitles, so maybe there's many of them and I just see one...honestly, this seems like an important thing to clarify early on they are going to be our only contact(s) in the game world. Instead they wait until you've been playing for 2 hours and are thoroughly confused/bored with the game.Anyway, just...just find a different game to play. This one isn't worth the time.			"

												This is a puzzle platformer with a distinct ambient, alone-in-space feeling, that you can play at your own pace. In the game, you clone yourself and swap your consciousness between those clones, in order to get past obstacles and collect orbs. It has a deep plot line (though there are plot holes here or there), with a decision to eventually make. Along the way, there are also some secret rooms you can find if you're skilled enough at platformers to know how to look for them. Also, make sure to read up on the controls before playing. This isn't a spoiler at all, but I'll put it in a spoiler tag just in case:  just hold down the 'make clone' button to slow down time. Seriously. Without this, the game is nearly unplayable, but it may not be clear that holding it down slows down time.As an old fan of Oddworld, I absolutely love this game. The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible, and definitely give you that great 'ah-hah!' feeling when you solve one. As long as you're working the controls correctly, you don't need to be that quick on the keyboard, but you do need to be paying attention during the puzzles to align and time things correctly.The content isn't graphic, though it may contain some slightly disturbing ideas to sensitive folk. Really though, from what I've seen, you could be 10 and play this game, because none of it is any worse than what you'd see in any Star Wars movie. It's on sale right at the time of me writing this review, so give it a try!			"

													I’ve watched myself die countless times in games, but it’s never haunted me like The Swapper has. The hiss of oxygen flushing from my spacesuit fades gently, but the knowledge of this death's necessity - much like many that proceed it - lingers unsettlingly, even if those bodies are just my clones. Moments ago, they were me.	The Swapper brilliantly explores mortality and identity through its tense story, refined puzzles, and awe-inspiring atmosphere. Every aspect of the game is carefully crafted to plunge you into the grim desperation of a deep-space operation gone wrong. First cast in clay, the game’s environments hold a dark beauty, finely detailed and deeply chilling. The soundtrack is a true piece of art unto itself, weaving heartwrenching piano and umbral ambiance into one of The Swapper’s stronger assets.	Though the game divides story progression and most of the puzzles, they are still thoroughly entwined with the game’s themes. The game clocks in at just around six hours, which allows each puzzle to be unique and memorable, and sticks the landing with an unforgettable ending that had me paralyzed. 	The Swapper is made up of a number of expertly crafted elements that come together to form a thoughtful, captivating experience that doesn’t outstay its welcome. I almost regret buying it on sale - it’s worth every penny of the full price.			"

												Absolutely stunning game on every level. The atmosphere created by combining unique hand drawn backgrounds with a clever ambient music score is totally absorbing. The puzzles themselves had a brilliant organic learning curve that had me playing for hours- something I NEVER do with puzzle games. Being genuinely intrigued as to what new skills or thinking would come about in the next section spurred me through a well executed story, which rewards lateral thinking in a way that most games overdo to the point of cliche, or mess up entirely. If you enjoy puzzle games this buy is a no brainer, but i would highly recommend anyone into sci-fi check it out. Without a doubt the best puzzle game I have touched. This is what indie game producing is all about imo.			"

												+Fantastic sound design.+Wonderfully stylized presentation.+Polished graphics.+Iterative innovation on proven game-play concepts.+Mind-bending puzzles.-Too short.-Story misses a few minor beats.The Swapper has quickly become a favored indie title of mine, surpassing top-notch titles like Fez and Braid. I am subjectively biased by the more serious tone and sci-fi setting though. The story is light, but engaging. The derelict space-station setting provides a miraculously haunting atmosphere. Characters are voiced adequately, though the performances border on becoming too withdrawn (which is part of the story/setting, but felt extreme at times). Very short, though still quite fulfilling. If most plot driven titles are novels, then The Swapper is ultimately a great poem; metered, personal, and interpretive. A beautifully sad journey and a striking metaphor for real human struggles with individuality.Comparable games: Braid, Super Metroid, Portal			"

												The Swapper is a great puzzle platforming game. The player is equipped with a device called the swapper, hence the game name. The device allows a person to create up to four clones at a time and can swap to control any of them. The puzzle revolves around these two core elements as you gain no additional abilities when the game progesses. However, new puzzle elements are added to keep you scratching heads. There is no narrator to tells you what the story is about. All that you have is gathered from space rocks and memory logs that tells you about the past. Throughout the game, it constantly portrays the questions about life and whether you are ready to sacrifice your humanity for survival. In the end, I  swapped myself with another person to survive. The negative part about this game is the length which is considerably short, depending on how good you are with puzzle games. The hidden rooms which nets you steam achievement are literally impossible to find unless referring to a guide. It gives you no clue on how to get there. It just goes, hey I want a room in a dark spot above this wall. Other than that, The Swapper is an amazing experience.9/10			"

Definitely one of the best indie games I've played, and is probably somewhere on my top ten. I haven't finished yet, but it seems like the story is leading up to a pretty epic ending as well. The game will haunt you as puzzles require you to kill off your seemingly mindless clones. The journal logs ask that very important question. Are they actually people? I still don't really know because I haven't beaten it, but I get chills everytime I hear a clone body hit the floor and replenish my clone stock. If you like games that really make you think, this one's for you, not to mention the beautiful visual style.			"

												While deep philosphy in interactive entertainment is slowly becoming more commonplace, it's still an extremely rare occurance when majorly heady concepts  and themes are presented maturely, clearly, and accessible yet neither are hamfisted nor under-explored.  The Swapper immediately assumes you are an intelligent person and presents your mind a smorgasbord to feast upon.  At it's core The Swapper is a 2D puzzle platformer that uses a simple yet powerful gimmick to challenge the problem solving part of your brain.  You get a device called 'the swapper' and it allows you to create up to 4 clones of yourself which mimic each move you do.  You then can swap direct control between any which one in firing range and then chip away at some masterfully designed puzzles which remain challenging but never frustrating.  The narrative of the game is best left for discovery, but I will say it will please anyone with an affinity for sci-fi short stories.  The questions that askes you will have you long pondering its themes long after you take a break or finish the game.  And its themes are multifaceted and varied and I can easily see myself diving in for seconds and thirds.Visually The Swapper is outstanding.  The vast majority of the visuals were crafted from clay and household items and work to give it a real organic feel.  Paired with a ambient sountrack that floats between giving sensations of isolation to painting portraits of beauty, they work in tandem to create an atmosphere that completely captivates you in the game world.If you happen to be one of those psudo-intellectuals such as myself and enjoy chewing deep and philosphical questions and happen to love games as well, The Swapper is an experience well worth your time and money.  I can't speak highly enough of it.			"

The whole idea of the game isn't bad, but some puzzles are real trash which has nothing to do with logic but ""try and find"" and ""be lucky"" tactics - this sucks! The plot, gameplay etc isn't bad, but still I was expecting smth more of a Deadlight. But once again - the ""good luck"" puzzles kill all the fun, and the game made me more angry than happy, that's why 5 out of 10.PS. Final puzzle is damn glitchy! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!PPS.

												The Swapper is a great 2D puzzle platformer game that reminds me a lot of Portal in terms of its mechanics and level design. The game requires you to create clones of yourself and swap from one to another. The creators of this game have made a huge variety of puzzles with a very small set of mechanics. Some of the puzzles really make you think and force you to get better at using the swapping mechanic.The overall atmosphere in the game is very melancholy with a somewhat convoluted narrative (that takes a bit of wikipedia research to fully understand) but it mainly serves to build the dark loneliness and desolation of the world.OVERALL: This game shines in terms of its interesting puzzles and mechanics. It has a solid minimalist narrative but its the gameplay that you want to pick this game up for.			"

													I’ve watched myself die countless times in games, but it’s never haunted me like The Swapper has. The hiss of oxygen flushing from my spacesuit fades gently, but the knowledge of this death's necessity - much like many that proceed it - lingers unsettlingly, even if those bodies are just my clones. Moments ago, they were me.	The Swapper brilliantly explores mortality and identity through its tense story, refined puzzles, and awe-inspiring atmosphere. Every aspect of the game is carefully crafted to plunge you into the grim desperation of a deep-space operation gone wrong. First cast in clay, the game’s environments hold a dark beauty, finely detailed and deeply chilling. The soundtrack is a true piece of art unto itself, weaving heartwrenching piano and umbral ambiance into one of The Swapper’s stronger assets.	Though the game divides story progression and most of the puzzles, they are still thoroughly entwined with the game’s themes. The game clocks in at just around six hours, which allows each puzzle to be unique and memorable, and sticks the landing with an unforgettable ending that had me paralyzed. 	The Swapper is made up of a number of expertly crafted elements that come together to form a thoughtful, captivating experience that doesn’t outstay its welcome. I almost regret buying it on sale - it’s worth every penny of the full price.			"

												As a puzzler, The Swapper is excellent. As art, it's lovely. As a story, it's compelling.The number of puzzles isn't huge - maybe a few dozen in total - but there's lots of exploring to be done, and the game will likely take several hours to work through. Each requires progressively more thought and planning - there's certainly nothing ""casual"" about these puzzles - and the last handful are particularly challenging. I caved and looked for help with a couple, though I wish I hadn't.It seems reasonable to compare the puzzle elements of this game with Portal - there are only a few game mechanics, and the game pushes you to fully explore those mechanics rather than throwing new ones at you. If anything, The Swapper's puzzles are more polished - they don't use ""filler"" puzzles with the same solution, and they always present a mental challenge, never falling back on split-second timing or mid-air object catches.The art and audio suit the game perfectly. The engine works wonders with the clay objects and animation, and it's immersive. I completely forgot to admire the quality of the clay modelling because I was so absorbed in the world, story and puzzles.The science fiction elements of the story are well thought out, and are used to great effect to create a clever story with a satisfying finale. While the plot deals with philosophy, morality and mortality, it stops short of pushing a particular world view, meaning it should be enjoyable to anyone who appreciates science fiction.			"

Gameplay consists mostly of puzzlesolving, and some very basic platforming. The puzzles range from easy enough to downright insidious, and solving the latter kind is immensly satisfying.The Swapper's story is perplexing and will keep you wondering what's going on for quite a bit of the game - but in a good way, and whenever some of the pieces fell together and revealed parts of the bigger picture, it left me in awe.First playthrough lasted 6 hours for me.All in all, phantastic experience, would absolutely buy again.

												One of the most unique puzzler games I've played in a very long time.I did find a lot of the puzzles (especially until late game) were pretty easy. However, even the easy puzzles give great satisfaction when solving just because of the uniqueness of the game.  The more challenging stages were real head-scratchers though, and overall I had a great time playing the game.The one thing I did not like was the achievements - There are 10 achievements, each earned by finding some hidden room in the game.  Some of these I find extremely unlikely that people could ""stumble upon"" without Googling the answers.Looking forward to The Swapper 2 - Would love to see a co-op feature. Imagine the puzzles....

												The Swapper is at its heart a puzzle game, similar to Braid or other Clone based games where you use copies of yourself to flick switches, open doors, etc to complete objectives. The Swapper manages to carefully tread the fine line between not too difficult and not too easy. Most of the puzzles you should be able to solve on your own, and it's very satisfying when you do so. I don't have much to complain about. The graphics are wonderful, but the most important part, the protagonist, is animated very awkwardly. It doesn't affect gameplay but just looks off. Lastly, the ending is a bit anti-climactic, and the story tries to be deeper than it needs to be. Still, fun title that'll take you ~ 8-10 hours to finish.			"

												An indie title that is, shockingly, good. I'm not being facetious, I do believe that the majority of indie titles coast by easily on gimmicks such as 8-bit graphics or meme spouting that earn them undeserved praise among the gaming public. Some indie titles try way too hard to come off as intellectually stimulating and are heralded by people who are accustomed to triple A titles that stopped trying long ago. Being accustomed to♥♥♥♥♥♥ they uphold anything that is remotely different as a godsend without looking at it individually and critically, falling prey to the hype and hysteria that comes with a community desperate to stick it to big name publishers by praising tiny developers without criticizing as readily due to a crowd that is too easily swayed by chiptune soundtracks or 8-bit graphics and faux-intellectualism.Some of that is present here, sadly. The plot starts off by throwing you into the thick of things, giving you logs to read without any context or attempt to ease you more readily into the game's story. Soon enough (it's a short game, afterall) you're reading logs dealing with esoteric matters of what conciousness is and the difference between the mind, identity, and the physical. Admittedly, it compliments the games mechanic of swapping bodies and interweaves it in a commendable manner. But the way the developers go about informing you on these plot points is lacking. There's something to be said of storylines that don't go on long expositionary strings of dialogue and opt for weaving the plotline into the game through files, flashbacks, and other subtle forms. But it's a delicate art: you have to make sure the gamer isn't inundated with incomprehensible information from the outset, and have to slowly peal away the layers of the plot in a way that is simplistic and understandable. This game has sadly failed to master the art it so desperately wishes to practice. It wants to create a sense of loneliness through its absence of cut-scenes, yet opts to include a few mid-way through the narrative; it wishes to have you slowly figure out just what is occuring but instead leaves confusion.By the end of the title, you have a solid enough grasp on the story to find the ending worthwhile. But that won't stop me from chastising the sloppy narrative at the outset. But the failures in story-telling are due to the successes in atmosphere. The developers wanted as much silence, loneliness, and eeriness as possible. While it succeeds in creating an ecosystem of melancholy and, strangely, sorrow, the trade-off was an explicit and concrete narrative. It's impossible to dictate the peculiarities of the overworld if you wish for everything to be as quiet and non-obtrusive as possible.Ultimately, the narrative is really my only criticism. So far I've only complimented the developers success in their atmospheric goals. But let me add another one to the pile: the games mechanics. Ultimately, that's all we're here for, right? And the developer delivers. Gameplay revolves around a device that allows you to place clones of yourself throughout the world, empeded only by distance and light sources that dictate the terms of your abilities. Is the light source blue? You may only swap with existing clones. Red? The converse is our new reality: clone placement is acceptable but swapping isn't. Such a simple mechanic, but the developer has crafted a variety of puzzles that build on it and keep it fresh. It almost reminds me of Portal, really. One mechanic that is built upon and used in a variety of ways.As a whole, the title is worthwhile and one of the few indie titles that legitimately deserves the praise it gets. But please, don't pester me about it's 'moving' plotline. While it definitely has points of interest, the manner in which it delivers them detracts from their otherwise perfect and original premises. It's a shame. But that fault aside, the game is an enjoyable puzzle game that stretches out a simple mechanic to its limits and has a style and atmosphere of its own to set it apart from other games. Being unique is quite possibly the one thing games strive for and what matters most, and this title presents a style that is worth noting. Titles like this are short enough that it's difficult not recommending them.Wu-Tang motherfu*ker.			"

Graphics look good enough and the story is interesting.The only issue I had with the game is that, while the game has two possible endings, you can't go back after you've seen one of them and re-do the last part of the game in order to watch the other one - you have to go through the entire game again. And after you've solved the puzzles once, there's little reason to revisit the game.Aside from that, it's an awesome game.			"

												The Swapper is a clever puzzle-platformer set onboard an abandoned research station in the deepest reaches of space. It features a unique art style that uses real-world assets crafted from clay and other found objects to create detailed environments to explore. If you enjoy science fiction and a good story intertwined with mind-bending puzzles, this game is for you.			"

												A while since I played this now, but this is the sort of game you'll never forget. The atomsphere just grips you in such a way it's hard to stop playing until you finish it. Rare to find a puzzle game where the setting and story can match the level of the puzzle design. But in this rare gem, it all comes together, creating one memorable whole.			"

Found myself scratching my head and wanting to quit on a couple of the puzzles but after finally solving them feeling satisfied. All round good game, wished it was longer but still happy with it all the same.			"

												I came upon The Swapper in a Humble Bundle, and decided to play it first of the many games I recieved. This was a good decision. The game throws you into a practically abadon space station setting a tone of isolation and moody darkness. As you solve your way through this creative platformer, you begin to realize more and more about what happened, solving the curious situation that had occured. The themes and feelings the game potrays are some of the best I have played in a game, with a soundtrack that is second to very few others. By the end of the game hopefully having sidetracked your main mission more than a few times to discover journal logs and ""talking"" rocks, you put the final pieces together and realize the controversy that exists in the game, and now will challenge you to reflect on the theme of a soul and being and individual human.I would give The Swapper a 9.5/ 10 and HIGHLY recommend sitting down and immersing youself in a fantastic experience.

												A lovely bit of atmospheric puzzle-platforming.Animation style and art design mesh well to produce a quite creepy, lonely experience.  Difficulty curve on the puzzles is excellent - this is not an enormous game, but every puzzle requires something different.  You have to learn new tricks to overcome them even in some of the very last puzzles in the game, and I'll take that over huge amounts of repetitive filler any time. "

												What a game. Everything about The Swapper is awesome.GRAPHICS: The Swapper could have easily contented itself with some cheap cartoon or 8-bit art style. Thankfully, The devs went all out in the graphics department, crafting detailed art assets out of clay to convey its world. The game is technically 2D, but uses adavanced Depth of Field and lighting effects to convincingly simulate environments, in a very atmospheric way. It's one of the best looking games I've ever seen, indie or otherwise.SOUND/MUSIC: The game also has solid sound design. Reverb is very well done and does wonders in terms of selling the atmosphere. Every sound is high quality and properly processed for where the sound occurs (in a hallway, in airlock, etc). The soundtrack is great as well: solemn tunes ranging from classical-ish piano pieces to atmospheric electronic tones.GAMEPLAY: Movement and mouse control are very polished, as is the Swapper mechanic. Basically, you can create up to four clones of yourself anywhere on-screen that is not blocked, and they mirror your movemnts. You can then swap to become any one of them with the device. The great depth of this mechanic is revealed as you progress through the game, introducing pressure pads, lights that block certain functions of the device, and much more. Solving puzzles rewards you with one or more ""orbs"" that allow you to activate consoles to progress. This is balanced so that you can skip some puzzles and still progress, though you have to complete all puzzles to reach the game's ending (you can use teleport devices to re-visit earlier puzzles). I had to consult a walkthrough twice towards the end of the game, but in general the puzzles were balanced, rewarding, and very well designed.STORY: Pay close attention from the very beginning to the very end, and play in large chunks of time. You don't want to miss a single detail in The Swapper's incredible story. Without spoiling anything, the plot is directly linked to the core gameplay mechanics in a very unique way. I will never forget the ending.VERDICT: 9.5/10Would clone myself so I could recommend it moreWould swap myself so I could experience it again			"

												Ever since Jon Blow's Braid, indie platformers have flooded the digital market. It seems that every month we get a new game that either attempts to emulate Braid's successes or fail at developing it's own identity. The Swapper is the kind of evolution of this genre that should have happened after Braid.Tasked with exploring a very eerie space station, your character stumbles upon a device that allows him to create a small number of clones of himself. Along with cloning, you can ""swap"" between the clones with a press of a button. Once you obtain both features of your swapper gun, you are left to explore and solve puzzles to continue your journey.The set up may be simple as hell, but the puzzles are very creative. Everything from lateral thinking to reaction based puzzles and even some that limit your clones from the standard 4. While this may have gotten boring if dragged on for more than a few hours, developer Facepalm Games knew to take their idea, extend it to the max and then finish.Even if the campaign can be beaten in a mere 3 hours, the hand-crafted visuals will likely perplex you. How anyone has the talent to mold clay into digitized sets is astounding. Everything looks real because it actually is. Even so, the game never wastes time to flaunt it's looks. The story moves along nicely and the game keeps the puzzles coming.The story is very intriguing, too. Thoughts of what swapping means, what it is to be human and whether or not survival is of the utmost importance make for a game that will constantly have you scratching your head. It's a testament to the gameplay that I actually felt the need to rebeat the game just to get the second ending (instead of Youtubing it).There really isn'y much else to say about the game. I do believe the price tag is a bit steep, but even getting the game at half-off is well worth it. If you are a fan of puzzle based games, I whole-heartedly recommend this. Even if you're not, it never hurts to go outside your comfort zone for a truly unforgettable experience.8.5/10			"

The concept is fairly simple and but super enjoyable to play. It took me 6 hours to play it in its entirety, and I wish it was a little longer. A few puzzles had me stumped for while, one taking me as long as 30 minutes to solve. All around, this game was well worth the price paid. I hope there's a sequel or perhaps a prequel in development, as I would definitely love to play this style of gameplay again.			"

The plot, gameplay etc isn't bad, but still I was expecting smth more of a Deadlight. But once again - the ""good luck"" puzzles kill all the fun, and the game made me more angry than happy, that's why 5 out of 10.PS. Final puzzle is damn glitchy! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!PPS.

												The Swapper may seem like your regular puzzle platform game, except that it has a cool puzzle mechanic, clones, amazing graphics, and a lot harder that it looks.Like, really hard.The learning curve may feel steep as you play along the game, but the great thing is they let you go on with the story while you skip the puzzles you can't solve yet (you get to go back and try it again anytime until the end). The story is the best aspect of the gam: it is both captivating and well-written while raising a lot of moral and philosophical issues regarding the swapper device. It's almost like Portal, but with a darker and more sinister backdrop... and no jokes. It's serious business, basically.Speaking of serious business, their art is simply amazing and professional—all the levels are made entirely out of clay and found objects! I mean, what could possibly be cooler than that? That's some serious dedication, and it should be a good reason for you to get the game.			"

												The Swapper is a great 2D puzzle platformer game that reminds me a lot of Portal in terms of its mechanics and level design. The game requires you to create clones of yourself and swap from one to another. The creators of this game have made a huge variety of puzzles with a very small set of mechanics. Some of the puzzles really make you think and force you to get better at using the swapping mechanic.The overall atmosphere in the game is very melancholy with a somewhat convoluted narrative (that takes a bit of wikipedia research to fully understand) but it mainly serves to build the dark loneliness and desolation of the world.OVERALL: This game shines in terms of its interesting puzzles and mechanics. It has a solid minimalist narrative but its the gameplay that you want to pick this game up for.			"

The graphics and general presentation are the definitely the high points of the game, while the plot tries to be more than it ends up being.

												The Swapper is an atmospheric puzzle platformer set in outer space.The puzzles involve an experimental device able to clone yourself and swap control between up to 5 total. Personally for me there weren't many puzzles that were too difficult to make me just quit the game, but I did have the occasional one that made me feel like a genius for completing it.All of the art for the game was apparently made with clay sculpters, making the game very aesthetically pleasing. I also felt that the limited sound made for a more immersive experience. The only thing I had a problem with were the achievements. I personally don't really care about achievements too much, so I don't mind that it doesn't tell you how to get them or how secretly hidden they are, but I feel for those that do enjoy achievement hunting that the execution of it all only hurts the game. I found myself enjoying this game a lot more than I thought I would, and I was actually pretty immersed in the whole experience. For $15 I honestly think it's worth it and even though it was 3.6 hours in length for me, it was definitely quality gameplay.8/10			"

												The Swapper is a challenging puzzle game, set in a deserted spaceship drifting in orbit of an uninhabited planet far away from any human civilisation. As you explore the cold, dark and lifeless environment, you will have to overcome obstacles and solve brain-twisting puzzles using your ""Swapper"" device - a gun-like apparatus which not only allows you to create clones of yourself that copy your every movement but also gives you the ability to switch consciousness between them.Soon the distinction between original and copy will blur as your character becomes less and less human and more and more a series of disposible clones. In an omnipresent atmosphere of lostness in the void, one is confronted with events that provoke reflection on the nature and value of consciousness and thought, of identity, a sense of self, and the nature and value of life itself, in a storyline equally as stimulating as The Swapper's brain-teasing gameplay.Highly recommended.

												Hesitantly, I say yes.  Swapper has an awesome atmosphere, and the gameplay mechanics and the story combine with each other nicely to create an intriguing experience.  Creating and controlling copies of yourself in order to solve puzzles is a cool idea, and was utilized ingeniously in many of the puzzles.  I am, however, not as fond of the ""gravity-swapping"" element added partway through.  It never seemed to mesh well with any of the other aspects of the puzzles, as they were all tightly designed around the Swapper device and combined well together.  It seemed like an annoying gimick that made the puzzles harder by its inclusion rather than really pushing the capabilities and challenges of the Swapper device to its limits in puzzle design.Also I am immensely impressed that it created using stop-motion animation.

The plot, gameplay etc isn't bad, but still I was expecting smth more of a Deadlight.

												The Swapper is a very fun 2D puzzle game. The story is about uncovering the mystery of how a spaceship has been abandoned. The game is fairly short but the puzzles and story are enjoyable. The puzzles involve having to create clones and swap between them. Some of the challenging puzzles are somewhat tedious (like the ones where you have to swap at a certain point) but they are still fun. The game really nails the ""alone on a spaceship"" atmosphere. All you have for company are your clones. The parts where you are in the vacuum of space are really well done as well. If you like sidescrolling puzzle games, The Swapper is definitely worth your time.			"

There are no monsters to fight, just puzzles to solve in order to collect some orbs and progress to other areas, but the puzzles can get quite challenging, to say the least.

												Touch Down!This is a puzzle platformer which atmosphere is alienish. A rare few of the puzzles may get on your nerves, since they will use the game mechanics in a non-intuitive way. Nearly all of them have their difficulty properly and elegantly balanced.The gfx design, the sound, the music, the frame rate are what you would expect for the scale of this game: really, *really* good. The gfx are amazing, the sound and music breath taking, and the frame rate is sustained 60 fps. The atmosphere is fantastic, period.The game is more enjoyable using a mouse and a keyboard, than a joypad. And beware, at the time of writing this review the game has the same bug than dota2 on GNU/Linux: if you don't use a qwerty mapped keyboard, the keyboard mapping won't display the right glyphs. Additionally, for me at least, none of the steam achievements were unlocked, but I will survive without them.There is one thing I did not really like: the 2 alternative endings only reachable by restarting the game from the beginning.On the technical aspect of the game, they used very technically expensive software components. I would have recommended to go minimal C. I really don't like the software they used, but since it's a closed source game and we get only binaries, till those binaries are available on GNU/Linux, I won't go on a rampage. And the last but not the least: the game ran perfectly with the linux radeon open source driver.			"

A few puzzles had me stumped for while, one taking me as long as 30 minutes to solve. All around, this game was well worth the price paid. I hope there's a sequel or perhaps a prequel in development, as I would definitely love to play this style of gameplay again.			"

												Loved this game. The puzzles could be quite fiendish, yet once solved can be appreciated for their elegant simplicity. Learning to think in all directions at once was key to mastering the Swapper.The story, too, echoes the theme of simplicity and complexity masking each other. On the face of it, the plot is quite straightforward, but it conjures up unnerving questions of identity and what it means to be alive; to be sentient. Coupled with the numerous computer logs positioned throughout the game, you get a real sense of what kind of world the Swapper takes place in. And a sense of how it could well be our own.What would you do to survive?			"

												First of all this is a story driven puzzle platformer.  It plays like Limbo, what that entails is the player character is floaty, the controls are rudimentary and the driving force is ingame/inengine cutscenes with a certain vagueness to them.  However it isn't linear like Limbo and has a Metroid Prime structure to it, with datalogs/internal monologues.  So that should give you an idea of how it will play and what you will experience.With that said, the puzzles are simple at first, but get pretty devilish as the game progresses.  The music is fantastic.  The whole game feels like a visionary Sci-Fi classic, presenting you with the questions and some thoughts on them, but never supplying anything close to a concrete answer.  I don't know how to explain the graphics, but looks like a 3-D/claymation effect without really being either, in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing since I like the look.I randomly started playing it one afternoon and could not stop.  The later puzzles might have been harder as a result of the extended session, but it was well worth it.  The Swapper was gripping from beginning to end.			"

												This is one of those games where the creator probably had this amazing idea for the ending and built the rest out of that.Overall, it's a pretty good game. All the puzzles rely on the same mechanics that you start with, so it's all about improving your own skills, and the difficulty progression is well ballanced. The graphics and general presentation are the definitely the high points of the game, while the plot tries to be more than it ends up being. Still, i wouldn't recommend it for the price they are asking.			"

												What a game. Everything about The Swapper is awesome.GRAPHICS: The Swapper could have easily contented itself with some cheap cartoon or 8-bit art style. Thankfully, The devs went all out in the graphics department, crafting detailed art assets out of clay to convey its world. The game is technically 2D, but uses adavanced Depth of Field and lighting effects to convincingly simulate environments, in a very atmospheric way. It's one of the best looking games I've ever seen, indie or otherwise.SOUND/MUSIC: The game also has solid sound design. Reverb is very well done and does wonders in terms of selling the atmosphere. Every sound is high quality and properly processed for where the sound occurs (in a hallway, in airlock, etc). The soundtrack is great as well: solemn tunes ranging from classical-ish piano pieces to atmospheric electronic tones.GAMEPLAY: Movement and mouse control are very polished, as is the Swapper mechanic. Basically, you can create up to four clones of yourself anywhere on-screen that is not blocked, and they mirror your movemnts. You can then swap to become any one of them with the device. The great depth of this mechanic is revealed as you progress through the game, introducing pressure pads, lights that block certain functions of the device, and much more. Solving puzzles rewards you with one or more ""orbs"" that allow you to activate consoles to progress. This is balanced so that you can skip some puzzles and still progress, though you have to complete all puzzles to reach the game's ending (you can use teleport devices to re-visit earlier puzzles). I had to consult a walkthrough twice towards the end of the game, but in general the puzzles were balanced, rewarding, and very well designed.STORY: Pay close attention from the very beginning to the very end, and play in large chunks of time. You don't want to miss a single detail in The Swapper's incredible story. Without spoiling anything, the plot is directly linked to the core gameplay mechanics in a very unique way. I will never forget the ending.VERDICT: 9.5/10Would clone myself so I could recommend it moreWould swap myself so I could experience it again			"

												An extremely good puzzle game with art that is mostly (possibly entirely?) made from real-life objects, giving it a very cool look. Even more impressive is the game's atmosphere, which is both solitary and very contemplative. Basically, this game made me want to go read some good sci-fi.The puzzles are varied and most are challenging without being frustrating, and nothing requires split-second timing. My only complaint with The Swapper is that to complete it, you have to solve every single puzzle in the game. Until the end, the game's obstacles (unlocked using orbs you solve puzzles to collect) can be passed by solving most, but not all available puzzles. This lets you skip a handful that I found too difficult, even after trying over several days. The very end, however, requires you to go back and solve EVERYTHING. This was frustrating.Also, if you're a lunatic for achievements, this game hides all its achievements and a fair amount of back story on ten hidden terminals. These aren't like Bioshock Inifinite audio-log ""hidden"", these basically require you to glitch through seemingly solid walls where there is no indication of a collectible. If it was just achievements hidden this way it would be stupid but easily ignored; the fact that there is additional story and flavor hidden so ridiculously deep is aggravating.My quibbles with it are minor, though. The Swapper is a must for people who enjoy puzzle games and good atmosphere and mystery.			"

 The Swapper Review	 Having bought this game in a bundle, I didn't expect too much, but this game blew away all expectations that I had. The way that it intergrated problem-solving and precarious puzzles with a great story is very unique and I had a great time playing it. I've been getting into achievement hunting recently, and this is a very easy game to 100% as long as you aren't against using a guide. These achievements are entirely hidden and very jerkish of the developers, but they are possible.I came across a few areas where I was stumped beyond belief, but the storyline kept me persevering. Throughout the entire campaign, I was a bit puzzled as to the direction that the story was taking. If you actually spend time reading the terminals and consoles, you understand why you are completing these tasks much like Portal and Portal 2.Overall, I had a great time playing this game and it was worth way more than I paid for it. I would give it a 9/10 and place it atop my favorite puzzle games!Gameplay - 8/10Difficulty - 8/10Accessiblity of Achievements - 10/10			"

												The Swapper is an atmospheric puzzle platformer set in outer space.The puzzles involve an experimental device able to clone yourself and swap control between up to 5 total. Personally for me there weren't many puzzles that were too difficult to make me just quit the game, but I did have the occasional one that made me feel like a genius for completing it.All of the art for the game was apparently made with clay sculpters, making the game very aesthetically pleasing. I also felt that the limited sound made for a more immersive experience. The only thing I had a problem with were the achievements. I personally don't really care about achievements too much, so I don't mind that it doesn't tell you how to get them or how secretly hidden they are, but I feel for those that do enjoy achievement hunting that the execution of it all only hurts the game. I found myself enjoying this game a lot more than I thought I would, and I was actually pretty immersed in the whole experience. For $15 I honestly think it's worth it and even though it was 3.6 hours in length for me, it was definitely quality gameplay.8/10			"

												Hesitantly, I say yes.  Swapper has an awesome atmosphere, and the gameplay mechanics and the story combine with each other nicely to create an intriguing experience.  Creating and controlling copies of yourself in order to solve puzzles is a cool idea, and was utilized ingeniously in many of the puzzles.  I am, however, not as fond of the ""gravity-swapping"" element added partway through.  It never seemed to mesh well with any of the other aspects of the puzzles, as they were all tightly designed around the Swapper device and combined well together.  It seemed like an annoying gimick that made the puzzles harder by its inclusion rather than really pushing the capabilities and challenges of the Swapper device to its limits in puzzle design.Also I am immensely impressed that it created using stop-motion animation.

												Ever since Jon Blow's Braid, indie platformers have flooded the digital market. It seems that every month we get a new game that either attempts to emulate Braid's successes or fail at developing it's own identity. The Swapper is the kind of evolution of this genre that should have happened after Braid.Tasked with exploring a very eerie space station, your character stumbles upon a device that allows him to create a small number of clones of himself. Along with cloning, you can ""swap"" between the clones with a press of a button. Once you obtain both features of your swapper gun, you are left to explore and solve puzzles to continue your journey.The set up may be simple as hell, but the puzzles are very creative. Everything from lateral thinking to reaction based puzzles and even some that limit your clones from the standard 4. While this may have gotten boring if dragged on for more than a few hours, developer Facepalm Games knew to take their idea, extend it to the max and then finish.Even if the campaign can be beaten in a mere 3 hours, the hand-crafted visuals will likely perplex you. How anyone has the talent to mold clay into digitized sets is astounding. Everything looks real because it actually is. Even so, the game never wastes time to flaunt it's looks. The story moves along nicely and the game keeps the puzzles coming.The story is very intriguing, too. Thoughts of what swapping means, what it is to be human and whether or not survival is of the utmost importance make for a game that will constantly have you scratching your head. It's a testament to the gameplay that I actually felt the need to rebeat the game just to get the second ending (instead of Youtubing it).There really isn'y much else to say about the game. I do believe the price tag is a bit steep, but even getting the game at half-off is well worth it. If you are a fan of puzzle based games, I whole-heartedly recommend this. Even if you're not, it never hurts to go outside your comfort zone for a truly unforgettable experience.8.5/10			"

												The Swapper is an excellent and unique platform puzzler with tight controls and satisfying gameplay. However, the story that unfolds as you play is arguably worth more attention than the game itself.The puzzles are challenging but logical, and I was able to solve all but two on my own (and I'm pretty bad at puzzle games in general). When you get stuck, there are usually other puzzles you can tackle while you let the answer to a puzzle come to you. Eventually, you should have them all solved. My only complaint is that in order to view either of the two endings, you must solve ALL puzzles. It might have been more interesting if players were able to pick and choose one or two puzzles to skip if necessary and still complete the game.The story is where this game really shines. Luckily, the story is more absorbed than told, which really helps the story's magnitude carry more weight. There are a few scenes where telling is used over showing, but these are few and usually very short. Put simply, the further you get into the game, the more hesitant you feel using your clones all willy-nilly. The ending is particularly powerful due to this growing concern I had regarding my actions.The quality of this game reminds me of titles like Braid and LIMBO. Definitely worth the money and the time.			"

												A well done puzzle platformer. One of the more intriguing elements in the game is that they incorporate the philosophy of mind in the story. They use Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers as the protagonists for their respective positions (merely referred to by their last names in-game). Dennett does not believe in consciousness (soul in the game) and Chalmers is an advocate for consciousness (soul). Although the pro/con soul/consciousness debate is largely lacking the kind of robustness seen even in an elementary exposition of their positions in philosophical writing, it does a fair enough job to be provocative even for the veteran of philosophy. Additionally, experiencing it in an already mind-flexing puzzle game is icing on the cake. Therefore I don't dock them points for oversimplfying the philosophicals issues touched upon in the game. Even without the philosophical debate, the puzzles are enough to warrant the play through.			"

												The Swapper is an indie platform/puzzle game with an extraordinarily innovative concept. The main character wields a device that allows you to create clones and swap places with any of the clones, and you have to get to the next point using this swapper device. The levels are very well designed and ordered, so it was very entertaining throughout, and nowhere was it too difficult. Not only is gameplay outstanding, but the setting is also superb. the game takes place in a space station where nearly everyone has died due to an unknown psychological phenomenon. The game has a ominous and eerie tone that successfully binds you to the story and makes you want to find out what is happening as story reveals, and the ending gives you something to think about philosophically.

												Puzzle-based games rarely offer the depth and atmosphere The Swapper provides. The game takes place in a beautifully realized science fiction setting; as you traverse an enormous yet desolate research station orbiting an alien world, you begin to piece together an understanding of the events which led it to such a state. However, with each bit of information about the past that you uncover, new questions about the present begin to appear. Overall, The Swapper is a game that accomplishes a lot without overstaying its welcome. It's short enough (roughly 3 - 6 hours) that despite puzzle mechanics that are fairly limited in scope, it rarely feels repetitive, and it leaves you satisfied but wanting more. I'd highly recommend this game.			"

												The Swapper is a challenging puzzle game, set in a deserted spaceship drifting in orbit of an uninhabited planet far away from any human civilisation. As you explore the cold, dark and lifeless environment, you will have to overcome obstacles and solve brain-twisting puzzles using your ""Swapper"" device - a gun-like apparatus which not only allows you to create clones of yourself that copy your every movement but also gives you the ability to switch consciousness between them.Soon the distinction between original and copy will blur as your character becomes less and less human and more and more a series of disposible clones. In an omnipresent atmosphere of lostness in the void, one is confronted with events that provoke reflection on the nature and value of consciousness and thought, of identity, a sense of self, and the nature and value of life itself, in a storyline equally as stimulating as The Swapper's brain-teasing gameplay.Highly recommended.

Brainteasing puzzles, philosophy course required. You want this game. You need it. And once you're done playing this beautiful game based on clay-made backgrounds you may end regretting your final decisions. And play it again.			"

												The Swapper is undoubtedly a puzzle game inspired by Portal. But is it just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone, or maybe something else? Let's find out.The game is set on some kind of abandoned space station orbiting an unexplored planet, where our main character arrives at the beginning. We don't know who he is or why is he there. Soon we'll find the Swapper, a portal-gun-like device that will become our main tool throughout the game. It has two functions: creating a clone of yourself at a certain location that will move exactly as you and swapping the control from yourself to the clone. You can have up to four clones plus the main character at the same time. With such a powerful tool, you would think no puzzle will resist you more than a few seconds. And here it comes the brilliance of the game designers: the puzzles ARE hard. The start being easy, but soon you will find yourself stuck for the first time.Fortunately, the game offers the player some freedom on the order puzzles must be done (but eventually every one must be completed to end the game), so you don't desperately stand for hours trying the same puzzle. Also, it alternates these puzzles with more narrative sequences, letting you learn some of what happened here before your arrival. The story itself is quite interesting, following the path of speculative / philosophical science-fiction, and has a really decent ending.On the art of the game, the graphics are nice and original, specially textures, through the character moves seem quite orthopedic and sometimes there is just too much blur on the screen. On the other hand, the soundrack is outstanding, ranging from ambient passages that get you into the isolation atmosphere of the game to beautiful and evocative piano melodies.In conclusion, The Swapper is an awesome adventure and a very well done game in every aspect of its development. It is however a bit expensive for the 5/6 hours that last a basic gameplay. But hey, it is on sale quite often.			"

												""The Swapper"" is a Metroid and Portal-esque puzzle platformer set primarily on a distant space station.  It deftly tackles tough philosophical conundrums such as the nature of consciousness, identity, and the importance of survival, whilst skilfully weaving crafty puzzles with engaging plot-telling and immersive visual settings made by hand.  Primarily, the puzzles involve the use of clones and the Swapper - a teleportation device of sorts - to locate and acquire security orbs which help unlock different areas within the Space Station Theseus.  The puzzles are typically compartmentalised within single rooms; they typically are relatively short and, whilst tricky in parts, are certainly doable by more causal players with some attempts.  Since there is no combat whatsoever within the game, puzzles confer the meat of the game's challenge.  They mechanically work well and are typically not subject to frustrating pinpoint accuracy or poor handling.  The bulk of the plotline is narrated by a female character - the only other humanoid character alive in the space station - and who guides and directs many of your explorative actions.  Her confused identity and purpose of being is gradually unravelled as the game progresses, to a perhaps surprising end.  Memory logs and the sentient stone 'Watchers' bulk out the storytelling methods and each tells a slightly different type of tale of their own.  The visuals and audio eccentuate the general sense of aloneness the player experiences as they wander through the space station.  The visuals frequently speak of a place that almost feels frozen in time, and have quite a distinctive look with the oft haze-inducing light effects.  Meanwhile, the subtle ambient music engenders a sense of longing for company and, perhaps, finality.  Whilst the player is not technically alone, the curious 'Watchers' (who can be met in every other room) tend to provide more questions than answers, and the other humanoid inhabitant on the station provides only fleeting moments of solace as she wrestles with her own multidimensional problems.    Throughout the game, a certain moral debate of sorts is broached, and the debate comes to a head near the end, where the player must make a potentially emotionally impactful choice.  There is no right answer to that choice, nor is either answer necessarily a sweet one, but both choices are meaningful in their own way.On the downside, the game is quite short and lacks much replay value.  When the game is complete, the player must begin from scratch if they wanted to recheck a log or seek out a secret room, which is suboptimal design.  The secret rooms are only findable if someone goes in with the expectation of looking for them, and the memory logs within said rooms could have been utilised to portend more meaningful messages.  Finally, whilst the ambient music sets the scene well, there was room for a more dramatic and memorable piece or two within the game as well.      Overall, if you want a relatively short puzzle-centric isolationist game that tussles with morality and philosophy along the way, you'll enjoy this game.   "

												The Swapper is a truly amazing game. It has an immersive atmosphere, fluent, non-forced narration, a balanced game flow that does not insult you with that stupidity which a majority of games tries to sell. Voice acting quality is also way above the ordinary sterile pseudo-emotional nonsense. I must gladly admit, that I was really blown by every zero gravity moment. The binary decision at the end of the game is breathtaking as it perfectly merges the gameplay mechanics with the story while asking a very serious moral question. This illustrates how well thought through The Swapper is.			"

												I came upon The Swapper in a Humble Bundle, and decided to play it first of the many games I recieved. This was a good decision. The game throws you into a practically abadon space station setting a tone of isolation and moody darkness. As you solve your way through this creative platformer, you begin to realize more and more about what happened, solving the curious situation that had occured. The themes and feelings the game potrays are some of the best I have played in a game, with a soundtrack that is second to very few others. By the end of the game hopefully having sidetracked your main mission more than a few times to discover journal logs and ""talking"" rocks, you put the final pieces together and realize the controversy that exists in the game, and now will challenge you to reflect on the theme of a soul and being and individual human.I would give The Swapper a 9.5/ 10 and HIGHLY recommend sitting down and immersing youself in a fantastic experience.

												The swapper is an experience you will remember for a long time.Pros: The puzzles are great and tricky and when you get the solution you don't feel cheated. None are too hard to make you frustrated. The atmosphere of the game is something you will remember. The sound, the lighting, the different areas of the ship, the space travel... there are moments that will just leave you stunned. Cons: Not much but if I had to point out a couple then firstly, the achievement system is designed to make you play through the game again. You won't get any achievements unless you are actively looking for them because they need you to access hidden rooms which are really well hidden :). Secondly, the story, though great, is not told directly in the game. You need to make sense out of the various dialogues and it will leave you thinking about what is happening through out the game.Overall, it is a great game in my opinion and I would highly recommend everyone to experience this.

												This is one of the better puzzle games I've played. It offers a simple and straight-forward concept and utilises it to its full potential - create clones of yourself that copy your every move in order to solve puzzles. The puzzles vary between each other, and some introduce new things into the mix. For example not being able to create any clones within blue light, or not being able to swap between the clones within red light. In late stages the game also offers gimmicks with artificial gravity too, which adds a layer of complexity to the puzzles.Most of the game has you solve puzzles in order to collect orbs, and a certain number of these is required to get past checkpoints to another area. I really liked this semi-open feel of exploration that the game offered, and for most of it you didn't even have to solve every single puzzle in order to make progress. You could afford to skip some. However, the very last console checkpoint requires that you solve every single puzzle that's left. Most of the puzzles were really intuitive and felt rewarding when you solved them, but I wasn't a fan of a few near the end. Three of the puzzles took me so many attempts that I eventually had to consult a walkthrough. I think that it would've been better if the final checkpoint didn't require every single puzzle to be solved.Throughout exploring the ship and solving puzzles, there are many logs and interactable computer terminals that shed light on the creepy backstory behind this device that you're using to create clones. In general the story was in the background, but its concepts would leave you thinking of what's morally right, especially with the way it concluded with an interesting choice of two alternate endings.All in all, I enjoyed the game and thought it was pulled off really well. Only the last few puzzles near the end frustrated me. Would certainly recommend it for all fans of puzzle games.			"

And after you've solved the puzzles once, there's little reason to revisit the game.Aside from that, it's an awesome game.			"

												9.5/10Charming visuals, amazing gameplay mechanic, a story that is just obscure enough to keep you puzzled right up until the end and some really deep questions about existence and the concept of consciousness itself - this game has it all. It is above par the standards you would expect from even the leading AAA game studios.I would avoid repeating the praise others have heaped (which is well-deserved, FYI) and point out the stuff that I felt on a personal level. Past halfway point, I was solving the rooms comfortably, occasionally needing me to take a 2-3 min break to step back and re-evaluate. Eventually the solution would ""click"" in those 2-3 mins, and I thought that all the puzzles are going to be rather easy to do. But, I must admit, the last 30% or so really made me flex my brains. Those puzzle rooms taught me how to rid myself of my clones by mercilessly sacrificing those that were no longer a part of the solution. The mixing-up of various challenge elements was truly seamless and not a single room had cheap positioning tricks or tedious solutions. The ""puzzle platformer"" part has been executed to perfection.The emotional, spiritual and existential dilemma that the game delves you into, as you start wondering about your clones,  the Watchers and what they say, and the voices you hear as they reveal their own sagas - left me in a state of wonder. It makes the player ask a lot of questions but nudges you ever so slightly. The slowly revealing backstory you learn from various logs is obscure yet it adds a piece to the puzzle, just like the small items lying in some chambers tell a lot. The choice to be made by the player at the end is very fitting. It leaves you asking yourself why you did what you did and if it was worth it. That's the kind of endings you remember for a lifetime.My only beef with the game is the ridiculous Steam achievements. They are actually some well-hidden logs, that are incoming transmissions which weave a rudimentary backstory of why in the name of Cthulhu the player and the ship are where they are. They are impossible to find yourself (at least all of them) unless you go OCD-crazy in every single room or look up Youtube for a guide, like I did. I wouldn't have had the least of problems if the achievements were some useless hidden collectible; but this is a part of story, and it takes a part of the experience away from a player who isn't concerned with achievements. If nothing, there should have been a marker of some kind that makes you aware of the presence of one such console in the vicinity; in its current form, this forces you to either miss a part of story or keep a youtube video open in your web browser and keep a check to find the 10 hidden consoles - something I think is unnecessary and unfair.Except for that one very specific nitpick, I have found the game to be perfect. If you are the kind of person who requires a set number of hours of gameplay to justify the pricetag, go for this on a sale. Otherwise, in all fairness, the Devs have earned that money, and my eternal respect.EDIT: My playtime is displayed as 11 hrs+ whereas I have not taken more than 7 hours, including being stuck at 2-3 levels for half an hour or so (the rest is idle minimize-time). The 7 hours also includes getting 100% in Steam and in-game, and thus should be the actual maximum playtime this game has to offer (unless you replay, that is).			"

												Wow.I don't think I've ever played a game like The Swapper. As far as recent platformers go, Braid and The Swapper are best there are. Not just in terms of invigorating gameplay, but the writing and music, they're so strong. The atmospher in The Swapper was gorgeous, beautiful and breathtaking. The animation was simple, but it didn't need much to show off, it already had the intriguing intro to keep the player going. The puzzles are strange and sometimes complex.In The Swapper, you play a stranded astronaut, or scavenger that lands onto an abandoned space ship, Theseus, or at least it appears abandoned. It is one of seven ships meant to gather resources for Earth, as Earth has exhausted all resources. You have to find a means to esacpe, by solving puzzles, collecting orbs, collecting data to find out what happened to the crew and why they were so keen into the telepathic rocks/Watchers. The story is mystifying and refreshing for its ambiguity and intelligence of space, time, the mind, and life. It's almost philosophical.I can't say I've played a game where you can generate clones and swap bodies, while controlling them all at the same time to solve puzzles. I know other platformers use the clone ability for puzzles, i.e.; Braid with its time controlling, Mario for its bizarreness, and a few others. But The Swapper perfects it for forcing you to use your clones, not to your advantage, but to your necessity.It's fascinating to know that The Swapper's art, sets, characters were all claymation. It give itself a distinct art style you wouldn't reguarly see in videogames, especially since most video game art is done digitally. So seeing the seemless claymation in a videogame just goes to show that claymation is not a dying art form. I would certainly like to see more indie video games take this approach, as it is unique and, when done well, looks outstanding.I can't say enough about this game, it's simply outstanding.10/10			"

												9.5/10Charming visuals, amazing gameplay mechanic, a story that is just obscure enough to keep you puzzled right up until the end and some really deep questions about existence and the concept of consciousness itself - this game has it all. It is above par the standards you would expect from even the leading AAA game studios.I would avoid repeating the praise others have heaped (which is well-deserved, FYI) and point out the stuff that I felt on a personal level. Past halfway point, I was solving the rooms comfortably, occasionally needing me to take a 2-3 min break to step back and re-evaluate. Eventually the solution would ""click"" in those 2-3 mins, and I thought that all the puzzles are going to be rather easy to do. But, I must admit, the last 30% or so really made me flex my brains. Those puzzle rooms taught me how to rid myself of my clones by mercilessly sacrificing those that were no longer a part of the solution. The mixing-up of various challenge elements was truly seamless and not a single room had cheap positioning tricks or tedious solutions. The ""puzzle platformer"" part has been executed to perfection.The emotional, spiritual and existential dilemma that the game delves you into, as you start wondering about your clones,  the Watchers and what they say, and the voices you hear as they reveal their own sagas - left me in a state of wonder. It makes the player ask a lot of questions but nudges you ever so slightly. The slowly revealing backstory you learn from various logs is obscure yet it adds a piece to the puzzle, just like the small items lying in some chambers tell a lot. The choice to be made by the player at the end is very fitting. It leaves you asking yourself why you did what you did and if it was worth it. That's the kind of endings you remember for a lifetime.My only beef with the game is the ridiculous Steam achievements. They are actually some well-hidden logs, that are incoming transmissions which weave a rudimentary backstory of why in the name of Cthulhu the player and the ship are where they are. They are impossible to find yourself (at least all of them) unless you go OCD-crazy in every single room or look up Youtube for a guide, like I did. I wouldn't have had the least of problems if the achievements were some useless hidden collectible; but this is a part of story, and it takes a part of the experience away from a player who isn't concerned with achievements. If nothing, there should have been a marker of some kind that makes you aware of the presence of one such console in the vicinity; in its current form, this forces you to either miss a part of story or keep a youtube video open in your web browser and keep a check to find the 10 hidden consoles - something I think is unnecessary and unfair.Except for that one very specific nitpick, I have found the game to be perfect. If you are the kind of person who requires a set number of hours of gameplay to justify the pricetag, go for this on a sale. Otherwise, in all fairness, the Devs have earned that money, and my eternal respect.EDIT: My playtime is displayed as 11 hrs+ whereas I have not taken more than 7 hours, including being stuck at 2-3 levels for half an hour or so (the rest is idle minimize-time). The 7 hours also includes getting 100% in Steam and in-game, and thus should be the actual maximum playtime this game has to offer (unless you replay, that is).			"

From the eerie static noises in the background and the Claymation style, it sucks you in quite a bit for a Metroidvania style puzzle game.

												The Swapper is a puzzle game where you must watch yourself die hundreds of times. Imagine if every time you rewound in braid a corpse remained, some phantom Tim. The Swapper is a game that forces you to line up these little sacrifices, and it does so ingeniously. The only way to climb a shaft, for example, is to copy yourself a bit higher, swap your active mind into the copy, and so on-- all the while falling. Eventually you can copy yourself onto a ledge. And all those discarded bodies you inhabited just moments before? They keep falling.Then their legs crack, bodies pitch forward, ragdolls bereft of consciousness left piled on the floor below.The swapper is dark, maudlin even, and its music(what little there is) is of the horror-scifi genre of deep thumpy basses and synthy plinking highs. It takes itself very seriously and, in its worst moments, can feel a bit silly. At its best moments, it's emotionally affecting and clever. I love it when a game makes me feel smart one moment, manipulated the next, then smart again. It's a balancing act that's hard to pull off.If you're a puzzle platformer fan, you'll find lots to like here. Gravity manipulation reminiscent of a slower-paced VVVVVV meets braid's beat-the-falling-obstacle-in-slow-motion freneticism, while managing to feel more cerebral and self-paced than either. In general feel, that is to say the way you run about and leap and whatnot, it reminds me very much of Oddworld; Abe's Oddysey. The Swapper's exactly the length it ought to be to get all of its ideas on the table, to get all of the toys out of the toychest, which means it can be completed in ten or so hours. There are secrets, too, if you're OCD. God knows I am.This is easy to recommend, a haunting experience that nonetheless leaves you with a kind of satisfaction. That of a puzzle well-solved.			"

Of the several dozen puzzles the game offers, I couldn't solve about 4 of them (requiring me to search the interwebs for a solution). Just a thought: if certain lights prohibit you from either making a clone, swapping with a clone, or both, then why not just break those light bulbs? We wouldn't have a puzzle game I guess lol.The Swapper has my highest recommendation, a must play for puzzle game fans.			"

												This is my first puzzle platformer and I was kinda reluctant as to how it will go. Boy, was I in for a surprise. There is not much complication interms of multiple things to use to solve a puzzle, all what you need is given to you at the start of the game! The game is gorgeous to look at in the space setting and the music is subtle and just right and it does make you feel lost in this beautiful world where everything seems paaceful. THe level of puzzle solving keeps increasing but a nice pace so that you have a grasp on what you can and cannot do. Whenever I felt stuck I tried a few different things and when everything comes together the feeling of satisfaction is much more than you would get from other games.If you were ever reluctant to try a puzzle game or were reluctant because you thought you aren't good at it, START HERE!

The story is unsettling, with just the right hint of horror, it drew me in right away. Playing through a second time is entirely worth it, and sheds a different light on every line of dialogue. The puzzles are brilliant, increasing in difficulty at the perfect pace. They keep you struggling just enought to feel incredibly rewarded with each success, but not enough to become frustrated at your failures. The art was stunning to behold, every little detail lending itself perfectly to the visual experience. 10/10 I would 100% recommend.			"

The Swapper is a game that forces you to line up these little sacrifices, and it does so ingeniously. The only way to climb a shaft, for example, is to copy yourself a bit higher, swap your active mind into the copy, and so on-- all the while falling. Eventually you can copy yourself onto a ledge. And all those discarded bodies you inhabited just moments before? They keep falling.Then their legs crack, bodies pitch forward, ragdolls bereft of consciousness left piled on the floor below.The swapper is dark, maudlin even, and its music(what little there is) is of the horror-scifi genre of deep thumpy basses and synthy plinking highs. It takes itself very seriously and, in its worst moments, can feel a bit silly. At its best moments, it's emotionally affecting and clever. I love it when a game makes me feel smart one moment, manipulated the next, then smart again. It's a balancing act that's hard to pull off.If you're a puzzle platformer fan, you'll find lots to like here. Gravity manipulation reminiscent of a slower-paced VVVVVV meets braid's beat-the-falling-obstacle-in-slow-motion freneticism, while managing to feel more cerebral and self-paced than either. In general feel, that is to say the way you run about and leap and whatnot, it reminds me very much of Oddworld; Abe's Oddysey. The Swapper's exactly the length it ought to be to get all of its ideas on the table, to get all of the toys out of the toychest, which means it can be completed in ten or so hours. There are secrets, too, if you're OCD. God knows I am.This is easy to recommend, a haunting experience that nonetheless leaves you with a kind of satisfaction. That of a puzzle well-solved.			"

												It's an amazing game which isn't really that popular (at least I think anyway).I'll start off with the graphics, wow! I thought since it was an indie game the graphics were going to look a little bad for a game like this but they are amazing!The gameplay is great and the puzzles are fun and creative, theres sometimes alternative puzzles to do if you get stuck on one for a while.The game is extremely original and creative, adding something I never saw in a game (swapping between different characters to do puzzles)It reminded me of Portal, with a similar concept but lots of things different in between.If this game is ever on sale I highly highly reccomend.The only bad thing I can say is it was a big short to play.10/10 buy it now.

												Short but good puzzle game. Pretty creepy atmosphere and awesome soundtrack. The story requires you to seek out terminals, read log entries, and put the pieces together. It can be convoluted but if you take time to read it all and pay attention to the radio-chatter during gameplay you are left with a thought-provoking story about clones, loosing your mind and existentialism.

												Neat little puzzle game with atmospheric spacey visuals and engaging mystery storyline that wraps up nicely in the end, yet leaves you wondering about the central themes of the game. Puzzles were somewhat easy or intermediate level, with only 1 or 2 real killers, so this can be completed by people who dont even like puzzling and such. Highly recommended!			"

												The player has a cloning and consciousness swapping tool, with which he has to overcome obstacles to collect orbs, which open door and teleports to access new areas of the map, and reveal more about the existential space SF story.Personally, I found the mysterious story and clay model graphics very intruiging, but the puzzles just seemed like always the same thing returning with greater complexity. Below, my first hour of gameplay, you can follow my thought process and practically see a light go up when I solve the first puzzles.

												Beautiful game, great puzzles, incredible audio design and story. Not without flaws, though; while it seems open-ended and not every puzzle per area is required to move on, the ending requires you to backtrack and finish any puzzles you missed. In addition, there's a choice at the end and you can only make one; resuming your save takes you directly to the credits.These small issues don't detract too much from the overall game, though, and what a game it is; innovative puzzles and a great experience.

												Wow! What a game! I'm almost upset I didn't get around to playing this sooner. This game is a pretty non-standard puzzle-platformer, based around the central mechanic of creating clones and swapping places with them. The puzzle design is really excellent. Builds on itself very well and continually teaches the player through very fluid, dynamic progression. The visual astethic is extremely unique and very cool. The environments and atmosphere are all very dark and cold, and portray an appropriate degree of isolation and/or solitude. The story, though, is where this game really floored me. Without giving anything away, it's way more philosophical and interesting than I ever would have expected from a game of this type. I cannot applaud enough how much I loved this game's story and themes.10/10, absolutely get this game.			"

												The Swapper is one of the best puzzle games I've played. The puzzles get challenging fast, but they're designed in a way that the solution always seems within reach. Sometimes it's more straightforward than you thought, but the more devious ones are more complicated than they first seem. Either way, sometimes I'd just enter a room, try to figure out the riddle, then quit out the game and take a break if I didn't find a solution. But I never had the temptation to check out a guide. I loved the design in the puzzles too much to succumb to that. It's also way too satisfying to figure it out on your own, even if some are complex. Basic concept of The Swapper is that you can create up to 4 clones of yourself, which behave exactly like you do, and you can swap consciousness with them. The consequence is that the body you leave behind is just an empty vessel, which you can use as a tool, a means to an end.The developers actually run with this concept and a big part of the (surprisingly great) story revolves around the clones and the concept of a soul and the complexity of mind and matter. The story resonates because you are constantly hands-on with the overarching theme of the game. If you have to do a cruel thing to one of your clones, it hits home. The memorable finale is a culmination of all the soul-searching (and swapping) you had to do to get there.The Swapper could've just been a series of brilliant puzzles and I would've loved it already, but they fleshed it out and created an interesting universe around it. To top it all off, there are the numerous echoes of Metroid and Alien, giving you an eerie sense of isolation. Rarely do you get such a flawless fusion of gameplay, concept and story. This game is a gem, that a lot of people seem to be sleeping on. You shouldn't. Play it, it's brilliant.			"

												The swapper is a decent puzzle platformer with decent ambience, fresh gameplay mechanics and in my view, some of the most beautiful backgrounds yet seen in a sidescroller. My one major gripe with some of the game's design choices center around the developers decision to use really thin fonts in the logs that expand on the story. Probably won't be an issue for most users, but if you have problems reading in low light, you may need to occasionally head over to a wiki to read up the terminal logs.. otherwise you might end up missing a rather thought-provoking story. Still highly recommended however.p.s: The achievements in this game be maybe impossible to find on your solo playthrough. Unless you are extremely lucky, you are going to need a guide. Go for it, as you can't revisit the unlocked stages to get them once the credits roll.Good luck.			"

												This is an excellent game.As someone who enjoys puzzle games like this with compelling art directions and an interesting narrative I found this game very pleasing to play. The unique graphics and muffled or static-like space sounds work together to create an atmosphere that makes you want to explore the ship more and immerses in the feeling of isolation apart from the woman you speak to throughout the game.The puzzles have an ejoyable quality to them where they can be both frustrating, yet rewarding if successfully completed. There are no hints or any sort of handholding in the game. Similar to other puzzle games of this style, everything about solving puzzles is communicated via the conditions of the puzzles; which typically consist of some sort of obstacles and more than pressure switch. The times I found myself unsure of what to do were due largely to me not realizing what a particular puzzle was trying to communicate to me, as far as how I could use the swapper.I honestly can't comment on how long the game is because it took me a VERY long time to finish it, but I am quite pleased with it.

												I'll say I got this game in a humble bundle a while back. It had just been sitting in my library the whole time without me ever realizing what this game was. After I had finished one game in my library, I had stumbled across this title. It peaked my curiousity and I gave it a shot. I am so glad I did, because this game is fantastic! The puzzle mechanics work so well. You will get to a point where you think you can solve just about any puzzle they can throw at you and then they give you one that genuinely forces you to think about how you approach it. The atmosphere is wonderful. I love the clay animation style they went with and the empty feeling of the world that the audio provides. This game is solid and if you are a fan of puzzles in general, I would highly reccommed this game!			"

												Extremely well-executed puzzle game. The environment is very unique, the character modeling is engaging, the game mechanic is elegant, and the puzzles themselves are challenging, sometimes requires thought across multiple gaming sessions, until the a-ha moment arrives. Best of all, the puzzles do not require precise timing or pixel-hunting.The slowly-evolving storyline is...meh...not my cup of tea. It attempts to raise a singular philosophical point but in my opinion, it is a disjointed, uncompelling story justification for a puzzle game.			"

												Well... was so good I just sat there and finished it in one go.Really good puzzle platformer, a sort of mix between LIMBO and portal, but longer than both (took me 5 hours).The cloning / swapping mechanism - which the whole game is based on - is unlocked from the start, and simple to learn, but the difficulty ramps up rather fast and you find yourself often forced to think outside the box.The difficulty was challenging but just about right. You can skip some rooms and revisit them later (once you've done the last rooms, they will seem easy!). A couple of time I almost felt the temptation to youtube some solutions, but thankfully I resisted the urge and forced myself to think all the way!A pure pleasure; one of those few game that make you feel you became smarter after you played them.Oh and I almost forgot to mention, the art is beautiful and the story well thought provoking.

												Alright, I've been playing this for about three hours now. I definitely am enjoying this game. The setting, the atmosphere, the sobering graphics....they are all top notch. The 2-D scrolling with lush backgrounds works quite well (this is much the same as Deadlight as far as the way in which the background is presented as something vibrant but untouchable).So, the gameplay is pretty straight forward, but the difficulty definitely spikes after about an hour, and at the point I'm at now, some of the puzzles seem near impossible. This isnt a bad thing, and I know there is a solution for all of them, but they really get incredibly challenging in my opinion.Speaking of gameplay, it's a simple affair. A and D to move around, W or space to jump, E to activate objects, S to hold movable objects. The mouse is used to adjust view, project and swap your clones. All your clones move together, and you can have a total of four out there at any time.The puzzles themselves are mostly color oriented with pressure plates, deadfalls, jumps, etc...entering into the mix. There are also a couple zero gravity sections where you have to adjust your gameplay a bit.Anyway, this is definitely a fun, intense game well worth trying out.Now, a couple SPOILERS....SPOILERS....SPOILERSWhen you are projecting your clone, the game slows down to a crawl. You can use this to help slow your falls and time your swaps while falling, which you will need to do. You can also use swapping to basically climb through the air.The story has taken on a touch of sci-fi horror at the point I'm at. I've uncovered about 2/3 of the map so far, and I imagine the story will get a bit darker as it continues. There are weird, seemingl;y intelligent stones throughout the complex. They all have a thought stored in them. I am guessing that as people were experimenting with the swapping devices initially, their thoughts/memories were transfered to the stones, and possibly their bodies were possessed by the minds of the alien stones. This is strictly specualtion on my part right now though, but I thought it would be fun to see if I was correct or not.Achievements; These have nothing to do with gameplay, the story, or anything else. They are each linked to hidden messages found throughout the game. You cant see where they are and the means to get to them is never obvious (they are in blacked out sections that dont look like you can actually access). I havent actually found any, but I just watched a video on them and realized I missed 6 or 7 of them already.SPOILERS END HEREAll in all, TL:DR, but enjoy regardless.			"

												Brilliant Puzzle-Platformer!You take over the role of an unnamed astronaut who finds a mysterious device, which can create a clone of yourself and also swap yourself (your soul?) into it.You have to make use of your swapping-device to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.You also get some background story through log-entries and narration, which i found pretty fascinating (almost philosophical and very mature).If you like puzzle-platform games, then this is highly recommended!

												Unique, challenging and fun. Progression is determined by solving numerous puzzles, some of which will have you screaming ""it's impossible!"", until you solve it while doing something completely different and feel like a genius. With minimal tutorials, each new puzzle requires both strategic planning and a flair of creativity, and are for the most part highly rewarding to solve. The story starts off slowly and the puzzles distract you, but as you progress the narrative comes together in an subtle, interesting way, striking deep. The art style is beautiful and the music soft. There is a lot of silence, which suits a game set on an derelict station drifting in space; the ambience complements the narrative very well.Take the time to appreciate the environment and story as you progress and this game will surely impress.

												This reminds me of Portal 1, except it was entertaining.The game uses a clone puzzle mechanic. Some puzzles are difficult, while others are 'oh, I just needed to do that?'. You need to think sometimes.Art direction is unique and you've NEVER played a game that looks like it.The real cream on this cake comes from the plot. It's got philosophy; plus, it doesn't cross the line and muddle it with junk science. Unlike the god awful movie Prometheus which was marred worse than a 6 year old to a rabid dog, the science is rarely talked about in The Swapper, and the ambiguous themes are made known.There are two endings (maybe a third, I don't know; probably not) and I chose to retain my identity, even if it were for a minute longer. Yes, the story makes you think, too.			"

												Got this on sale, for I believe 2.69, I'd say even full price is something I'd be okay with giving, this game is perfect, albeit a very obvious tribute to the movie ""MOON"". Regardless, soundtrack though scarse fits perfectly, setting up a very bleak and scary-like atmosphere, the story is not annoying and not in your face, but the best part about the game is the gameplay. There is one puzzle I couldn't figure out myself and had to look at an online solution, and I was really close to it, in terms of logic. I say if you're looking at alternatives to Portal, I think this is the closest, if not better, approximation to it.			"

												I'm still at the beginning of the game, so I'll update this review as I play more.The Swapper is a puzzle game with a really nice atmosphere and somewhat beautiful graphics. The sound effects doesn't stand out as much as the graphics but they do their job.I mean, you're in space. There isn't a lot of noise in space.As you may already know, in this game you can create 1 to 4 controlable clones and swap control between them. The concept may sound simple at first but there's an incredible amount of depth to it. You can use your clones for a lot more of stuff than just swapping places, moving boxes and pressing buttons. The developers really put a lot of thought into it.And even though the level design, puzzles and gameplay are great, for some reason I can't get addicted to this game (and that's not necessarily a good or bad thing).In my opinion it's an above average puzzle game. The concept isn't THAT original or anything, but it's still a lot better than most games out there. If you are into puzzle games you may want to check this game as soon as possible but if puzzles aren't really your thing you may want to wait until it's on sale.			"

												The Swapper is a puzzle platformer set in deep space. The premise is simple: you can clone yourself up to four times and take control of one of these clones at the same time. This unique gimmick also grants a number of unique puzzles. And these puzzles are great. The game rarely tells you what to do, only explains some basics and the rest is up to you. The puzzles themselves are highly enjoyable, challenging and really require you to think outside of the box. However, a few of these puzzles are so insanely difficult that even the most seasoned puzzlers have to kill the pride any puzzle game can offer, and look for help on the web. Other puzzles require such pinpoint precision that even that becomes frustrating. Difficulty aside I have nothing to complain about. The graphics are gorgeous, supposedly entirely made from clay, but I would've believed it to be the U3 engine just as well. The setting is really dark, a bit creepy even and perfectly fits with the idea of a derelict space station. There's some replayability for finding hidden rooms and an alternate ending, but puzzlers lose their charm after the solution has been found. One final applause for the story of the game, which is just as mindblowing as some of the later puzzles. Hollywood quality writing there, with plenty of room for your own interpretation. I should, however, tell you as little about it as possible. Looking for a challenge? Looking for a great puzzler? Looking for an awesome, open-ended story? The Swapper won't disappoint you. + Unique mechanics and puzzles+ Challenging!+ Wonderful setting and fitting graphics+ Mindblowing story- Too challenging?8.5/10			"

												This game is hands down the most beautiful game I have ever played. The effort put into making everything in this game out of  clay and then putting the graphics into the game really paid off. The beautiful atmosphere coupled with the ambient noise establishes one of the most haunting environments in any video game. Also, the lack of NPCs in this game establishes the lonlieness and brings the gamer to question why they are here and what is going on here. The simple mechanic that is 'The Swapper' is really well done throughout the entire game and the puzzles are very challenging. The puzzles are very creatively imagined and the beginning levels teach you a lot of what you are going to see in the future. The game very carefully introduces new themes and mechanics that keep building on top of one another.If you don't have this game you are really missing out on a great experience.10/10 would reccomend to anyone			"

The puzzles themselves were very well made, most of the solutions being hard to figure out, yet hiding in plain sight. Some of the zero gravity segments were a little disorientating but having the portals to different locations VVVVVV style, you didn't have to go through them more than once if you didn't have to.

												This is one of the best puzzle games I ever played in my entire life. The game immediately strikes the eye with a very atmospheric setting. The whole environment is beautifully crafted. To fully enjoy this, playing on a high resolution is recommended. The originality of this game is out of question. By creating clones of yourself, you have to try to get to things. The game slowly gets you going to get used to the cloning mechanics. The puzzles are challenging enough to give you a sweat, but never leave you frustrated. As the game goes on, the story unfolds with messages coming in different forms. The story evolves very well and wants you to solve the puzzles even more. The only downside I can think of is that the end comes to soon. If you like puzzle games, you won't be disappointed by this masterpiece.			"

												From Polygon: ""You are every clone, and every clone is you. And yet, every clone is dispensable. Death is the gameplay. The making and disposing of clones is as necessary as walking and jumping.""Gorgeous visuals, a creepy plotline and the unsettling feeling of killing hundreds of copies of yourself make this quite the experience. It's easy to get drawn into the sensation of exploring this beautiful, still world. And the sound design is just brilliant.The gameplay introduce new elements to you at a good clip, but not so fast that they become confusing or overwhelming, and the cloning mechanic means that it's not a simple rehashing of stuff we've seen before; puzzles are original, and engaging.Highly recommend.

												I'll start by saying to pick this up on sale. There isn't a ton to it, but it took me about 7-8 hours to finish. If you have an easier time with the harder puzzles, you might go faster. Once I knew the solutions, I could run through it again in under an hour, so it's really a two play-through game. More on that later. First, the game looks great. I grabbed it for the appearance and ambience and was not disappointed there. It is very creepy and pulls off its intended asthetic well. The lighting is done extremely well. You start by landing on a mysterious planet after having been sent off a space station in a drop pod. Then you find a device that lets you clone yourself and move into the different clones. You use this to solve puzzles and a story is slowly put in front of you. Often the clones will die, and often you will have to kill them to solve the puzzle. I went from not liking this, to not caring when I found out it didn't matter, then finished wondering if it actually did matter, but not being sure.As far as the story, it is told well. Most of the game, I thought it was a good story. There are some strange things going on, though the story might actually reveal a little too much that would have been better left mysterious. Eventually there will be a big reveal that is somewhat meaningful. Also, subtitles will matter, and I'd recommend having them off on your first play, then running through it again with them on.There are two endings. One is supremely unsatisfying and even stupid, and the other is questionable, but at least interesting.  Unfortunately, it autosaves but does not allow multiple load points. And one of these saves is the credit sequence. In an unbelievably silly oversight, in order to see the second ending, you have to run through the entire game again. And you can't go back and watch one of the several dialogue sequences either.Ultimately, I'm glad to have played the Swapper, but I'm also glad I didn't pay full price.			"

												The “artistic” puzzle/exploration game with strong philosophical undertones seems trendy of late. Especially with all these indie developers vying to be the one to finally get games recognized as “art”. But as Facepalm Games seems to understand, art isn’t about the destination. It’s about what brought you there.The Swapper does not lack for artistic content. All of the visuals are made from clay models and other real-world materials, given a fancy shader to make your unnamed spaceman’s flashlight bounce off their surfaces realistically. It’s beautiful in its simplicity and effectiveness, invoking a mood very reminiscent of the cult-classic 1972 sci-fi movie Silent Running.The Mr. Spaceman you play, comes across a strange device that lets you create clones and swap between them. All the clones mimic your movements exactly. The first time you get so caught up in solving a puzzle that you forget which one was “you” (which you then accidentally kill), is a very memorable moment. If a clone dies, it’s no big deal. You just make another. But there’s only one of you. Right?The puzzles get tricky, but frustration is offset due to the open-world nature of the space station. While you are gated somewhat, multiple puzzles are available to you at any time. Exploration leads to discovery, and clues about the strange sentient rocks everywhere in the station.			"

TL;DRThe Swapper is a stunning game with its atmosphere, soundtrack, narrative, and graphics commending each other extremely well.ReviewThe Swapper has a a rather dark narrative, with the plot  developing through moments of curiosity, to realization, and to sufferance. (Spoiler, hover over black area to reveal text)This game truly portrays the story in entirely pertinent fashion.Its somber, progressively haunting atmosphere is incredibly satisfying to play through.For a 2D Puzzle Platformer, the graphics/art style suits it so well.An occasional parallax effect on the background is not overdone at all and is extremely fit for the scene when used.The long and drawn out shadows combined with the aforementioned atmosphere compliment each other extremely well.The bloom effects can become a bit much, but I personally loved them.They gave a feeling quite reminiscent of a dusty, abandoned area which is the main setting for most of the game despite some well lit areas. (Spoiler, hover over black area to reveal text)All of these combined with the soundtrack in The Swapper bring out a rather solemn sentiment throughout the game.This last feature was the one that really, really sucked me into this game. Kind of like reading a really sad part in a book. You want to keep on reading but as you read, you just start to get the feels.Overall, I give this game a solid 9.5/10 "

												There are few games that ask the player to answer questions it raises, and even fewer that employ game-mechanics so focused on the narrative. The Swapper succeeds in the former category, but the latter feels not often thought out.Don't let what I've said turn you away. Sure, it's an artsy kind of platformer with a philosophical undertone, but the story is captivating to unravel for yourself and the gameplay is superb as well to make playing the game equally as challenging.What Makes It So Special?Unlike many artsy-smartsy platformers with almost zero mechanics, The Swapper will warrant you to play the game for its challenge as a puzzle game. It's undoubtly a game.In the Swapper, you have the ability to create copies of yourself and to transfer your ""soul"" to another clone. The game will slow down and you can place your clones with your mouse or right-thumbstick. This comes into play when you have more quick-reaction puzzles.Sounds simple, right? However, if you move one body it moves all of your clones with every movement. And if your clone dies or combines with yourself, you can make another clone. The Swapper's sense of challenge comes from this limitation; you have to manage all your copies at once, which would otherwise make the basic idea boring.For some puzzles with a large room/options, the puzzles can be daunting because of that added challenge. As a result, there always seems to be one--and only one--solution. If you were hoping for some versatility in your puzzles, then you probably won't like this game that much for its puzzles. The game sticks with its gimmick throughout the whole game, and it adds new puzzles/obstacles to keep things interesting. Colored lights that can disable some of the Swapper's abilities, reverse gravity jump-pads, switches, boxes, All of which use your clones in some way. Sometimes not as obvious as you might think. You do not need to collect everything in the game. You only need 100 orbs to beat the game. The rest of the rooms are for completionists, which will extend your playthrough for another few hours. But if you only care for the story, you can focus only on finding all the Watchers (althought numbers 20-something to 38 seem repeating dialogue of what you'll hear in the main-game.)The gameplay itself will make the Swapper become more familiar to you as you experiment with its mechanics, and the story will work off your experimentation to question just what it is your are doing exactly.Who Am I?""The one called the Swapper -- it manipulates minds by some method that is not persuasion or argument. Is it a weapon?""These scattered messages and seemingly random characters you encounter are how The Swapper presents its story. You'll be left with more questions than answers often, but you will get some concrete information to ground your answers. Instead of feeling like a cop-out for telling a story, the game knows when to give you information and when to keep the mystery at bay.That said, you don't need to brush up on your Kiekargaard, Descartes or your ancient Greeks to understand the kind of questions this game raises. It touches on philosophical quandries as timeless as the concept of souls and the perception vs. the reality of your identity.This method works within the game's narrative and mechanics, and as such they are asked in a more relatable/modern manner. Mostly through messages, conversations with a limited cast of characters and teleopathicconnections. As these are more interpretetitve ideas, the game focuses on raising the questions it wants you to ask of yourself, rather than straight-out giving an answer to everything.If you are going to do a philosophical game, this approach is definitely what you want to go for. (let the player ask and find their own answers.) However, and what can happen as a result of the storytelling method, the decision you make at the very end can either go over your head or feel kind of shallow if you don't care to figure it out.The other downside to this type of narrative is sometimes you'll raise questions that weren't meant to be asked.What is Gameplay-Narrative Dissonance?If that sounds too wordy/convulted of a phrase, then let me rephrase it like this, ""Why is that object/mechanic here? What does it do besides play a role in the game? Why would anyone design a space-station this way?""What breaks the immersion is this ""gamey"" feel about the game. In most cases, these are things I overlook because it's just a game. Sometimes, like in LISA or Undertale, the gamey-ness aspects are to subvert your expectations or to twist your perception of them.However, the Swapper does not do anything with its gamey qualities, which is asking for more questions from the player. Many of which I don't think are intended to be asked.For example, ""Why do the lights affect the Swapper? Why do they affect my copies (and why not me)?"" On this ship and on the planet below are these multicolored lights that are so precisely place to hide these orbs that unlock doors/systems. ""Why do these orbs power everything around here, and why are they put into these rooms like puzzles?"" So you can get around the station/planet. ""Wait, and you need the Swapper to get around this place, but they banned its usage. So how did everyone get around this place?""I realize this seems a rather pointless series of questions as most games don't care about how gamey they feel. However, if a game is trying to tie its mechanics so much into its story, and the story establishes some things about the usage of a mechanic, then these questions are going to be asked by the player and break the continuity of the story from the gameplay.The reason I stress this flaw is because as much harm you hear/read about the Swapper being used, you never really feel like using it comes with consequences.For example, there isn't a limit on how many times you can copy yourself nor any penalties. And despite the horror in the idea of the Swapper being misused, there's nothing said its effects cannot be undone. It's something the game assumes is a permanent choice, which affects how you interpret the ending.A Game Full of Questions, Void of Simple AnswersYou might come away thinking this game is nothing but sophistry. Or you might come away thinking you understand the ramifications of the game, and the attrocity of the Swapper itself. Or you might understand and like things about the gameplay and narrative but find that both were not in a happy marriage with each other.If you're interested in the mechanics or the story alone, buy the game on a sale.If you're interested in both the narrative and story, buy it whenever you want.Perhaps when you've been on the other side will you have a clearer mind. Or find yourself in more of a mess than what you began with. (But you'll still be the same, right?)			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.It's an interesting puzzleing game, with a surpresive and unique mechanics. You will need to clone yourself up to 4 times and be tricky by controlling all your clones at once, to achieve the goals.Puzzles start deceptively easy and increase in difficulty exponentially.A mind-bender. Not so hard and ""quantic"" as antichamber but, a really good one.If you enjoyed Portal, Antichamber and, that kind of surprisingly fresh takes on puzzleing games then, you OWE this game.That people that says it's short is because they went to some guide to solve the three or four really hard puzzles it has. Just a few seem impossible to imagine how to solve them. And, I confess I had to check some youtube video with a couple.Graphics aren't a deployment of art and technology but, perfectly serve to the overall atmosphear and mechanics of the game. Sound is also in same ball park.Story, is just an excuse to link everything toghether. Adds or substracts nothing.			"

												Play this game.  The gameplay gimmick is legitimately clever, the atmosphere is powerful and consistent throughout, and in a few short hours the is some legitimate ethical heavy lifting going on.  This game lives and breathes the spirit of weighty, lived-in 70s era science fiction movies.Some of the puzzles are less intuitive than others and your character is static in terms of abilities and powerups from beginning to end, but this is exactly the sort of philosophically engaged cooperative storytelling that games should be capable of and I guarantee that, minor though it may seem, the implications of the ending choice will stick with you after the credits roll, informed by everything you played through before.If you appreciate your sci-fi atmospheric, cinematic, morally challenging, and more than a little clever, do yourself a favor and play The Swapper.

												An absolutely amazing game. An extremely clever puzzle game that can have some very tough brain twisters. A few times, I had to take a break and come back later to see a new perspective on the puzzle. While the puzzles are brilliant, the real beauty of this game is in the story and atmosphere. The graphics, while not necesarily mind blowing, match and expand on the mood of the game perfectly. Having headphones is one of the best ways to play. The music Pushes the atmosphere even more than the graphics and sound amazing. Finally is the story. All of these aspects pull you into the narrative. I feel like the story could have been more direct though. So many different things are telling you small tidbits of information that I feel like there could have been more bigger story elements. A great example of this is near the end when everything builds to one moment only to have things drop off in an anticlimatic way. These shortcomings are easily forgotten when the game brings you to the end and requires you to make a morally challenging decision. As for the details, I will let you find that out. I would highly recommend this game to those who have the patience to work through this fantastic game.			"

The puzzles were awesome and challenging, the graphics were awesome, and the storyline was insane! I literally was so addicted to this game that I beat it in one run. I have only run this games once. This is one of the best games I have ever played and I am glad to have discovered it. Some of the puzzles were too easy, but then again, others were too hard. I loved this game and I am sad that I can't play it anymore because there is nothing left to do. 10/10GET THIS GAME NOW!			"

												A simple mechanic, the ability to create clones and swap your position with them, breaths new life into standard puzzles much like Portal did when it came out. The immersive story, enviorment, and soundtrack are all wonderful bonuses that explain the tale of how and why this swapping ability came to be.			"

												The Swapper is a small indie but don't let this fact deceive you.

It's a great visual and philosophic experience. If you like the genre, I would definitely recommend playing The Swapper.			"

												The Swapper is an incredible game. With an atmosphere reminiscent of the quietest moments in the first Dead Space, an art style that above all reminds me of the film Moon, and a very clever puzzle mechanic hinging on a cloning device allowing you to make up to 4 copies of yourself that mimic your movements. Its story explores the human condition more than any other piece of interactive sci fi I have come across, but it is not at the expense of gameplay. The moment to moment experience actually fuels the storyline which is sparsely but adeptly interwoven throughout your journey. Do yourself a favour and pick up the Swapper. It is cheap, memorable, mind-bending and very thought-provoking. It is up there with Limbo and Closure in my favourite indie games of all time, the only downside being that I wish there was more of this world to explore.			"

												This game certainly has some interesting ideas going for it, but the extremely unusual controls and relatively unengaging narrative are kind of a disapointment. The overall map design is extremely strange and difficult to follow. It never quite feels like I'm going the right way, this game would certainly be better set up completely linear. With all of that said, I don't want to bag on this game too much. I do think it's fun and a very cool idea. The setting is also relatively remniciant of Bioshock.

The story gives you a lot to thing about because it doesn't spell things out and because it's quite thought provoking. Stuff about what life really means and how can we define it. You have to find your own way and make of it what you will, both with the puzzles and story. Finally the atmosphere is superb. I really felt abandoned and alone, out there in the great void. I even lost myself in some of the puzzles. I couldn't see who I was anymore.In short+ Original and challenging puzzles + Good (and dark) atmosphere+ Interesting and thought provoking story			"

												Absolutely amazing game. Great and challenging puzzles, the learning curve is perfect, not easy by any means, but not hard enough to legitimately frustrate you. Atmosphere was great, very creepy and Super Metroid-esque. My only two complaints are both subjective and personal. I find the soundtrack a little bit lacking, and found myself playing my own music in the background because the nearly silent soundtrack put me on the brink of insanity(not literally). I don't know, maybe that is the point, having a spacey barely-there soundtrack just to give you the creeps. Again my own opinion. The other complaint is the story, maybe I'm just stupid and I completely missed the plot, or the story is just so spread and vague that no one knew what was happening. I think they tried to do something similar to Bioshock where survivors leave notes or recordings of their experiences etc. and you the player pick them up and infer what is going on. Although these memory stations are plenty, they are too vague to be of much value. Maybe it's like Inception, you kind of have to watch it like 5 times to get what exactly is going on.			"

												A thoughtful, scf-fi puzzler with a dark mood, an interesting premise and good story.  The puzzles were, at times, challenging, but not frustrating.  The ending was especially poignant and capped off an excellent, recomended game.			"

												This game is amazing! It is completely unique. It is like Portal in the sense that it is a puzzle game, but that's as far as it goes. At first I was skeptical about it, but as soon as I got to about 5 minutes in, I loved it. It's intriguing, facinating, and is by far the BEST side scroller I have even played. (Beats Mario) It shouldn't really be considered 2-D either, the graphics have depth and are very realistic. I was blown away by this game and reccomend it to anyone who liked Portal or other puzzle/campain style games.			"

												Audiovisually amazing, mechanically sublime and atmospherical like none other, The Swapper is a masterpiece of a puzzle game. Hand-crafted visual assets and beautiful ambient music create a wonderful feel to the game, which is only strengthened by the ingenious puzzle design around a simple core gameplay mechanic. The story is also impressive, handling such difficult topics as the very nature of consciousness and the existance of the human soul, and the ending is guaranteed to send chills down anyone's spine.You are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this work of art.

												Interesting enough, the designer of this game actually did some studying.For people who like languages (don't expect much deep about this matter in particular though) this shall be an interesting game. The mechanics are pretty amusing and together with the puzzles they are what make this game something different from your game-as-usual routine. Beside, what probably attracts the most of gamers to this kind of experience are its enigmas and superficial complexity, of some sorts, to figure stuff out, to decide their own outcome et cetera.It's also funny to mention that this is the first game I have finished without getting one single achievement. I guess one has to really explore the game to manage to get them. One more plus to this beautiful game, besides its shortness. (Yes, I believe that to be an advantage)Kudos for the small team which built it. Looking forward to their next game, if any.			"

												I will start by saying that this is a beautiful and atmospheric puzzle game with a good story line about what is life and soul. Everything about this game is good. Good story line , gameplay , graphics. The puzzles arent that hard so an average person can finish the game without the need of a walkthrough, afterall the main theme of the game arent the puzzles but the story.I enjoyed it without getting bored at all. The only negative thing i can found is that its 4-5 hours long (according to how fast you proceed,it took me 5hours) but still its ok. Basicly its more than enough to tell the story and to make you enjoy the puzzle games without getting bored of them.Even after playing the game a second time its still fun. The artstyle is amazing.Go buy this game~			"

												A beautiful and philosophical game with a single mechanic involving cloning and swapping between these clones. many puzzle platformers with a single mechanic gets boring and repetetive very fast, but not this game. because it uses this single mechanic in different clever ways and varies things up in a great pace. it is similar to fez in that regard; a single mechanic and a vast world to explore that gives the player the freedom to think outside the box and utilize their power in various scenarios.This game truly fits on the shelf among other indie heavy hitters such as limbo, braid or journeyon a side note: This game reminded me of ""the infinite ocean"" a free flash game available on armor games. its story is very different from the swapper and it is not even the same game genre. it's a point and click. but if you liked the swapper i can strongly recommend the infinite ocean because they share the same mysterious and haunting alone-in-space atmosphere and deals with the same tropes and concepts. asking similar mind blowing philosophical questions that really makes you think.

Eases into the puzzles but the game does tend to break your brain after a while (at least mine. hah).Still a game to keep your eye on or possibly wait till its bundled.			"

												Nice for a play-through or two, but this game is so linear, it's not really worth any more than that.While it's very linear and straightforward (and, except for a few of the puzzles, not very challenging), this game does touch on some philosophical topics. It does so in a very hazy way, though - the true depth of the topics is barely hinted at, never tangible or clearly defined.If you want some material on discussions about death, identity and (possibly) the human soul, this game might interest you - otherwise, I'd recommend finding another puzzle platformer, as this one is fairly easy.

												I tried, but could not like the swapping puzzle solving mechanic. The game is short, and the puzzles are all wildly different, so there's no time to familiarize yourself enough with the swapper device to start understading its uses as a tool. Maybe a longer tutorial, or slower rising complexity in the puzzles woud have helped.I recommend it anyway cause the story is that good. "

												This actually plays pretty well. I liked this more than antichamber (the other puzzle game ive played recently) as this has a very fluid approach. Generall easy puzzles (save for one or two ) so I'd put this more on the casual side. The achievements are probably something you have to know ahead of time. Atmosphere and such are great for an indie game and its quite polished. Most interesting thing I'd have to say is how abilities and mechanics are explored. When you start the game you have full functionality over the gun, however the puzzles serve to slowly explain to you all the possibilities of the gun.			"

												I did enjoy playing this game, but was ultimately disappointed. The game was far too short and ended extremely abruptly. The puzzles were phenomenal, but I feel the game could have been further developed. This feeling was compounded by the fact that I did not unlock a SINGLE achievement during my playthrough, as the achievements are less ""achievements"" and more ""secrets"" scattered throughout the game, nearly impossible to find without using a guide. If you can withstand the feeling of emptiness after completing this game and seeing it not reach its true potential, then by all means, give it a whirl. But it was awfully disappointing for me.			"

												Pros:Fun and challenging gameplay.Interesting philosophical points are made.Cons:Ignores a number of important issues brought up by the aforementioned philosophical points (and how they relate, or rather, are completely invalidated by, the gameplay).One of the choices thrown in at the end is poorly explained, resulting in quite a different outcome than expected, and there is no way to view the other ending without replaying the *entire game* all over again.Railroads the player in order for the writer(s) to display their ""deep"" philosophy and ending choices, instead of allowing for sensible alternatives.Conclusion:If you like challenging puzzle games, and don't care about the story, it's relatively good.Personally however, any game that puts this much emphasis on the story, and executes it so poorly, is a game I can't enjoy.

The game shines from it's simplicity; but yet challenging enough that it's not a cakewalk. I beat the game in ~7 hrs; and most of the puzzles took ~5-8 minutes average (longer for the last few that really make you think).My only con is that there isn't more!If you like simple puzzle games with atmosphere, then for the price (especially if on sale) you can't go wrong.8\10 "

												I want to recommend this game, but I don't think I can. At least, not at full price. I liked it, but didn't love it.I appreciate the philosophy 101, even if it is a bit pretentious and heavy handed, it's nice to see a small team take a respectable stab at a subject like this. I don't think I could realistically do much better in a format meant for as wide an audience as possible, without intentionally leading the audience to one conclusion or another by the end.Speaking of the end, I really felt it could have been handled much better. My own reasoning behind the choice that I made turned out to have nothing at all in common with the reasoning the writers assumed that I had, and the forced consequence seemed extremely contrived as a result. There is *A Choice* and it is worth pondering for awhile, but ultimately you find that it is meaningless either way. (Much like philosophy 101)The puzzles are fairly straightforward with one or two of them taking a little while to work out, but none of them were particularly daunting. A bit more complexity would have been more rewarding and enjoyable. Apparently they were too hard for some reviewers, but I suppose you'll always have some on the bottom end of the curve, no matter how easy you make it.The artistic direction of using claymation was well executed and a neat idea. They definitely get style points for that.The gameplay is decent and it doesn't detract from the fairly well executed narrative in the front seat, but in the end the game is simply too short for the asking price, with a rather unsatisfying ending. If this is a game you're interested in, pick it up when it's < $5 and expect to spend a casual afternoon or evening with it.			"

While this game was really fun - challenging and engaging puzzles, fantastic atmosphere, interesting story - There is a point of NO RETURN in this game, where all the various logs and goodies that you collect while playing the game (things you may not have looked over in their entirety for the sake of finishing puzzles or moving on) are GONE. You have to make a choice for which ending you want to see, and once you've done that, there's no reviewing old information or any chance to see the other ending(s?). I really enjoyed this game and became VERY disappointed after I finished it. I really don't want to play through it again just to double check to see if I misread or didn't understand any of the dialogues.			"

												The Swapper has so much going for it in the way of being a good puzzle platformer. The swapper device itself makes for some really interesting and difficult puzzles, as well as some really cool platforming. I also have to say that this game is very pretty and does a wonderful job of creating atmosphere and a feeling of isolation.However, the one glaring problem with The Swapper is the ending. For all the difficult puzzle-solving that one has to go through to get to the end, what you are left with is two choices, neither of which feel satisfying or fair. I'm going to avoid spoiling it, but it was enough to completely change my opinion about the game.			"

												The Swapper is a simple little puzzle/adventure game that ultimately fails to impress. While the cloning and swapping mechanic is neat and some of the later puzzles can be head-scratchers, the game lacks cohesion between its individual elements, leaving the experience somewhat hollow.The game begins with you in control of a nameless astronaut after being ejected, for reasons unknown, from a space station orbiting an alien planet. As you emerge from your escape pod planetside, you begin your quest to discover exactly what is going on. It's not long before you find the titular Swapper device, which allows you to create clones of yourself (that respond to control inputs in time with you) and transfer your control perspective between them as long as you have a line of sight. After getting a handle on the mechanics, you quickly come back aboard the space station Theseus, only to find it virtually devoid of life. It's here that the game begins properly, and sticks itself in a very basic loop until the end. You traverse the ship, solve puzzles to find energy-orbs, then use the orbs to power devices that open new sections of the ship.The problem with this is that while the game is supposedly about uncovering a mystery, there is no mystery whatsoever in its environment. Each orb is found within its own little isolated room with its own little puzzle. And since these rooms exist only to hold the puzzles, it makes the entire space station feel less like a place where people lived and worked and more like an excuse to give the player some downtime in between puzzles. After all, why would space explorers and researchers need a room with two man-sized switches on opposing sides of the same platform that control colored lights that limit the use of the Swapper? The rest of the Theseus is equally impractical in its design, requiring extensive use of the Swapper just to get around. Granted, it would've been pretty boring to not use the game's central gimmick during map traversal, but the whole thing still feels like shallow pretense. A potential alternative to these issues could have been to have the space station be thoroughly destroyed, with the orbs placed evenly throught the station rather than in rooms dedicated to them. Crumbling walls, collapsed ceilings, generally broken machinery and other structures could have made the Swapper's unnatural traversal method fit more naturally in the setting. Alternatively, the developers could have done away with the station entirely, making the game nothing more than a series of puzzles chosen from a menu, perhaps with a basic level editor included so the community could create and share their own puzzles, maybe even compete for best times or fewest Swaps a la Portal. But perhaps that suggestion is out of line, as this game has a story that it wants to tell.The plot is one aspect of this game that I have no major gripes against. The dialogue is natural, it raises some philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of consciousness, the mystery unravels at an appropriate pace, and its general tone and themes are accompanied well by the visuals and music. My only criticisms are that the cutscenes are unskippable (but thankfully on the short side) and that there are two endings decided by a final binary choice. Normally I wouldn't mind that sort of thing, but unless you do some clever save file manipulation, you'll have to replay the game a second time to see the other one. And since you've already solved all the puzzles and seen all the unskippable cutscenes, it's pretty boring the second time around. The only potential saving grace of a subsequent playthough is finding the hidden text logs to get the achievements, but the vast majority of them are so obtusely hidden, it's unlikely you'll find them without a guide (unless you're a fan of trying to create clones in areas that look like totally solid walls, anyway). And they don't even tell you anything about the story you didn't already know.However, all of that said, this game can be reasonably enjoyable for exactly one playthrough. It's very pretty to look at, pleasurable to listen to, and it story and puzzles will definitely give you some things to ponder. If that sort of thing intrigues you, maybe grab it when it's on sale for about $5 or so. Just don't expect anything brilliant or amazing here.			"

												100% on another game....And hold onto your socks for this one....Swapper tries too hard to be Metroid and Portal in one.  A ""PortalTroid"" if you will.  Know what I'd rather be playing instead of this game?  Metroid and Portal.Great graphicsNice (not great or good) musicNice controlsNow to cut to the chase.....the story is terrible.   The characters are bland and are easily forgetable.  Rather than speaking lamen's terms, everyone has to talk in a damn riddle with complex English....stuff that won't even matter in the end.The puzzles can be good, but you'll learn soon enough that they're just there to prolong the game.  The game doesn't really reward you for getting farther, it instead throws more philosophical crap in your face.I tried to make myself like it.  Even after a 2nd playthrough just to figure out what the **** happened without getting many answers.If you want some puzzles with a twist, go for it I guess.   If you want to save your sanity, pick up Metroid or Portal and save yourself a lot of hassle.EDIT:  I tried a 3rd playthrough of this game since I've seen many people rate this review down.....sorry, but I simply can't say it's a good game.

												This game has a pretty cool game mechanic, you create clones and swap who you control. It also has good atmosphere and I liked how you could choose which puzzles to tackle. however, the difficulty of the puzzles is frustrating to the point where I gave up. You can call me whatever names you want but many of the puzzle solutions are difficult and extremely hard to figure out. If you think you're up to it go ahead, but it just doesn't have the same satisfaction as other puzzle games like Portal, Gunpoint. Oddworld, point and click games, etc. which have puzzle difficulty that is suitable for a gaming audience. I would not recommend this for the majority of gamers, but if you're extremely intelligent go ahead.This game's absurd challenge three hours in turned me off from it, which is a shame because the game really does look and play nicely and the core concept is ingenious. If there was a mix of action and puzzles maybe it would have been better. You might have a different experience though so if you can handle a game that is cerebrally more difficult than what you're used to from puzzle games, give it a go.			"

												The Swapper is a puzzle plattformer, but I wouldn't call this game a plattformer. You don't have to go through difficult jump passages and there aren't enemies or something similar in the game. You just walk from room to room to solve puzzles with your clones to unlock new rooms with even more puzzles. Every puzzle has to be solved with only 2 abilities: Make clones, and take controll over them. In the middle of the game when the puzzles become more challenging you also use the ability to invert gravity. That makes the game one-sided. The story is only told by text-logs you can find. I think in the puzzle-plattformer genre there're much better games which are more ""plattformer"" and have more varying puzzles.			"

												The gimmick is great and very well-realized, but... creating clones to get the first few orbs is entertaining, getting another dozen is tolerable, and then it becomes such a damned drag as you solve variations of the same exact ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle again, and again, and again, and again and AGAIN and again and agaaaaain ad nauseam.Production-wise, it's uneven. Graphics are pretty, but sometimes bloom's so intense that it's hard to see what's happening. Music is generic melancholic piano tunes that take away from the atmosphere because of how terribly trite they are. Story is decent, but writing is questionable, often purple, with aliens speaking like tumblr webcomic characters, which conflicts with the extra-srs tone. Voice acting is nice.			"

												A new and creative concept with nice music and good atmosphere. But that does not save the game from being incredibly frustrating and repetitive.The puzzles are mainly made up of pressing buttons that switch red and blue lights off and on, and your having 4 clones that you have to use to solve them. They are made more frustrating by bad controls.For example, if you tap the jump button your character barely lifts from the ground, in what seems like a unnecessary move in the game, I found no use for it anywhere. And if you hold in the jump button, the character performs what I would characterize as a normal jump. There are boxes which you have to jump over and drag/push, and too often you don't hold the button long enough, causing the character to instead tilt the box and make it roll away from you, instead of jumping over it. First time I've experienced this in a puzzle/platformer game and it's so bad it almost becomes a deal breaker in itself. Developers could learn a thing or two from Mark of the Ninja, or other platformers with tight controls.At first the atmosphere was great and the music augmented that in a very nice way. Unfortunately, once you start rolling boxes around when you mean to jump over them, and you experience the ""flap"" sound of your clones dying and dying and dying, after you try one puzzle after another, you quickly get bored to death. Puzzles are not necessarily hard, but with the way they are organized it takes time to move around the room and solve them, even if you know and see what the solution is. And you often have to switch to another clone mid-air. If you miss that switch by 1/10 of a second and die for the nth time, the game just deteriorates to being tedious and boring.			"

												I'm going to be biased here and not recommend this one because I got stuck way too early on. But what I am missing might be easy enough for someone else to figure out. And getting stuck that early and not being far enough into the story to care, I think I will just let this one go for now. To this game's credit, though, the idea behind it - to clone the player character and swap to the clones to get around the levels and complete puzzles - is pretty cool.			"

												It looks really cool (graphics are well-digitized clay models), it plays smoothly enough and has some unique ideas, but it fails to be all it could be.  The signature swapping mechanic is overused and gets really tiresome after awhile, and the story, while conceptually fascinating, is ambiguous and threadbare in execution.  And regardless of which ending you choose . . . you wind up with something short and murky and depressing and decidedly indie (I'm talkin' ""indie film festival"" indie).  To close on a positive, the sound is really quite excellent. "

												I really want to play this game, it looks really awesome. The only problem is that me and some other people are not able to get past the first minute of the game due to a glitch that no one has reported the fix to. We've tried deleting the appcache and restarting and all that, nothing works. What happens is when you're first prompted to make a clone, there is no space on the screen that allows clone-spawning. If you click Start it spawns a clone after you resume the game, but you're stuck in slo-motion forever, and can't leave the room.I want to give this a good rating, but the fact that it's unplayable for me and several others makes it impossible to do so.Please fix this problem, powers that be.

												I've played this game twice. Rather an interesting concept in the game and the puzzles are enjoyably crafted, though a few require more twitch reflex skills than out of the box thinking and discovery. It has beautifully crafted atmosphere and unrelenting loneliness, and the section with radiation and zero-G are exceptionally fun. But that's where the good ends. This game is burdened with two huge things. Non-Intergrated Puzzlers and a story that doesn't even begin to ask the question let alone even provide enough background to surmise your answers. A bane of puzzlers, pretty much all the key puzzles are rooms, set aside from all the rest to perform route actions to acquire security keys. The rest of the rooms tend to have obvious, at best, to the solutions the problems with. Swap gravity with plates, use clones and swap to when falling. Getting to some of the secret rooms take some doing, but of course they also require you to know there are invisible openings in the walls or when the foreground covers the screen, you to guess that ""Oh hey, I should jump!"" which you'll find more from cocking about than honest exploration. And this is ignoring, again, teh puzzle rooms are distinct from the rest of the game and just random rooms on the space station with specially made lights to block your puzzle gun which serve zero purpose of being on the space station. The only reason set aside puzzle rooms worked in Portal is because of the testing narrative, puzzle games need to understand that.Second, the story. WIthout spoilers, the game introduces a rather radical concept, says a few things about it, and then ends. Since the EFFECTS of the thing aren't even shown until you meet the very end of the game, one would assume then you'd be told some of the things. But instead you spend most of your time on, mysterious rocks. Mysterious rocks. Who's leader is a tiki head. The game doesn't even explain how a bunch of mysterious rocks killed the crew, just that they are all scary and stuff. It's meaninglessly vague. It doesn't add depth for me not to understand how they interact and damage the human psyche. It's one thing to leave the titular swapper's morality and function purposefully vague, I interact with it constantly and me making decisions on it from the effects it has from how I use it does add depth. But since instead of having THAT happen, given the isolated puzzler rooms and people saying no more than vague, throw away statements about it and then back to the ROCKS, you learned absolutely nothing about it than its bare functionality. It doesn't even give you enough information to let you even define a reasonable theory around what exactly is its purpose, how it was made, what technology it uses, or why it can transfer consciousness (Or Souls) around with beings. The entire damn story until the very final choice is entirely centered around those damn rocks. If I were to write a story that centered around rocks, even rock golems that could move around or psychic rocks, I would be laughed out of the room as a writer. Nobody wants to hear stories about rocks that somehow managed to kill the crew in some unspecificed manner (Which is needlessly unspecific). I bought the game to discuss and learn about the titular tool. For my money, the game should be called ""The Watchers"" since that's the name of the damn rocks and that's what the story is about 90-95% of the time. The Swappers moral and ethically implications are left to the wind cause the rocks are way too damn more important than worrying about those things, so lets go solve some puzzle rooms which are apparently how the ship hides its security keys so I guess the entire security staff were armed with swappers to acquire and hide their keys. Only conclusion that I can draw is that as long as you are swapping to the clones, the Swappers a completely harmless tool for leisure and work. Also I like how the ending choice is entirely predicated upon first forcing you into a really random button pushing section (Just like all the puzzles) and then, you can see the doodad at the end, but the doodad doesn't trigger until you drop yourself off a cliff you can't jump up back from. And that's ignoring the absolute absurdity of the reason you even need to make the final choice. It's plot convience theater people, this is not good writing or game design.At the end of the game I was about to go like ""I hope you enjoyed No Moral Theater"" but at least they make you at least feel something about your damn choice at the end. So It could be ""Hastily tacked on moral theater.""  Don't waste your money on this overly artisty yet completely meaningless wash. Braid is far better at least evoking emotions and mysterious wonder, why I ENJOYED it immensely, while this just left me with an intense distaste after the. Instead of feeling my emotions tugged and pulled, I had tension drawn and drawn before just being cut with no conclusions, no revelations, no big anything. Just smash, end, Hope you enjoyed Hastily Tacked on Moral Plot Convience THeater.			"

												This game is unique. But that's not necessarily a good thing. Its story, gameplay and visuals all bring some novelty to the table but that couldn't save it from getting boring after about an hour of playing.The problem is that the puzzles never evolve past what you see from the start of the game. They are also unpleasantly inconsistent in difficulty. There are some fascinating ideas presented in the universe this game places you in. But again, the narrative frequently lost me by being too mysterious and lacking in any characters worth caring about.This review isn't a resounding ""No, don't play it!"" Instead I'd just caution you to not get caught up in all the high soaring reviews this game has received unless you are the type of person that can't get enough of 2D platform puzzlers filled with mystery and ambience.

I also beat the game in 4 hours without a guide, so it's stupidly short too. Finally, every achievement is tied to finding hidden computer monitors according to what I've read online.

Everything just looks like a chunky blue blur after a while.The story: Super lame. So many ideas are hinted at but never addressed. It feels like the writer was afraid to answer any of his ""deep"" questions for fear that someone playing the game might disagree with him.

												This is one of my GOTY candidates for 2013. Even if it doesn't win, it is certainly within my Top 3. Reminiscent of Limbo ever so slightly in terms of presentation, but better than it in basically every way. I love the eerie atmosphere, the provoking storyline and the puzzles are do-able (not too easy, not too difficult). Expect around 7 hours of gameplay.			"

Game got some unique mechanics, but don't be afraid, they're so bland and uninspired that you won't get exited even for a second !Screw those fancy FEZ, Braid and other masterpieces, get this game, you will be bored the whole time !

												Pretty solid as a puzzle game.   Most of the early puzzles aren't too taxing but there were a couple that had me rather puzzled, which I guess is the point.  The atmosphere of the game is quite good, but it's the story that brings the game to life.  The plot does not patronise the player, and brings up some questions about metaphysics and philosophy of mind that are quite interesting (these questions are never conclusively answered by the game, but left for the player to decide).   I didn't get any of the achievements (apparently there were hidden consoles somewhere, but I didn't see any!)			"

												As a fan of sci-fi in general the discription and other reviews of this game really interested me. The game is very atmospheric and haunting. The sound and the environments really draw you into the game and suck you into the world the game presents. The puzzles are engaging and fun and make you think. The premise of ""The Swapper"" and how you solve puzzles is really cool and a neat game mechanic. I highly recommend this to anyone that is a fan of atmospheric games. Get this game. It's alot of fun.			"

												""You can die here, or you can do what you have to to go on.""These haunting words are all I could hear resounding my head during the final choice of the game The Swapper. Neither option was good, but they were both equally viable. So why was it such a big deal to me? Because The Swapper had swallowed me whole, and I was in it's world and this felt like a real decision.I first saw this game earlier this year when it first launched on Steam. It's trailer intrigued me and I love puzzlers, so I added it to my wishlist. Come Summer Sale, my friend gifted the game to me when the price dropped. And now I have to thank him wholeheartedly because The Swapper is the one of the most intriguing, thought-provoking, puzzling, and, at many times, fun experiences of not only this year, but that I've yet played.The story is set far into the future, and you have just arrived on the derelict Space Station Theseus. There is no indication to who you are, what the Station is there for, or where everyone went. You simply enter the Station and find the enigmatic Swapper device. And here lies the game's central gameplay mechanic and moral dilemma: you can create and swap into clones of yourself and use them to solve puzzles aboard the ship, however in doing so and exploring the station, you often have to kill the clones. The game then goes from there, taking you on a puzzle-filled tour of the station, as you investigate what went down on Theseus and follow the instructions of a mysterious woman that is also aboard. Both lead you on a quite a ride, all the way to the mind-blowing ending I referred to earlier.I am pleased to report, that the puzzles are the best puzzles this game could have. It's the sort of puzzle that is Portal-esque in nature, simple but difficult simultaneously, but always logical. I only had to look up solutions twice, and both times I immediately facepalmed myself (likely where the developer's name originated from) for not realizing the solution that was staring me in the face. I was quite okay with this, because it was never frustrating at all when playing, and when I absolutely couldn't figure out to solve it, I'd just go to the other availiable puzzle to solve and return to that one later with fresh eyes. And when I did solve them, there was always that joy of ""Yes! I DID IT!"" accompanying it.The Swapper is a game I must insist you play. It's fascinating and thoughtful plot and well-crafted swapping mechanic and puzzles demand a playthrough. I don't often say a game simply has to be bought, but here it is. The Swapper is a wonderful adventure, puzzling from story to gameplay, that questions the true nature of the mind and soul, and the extent of what it means to have one.			"

												The space station is laid out in an unbelievable, but serviceable, series of puzzle rooms joined together by modest platforming sections. At first, the platforming between puzzles is interesting because it kept me thinking along the lines of solving puzzles rather than just moving from place to place. But there's a lot of exploration and backtracking, and having to navigate the corridors between puzzle rooms quickly became tedious once using the swapper gun became second nature and automatic. Fortunately, the game provides handy teleporters to allow you to quickly move to key sections of the station, so the backtracking never became as problematic as it could have been.The puzzles themselves start off fairly simple, requiring that the player simply point the gun and clone herself in order to reach a platform or cross a gap and collect alien orbs that you use to unlock new areas of the space station. The challenge quickly escalates. Soon, obstacles start getting thrown at you, such as colored lights that prevent certain operations of the swapper gun, forcing you to have to find more elaborate ways around the lights in order to reach your destination. You have to start using careful positioning, choreographed movement, gravity, momentum, and inertia in order to successfully solve the puzzles. And all this escalation seems to happen naturally based on the increasing complexity of the levels, rather than through the introduction of new mechanics or controls....So the core mechanic and puzzles are simple, comfortable, and varied enough to make the game a joy to play. But where The Swapper really excels is in its narrative and themes. The written narrative is fairly simple and straightforward, with mostly predictable plot turns. But this narrative explores very complicated and metaphysical themes of consciousness, identity, and self, and those themes are actually conveyed through the game's actual mechanics!...And the true brilliance is that the the simple act of playing the game goes so far to help explain the problem and make it tangible that I can't imagine anybody having trouble understanding the very heavy metaphysical concepts being discussed. It makes this complex philosophical conundrum accessible to its audience in ways that simply telling the story can't. It's a perfect application of the video game medium.Please read my full review on my blog at:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2015/12/03/The-Swapper-game-review.aspx "

It's one thing to provide challenging puzzles, but forcing the player to move just barely to the left in order to shoot a beam at a precise angle through the colored light..

												If you like your puzzle games with a little more forethought and personality than your average Peggle clone, then you could do far worse than the brilliant ""The Swapper"" from Facepalm games. Touching upon themes of morality and mortality, this little indie gem forces you to think on your feet. And it's not just the excellently designed body-swapping physics puzzles that will leave you scratching your chin either. There is a deeper message here about the human condition framed inside a compellingly original sci-fi narrative.

Once I started, I couldn't stop, and played through the whole thing over 2 sessions.At its most basic, The Swapper is a collection of physics puzzles involving making clones and switching places with them.  The puzzles get fairly difficult, but they made me feel smart for figuring them out.  What makes this game stand out is the atmosphere; haunting and mysterious, creepy but not frightening.  The full plot and circumstances are never fully explained, but it is captivating and keeps you wondering and wanting to find out more.  It's not a long game (took me around 4 hours), but it's one that will stick with you.			"

												Atmosphere is one thing I value the most in games, and this game definitely has it. The creepy, gorgeous, and mysterious setting meshes perfectly with the sound effects and ambient sountrack.While it did seem a bit short, I did not enjoy it any less. The puzzles provided a decent challenge, and the primary game mechanic molds right into the storyline which in itself is interesting and thought-provoking. If you liked Portal, you'll like this.			"

												Very interesting concept side scroller.  Essentially you've got 2 tools in your kit: - ""Make a clone"" - ""Make ME that clone""The side affect of ""Make a clone"" is time is slowed while you plant your new body which means you can do a LOT of things so long as you don't feel bad about your clones going ""splat"".Puzzles starting to get a bit more challenging about 30-45 minutes in so I bet there are going to be some real stumpers later.

												I bought this game on sale and had no idea what I was getting into. I'm not too into platformers these days, but this totally took me by surprise and I was blown away within the first 10 minutes of playing it. I have about 1.2 hours into the game, and the puzzles are pretty good, the ambient soundtrack is just awesome and I want to get a hold of it. I tried this on a 360 controller, and it was pretty smooth, though after playing it, I think it would be much better with a KB+Mouse, but it was still smooth with a controller, so it's good for whatever play style you are most comfortable with. I will be recommending this game to all my friends, and to whoever reads this. If I would have known it was this good I would have paid full price for it.			"

												Being a game that you finish in around 5 hours, give or take, it manages to pack a lot in a little.The game feels a lot like a platform version of Portal where instead of shooting portals you shoot up to four of your own clones. This mechanic is used throughout the game to solve puzzles which grant you orbs. These orbs are used to open up the next areas and progress through the story.Pros:- Artistic style and animations are beautiful.- Some of the puzzles are really mind boggling. (That's a good thing!)- Story is good for a puzzle game but one might need a few college degrees to fully grasp it.Cons:- The achievements for this game are all ""achieved"" by finding very well hidden messages. These messages are probably the best way to understand the story yet they are hidden so well that the only way anyone would find them is looking for their location on the internet.			"

												Unique graphics and outstanding puzzles makes ""The Swapper"" well worth playing.  The story is fairly interesting but rather cryptic and somewhat difficult to follow.  The story, although rather vague, left an impression on me but could've been stronger.  The game took me 4 hours to play through which, in my opinion,  is a bit short.  The puzzles are difficult but after a few moments of pondering/experimentation you should find a rather simple answer.  Rewarding experience overall although I would've liked to see some ""Challenge"" puzzles that ramp up the difficulty after finishing the game.4/5 Stars.			"

												The Swapper is an interesting puzzle platformer with some new ideas and a very suitable space ambience. You are a lone spaceman landing on a strange ship/planet and besides running and jumping just have an alien device ""the swapper"". With this  ""weapon"", you can create up to 4 clones of yourself that move exactly the same way as you. But you can not only use those clones to activate platform switches, you can swap yourself between those clones by pointing at a clone and ""fire"" your swapper device. You basically have to find and get lots of ""orbs"" to escape the planet.As long as just a clone of you dies, you can always recreate the clone. You can always swap between clones that you can reach with the swapper, even though you are just falling. This leads e.g. to the ability to ""fly"" just by creating clones anywhere in the room. Outside of the stations, you can also float and your swapper device is like a little rocket to push off. There are also gravity changers to walk on the ceiling. The puzzles are not too hard but there are some of them that really requires you to think in other dimensions.This nice twist for a puzzler is supported by a deep athmospheric surrounding with rare soft space music in the background, ""dirty"" graphics especially outside, radio voice signals with acoustic noise, and some challanging puzzles with absorbing lights, gravity and ... clones.Good game but not too chalanging. By the way: the achievements do not work in the Linux version, so far.			"

												tl;dr at the bottom.I just finished this game in one sitting (somewhere between 4 and 5 hours) and I can definitely recommend it. It's a little short, however, it's also a good puzzle game so it's definitely forgiveable. Each puzzle felt unique in some way, and while there was never too many mechanics at once, it does increase the complexity along the way. The difficulty was actually about perfect for me, I got stuck on 2 puzzles but ended up being able to solve them without a walkthrough. I wouldn't say it was an easy game at all, but the difficulty scales up at a healthy rate so solving puzzles is generaly satisfying but you shouldn't feel out of your depth. For the mostpart, platforming isn't as much of a focus as the puzzle solving, and with the ability to slow time you shouldn't feel put off if you're not a great platform jumper.The atmosphere is  great, and the story is interesting if a little understated. Most of the backstory will come through computer logs and it will require a bit of piecing the parts together. If you read them, you should have a fairly good idea of what's going on by the end of the game, and there's plenty of gaps left for you to decide some of the finer details on your own. The graphics and the sound seem designed to compliment said atmosphere, and the clay animations and ambient sound does a great job.tl;dr: Well balanced puzzle game, great atmosphere, definitely worth a purchase. If you're a bit broke and  looking for money/time you might want to wait for a sale, but I can assure you it's a good quality game so buying at full price shouldn't disappoint you.			"

												I kept rehashing my thoughts on this game, because I didn't want to jump to high up in my favorite games so quickly. I felt I had to keep thinking about it, because obviously an indie like this shouldn't be one of my favorite games, right?Well, it is. This is one of the best games I've played. I'm not going to say much more than that. I just want to highlight to the two things (well, two and a half) that stand out to me.First, are the puzzles. The start off fairly simple, but they teach you as you go. It's important to point out that you don't unlock any new abilities in this game. You have your swapper gun and that's it. That being said, it's a puzzle system that I've never seen before. The game knows this might be confusing for new players. As such, the first several puzzles are set up to teach you different techniques. They don't just display text on the screen and say ""do it this way."" They give you just enough clues to help you think outside the box. By the end of the game, there are some head scratchers. Nothing impossible, but some great designs that put your new thinking to the test.Second is the atmosphere. I don't think I've played a game that oozes more atmosphere than The Swapper. From the opening scene until the end, when I wasn't focused on the puzzle at hand, I was just in awe. Just through simple music and art, the game really transports you to another place. Without giving too much away, there some zero g moments in the game, and they just feel inspired. Those moments are surreal and they'll definitely be in my mind for a while.The story of the game is also quite interesting. It's done in a way that it leaves a lot of interpretation up to the player, so I won't go into much detail there; I'll just say that there are a few quite thought-provoking scenes.Anyway, so if you like puzzle games, or games dripping with atmosphere, check it out. I finished it in about 5 hours.			"

												Really good puzzler with an atmospheric and surprisingly philosophical story. Cool swapping and gravity mechanics set the design apart and make the puzzles challenging but definitely solvable. Easy to come back to puzzles later if you feel like moving onto something else (you can always have a couple unsolved and still be able to move on). The backing soundtrack suits the beautiful art design as well; it's a tiny bit creepy but mostly you just feel... alone.Relatively short at maybe 5-6 hours (my playtime of 8-9 hours had a lot of time where I was actually not at the PC), but definitely pick it up on sale!

												A very cool game and one of my favorite Indies of the decade. Picking up for the first time the only the gun and central mechanic to the game, the swapper, it appears fairly innocuous; it doesn't maim or kill anything directly, its simply a tool. It's not long before the stranded survivor inadvertently kills himself (albeit a copy of himself, but still a human being) in the name of progress. This disposability of the main character is his main asset, and is fascinating but subtly horrifying. All art assets were modelled out of clay and mechanical bits before being photographed and turned into bump-maps, giving a lot of gritty photo-realistic texture to surfaces and a sculpturesque feel to objects. The narrative was well thought out and intriguing, and conversations, however one-sided, were well paced. Not a whole lot of psycho-babble going on, which is more impressive coming from a science-fiction-philosophy game. Definitely a game I recommend as a must-play.			"

												Great game, with simple mechanics that could be used in a  number of clever ways, the majority of puzzles in this game can be solved fairly easily, despite that, there are still a handful of them are a realy scratchers. The story itself is intiguing as it entices to you to further explore the area in order to uncover the mystery behind the events that transpired there. Graphics itself, you can just watch some trailers and judge if the artstyle excites you. My impressions is that the black with ambient blue lighting every now and then fits the theme the game is trying to portray, the emptiness of the rooms you explore also aids in greatly setting up the atmosphere of the game. Character models need some work, but since characters are used sparingly, bar the player avatar, it is never not considered a huge issue. 5 hours to complete it and worth the price			"

												The Swapper is a nice little puzzle game very similar to Portal where you are put in the shoes of an astronaut who has a swapper device. This device allows you to create (with a right click) upto five different clones of yourself that mimick your every movement and to swap your mind with any one of them with a left click. Your job is to collect enneagon orbs that allow you tp progress further in the game. Each such orb is in a puzzle room where there are obstacles, as well as strategically placed red light (prevents transferring your mind to clones in that area) and/or blue light (prevents creating clones in that area). Your clones cannot claim enneagon orbs, only you can. So your job is to figure out a way to get to the orb yourself in order to collect it, using your clones as pawns. The game is about 5-6 hours long and some of the puzzles are really tough nuts to crack but most are simple enough for even the casual gamer to figure it out pretty quick. The most interesting part of this game is its story - it is kinda creepy and unsettling and the atmosphere of the huge space station you are in is nicely done. Oh and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, too. A four, out of five stars.			"

Nice lighting, strong atmosphere, nice soundtrack/ambients.No crashes or bugs/glitches at all, runs smooth.Somehow reminds me two sci-fi movies - Apollo 18 and Moon.For someone a bit short playtime (took me about 7 hours to finish it), but for me it was just enough.

												This game is amazing. The game which consists of emotional and philosophical depth thematically is able to pull it off perfectly.The gameplay is a puzzle platformer with interesting and intriguing puzzles that are solvable and frustrating but purely on a logical deduction side, you never feel cheated out of an outcome, only as though you couldn't see it clearly enough. That revelation is so satisfying that it compels you to try your best and to figure it out correctly.While the gameplay is the bread and butter of the game the story is amazing to follow and well paced. You are a human (gender doesn't matter here) who has appeared on Spaceship outpost Theseus with a device called The Swapper which allows you to clone and swap bodies with yourself. From there you have to figure out what happened to the crew, who is this mysterious lady on board the ship and why are these rocks talking to you.All of these by themselves could be boring or unoriginal or uninteresting but it's the themes that drives them all to be unified and they are all utilized in perfection. Themes such as isolation, identity, life & death, community, all play a part in establishing the world and the decisions you make as a character. While you are alone on the ship solving puzzles, are you truly alone while you have clones of yourself? How can you prove your own identity if who you really were died 10 swaps ago? The game rests with you, It took me a few days to beat this game but the in between time ruined me, I would be at work or on my way home either mentally going over a puzzle in my head or wondering if we were all clones or if the ship died of causes outside of the believed threat. The moral and philosophical implications made me question choice that I had made in my own life, and what it meant to be selfish or selfless. It's games likes these that I wished that more people would play in order to truly undertstand that videogames as a medium can be examples of high art. This game shows an unperverse and unflinching gaze as to what it truly means to live a life and to live for a greater good. 10/10			"

But once you start to get the hang of the swapping technique, and how to move yourself and your clones, it will get a bit easier.			"

												Imagine a PC game flavored with chunky bits of old school 2D. The Swapper's not quite a platformer, it's a puzzle game packaged with a brooding-mystery sci-fi story set in space.The essence of the game is getting to smaller puzzle rooms generously dispersed throughout the desolate space station.The puzzles have a rising difficulty curve, but you may not find yourself stumped until the later ones appear. That said, more systems are added as you advance, deepening the puzzle complexity by with more buttons that you have to stand on simultaneously, with new conditions that interfere with your cloning abilities.The heavy sci-fi atmosphere is heavy with prolonged isolation and sounds of shuttle doors closing, vents breathing, and space-inspired sounds. It's not monotonous, however; the setting sometimes takes you to lusher, greener spaces, punctuated with wonder-inspiring piano segments. A good pair of headphones is a must.			"

												Wow.  I love this game.  Overall, I'd say I loved the mood set in this game the most.  The wonderful music and beautiful art style and haunting story all come together to make this game entertaining and spooky at the same time.I found the puzzles challenging but not beyond my ability to figure out.  Often in games like this, I wind up being able to figure out 50% of the puzzles the others give me a headache before I can even get close to figuring out where to start.If I have one (minor) complaint, it's that the achievements are all but invisible.   Most games at least alert you in the Steam interface what you need to do.  In this case, I only stumbled upon the fact that there are (insanely) hidden rooms in different areas.   Rooms which I can't imagine how I would have ever found on my own.I loved and would highly recommend this game and its soundtrack.			"

												The Swapper is a fantastic puzzler with an eerie and thought provoking atmosphere.  The art style uniquely resembles claymation which gives it a homemade yet alien appearance.

Aside from all the visual and audial queues that make up the chilling atmosphere, the difficult and brilliant puzzles define the gameplay.  Overall, one of my alltime favourite purchases on Steam.

												Some of the puzzles are really hard, but with the help of your self-cloning/swapper device you can figure it all out! The only question is, is it really you in the end? My only gripe with the game is that once you beat the game you can't go back as there is a checkpoint at the credits. That said, you can pretty much speed run through the game to get any secrets you missed and the alternate ending like I did. Overall, very fun puzzle game with a universe that I would love to see expanded upon in the future.			"

												An interresting puzzle platformer with a philosophical sci-fi plot. The Puzzles are a bit samey with the constant objective of collecting orbs- which are used to open up further puzzles and progress through the game\map. The visuals are grim and dark with a heavy atmosphere of isolation. The plot is what makes this game distinct. It explores the meaning of identity and mind\body dualiy. If you are familiar with the ""Theseus's Paradox"", you have the philosophical background on which the game builds.			"

												I have enjoyed few puzzle-platformers the way I have this game. To start, I love the atmosphere of this game. The combination of visuals, the story, and the sound combine to make a really unique experience from the get-go. It's not just a puzzle game, it manages to be an experience. But on the subject of puzzles, the mechanics here are a lot of fun to learn and employ to get through rooms. Probably 95% of the puzzles felt intuitive and fun and were rarely frustrating. There were, as in almost every puzzle game, some rooms that were more problematic. Rooms that were unintuitive, had unforgiving timing, or required irritatingly precise positioning (or some combination thereof). But these rooms were pretty infrequent and can be forgiven pretty easily. Overall, this was a fantastic experience and one that I can't recommend highly enough to others.			"

												I walked into The Swapper with mild expectations. It seemed to me like a game focused around a single mechanic almost NEVER does well (exceptions include Portal and the like.) Yet from the moment I started playing, I was hooked. The Swapper has this odd way of making you crave companionship. Maybe its how easily you kill off your thousands of clones. Maybe its how mundane the Crew Logs are. No matter what it is, The Swapper has a way with isolation. Add to that fantastic puzzles and an ending to make you question your sanity, and you have an excellent game. 9.5/10			"

Controls are on point (I played using a gamepad and had no issues) and it took me about 7,5 hours to get though the game.There are some zero-g sequences that aren't perfect and I would have liked some of the fast-travel portals moved (some areas have too many - others too few), but that really is nitpicking.

												For an Indie game, I expected to have just an ok game.  However, this puzzle/platformer sets itself apart as a stellar indie that in my opinion can be more entertaining than some popular franchise games.  First off, the game has simple mechanics and controls.  In the first 15 minutes you will have all the tools you need to solve any puzzle and journey throughout the environment.  Secondly, the game's atmosphere and story is really compelling and absorbing.  The creepy and unique environment (the art style is based off of clay animation and scavenged household objects) will have you hooked while the story will throw you a number of twists.  Finally, the game has no need for violence.  There are no enemies or gore and can be a good break from violent games.  The down side?  The Swapper may be a great game but it can try your patience.  Numerous puzzles had me frustrated.  This could be a plus for those who crave puzzles,  but those with lesser patience will loathe the game.  Another aspect is the game length which is only 4.8 hours on my first playthrough.  This may be seen as a short story, but the game was worth it.  Other than that, I didn't find much fault with it.Overall, I strongly recommend this game.  I typically don't like puzzle games, but I found this one rewarding and worth the investment.			"

You're alone out in space trying to figure out what has happened to a run down space station, but instead of shooting all sorts of badies, you solve puzzles to progress.  It seemed a little slow at first, but once you figure out other ways of getting around besides walking and you open more of the space station so the game isn't completely linear it gets really fun and rewarding!

												One of the best games I've played in the past few years, and one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. The puzzles are difficult and intelligent, without being senselessly random. You won't have puzzles that take random guessing to solve, just pure logical thinking. The story is interesting as well. And the graphics are something different and pleasant to look at. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes puzzle games or a mental challenge.			"

												Another indie puzzle-platformer with gameplay that doesn't feel very spectacular after my experience with a buttload of other similar stuff in the same genre. However a fantastic narrative is told throughout the game with the use of terminal logs and freaky alien rocks so to me that was the bait to keep me hooked to this until the very end.			"

												This is a relatively short, but undeniably satisfying puzzle platformer. It centers around a basic set of mechanics -- you can create up to four clones of yourself which mimic your movements, and you can swap positions with one of them if they are in line of sight. The puzzles can be tricky, but are never unfair. The platforming aspect is reasonably forgiving because you can slow down time to create a clone and swap with it when performing a jump which is otherwise suicidal. My only complain is the ten hidden rooms, which are a classic case of GuideDangIt.			"

												A very cool art project of a game. I say that because, while sort of interesting, the gameplay is very simple and the puzzle aren’t hard at all(with the exception of a few that required precise placement of your clones.) What really stands out to me was the art design, tone and overall atmosphere of the game. It’s dark and moody but in the best kind of way, sorta like Aliens or Moon.  Definitely pick it up if you enjoy the ""you're not as alone as you think you are in space"" genre.			"

												Great game. Puzzles are challenging but not frustrating. The learning curve is gentle enough that you are always just being challenged a bit further than the previous room. I found myself getting stuck a few times, but there are always other rooms to go to. When I came back to rooms I had left before, I was able to approach them with a fresh mind and solve them. I was tempted to look at a FAQ for one or two but never did.There's going to be a lot of comparisons to a 2D Portal, and that's not a bad thing. Portal was great too, and I'd say the difficulty of puzzles is comparable.Music and sound effects are awesome, very atmospheric. You really do feel that isolation of being trapped in space.Story is good but a bit lacking since it is only delivered through text consoles (who has time to read in a video game?) and very few cut scenes. This didn't hurt too much as the cut scenes were impactful and the voice acting superb.Overall, a great game and well worth the price of admission. Pick it up!BTW, I beat the game, not sure why Steam is saying I only played for one hour. I played for probably around 10 hours over several days.			"

The core mechanic of Swapper, making clones and swapping your conscience into them, and works well.

												I don’t normally do reviews but a game like this one warrants it.  I must admit some bias I enjoy platformers in general and puzzle games.  When the two meet I don’t always like them; it can be hit and miss.  (The last one I really enjoyed was Thomas Was Alone.)  Though the puzzles were frustrating at points (though I’m not the best at them) the storyline and mystery compelled me to compete it.  It’s atmospheric and really beautiful at times.  If need be use a guide on the odd puzzle if you’re really stuck or experiencing some puzzle rage because it was satisfying in the end though I can’t say more without spoilers.   If you aren’t sure if you like this sort of thing read some reviews from people less biased than me or wait till it comes up in a humble bundle again or a sale =]			"

												If you like puzzle platformers, you must get this title. In this game, you rely on The Swapper, a device that lets you create copies of yourself and then teleport your conciousness into them. Puzzles then are solved using this mechanic.The mechanic:- Cloning: You can create up to 4 copies of yourself ( 5, including the original you ). Each copy won't stay still and will mimic what the original dude does, so plan ahead! You can create clones anywhere you want, as long as there is a direct line of sight- Conciousness / Mind transfer. You switch which individual is in control. This is useful when you need to get to hard-to-reach places. Also as far as you can, as long as there is a direct line of sight.- Merging: If you can corner a clone and physically touch it, the clone dissapears. This is useful when you need to reuse one of them.- Gravity switch: This comes later in the game. Gravity fields will make your guy to flip ""upside-down"", allowing you to jump and place clones on both sides of a platformThe obstacles: Besides hard walls, there are 2 main obstacles:- Blue light fields: You cannot make clones in places lit with blue light. You can transfer your mind into any clone that is already in there, however.- Red light fields. You cannot transfer your mind through them ( same as with hard walls ), but you can create clones in red light.- Purple light fields ( did I say only 2? ). It's a combination of blue and red lights.Other stuff:- Boxes: Pull and push to block lights and doors- Buttons: Step on them ( or place a clone ) to turn lights off or open doors- Teleporters: Fast jumping through the map- Zero gravity zones: This took me a few seconds to realize, but you need to shoot the Swapper to use as propulsion in these levels.- Orbs: You must collect these in the puzzle levels to move the story forward.- Slow-mo: When placing a new clone, the game will switch to slow motion. This is particularly useful to place clones while falling ( and then teleporting to the new clone to avoid death )The story is interesting, but in my opinion secondary to the game. The puzzles are more fun than the story :3My only complaints are that:- It's a bit short. You can clear it within 5 hours- The achievements are unintuitive. They're just numbers with no explanation of what to do. After doing some internet seraching, you have to go to hidden areas outside the screen to unlock them. Kind of defeats the point of being ""achievements"" if they're hidden, imo.			"

												The Swapper is a great puzzle platformer with some really nifty ideas and gameplay mechanics. As you progress through the game, you learn about what has happened to the station that you're in and the mystery begins to reveal itself. The story is also fairly well developed and kinda heavy too touching on question of life, the universe, and everything. =)The controls are simple - With WASD, you move left and right, have the ability to jump, and are able to grab blocks in some of the puzzles. The mechanics of the Swapper device are simple to understand: you are able to create 5 clones, and you can swap to them. The clones maintain their orientation as the were created, and imitate the movements of the 'active' clone. The concept is simple, but quickly becomes very difficult to master in some of the later puzzles.The game is visually stunning; the art is beautiful. From what I've read about it, the developers molded most of the game assets in clay and then imaged them into the game. This creates the unique look that The Swapper has. The music is grade-A and very beautiful to listen to. Along with the art, it sets the mood of the game as a gloomy, lonely, yet inquisitive environment.And the ending. Wow. There are two endings available. One is kinda meh, but the other one really wraps up the whole experience.As for the cons... the game was a bit short, unfortunately. I would say I logged about 5 hours of gameplay. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on the puzzles and how quickly you get through them. There's also achievements, however, I have no idea what they are. I've beaten the game, and haven't unlocked even one. They are titled as Roman numerals and the description is the same as the title, so there's no hint as to what they are. The game also has no replayability at all.However, those are my only real gripes, and definitely doesn't offset from the great playing experience this game has to offer. I wholly recommend it, 9/10.			"

												A great indie title, where the puzzling elements don't interfere with the story. The visuals and atmosphere of the game are break-taking and the difficulty of the puzzles does increase. I personally found it replayable, since the game has 2 endings. After finishing the game it made me reflect on the themes and story, which I believe to be a good thing.			"

												A good puzzle game with an intresting story that keeps you coming back until you finish it. The hidden messages are a pain to get. If you want 100% completion this game will punish your dreams. The graphics are fresh and intresting to watch. I actually found the clay mation makes this a better alien setting than using normal graphics. This indie game is a gem. This is a great game and you will not want to swap it out.			"

												The swapping mechanic is simple but ingenious. The puzzles are workable and I only had to use a walkthrough for a single puzzle (only as a hint).  As a puzzle-platformer, it is hella fun.That said, the philosophical questions posed by the game are interesting but the game is only a shallow explanation of the possible answers.  After taking four semesters of philosophy, the ending and general treatment of the subject matter was disappointing.			"

												I kept rehashing my thoughts on this game, because I didn't want to jump to high up in my favorite games so quickly. I felt I had to keep thinking about it, because obviously an indie like this shouldn't be one of my favorite games, right?Well, it is. This is one of the best games I've played. I'm not going to say much more than that. I just want to highlight to the two things (well, two and a half) that stand out to me.First, are the puzzles. The start off fairly simple, but they teach you as you go. It's important to point out that you don't unlock any new abilities in this game. You have your swapper gun and that's it. That being said, it's a puzzle system that I've never seen before. The game knows this might be confusing for new players. As such, the first several puzzles are set up to teach you different techniques. They don't just display text on the screen and say ""do it this way."" They give you just enough clues to help you think outside the box. By the end of the game, there are some head scratchers. Nothing impossible, but some great designs that put your new thinking to the test.Second is the atmosphere. I don't think I've played a game that oozes more atmosphere than The Swapper. From the opening scene until the end, when I wasn't focused on the puzzle at hand, I was just in awe. Just through simple music and art, the game really transports you to another place. Without giving too much away, there some zero g moments in the game, and they just feel inspired. Those moments are surreal and they'll definitely be in my mind for a while.The story of the game is also quite interesting. It's done in a way that it leaves a lot of interpretation up to the player, so I won't go into much detail there; I'll just say that there are a few quite thought-provoking scenes.Anyway, so if you like puzzle games, or games dripping with atmosphere, check it out. I finished it in about 5 hours.			"

												This is a really cool puzzle game where you can create clones of yourself that copy all your movements. You can also switch which clone you're controlling. It's a really neat mechanic that leads to really interesting puzzles. Definitely worth checking out. It's a really short game, though, so maybe wait for a sale			"

												Really good puzzler with an atmospheric and surprisingly philosophical story. Cool swapping and gravity mechanics set the design apart and make the puzzles challenging but definitely solvable. Easy to come back to puzzles later if you feel like moving onto something else (you can always have a couple unsolved and still be able to move on). The backing soundtrack suits the beautiful art design as well; it's a tiny bit creepy but mostly you just feel... alone.Relatively short at maybe 5-6 hours (my playtime of 8-9 hours had a lot of time where I was actually not at the PC), but definitely pick it up on sale!

The puzzles are interesting and challenging and the story is very well told and had me question a lot.Also, hidden acheivements!

												This game... THis game is amazing! The puzzling is great... but that is not the main meat of the game. It is the atmosphere and the story. If you think about what the game is telling you. And you really take in the story. Then this game will be the best game you have ever played (if you like this kind of game). This game will make you think about your identity, who are you? what are you? Are you really yourself? and what part of you is you? Is it the brain? does a soul exist? This game is my favorite game of 2013. I thought it would be Dust: an elysian tail, but this game is just so amazing. I can't recommend it enough!			"

												Where was this on everybody’s “2013 game of the year” list?? As of this writing, it’s January 2014, so all of the major game websites have put out their “best games of 2013 list”. I’ve checked most of the major gaming websites, and this game has appeared on precisely none of the “best game” lists, whereas games like Brothers and Bioshock Infinite - both of which I found to be less than favorable - appear all over the place. I don’t understand. Anyway, The Swapper is an indie puzzle game which has taken quite a bit of influence in its art direction from the Metroid games. Actually, this game threw me quite a bit at first. After seeing all of the visual and stylistic references to Metroid, I was expecting a Metroidvania game. The Swapper is very much just a puzzle game and nothing more, but it’s a very good puzzle game. The main puzzle solving mechanic in the game is the title device, The Swapper. It allows the user to make clones of themselves that will mimic the user’s actions one to one. It also allows the user to transfer their consciousness not only between their clones, but between any living being, which makes for some interesting storytelling. Armed with The Swapper, you’ll explore a derelict space station that has been seemingly mysteriously abandoned. You’ll solve puzzles and read crew logs to try to piece together what happened to the station. The puzzle design in this game was pretty excellent, on par with games like Portal or Braid, where I would just stare at the screen for minutes at a time and try to think through what I needed to do to complete the puzzle. Light plays an important role in this game’s puzzles. Blue light will block The Swapper’s cloning feature where red light will block the “swapping” feature. Purple light will block both. The game’s mechanics are a bit difficult to illustrate verbally, so you may want to check out some gameplay videos to get the idea and see if this interests you. Don’t be thrown by the Metroid references, this isn’t that kind of game. But if you enjoy puzzle games, The Swapper is a must-play.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

I truly recommend this game, its a piece of art, its is incredible in all ways it could and i never thought the story would catch me so hard. The only thing that i didnt like it is that all achievments are secret and they are actually 10 stations that are extremely hard to find and those stations have some pieces of the story.i'll give it a 9/10.

												*I would like to point out a really annoying thing, and that is that once you've completed the game, there's no way to go back and collect achievements without starting over from scratch.  Particularly this is annoying because I didn't even know there were secret rooms until after I'd finished the game and noticed I hadn't gotten any of the steam achievements.Good writing, good core gameplay, beautiful environments.  However, don't be fooled, you're mostly paying for style not substance here.  The game is rather short (5-6 hours) and the puzzles never really rise beyond a medium difficulty--this is no fish fillets 2 of toughness.  There was really only a single room that even gave me pause, and that might not be the case for someone else because I felt stupid after I realized I simply had to begin the puzzle from a different location in the room.Considering the short length, not hard puzzles and the problem I have with how the secret rooms are handled, I'm a bit on the fence, but maybe once in a while shiny packaging wins out for me and this game really is a joy to look at and think about.

A clever, but otherwise insubstantial diversion that I'd enjoy for the moment and then quickly forget. I was pleasantly surprised.Beautiful art design, a nice sweet spot of difficulty with puzzles that make you think without pushing into frustration territory, and a well-written and thought-provoking sci-fi narrative. I finished it in a matter of hours, but I think they were hours well-spent. Definitely recommend.			"

Must-play for fans of philosophy, mystery, or just plain old isolated space station exploration. I was not expecting such beauty from a sidescroller. I'd also pay well for the soundtrack alone. Thanks for a wonderful time. Salute to the creators!Even though I've 'beaten' the game, i havent unlocked a single achievement. I wonder...			"

												This game is beautiful. The puzzles are challenging and engaging (though a few require twitch reflexes). Both the ambient music and lack of sound in space were enjoyable. The sci-fi story is intentionally confused--fitting for a game about swapping in and out of your clones. The story is also pretty much entirely ignorable if all you want to do is solve puzzles.Be careful, the game intentionally tries to give you motion sickness multiple times. My brain is still a bit wibbly-wobbly from the experience.			"

												A shorter puzzle game that really trys a new mechanic. I loved how the premise of the puzzles is reinforced through the story as well. It has just enough philosophy to propel it into actual Sci-fi that is hard to find. The game even at its most frustrating is about 4 to 6 hours all-together. Whether that deters you is a call you can make with regards to the price. The puzzles themselves are isolated to rooms and have very simple ""restart"" mechanics that let you try those 20 ways until you find the right solution. Sometimes I really had to put my head to the wall, leave for 10 minutes, come back, and then the solution became clear as day. The challenge curve seems balanced as well. Very little times did I think, ""this is way out of my leage for now"". There are NO power-ups so every room is also as it will always be until you solve the puzzle. I've no place to speak of graphics and quality but the theme or aesthetic they wanted comes through and nothing seems out of place. The sound is errie but not melodramatic. It really lets Fmod do the work by putting you in the space of this huge outerstellar astroid station. Great immursion. The voice-acting is compelling as well despite the few actors. It is to the games benefit in my opinion. There are few option menu choices if at all. I played on a 360 controller and had no issues. Sometimes I felt a mouse would be better. The game only utilizes a jump and the L/R triggers. There also seems to be 10 achievements, but beating the game has unlocked none of them. They have no description. If you hunt for those, you'd need to look them up because I have no clue. One of the better games I've played this year to be sure. I hope you can enjoy it too.			"

												An excellent puzzle game with an intriguing metaphysical story about the nature of self. Kind of Metroidvania-ish, however, instead of gaining new powers to traverse the map, you expand your knowledge of the powers you have and how they can be used. More than once I was grinning at figuring a new trick out. Much like Portal, the game does a very good job of leading you through learning new techniques for puzzles. Moody, handcrafted graphics and an excellend ambient sountrack round everything out. This game was very much worth the purchase and the playtime (around 5 hours).			"

												Puzzle game that utilizes a cloning mechanic and a swapping mechanic. You can take control of any clone you make, though there are areas which you cannot create a clone or swap with a clone. Takes place on a derelict space station. Clay animation makes this game beautiful to behold. If you like Limbo our Metroid, this is a game for you.			"

												A really fun indie game. This is a puzzle platformer, heavily reminiscent of SNES Super Metroid. The same 2D perspective, with a gun you aim diagnolly, and frequently checking the map to see what doors you haven't opened yet. But instead of a ray gun, ice beam, etc, you have a Swapper. The secondary fire button creates a clone of yourself, the primary teleports your soul to your clone (or does it)? Use these abilities to collect orbs, which unlock doors.I have mad respect for the level design in this game. Writting puzzles with the correct difficulty is really hard, and they did it. I was able to finish each puzzle, without Google, but towards the end many of them were tough. And the solutions were rarely technically difficult. Once you figured it out, executing it was not hard.The plot centers around a derelict space ship, with an unusual lifeform aboard. The lifeforms have killed most of the crew, and your goal is to survive until help arrives. And it posits an interesting take on what it means to have a soul.			"

												The Swapper is completely amazing, and probably the greatest puzzle game I've ever played. The most obvious point of comparison is to Braid, which also appears to be a platformer, but is really a pure puzzle game with completely unique mechanics and a cryptic story woven throughout. The Swapper's story, to me, is much more compelling than Braid's, and the puzzles not quite so beat-your-head-against-the-wall frustrating. I actually managed to finish the entire game without the help of a guide, which is pretty rare for me where puzzle games are concerned. The graphics and atmosphere are also overwhelmingly great. The spookiness reminded me a bit of the original Alien movie. So the game has it all: unique mechanics, amazing sound and visual design, a deep, thought-provoking story, and actual FUN gameplay (both the puzzles and the general ship navigation). I think this is about all I can say while remaining spoiler free. 10/10			"

												I was very impressed with this game, normally I do not like side scroller games, think that might have something to do with failing at mario when I was 6 years old. Never the less I was intrigued and really enjoyed this game, in fact once I started playing I didn't stop, beat it within 5 hours of downloading it.The graphics are legible, have high LoD, and are very artistic at the same time. The story is simple put has a nifty little twist at the end. There is a bit of philosophy in the games narrative and story, which is pretty much a staple for an indie game, but if that's not your thing don't worry it is not overbearing. The gameplay and mechanics are solid across the board, and once you find the deadzones and what not for the controls you can get anything done that you might need to do in the game. The puzzles are fun and complex, often I found that rather being forced to do the puzzles one after another in a linear fashion, I would have a room with about three or four different puzzle rooms attached to it so I could choose which puzzles I wanted to do first, which was really nice because I got stuck a couple of times and moved to a different puzzle and then went back for the one I couldn't get earlier. The sound is great and adds to the sense of foreboding that the environment has, and the voice acting a well done.Some of the physics in the game felt a bit sluggish at times but not so much as to detract from the experience. The lighting was a bit too dark at times and the headlamp on the character probably could have radiated a bit further and wider. Some of the puzzles were really difficult and at times confusing and some hints would have been welcome like maybe a warning sign on the wall telling people to stay on or off of certain areas. There really iss not a lot that I can say is bad about this game, the devs sat out to accomplish a goal and the execution was spot on for the most part. Best of all at this point in time the game feels like a complete game.Highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone, even those who are not fans of the 2D side scrollers.			"

												The Swapper is a succinct little puzzle game about the ability to create clones and (as you might expect) swap your consciousness with them. This is done through a gun-like device similar to Portal and like Portal it uses its limited mechanics to great effect. The two main wrinkles in the puzzles are that all the clones move and jump to the same input and various types of light create areas that block either the clone creation or swapper functions of your device. This means it is a game primarily about relative motion and line of sight. Moving your clones around can be a bit like herding cats, so you have to think several steps ahead to get everyone where they need to be. The story deals with the nature of consciousness and a race of sentient rocks, but it is mostly a curiosity to break up the puzzle rooms. The game has a rather dark atmosphere supported directly by its mechanics (your clones rarely meet a happy end). I recommend The Swapper if you enjoy having your mind fried wrapping your head around situations that appear impossible.			"

												This game very well may be my favorite game of all time. It combines the very clever puzzles of Portal 2, the very deep story line of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and the beautiful setting of space from Gravity (You didn't think I would include a movie reference here, did you?) I finished the Swapper in a matter of about 6 hours, and the ending gave me the same feeling as finishing Deus Ex. I thought on its meaning for days. The Swapper means to make you think about the difference between the mind and the brain, and how far would you go to survive. I was deeply inspired, and I think anyone who appreciates art in any respect will be too. The Swapper exemplifies how a tiny 4-person indie developer can create a work of art that knocks any triple-A game out of the water. I absolutely recommend it.			"

												What really made this game compelling for me was the overall atmosphere. The aesthetic components of the game feels fairly original in all aspects. Textures, models and music are all appealing and blend together nicely to compose a feeling of mystery and loneliness. The game mechanics are fairly simple and the puzzles that you are tasked to solve range from easy to semi-hard in difficulty. I am not a great puzzler and still managed to finish the game without to many hickups. Basically it's all about using a special swapper gun to create clones and transfer your mind between these clones to reach spheres that unlock new parts of the ship as well as the story.A story that is excellently written and executed at that. It all starts out as a great mystery and then you unravel it bit by bit by interacting with consoles and other objects on the ship. A bit of reading and thinking might be required to get to grips with what has been going on on the ship but it's definitely worth the effort in the end.			"

												The Swapper combines flawless mechanics, an otherworldy aesthetic and a haunting narrative into not only one of the best puzzle games on the market, but one of the best games available period. In The Swapper, you control a faceless, voiceless, nameless protagonist. This is a deliberate choice, considering that the Swapper Device, the game's mechanical hook, allows you to create up to four clones (meaning five bodies total) at a time for you to swap your consciousness between. What exactly this consciousness is (a soul?), the game never elucidates, and rightly so. This is a game of worrying questions and previous few answers.There are also environmental obstacles, such as pitfalls, specific areas that prohibit creating clones/swapping/both, and gravity switches. The gameplay objectives consist of rooms with an ""orb"" at the end, which must be picked up by a body you are inhabiting for it to count towards your overall collection. In order to reach the incredible ending, one must collect them all; so while you can leave a room before you complete it, be aware that you will always have to come back to it eventually. The simplicity of these mechanics makes them fantastically compelling. I often feel compelled to look up a walkthrough in some games, because I think I'm missing something and don't like looking for answers in the wrong place. This is avoided completely in The Swapper, as the rooms are clearly set-out and all important aspects of the puzzle are made clear and highlighted. This results in fine, fine logic puzzles that tease but do not baffle. This is a game that makes you respect the craft of the puzzles enough that you don't want to look up a walkthrough. You may get frustrated at points - trust me, I was - but the ability to drop out of a puzzle any time and go looking for more completely negates that.The atmosphere of the game is perfect. The desaturated tones and harsh, hyper-real lighting created by the combination of found objects and claymation mean that the aesthetic of the game is bleakly beautiful. The organic and synthetic alike are rendered with such incredible detail and moody truth that you'd swear you're exploring real locations. The murky greys and hospital whites are only broken by items you can interact with, and this is purposeful, I feel: they are the only vestiges of life and hope left in an otherwise dead ship. The sound design, too, is phenomenal. The thuds, scrapes and clangs of space are all captured with the same muted distance the rest of the aesthetic champions, and the result is a slow, hard, weighty feel to the movement and environments of the game. The soundtrack is beautifully eerie and occasionally offers a reprise from the bleakness. It reminds me very much of the film Moon, and though that is perhaps an obvious comparison, there is a reason for that.I will do my best to recommend the story without spoiling much for you, but if the rest of the review is enough that you already want to buy the game, I still recommend you skip this paragraph. That said, this game communicates existential dread and the terror of mortality like no other I have played, and does so through perfect fusion of the mechanics and narrative themes. It presents a world and characters that should be dead, but do not want to die. They exist purely through will and determination, and they are not the better for it. Everyone is a frantic husk, and everyone is looking to buy more time. There are text logs, but they simply fill in the fairly interesting lore - the real bulk of the writing's strength comes from other sources. It is frightening and meditative, and makes one stop and think. To say any more would be a disservice.The game is not perfect, though, as no games are. Some of the voice acting is slightly iffy (though never strictly bad), and the fast, jerky movement speed, while perfect for puzzles, undermines some of the more resonant moments of the narrative. These are, however, minor faults in an otherwise incredible game.I would suggest The Swapper to everyone who enjoys puzzle games and/or strong narratives, but that would be fairly useless. To summarise, I would say that the game is a graceful, poignant example of the beauty and horror of perspective. And that, in a two-dimensional game, is something.			"

												The Swapper is a new kind of puzzle / adventure game in a mysterious setting, on a derelict ship. The discovery of alien non-organic sentient stones lead to the creation of the Swapper. A device that can create clones of yourself and switch minds with others.The game has a beautiful atmosphere and the graphics make it even more immersive. The puzzles become increasingly challenging and if you're into the plot, you will enjoy how the story discusses the concept of existance.About 4-5 total game hours, absolutely worth it.			"

												This is a fantastic sci-fi puzzle platforming experience. It makes you think about what you are doing (both from the puzzles themselves and about the interaction between characters) and the setting immerses you even more when combined with the first two elements. I was in love with the music the entire time, because it brings a sense of sadness and longing that even more fully makes you feel connected with the game. If you willing to allow a game to make you think about what you are doing, and allow yourself to be fully immersed in it, then this is the game for you.			"

												Very good game! I got this game in a bundle and really had no idea what it was. I really didn't have any in it interest either. Started playing and got hooked. The concept is very unique and the atmosphere eerie and well done. It has an engaging story that was lots of fun and very well thought out. My only complaint was that it was shorter than I wanted it to be. I was having so much fun and the game just flew by. I would recommend this game but because of its length I find it hard to justify buying it for full price, other than to support the very creative and talented developers.			"

												The trailers I saw for The Swapper were mostly vague, and it serves the greater themes of the game well.  A beautifully detailed game, structured in the vein of a classic Metroidvania game, The Swapper asks you to think a little more broadly in how to accomplish various challenges.  An interesting meditation on the nature of identity.			"

												This game is an excellent puzzler, with some superb level design and sound to boot.Only thing is, this game made me feel like I was a man with the brain of a baby, as some of those puzzles drove me to insanity.The game itself is not spectacularly long, although playing it for a half hour or so a night will definitley prolong it's experience, as you are left pondering about what you have uncovered so far.Definitely worth checking out for any hardcore indie gamer or casual player, as it can cater to both. Although be prepared to chop a testicle off through frustration at some of the tricky puzzles.(Please note, the puzzles aren't all that hard when you find out how to do them, but Jesus Christ was I stuck a lot.)

												It won't take you long to complete The Swapper (3-4 hours), but when you do reach the end you will have pondered the nature of persons, mind, and intelligence. Not only that, there's a point in the story when I wondered, ""What's happening to all those swapped clones of myself?"" Suffice to say, when you reach the conclusion you will have not only finished the game but you will be amazed at how you got there. The puzzles in this game are top notch, and some were legitimately frustrating, yet I never felt like I wanted to just stop playing because I got stumped. The Swapper is not a game to be blasted through, but rather one which lends itself to thoughtful problem solving and reflection on humanity. For such a simple concept, The Swapper is a great success.			"

												I was not interested into The Swapper but I got it in the Humble Bundle XI so I thought I'd give it a try!This game has nice puzzles that can be quite challenging.You must collect orbs in order to proceed in the game. So you create clones of yourself and swap to control one or another. If there is a blue light you cannot create a clone and if there is a red light you cannot swap. There are also switches that either turn one of the light off or that move a wall. That being said, the puzzles get harder as you progress in the game and you must collect every orbs in order to reach the end.I definitely recommend this game if you like challenges. The ending is quite surprising too.			"

												A great game.  Tried it out for a few minutes and ended up playing straight through.  The gameplay is slick and refined where it is a joy to zap across the world discarding your cloned shells behind you.  I particularly liked the slow motion while aiming the 'Swapper' gun. A few puzzles did leave me stumped but the satisfaction from each coupled with the superb seamless tutorial and the gradual incremental difficulty make for a game that is never really frustrating even in the toughest puzzles.  The non-linear solving also allows you to go and try a different room if you do get stuck, which a couple of times gave me the break I needed to work out the previous room.  A fantastic game.  Heartily reccommended, if you enjoy puzzles and an accompanying story.  The narrative flows throughout - if you were so inclined you could ignore it all and have a great puzzling experience by itself but by the end you'll likely find yourself absorbed in the game world and the resultant ethical dilemmas and philosophical quandries, culminating in a great finalé which both matches the overall game aesthetic and leaves you with a great deal to think about after the credits have rolled.  Great!			"

The puzzles are challenging from a logical standpoint, but the controls are easy enough to use that the game is not difficult in terms of executing what you want to do.I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good puzzle platformer.

												One of the finest games I've come across, I'm not usually a big sidescroller fan but this game just captured me. The atmosphere and storyline are curious and poignant. The hand-crafted clay environments create a neat look and it's easy at times to get lost in the combo of music+setting. The puzzles can be frustrating but then again they should be, although I can't help but think that the sidescroller format doesn't take full advantage of the world's potential. This could have been flowered into a massive game in many ways, but it remains a lovely gem in its current petite form.After finishing this must say that it turned out to be one of the most emotionally and psychologically striking games I've ever come across. It dares to reach into existential no-man's land and the ending choice sums up the entire game quite expertly. This one will make its home in the back of your mind and I'll be revisiting it soon.

												Some of the puzzles are really hard, but with the help of your self-cloning/swapper device you can figure it all out! The only question is, is it really you in the end? My only gripe with the game is that once you beat the game you can't go back as there is a checkpoint at the credits. That said, you can pretty much speed run through the game to get any secrets you missed and the alternate ending like I did. Overall, very fun puzzle game with a universe that I would love to see expanded upon in the future.			"

												tl;dr at the bottom.I just finished this game in one sitting (somewhere between 4 and 5 hours) and I can definitely recommend it. It's a little short, however, it's also a good puzzle game so it's definitely forgiveable. Each puzzle felt unique in some way, and while there was never too many mechanics at once, it does increase the complexity along the way. The difficulty was actually about perfect for me, I got stuck on 2 puzzles but ended up being able to solve them without a walkthrough. I wouldn't say it was an easy game at all, but the difficulty scales up at a healthy rate so solving puzzles is generaly satisfying but you shouldn't feel out of your depth. For the mostpart, platforming isn't as much of a focus as the puzzle solving, and with the ability to slow time you shouldn't feel put off if you're not a great platform jumper.The atmosphere is  great, and the story is interesting if a little understated. Most of the backstory will come through computer logs and it will require a bit of piecing the parts together. If you read them, you should have a fairly good idea of what's going on by the end of the game, and there's plenty of gaps left for you to decide some of the finer details on your own. The graphics and the sound seem designed to compliment said atmosphere, and the clay animations and ambient sound does a great job.tl;dr: Well balanced puzzle game, great atmosphere, definitely worth a purchase. If you're a bit broke and  looking for money/time you might want to wait for a sale, but I can assure you it's a good quality game so buying at full price shouldn't disappoint you.			"

												I kept rehashing my thoughts on this game, because I didn't want to jump to high up in my favorite games so quickly. I felt I had to keep thinking about it, because obviously an indie like this shouldn't be one of my favorite games, right?Well, it is. This is one of the best games I've played. I'm not going to say much more than that. I just want to highlight to the two things (well, two and a half) that stand out to me.First, are the puzzles. The start off fairly simple, but they teach you as you go. It's important to point out that you don't unlock any new abilities in this game. You have your swapper gun and that's it. That being said, it's a puzzle system that I've never seen before. The game knows this might be confusing for new players. As such, the first several puzzles are set up to teach you different techniques. They don't just display text on the screen and say ""do it this way."" They give you just enough clues to help you think outside the box. By the end of the game, there are some head scratchers. Nothing impossible, but some great designs that put your new thinking to the test.Second is the atmosphere. I don't think I've played a game that oozes more atmosphere than The Swapper. From the opening scene until the end, when I wasn't focused on the puzzle at hand, I was just in awe. Just through simple music and art, the game really transports you to another place. Without giving too much away, there some zero g moments in the game, and they just feel inspired. Those moments are surreal and they'll definitely be in my mind for a while.The story of the game is also quite interesting. It's done in a way that it leaves a lot of interpretation up to the player, so I won't go into much detail there; I'll just say that there are a few quite thought-provoking scenes.Anyway, so if you like puzzle games, or games dripping with atmosphere, check it out. I finished it in about 5 hours.			"

												The Swapper is a puzzle-solving game like no other.  Three aspects make the game nearly flawless: it makes you think, it creates a palpable atmosphere, and it makes you ""think.""The puzzles are fiendishly difficult; I found myself stuck multiple times in the later stages of the game.  They all ""appear"" so simple, and yet they require precise planning and control.  Good luck finding the achievements, lol!The setting is superb.  The lighting, the sound effects, and the physics breathe life into the game like you'd never believe.  It feels like a survival game, but without hordes of enemies assaulting you.  Heck, I can't think of a single actual enemy in the game.  All of your opponents are purely philosophical.  And that segues into my last point.The game causes you to ""think.""  You will be peppered with questions about ethics and communication, interaction and science.  They are questions ""I've"" considered for a long while, but few examples in any media have tackled.  The ending, sadly, does not leave you with any answers, though perhaps that is a good thing.  Perhaps it's left like that to spark the discussion, and to motivate new thinking on the subjects.The Swapper is a game you SHOULD play and form an opinion on.  It's an indie masterpiece on the level of Bastion.			"

												The Swapper is what would happen if someone made a puzzle game out of the LV-426 sequence from Alien with a Metroidvania-esque flair to it, and that's perfectly OK with me. Terrific visuals and audio, thoughtful puzzles that ramp up quite nicely, and its excellent pacing ensures that it doesn't overstay its welcome, nor feel too undercooked.			"

												Hey a science fiction story that takes 3 seconds to get interesting!  I wish I could show this to that fool at my writing class who said good scifi is only good 100 pages in.Fun well utilized gameplay mechanic - checkstory that asks quick simple questions that make you uneasy - checkinfo delivered in unobtrusive audio playback you can listen to while you solve puzzles - checka creepy climax that leads to a cataclysmic horror show - you can't win them allOh!  it looks nice too I guess...

												The Swapper - Deep, intelligent and demanding.On the surface The Swapper is a puzzle game that borrows a lot from VVVVVV, portal and braid, however the story binds it all together and drives the player forward through a tense and atmospheric setting.The controls are super-simplistic and responsive, the 2.5D visuals are gorgeous... in fact the whole thing feels very well polished, not indie at all.With an ideal playtime of 4.5hrs (at a leisurely pace), this game should be played uninterrupted and with good sound.It goes without saying that I thoroughly recommend this game.

												I just completed the game 100% and I thought the 5 1/2 hours of playtime was well worth it. (Note: This review contains a very minor gameplay spoiler that I think is worth mentioning, so if that bothers you, stop reading this). Many people consider this game to be a ""metroidvania"" style game, but I honestly wouldn't consider it to be one because of three reasons: 1) The game consists of many, many ""green"" rooms, all of which are puzzles of increasing difficulty. I liked the feeling of progression but felt like some of the last few (possibly optional?) puzzles were overly complicated. I couldn't figure out how to ""properly"" solve them and I never referred to a walkthrough, but I did notice that each ""clone"" you made would have about a 1-frame delay from your ""main"" character's actions. This allows you to abuse your jump and disintegrate a clone that you couldn’t otherwise touch.2) I felt like the game was very linear despite its open-world style layout. I guess you could say the same about Metroid in terms of playing the game casually (without sequence breaking), but this game evoked a feeling of linearity unlike the Metroid and SotN-inspired Castlevania games.3) Your character has limited abilities. Spoiler: There are no weapon or suit upgrades that you encounter throughout the game. The environments change and different game mechanics are introduced, but the main character never gains a new ability.Ultimately, if you like puzzle and thought-provoking games, I'd highly recommend The Swapper. The story keeps things fairly interesting and, despite 2 or 3 puzzles that the game throws at you near the end, I think most of the puzzles are well-done and gradually become more difficult. Every puzzle requires a different approach than the last, so be prepared to get stuck a few times throughout the game.			"

This helps immerse you in every level you go to, with the gameplay reinforcing the visuals, and vice versa.

It's definitely a game worth playing and great for puzzles and casual play. My only criticism is that there is no upgrade path for your gear in the game. It's only the puzzles that evolve, but not your character, so it might get a little boring in that regard. Overall, this game is great and I highly recommend it!			"

												The Swapper is a great puzzle platformer with some really nifty ideas and gameplay mechanics. As you progress through the game, you learn about what has happened to the station that you're in and the mystery begins to reveal itself. The story is also fairly well developed and kinda heavy too touching on question of life, the universe, and everything. =)The controls are simple - With WASD, you move left and right, have the ability to jump, and are able to grab blocks in some of the puzzles. The mechanics of the Swapper device are simple to understand: you are able to create 5 clones, and you can swap to them. The clones maintain their orientation as the were created, and imitate the movements of the 'active' clone. The concept is simple, but quickly becomes very difficult to master in some of the later puzzles.The game is visually stunning; the art is beautiful. From what I've read about it, the developers molded most of the game assets in clay and then imaged them into the game. This creates the unique look that The Swapper has. The music is grade-A and very beautiful to listen to. Along with the art, it sets the mood of the game as a gloomy, lonely, yet inquisitive environment.And the ending. Wow. There are two endings available. One is kinda meh, but the other one really wraps up the whole experience.As for the cons... the game was a bit short, unfortunately. I would say I logged about 5 hours of gameplay. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on the puzzles and how quickly you get through them. There's also achievements, however, I have no idea what they are. I've beaten the game, and haven't unlocked even one. They are titled as Roman numerals and the description is the same as the title, so there's no hint as to what they are. The game also has no replayability at all.However, those are my only real gripes, and definitely doesn't offset from the great playing experience this game has to offer. I wholly recommend it, 9/10.			"

												A mindbending puzzle platformer with great atmosphere and a moody soundtrack. Despite some vague ""metroidvania"" strappings, this is basically a very linear game. Some of the puzzles will drive you mad, but they always have logical solutions (sometimes more than one). When you solve a particularly tough puzzle you can experience pure elation.On the downside, although the story and the setting is intriguing, it ends up being mostly nonsensical and confusing. I didn't get much out of the audio commentary and text logs scattered throughout the world. A second gripe is the generic and repetitive nature of the puzzle layouts. Sure, a few new elements are introduced throughout the game, but the main design and gameplay mechanics of the game, and the type of the puzzle rooms that are available, remain pretty much the same from beginning to end. Luckily the core gameplay gimmick is strong enough to warrant a very enjoyable single playthrough. (By the same token, it has very little replay value, if you're into longevity.)Rating: 8/10			"

												The Swapper is quite simply a beautiful game. The gorgeous visuals, all hand crafted from clay and other household materials, immerse the player in a fully realised sci-fi universe. The atmosphere created by the both the art style and the minimalistic piano based soundtrack is intoxicating. You arrive on a space station, and are shortly contacted by another sole survivor who speaks of the existential nature of the human soul and how we define our sense of self. In the final moments of the game you will be asked to make a choice that, once made will likely leave you deep in thought for some time. The core game-play involves puzzles that gradually increase in difficulty, often quite sophisticated and intricate, making it all the more satisfying when you get it right. The player wields a device which can create clones of yourself and then swap your soul between them, this is the fundamental element in the puzzle mechanics. The puzzles are fun but what sets this game apart from others of the same genre is the world created by Facepalm games. This is a great example of how the medium of video games can offer something as emotionally rich and affecting as the great works of cinema and fiction writing.			"

The atmosphere is outstanding (think of the loneliness of Dead Space or System Shock). The controls are simple to learn but capable of extremely acrobatic maneuvers. The puzzles have just the right balance of difficulty - there are no zingers that require you to consult a game guide, you just need to keep at it. Really impressed by this game.			"

The story is as intriguing as Braid and the question(s) it brings up are even more gripping. The puzzles are as fiendishly fun as Portal. The main draw for this game, however, is the atmosphere. You get the feeling of being alone and confused in a massive space station, with the threat of something aweful soon to transpire always hanging above your head, without anybody actually coming out and saying ""hey, you're all alone and confused in a very large space station where a terrible thing is soon to happen..."" To get that message through artwork and design alone is what takes this game from pretty cool to pretty awesome.			"

												Mostly good.  Only one puzzle made me feel like I was cheating.  To get both endings, the game wants you to play through the whole exact thing twice, which is total B.S.  The metaphysical gibberish is annoying.  Most of the puzzles are fun, though.			"

												The Swapper is a new kind of puzzle / adventure game in a mysterious setting, on a derelict ship. The discovery of alien non-organic sentient stones lead to the creation of the Swapper. A device that can create clones of yourself and switch minds with others.The game has a beautiful atmosphere and the graphics make it even more immersive. The puzzles become increasingly challenging and if you're into the plot, you will enjoy how the story discusses the concept of existance.About 4-5 total game hours, absolutely worth it.			"

												This game is another excellent example of the beauty of indie games. The artistic side of this game is just beautiful and the puzzles are really clever. I admit later in the game puzzles get tricky (in that way where you have to do a tricky movement and if you fail, you have to redo the puzzle). And then there is another very important aspect in this game - storyline. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but it is really awesome. Go and buy it and play it and finish it and the play it again.			"

												If you like your puzzle games with a little more forethought and personality than your average Peggle clone, then you could do far worse than the brilliant ""The Swapper"" from Facepalm games. Touching upon themes of morality and mortality, this little indie gem forces you to think on your feet. And it's not just the excellently designed body-swapping physics puzzles that will leave you scratching your chin either. There is a deeper message here about the human condition framed inside a compellingly original sci-fi narrative. Beautifully animated, hauntingly desolate and punishingly difficult, The Swapper sets a new bar for the indie puzzle genre.			"

												The Swapper is quite a fun adventure if you can tolerate it that is.The Swapper involves being on a abanonded spaceship vessel armed only with a machine that allows you to create clones and swap between them opening up some ingenious puzzle gameplay involving moving your clones to different locations etc not much can compare to killing off a whole legion of yourself from dropping down a large fall then crowning yourself king because your the only one with free will or creating and switching to one of your clones to save yourself from a nasty death.The puzzles in the game genuinely seem well thought out and aren't gimicky or dull but frustrating enough that your gonna get a kick out of finishing them properly above all they are a general joy to complete and do feel as if they are testing your brain in the later ones. There aren't any enemies in the game but truthfully the Swapper doesn't need them to be challenging, it's one of those games that has taken a simple idea and flown with it exploring how best it can use it's concept like Portal has for example.The game is set out metroidvania style which means backtracking and exploring a lot but that's part of the fun of the game - exploring the spaceship and wondering what happened to it's inhabitants. Most of the story is told through small bits of texts that you can find throughout the game that help you to slowly piece together whatever the hell happened. On top of this all The Swapper's art style is pretty unique with the characters being made out of clay and shows that you don't have to be a big budget release to look great and atmospheric - I felt isloated and alone in the cold ship interior and started to long for another human being during the adventure. My only real problem with the Swapper would be the length and how (justifiably) annoying the puzzles can be, which can easily make you start to hate the game or get bored of it. That being said if your into both puzzles and adventuring the Swapper is a title your going to want to pick up.+ Atmospheric + Puzzles are well thought out+  Visuals are great+ Ingenious concept- Kind of short- Puzzles may make you want to rip your hair out or sell your soul for the answers9/10			"

												Gunpoint may have worked my brain pretty hard in some stages, but nothing tested my mind as much as The Swapper (well, perhaps Antichamber... but we'll get into that later).  The Swapper uses a limited amount of controls to craft some fiendish puzzles, similar to Portal.  Your character can move left and right, but the titular mechanic reveals itself in the way you can create clones of yourself in nearly any location, and with another click you can switch to that clone.  Levels gradually introduce other challenges, such as areas of light that do not allow clone creation or swapping (or both), some larger areas that have you treading familiar territory like a Metroid game, and gravity puzzles because why not.  Overall, I enjoyed the game (again with a surprisingly deep story), but I also didn't like how certain later stages basically only had one intended way of success that can take a long time to figure out.  Then again, those ""Eureka"" moments when you do figure out a solution after an hour is pretty great... until I realize I spent an hour playing one puzzle :(			"

												The Swapper another great addition to the family of puzzle games, and a must-have for any puzzle-fanatic.As a helmet wearing space-scavenger, you are a nameless person, in a nameless place in the orbit of a nameless planet.Weird things are happening, but there is no way of know what it is...until it's too late.Inspired by Portal, this beautiully hand-crafted game - reminiscent of a 90s adventure-game, or perhaps a point-'n-click game - tweaks and builds upon this already fantastic puzzle game, and bringsfresh ideas and mechanics to the table to create a splendid puzzle game that will leave you scratching your head more than once.Aim your ""Swapper"" and create a clone to help you solve the puzzles presented to you,but beware the lights, for they will not make the puzzle-solving easy!To complete the immersion, the audio does an amazing job of sucking you in and not letting you go.From eerie, ambient sounds, to a relaxing piano melody: the music sets the mood for every moment of the trip.Explore the beautifully aesthetic and atmospheric environment, collect 'the orbs' and unravel the mystery.""What is this ""I"".

												This game is amazing. Started kind of slow and difficult to understand. It got to a point where the game is like ""try doing this"" and you realize how cool the game is. I would say the game is a combination of Myst or other puzzle solving games and metroid for the map layout. The objective is to collect orbs by solving puzzles in rooms, but you can choose which room to go in. Some rooms seem impossible so I went to another one, solve it then come back and the previous one clicks. Haven't gotten too far into the story, but its been interesting so far.			"

The game is so atmospheric - at first having clones and swapping is weird and you end up with a weird sense of detachedness, which fits the game, running around this big old deserted ship with a single voice guiding you. It also has a great puzzles and a nice back story to boot, and all of this coming from an indie publisher. I can't wait to see how the game ends, it's been great fun!			"

												An excellent, atmospheric puzzler.  The surprisingly deep narrative ties in perfectly with the simple gameplay mechanics and unique presentation.  Particularly for a game with such a 'handcrafted' aesthetic, eveything feels remarkably tight.  The Swapper deserves additional bonus points if you're versed in philosophy, particularly philosophy of the mind.  Although this isn't really a horror experience, you are likely to find yourself deeply unsettled as you play (in a good way).The puzzles themselves, with the exception of a few of the final ones, aren't terribly taxing; but they still provide enough of a challenge to maintain the inertia of the experience.  This game could have been longer again by half and still held my interest.My one gripe would be that the achievements (which involve finding hidden terminals) felt like an artificial means of extending the play time.  Some of the achievement locations made intuitive sense / provided environmental clues, but others seemed to require the player to scour every edge of every room in the hope of stumbling upon a hidden area.  Ultimately, I ended up cheating and using a guide to find most of these.			"

												I was drawn to ""The Swapper"" by the interesting game mechanics - cloning and swapping, and the fact that is an indie title that looks good (not a lot of those around). After finishing the game I must say... I got a lot more than I bargained for.The puzzles are interesting and quite challenging, requiring you to master the art of ""clone 'n' swap"" to perfection. You don't have any enemies, there are no boss fights, there are no impossible tasks - you just have to get away from the space station. During the game you realize what ""swapping"" actually means from a philosophical standpoint - you clone and you swap souls with the clone - is that still you? Is it moral to just take over someone else's body, be it your clone? You must ask yourself at the very end of this ""two-alternative-endings"" game. My only regret is that I have to play throught the whole game again to play the ""alternate"" ending.Highly recommended.			"

												I love this game.  The art style is fantastic: backgrounds, characters, and curious geological forms are all nicely visualized and the bloom features make it all so pretty and moody.The gameplay felt good, and the progression of difficulty felt pretty natural as new puzzle elements were introduced.  I did admittedly find myself stumped for a few hours by the last three puzzles to the point of needing a strategy guide, but it feels good to know that a game like this can still give me a serious challenge.The story though, I liked it most of all.  Heavy science fiction mingling with philosophical ponderies is just what the doctor ordered.So yeah, puzzling platforming, fine visuals, and a great story to boot, you should probably pick this up if those are things you admire in a game.

												A lot of reviews of The Swapper talk about how your actions in the game will touch you on a deep emotional level. The action of effectively killing clones of yourself over and over just to proceed, the philosophical argument about who is the real you, are you you, or are you a clone? Does it matter?Rest assured, if like me you don't care about any of that stuff, and like me, you don't really see the appeal of games like Dear Esther or Gone Home, there is still an awful lot to like about this game.The puzzles are excellent from start to finish. There are some really difficult ones in there, but they're never unfair, and because the game doesn't punish you for trial and error, other than by having you restart the room you're in, it hardly ever gets frustrating.Then there are the graphics. The Swapper has a really unique style, perhaps somewhat similar to The Dream Machine, with some excellent lighting and particle effects which really make this game look fantastic.The story isn't bad either. Setting aside the aformentioned philosophical and emotional elements, there's still an interesting sci-fi tale going on in the background, and throughout the playthrough there's an excellent sense of mystery and isolation.The only real negative I can think of about The Swapper is that the achievements are terrible. All of them are for accessing terminals which are hidden in such obscure places that you wouldn't even come close to spotting even one of them on a normal playthrough.But that's a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent game, and most certainly one of the best in the puzzle genre, so I highly recommend you give it a try!9/10			"

												I enjoyed my playthrough of 'The Swapper'.If you're a fan of puzzle games, minimalism, sci-fi and existential themes, definitely check this one out.The solution to all of these puzzles are simple in execution but figuring it all out while utilizing your clones effectively is not always easy. Some solutions might come to you right away while others may not be as easy. Still, the challenges presented are fair and the game makes full use of its syncronized clone mechanics, while introducing some other clever things to the mix.The only downside is the game's length. For an indie title, it's good for what you get but it might be wise to pick this up on a sale if you have any doubts.			"

												A very satisfying puzzler. You use a gun to create clones of yourself to progress through the game. All the puzzles are created in a way to get you to use your abilities in a new and creative ways. Some of the puzzles are quit mind bending in that the solution isn't obvious. I highly recommend this game.			"

												A great little puzzle platformer, with a surprisingly deep message.It is not every day you hear a game talk about the ""great chain of being"", or dealing with very profound spiritual ideas and eastern and western philosophy. If you have any of those interests, you'll probably catch them here and there in this game. I think it is brave to snuck it in a game, where probably most will never catch these ideas though. But, there is no coincidence that the ""big face"" looks like a certain ""eastern religious"" figure. And the ""dialog"" found in this game has loads of philosophy/spirituality.I also noted hints, pointing out how futile culture-wars really are, and that the arguement of ""matter versus spirit"" ultimately misses the point; none replaces the other, but they complete each other. I very much agree, how refreshing!But if you have absolutely no idea of what I am talking about, don't worry. You don't have to know any of these things to enjoy this excellent game. In a way, I think those ideas are the point of the game, but they are still sneaky enough that you might never care about it and just enjoy the game, which is totally fine. And you might still find the story and the questions intriguing. Even the game mechanics should make you ask some interesting questions. And of course I think this game can be rightly interpreted in many ways, which is even greater in my mind.A really intelligent game, whith at some times very difficult puzzles, although the overall experience is not too difficult.

												The Swapper is a puzzle game. Period. But's it's a very interesting puzzle concept. You arrive at a space station where something went wrong. You obtain the swapper, a ""gun"" that clones you and allows you to swap between them.The game is a series of puzzle rooms, going from one to another, and learning slowly the story. The puzzle difficulty is not steep and very few felt impossible.The story is only unrevealed in the end, so this is that type of game where you have to play twice to get all the story details.The graphics are good and very atmospheric. The authors used clay models and that gives a very distinct feeling. The sound makes you feel alone in a space station. "

												This game is not really a metroidvania in that you don't really have item progression or levels. It's just a side scroller overworld that leads to puzzle rooms along the way. With that said, the heart of the game is a puzzle game using the game's mechanics, and they are sometimes quite involving. Some of the latter ones take much more thought than the earlier ones, whereas some of the earlier ones were a bit easy. I feel like the game is a strong start to a mechanic that could have been taken to another level. Visually, The Swapper has some type of claymation-esque graphics which helps with the setting being an out-of-this-world crashed spaceship. All in all, it's a fun little game. I beat it in one sitting, and wouldn't mind playing it again in the future.			"

												The Swapper is a wonderfully atmospheric and beautiful puzzle/adventure game that had me sucked in from beginning to end. Besides the ending, it is pretty light on story, which I felt really helps the flow of the game. The Swapper has a lot to ask, and answers very little (wisely avoiding preachy pretension), wrapping everything up perfectly before it overstays its welcome. This game is one of my favorite games of this decade, and I recommend it to everyone I know. :3			"

Aside from all the visual and audial queues that make up the chilling atmosphere, the difficult and brilliant puzzles define the gameplay.  Overall, one of my alltime favourite purchases on Steam.

The mind-bending puzzles will stretch your brain power, whilst the ongoing existential debate adds an extra layer of perplexity and intrigue. The soundtrack is rich and provides an eerie backdrop to the whole experience. And I’m in love with the stylistic choices made in design and graphics. A masterpiece – you must play it!			"

Perhaps my only gripe is how disconnected and contrived the puzzles feel in relation to the game's world and the story. This disconnection somewhat ruins the atmosphere, but not enough to stop me from recommending this title.			"

I wouldn't have thought that a 2D game like this could be so atmospheric, but everything from the visuals, sound design, and the story create such an immersive atmosphere!It does have great puzzles, and there is a lot of story which - at least for me - might be better understood through multiple playthroughs; all of that combined with the immersion makes this game a definite recommendation!Watch part 1 of my let's play:

												Deep. Insightful. Philosophical debating at its best. This game left me needing more. So many questions left unanswered, but then again do they need answering for them to become something different, or only different in my mind. Gameplay is unique as you create clones of yourself to move your conscience through the map and solve the puzzles in 2D. Add in lights that only allow certain movements and flipped gravity and it creates a real challenging experience. The steam achievements were a bit frustrating because they didn’t have a description of what was needed from them. Looked it up which I hate doing. Also, I ended up getting lost on the massive map. All in all, a good game that’s fun to play with an intriguing storyline.7/10 "

												This was a fantastic indie puzzle game. It's got the gameplay of Limbo, the atmosphere of Dead Space, and the puzzle style of Portal. Really well done.Graphics: The whole setting is really dark and creepy. They really pulled off the abandoned spaceship look quite well. Gameplay: The platforming style is similar to Limbo, but the main game mechanic is as innovative and interesting as something like Portal. Basically, you can create ""clones"" of yourself with a cloning gun and can switch to control each of the clones. It's really interesting and there were some great puzzles, incorporating things like reversing gravity, boxes and pressure pads, and different areas where you can/can't create clones.Story: I was very pleased with the story. It brought up a lot of issues involving the killing of the clones and whether or not your ""soul"" is lost in the clones, etc. The voice acting and writing was pretty good as well. The story was only about 3 hours long, but I felt like they did all they could with the puzzles and ended it at a good time.Overall, a fantastic indie game with a very well executed game mechanic. If you enjoyed Limbo and Portal, you would surely enjoy this game. 9/10			"

												A very pleasing game. It's a Puzzle-Platformer where the player has to use his Cloning/Swapping Device to reach certain objects which open new areas with puzzles. It feels pure, in the way that, although the main gameplay focusses on the cloning and swapping, it still feels like it complements the platforming. It isn't too hard although there are indeed a few brain teasers here and there, but they spice up the overall game experience nicely.The soundtrack is very beautifully crafted and gives a really deep sense of loneliness, the vastness and, parapoxically, the silence of the outer space.I'm humbly glad for the additional soundtrack I recieved buying this game. (got it?)(That track[soundcloud.com] is unbelievable!)I never heard of this game before and I wasn't really expecting much to begin with, to be honest I was pretty sceptical at first, and to my very welcoming surprise it caught me off guard and surprised.

												As games go, this one is quite unique. You create clones of yourself and use them in a varity of way to complete puzzles to advance the story line. The game give you the sense of being alone, but uses a sparse contact with some NPC's to direct you forward through the plot.I appreciated the graphics and that the puzzles themselves were not unfair, that said, some of the puzzles were extremely difficult and required you to stop and stare at the puzzle for a few minutes before you understood what it wanted you to do. I had a few occasions where i would stumble upon the solution and went ""wait.... oh i get it!""Cons:~~The achievements are secret areas that are absolutely unfair to find, that was a big letdown, you cant find them unless you looked at a guide or spent hours walking into walls trying to find the small spot in one that was a fake wall. I wish they were more a puzzle aspect than just simply hidden behind fake walls.~~The storyline has no replayability, while it is a great thought provoking game, it is good for exactly ONE playthrough. It took me 7 hours to get through the story, i dont ever plan to play it again.All in all i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a well thoughtout puzzle game.			"

The technique of creating bumpmaps for photos works really well to make this world feel like a real stop-motion set.The gameplay is really fun and relaxing, almost a bit too non-violent, in fact. The atmosphere tries its hardest to creep you out, but with no apparent threat to the player it has a hard time... maybe some rudimentary enemies that you have to distract with a clone would have gone a long way!So, in one sentence: The gameplay is basic but you will love this game for its art alone!

												A very quick game with a game machanic that is reminiscent of the Time and Decision (Shadow) section of Braid. The story is as intriguing as Braid and the question(s) it brings up are even more gripping. The puzzles are as fiendishly fun as Portal. The main draw for this game, however, is the atmosphere. You get the feeling of being alone and confused in a massive space station, with the threat of something aweful soon to transpire always hanging above your head, without anybody actually coming out and saying ""hey, you're all alone and confused in a very large space station where a terrible thing is soon to happen..."" To get that message through artwork and design alone is what takes this game from pretty cool to pretty awesome.			"

												A little over 4 hours to complete this 2D puzzle platformer - and I had a pretty good time.  Even though its low budget, the atmosphere was pretty bleak and lonesome... which is perfect for a space adventure.The basic idea is that there are rooms that contain puzzles, you must make clones of yourself to solve them.  There are different colored lights and gravity that affect how you can clone yourself.  Overall I did not find the puzzles to be difficult because they were logical, so you can think your way through them; which is awesome!For anyone who likes casual puzzle platformers - I've give this a go!

												An amazingly impressive atmospheric puzzle platformer. Scratched exactly the itch I was having for such a game. It feels very Super Metroid-ish, despite not having any enemies to shoot, and is one of few games to focus on philosophical problems involving cloning from a pretty reasoned perspective. It's very pretty, but also is very well designed. A lot of the puzzles seem very difficult at first, but when definitely leave a sense of accomplishment when you solve them. The simplicity of it is definitely an unexpectedly challenging outcome.I'm sort of biased towards this game's positive rating and it takes me a lot to find faults with it, but there are some. There isn't really an 'evolution' of your skillset through the game and not much in terms of puzzle variety. The way to solve the puzzles is different, sure, but not the same kind of different like using a newly acquired powerup or something like that. I can understand how some would think the latter parts of this game kind of over stay their welcome, but I really enjoyed the theme that came with it.			"

												I am very impressed by The Swapper. It is a wonderful puzzle game.The key mechanics are duplicate player agents between which the player can swap which agent they actively control. Several other games on Steam use a similar mechanic (where the player controls multiple agents simultaneously who all move in the same way) I've played some of these (""I and Me"" comes to mind) but The Swapper builds on this mechanic and uses it in some new and creative ways.The atmosphere is excellently done. The screenshots on the store page don't fully do it justice. You have a sense of the isolation of space and the deterioration of the space station you are exploring. The atmosphere also enhances the underlying themes of the game and the questions it raises about life, the mind and identity. You don't have to engage with any philosohpy to enjoy The Swapper. But I think it is remarkable that the developers have created both an excellent puzzle game and an experience that can cause the player to reflect on their own thoughts.			"

												One of the finest games I've come across, I'm not usually a big sidescroller fan but this game just captured me. The atmosphere and storyline are curious and poignant. The hand-crafted clay environments create a neat look and it's easy at times to get lost in the combo of music+setting. The puzzles can be frustrating but then again they should be, although I can't help but think that the sidescroller format doesn't take full advantage of the world's potential. This could have been flowered into a massive game in many ways, but it remains a lovely gem in its current petite form.After finishing this must say that it turned out to be one of the most emotionally and psychologically striking games I've ever come across. It dares to reach into existential no-man's land and the ending choice sums up the entire game quite expertly. This one will make its home in the back of your mind and I'll be revisiting it soon.

												The Swapper is a puzzle game. Period. But's it's a very interesting puzzle concept. You arrive at a space station where something went wrong. You obtain the swapper, a ""gun"" that clones you and allows you to swap between them.The game is a series of puzzle rooms, going from one to another, and learning slowly the story. The puzzle difficulty is not steep and very few felt impossible.The story is only unrevealed in the end, so this is that type of game where you have to play twice to get all the story details.The graphics are good and very atmospheric. The authors used clay models and that gives a very distinct feeling. The sound makes you feel alone in a space station. "

												Imagine a PC game flavored with chunky bits of old school 2D. The Swapper's not quite a platformer, it's a puzzle game packaged with a brooding-mystery sci-fi story set in space.The essence of the game is getting to smaller puzzle rooms generously dispersed throughout the desolate space station.The puzzles have a rising difficulty curve, but you may not find yourself stumped until the later ones appear. That said, more systems are added as you advance, deepening the puzzle complexity by with more buttons that you have to stand on simultaneously, with new conditions that interfere with your cloning abilities.The heavy sci-fi atmosphere is heavy with prolonged isolation and sounds of shuttle doors closing, vents breathing, and space-inspired sounds. It's not monotonous, however; the setting sometimes takes you to lusher, greener spaces, punctuated with wonder-inspiring piano segments. A good pair of headphones is a must.			"

												First impressions: beautifully evocative visual, sound and narrative design; fluid gameplay (the character being moveable and just about visible while dialogue windows are up); and an intriguing and cool concept. I was even loathe to leave the main menu, so gorgeous is the music and look of it.The game also plays flawlessly with effects turned on (but VSync off for that first run) on my single core AMD Athlon 64 3700+ (2.21GHz) with a Radeon HD 6670 (driven by Mesa) and 2GB of RAM. In other words, it's probably pretty darn highly optimised and as long as your GPU + driver combo supports OpenGL 3.0 you should be fine.			"

Metroid/Castlevania style platforming with a unique body-swapping mechanic that makes for some interesting puzzles. If you want something that's unique and not combat-oriented gameplay, this is the game for you. Visually stunning graphics (runs great even on my older laptop) really add to the overall aesthetic.

												The Swapper was one of those unusual surprises to play. The game starts off simple enough and keeps an eerie vibe where you know very little about what´s going on and even who you are. Enter ""The Gun"" and everything changes. The gameplay becomes a series of amazing puzzles that are only interrupted by little bits of story that grows into you and develops until you reach a mind blown ending. Being a plataformer fan myself and a gaymer who prefers story over bling this quickly became an instant favorite.			"

												An enjoyable puzzle platformer video game that is side-scrolling. This allows you to vastly explore the world and areas provided. The puzzles increase steady in the amount of thought that need to be put into solving them. Also the beginning puzzles just get you used to the movement and controls, which i think was integrated effectively with out babying the player through each move. The objective is collect all these orbs to unlock the next area. The overrall story line for this game, is that humanity exhausted al its resources and the minerals or rocks they have been farming for earth have started to possess the space station inhabitants dreams and a group callled the ""Watchers"" sit idley by as u complete ur puzzels and explore the world for the apropriate time to intervene.Rating: 8/10			"

The puzzle mechanics are unique and make you really think, and flavor of the experience is really good.  The game leaves a good taste in your mouth :)The Swapper reminds me a bit of the Talos Principle, which is probably the best puzzle game ever designed (search for it on Steam).  They both have some remarkably unique puzzle mechanics and there's a heavy philosophical undertone to the story (though Talos goes much deeper with 100+ puzzles and took me about 30-40 hours to get through it).  I guess what I'm getting at is if you like puzzles, get Swapper and get Talos Principle.  You won't regret either purchase!			"

Short version: Fun game, relatively short game, very little replay value. Highly linear gameplay and lock-out after the ending doesn't pair well with non-linear story-telling.Steam Achievements are unrewarding.I'm glad I played it, but also glad I got it at a much-reduced price ($2.99) when it was on sale. Long Version: Visually and aurally the game is fantastic. Lots of complaints about bugs/controllability in the forums, but I had no issues. The price tag on the game is for all the hard work that went into the shape and feel of it.In it's basic mechanics, The Swapper a pretty straightforward and fairly linear puzzle game. Some folks have branded it a ""metroidvania"" title, but it really isn't: you gain all the skills/tools/abilities you're going to gain in the first 5 rooms, so there's never any real limitations built into the game that would impose a need to backtrack. The only thing that could impose non-linearity on gameplay is if you get irritated at a puzzle and leave it temporarily to go solve another. You'll have to get back to it eventually, and when you do you'll be bringing all the same tools to the table as before.So, gameplay is fun and demanding the first time through, but fairly formulaic.The storyline comes in small doses as you work through the game. A lot of reviews have praised The Swapper for raising philosophical issues about personal identity and consciousness, but reviews rarely actually discuss it. I found the links to philosophy to be pretty heavy-handed. The medium here (a game) is perhaps novel, but the ideas in play are far from it. The guy who handled the narrative is Tom Jubert (FTL, Penumbra), and he clearly knows this: it's as if the storyline, characters, and dialogue were read off of a syllabus for Metaphysics of Mind 101 -- and the game cites the syllabus. Characters named ""Chalmers"" and ""Dennett"" bicker over the nature of consciousness (see David Chamers and Dan Dennett). The ship's name is the ""Theseus"" (see ""The Ship of Theseus"" problem). All this makes one wonder who the story is written for, exactly. Players unfamiliar with philosophy of mind may not see the not-so-subtle references here, and so won't read into the subtext that's carrying much of the weight. Players who have read the syllabus won't find it very novel. For anyone, a difficulty with the story is that it really only comes together clearly in the last 5-10 minutes of gameplay. After a lot of slow and piecemeal development, everything comes to a head, and you're finally able to do what you've been trying to do for hours of play -- so you dutifully race to the abrupt ending, getting heavy doses of information that alter the narrative dramatically. Then, maddeningly, after the ending you're locked out of the game and cannot go back into it to either (a) revisit bits of the story you've collected, now wisened by a deeper understanding of what's been going on or (b)  see the alternate ending  You have to start all over again. But since nothing in gameplay changes on the second run, it becomes a pretty unrewarding grind.One thing that might force you back into the game is that you've likely missed all 10 steam achievements on the first run. That's because the developers didn't provide any description of what the achievements are, they're just roman numerals. I honestly reached the ending of the game and thought ""Oh, I must be about to complete chapter I, so I'll unlock achievement ""I"" in a second now and go on to chapter II -- that'd make sense, and could explain the high price of the game; there must be lots more content yet."" Nope.  And when you do go track down the achievements, they add absolutely nothing to the game at all in terms of storyline or character or anything.  You get to read one-sided emails to the Theseus as they start their work, discover the Watchers, and lose contact with command. Very boring. So the game is gorgeous and makes for a fun afternoon. But I'm not sure it's worth all the hype. Get it on sale.			"

												Several reviewers have made a comparison between this game and Portal, and I'm heavily inclined to do the same.Portal was quite possibly, with the exception of its successor, one of my favorite games of all time. Upon completing the canonical story of both Portal and Portal 2, I must say that I felt a strange emptiness that wasn't really fulfilled until this game.This game is a masterpiece.The gameplay, if you know what it is, begs the question why everything would need to be rendered in 3D, models, lighting and all. Upon playing, you'll find that it's meticulously atmospheric, immersive even. The soundtrack is both ambient and enjoyable as musical pieces on their own, and there's both an intuitive and logical aspect to the puzzle solving. The deliberate manner in which the game is designed can only be considered masterful.While I was nearly entirely immersed, I couldn't help but take myself out of the experience from time to time simply to admire the game for its design and creation.Portal and The Swapper differ in the sense that Star Wars and Interstellar differ. One is more geared towards your entertaining, and even as my absolute favorite game of all time, Portal can feel rather superficial in comparison. It provoked emotions, sympathy for the characters while making me laugh and enjoy the puzzles. The Swapper feels larger in scope, is more cerebral and thought-provoking, and is completely serious.There are countless similarities between the two, however. If you liked Portal for the puzzle solving and would also like something a bit more abstract, perhaps slightly philosophical, I would highly recommend this incredibly well crafted piece, something more of an experience than a game.

												Pros:- EXCELLENT PUZZLE GAME!!- Beautiful graphics- Excellent ambiance- Weird/twist story, but still, good in the end...- Good pacing with nice variety when in zero-g- Excellent level design...Cons:- When opening the map, it doesn't always stay in the same orientation which is confusingOverall:If you like puzzle and the settings of that game BUY IT WITHOUT HESITATION! It's a MUST HAVE!			"

												The best way to describe this outstanding game is Portal, except the main character is Sam Rockwell in Moon.  Only the second side-scroller to seriously spook me (I'm looking at you, Limbo), The Swapper shares an attention to art and sound that make for an unexpectedly immersive experience.  There's a very well-designed, textured, quiet ambience to both games that draw you in and sets you up for a few precisely timed chills.  The best part, though is that these scares aren't (all) jump scares, they're mental.  It takes talent to set up a horrible realization that slowly dawns on you.  However, where Limbo got inside your head about childhood trauma, The Swapper will strand you in outer space among the inhuman ramifications of misguided science.   A must-play.			"

												A Flawless Experience.This game has a mesmerizing atmosphere and a unique gameplay hook. The visuals will draw you in to the mystery of this huge derelict ship, deep in space. And I have never seen such perfectly-executed puzzles: they draw you in and then gradually ramp up the difficulty so that every challenge feels like a new triumph. And the psychological tone of the story fits the gameplay gimmick to a tee. To top if off, it's worth playing on max settings even on a struggling ultrabook because the visuals are sublime and the gameplay is somehow completely tolerant of low frame rates.I cannot recommend this game enough.

												Satisfying puzzle platformer with a creative mechanic, worth buying. It's been quite some time, since I've last launched a game spontaneously, and was expecting some horrible things to attack me in just a second. I was pleseantly surprised to discover, that this game is completelty different from what I'd imagined. Puzzles are satisfying, gameplay decent. If you'd like some fresh air, try it out :)			"

												This is an amazing game. The puzzles are challenging and the hand-drawn / claymated visuals are very impressive. What truly makes this title stand out, though, is the mysterious and throught-provoking narrative. I found myself pulled in very quickly, always wanting to get through just one more chamber so  I could unravel the next tiny thread in the story. The plot, visuals, sound effects, and gameplay come together to form an unusually coherent experience, and the ending will present you with some thorny metaphysical questions to wrestle with.Highly recommended for sci-fi and puzzle fans. It's a little bit like a 2D, creepier version of Portal.			"

												This game starts as a simple (but also really frickin' cool) idea of future technology and space travel. Using small puzzles tucked away in rooms of a huge overworld, hidden secrets around every corner and a curioser and curioser story unfolding, this is a game you do not want to skip. It is one, however, you have to play at least twice because of- NP!?TT PN?!TR UDD8?; ZXHSZXH********			"

												My favorite game from 2013.  Clever puzzles that are challenging without being obtuse.  Great presentation, very unique visuals and fitting soundtrack.  The atmosphere may be it's greatest accomplishment, it reminds me alot of the first Alien movie's atmosphere.  It was worth it at full price, now on sale for $3 is a no brainer.  Give it a shot.			"

												Sidescrolling almost Portal. Almost Portal in the sense that you get a neat gun and you solve puzzles with it. The puzzles are brilliantly designed, no two have the same solution. Actually, all the solutions are pretty darn different from each other. Awesome story too. Just enough crumbs to keep me hooked. The ending really got me thinking.Buy this game if you like games.
