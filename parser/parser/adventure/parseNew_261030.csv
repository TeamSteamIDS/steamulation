												I'll start off by saying that Telltale's The Walking Dead is the most intense emotional rollercoaster I have ever experienced in gaming.Season 1 of this series was one of the best games I ever had the pleasure of playing, it had characters you grew attached to or hated with every square inch of your being, and anything that happened to them had some sort of emotional effect on you, this made the story engaging like no other and because TWD is also known for being pretty brutal at times, I have cried some serious tears.Season 2 started off a bit slowly, but once things got going it was on par with season one's experience for me, once again I felt attached to the characters I met, and some heart-wrenching choices had to be made.At one point I even had to pause the game when such a choise was presented, it's things like this that make The Walking Dead an unique experience.

SPOILER FREE REVIEW~If you are a fans of the original  game, this is season 2 of an ongoing popular series based on a comic and tv show. the main character this time is Clementine, the little girl who must survive in this post apocalyptic world filled the undead and lost hopes will discover that the people she meets and the choices she makes can be much more dangerous. The game starts off showing off  your previous gameplay choices from season 1. Also it carries over your save from 400 days which doesn't do much but be ready to load them anyways! The game  starts off suspenseful, sometimes slows down to give the player a grasp on whats going on and picks right back up on the action. At the same time,  the story adapts to the choices the player makes while still following a main plotline itself. If you enjoyed the original series then you will enjoy this one much more, The new way the ui interface guides you is much more nicely done in terms of  being smoother  and cannot be any  easier to understand. As you watch the episodes play on you'll see that the game slowly advances itself with much more interactivity and choices.The gameplay is quite simple to play and  has much more than just qtes (quick time events). Aside from pressing and smashing  certain key buttons during sequence there will be time when players willl have to control Cleminetine to interact with the game's environment itself along with various actions such as sneaking, shooting,  or interacting with other characters in the game in regards to the situation. As the episode is played the player will have to make choices in dialogues that will be shown on the screen, There will be a limited time to do so before it is default randomly picked to keep the story flowing.Aside from the amazing voice acting, well written dialogue, beautifully drawn cell shaded art and immersive story line. The game includes choices to make the player feel every emotion humanly possible . Depending on the choices that'll be made, Cleminetine will either seem like a cold hearted human being or one that will tolerate and love for everyone. The decision is yours to make. Although there are times in this game  there will be limited choices to make due to the main plotline, it will shake the very foundation of her conscience and yours.[WARNING] - If you suck at QTE etc this game will take you a long time to conquerYou will see death scenes, many many death scenes which can be quite gruesome so try to stay alive.[WARNING] If you have a faint heart, be ready because some of the scenes in this game is not for the squeemish. There will be many things you do not want to see in this game but it brings out the immersion to it and emotions.Enjoy the game Cool hats off to you and Game ON!+ Cell shaded beautiful artwork+ Immersive storyline+ Leaves you on the edge with suspense+ Experience fear, joy, dispair, anger, love, and the feels+ The art is fantastic and well drawn. + The voice acting is superb and top quality + Adaptable story choices that will keep you playing and wanting more.+ - its a graphic novel game with Qte, you will either like it or don't like it- Its a graphic novel game, not everyones type of game but it is one of the best ones out there.- You'll have to replay the game to see different choices, though it doesn't really change out the main storyline direction itself but it will affect many events- If you haven't played part one of the walking dead or seen the show, you will not understand certain events that is going, just jumping into it is ok but you will miss out on the backstory.- Waiting for the episodes, if you are impatient lol. written and Played ontwitch/kenuty - Finished on 8/26/2014Yt- Will try to do a video review without spoiler sometimesAll comments and feedback are appreciated, stop by and say hi when I am live, keep the bottom spoiler free and subscribe to the tube if you want and check out my other reviews on steam.

												I will be the first to admit that when I beat The Walking Dead: Season 1, I not only cried, but I cried like a baby. The story, setting, and, most importantly, the characters all pulled me into this world where no one is truly safe, and your decisions matter and go beyond the ""choice 1 = good-but-risky, choice 2 = evil-but-conserative"" trope. So when Season 2 was announced, I was eager to get my hands on it. Now, ten months have passed and the season is over, ending with ""Episode 5: No Going Back"". Was it amazing, and how did it stack against Season 1?       First off is the actual game(i.e. graphics, gameplay, etc.) The graphics maintain the same visual style as Season 1, but look a lot better, and a little less rough around the edges. There is occasional pop-in when the game just loaded, but this normally isn't the case as long as you don't fail any of the gameplay. Speaking of which, the gameplay has changed for the better, especially action sequences. As much as I loved Season 1, I will say  that the action parts could've been better. In Season 2, though, they are just plain grand, and Episode 2 has prehaps the best action sequence across both seasons. Also, unlike the majority of Season 1, Season 2 has a full soundtrack that plays the right music at the right time, fitting the mood and tone. No matter the gameplay advances, though: if you're playing this game, it's for the story.            (Note: I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can; however, if there is one, don't say I didn't warn you.) The season opens up with a bang, reminding you in the first five minutes that this isn't some cheery game where everyone is happy: this is the Walking Dead, and people- notably the ones you love- are going to die. Events transpire and leave an 11-year old Clementine alone and starving, and when she meets a new group, can she trust them? As the plot carries on, new (and old) characters are introduced, and you eventually have to decide which is better: appealing to your pathos(emotions) or your logos(logic), and this choice not only sets up Clementine for her future, but also kind of defines you as a person to an extent. This season sees you playing as Clem, and whoever came up with this idea is an absolute genious. Clementine is just a little girl, and while at moments she may seem empowering, she is still just a kid and can't influence everything to go her way. However, as those who've played Season 1 know, Lee did not leave Clem helpless. She can survive, and does so often to the point where a specific, boating character comments that ""[Clementine] survive[s] better than any three adults put together"". As a kid, your power in combat won't be as direct, as she is considerably weaker (physically) than most of the walkers and other survivors. Instead, she uses dexterity and her environment to win. And of couse, this being The Walking Dead, dialouge and character-connecting is the focus here. As only one character from Season 1 re-appears, most of the people you're talking with are people you only met recently, and how you interact with them could affect their trust in you.            When the characters die in this season, none of them are quite like saying goodbye in Season 1, but its not supposed to: you've only knew this people for a week or two, so you're not going to get bonded with them as much as you did with Lee and Clem last season. Nonetheless, you will find yourself liking some characters over others. Instead of trying to decimate your heart, Season 2 more leaves an uneasy, queasy felling at the end of each episode, almost like ""Did I make the right choice? Is there something I could've done differently?"", and it's hard to shake off this feeling. So, think of it like this: Season 1 was heart-breaking, and Season 2 is gut-wrentching survival.            There are a total of five different endings for Season 2, and they all define who your Clementine is and who she will become. While none of the endings are exactly happy, one left me actually feeling heart-warmed, one left me bitter-sweet, another left me worried for the future, and the last two were not-so-good as the other two good ones (for those of you who know, the two not-so-good ones are both of Jane's endings).However, I felt that the game had done a very good job creating a tale of growing up. Most of the decisions that Clem has to make are the same type (albiet without the whole zombie and survival part) that we ourselves make as kids that determine who we are. Tell Tale Games has recently confirmed Season 3's existence. If Season 1 was finding and teaching Clem, and Season 2 was molding and shaping her, I think it's safe to say that Season 3 will be seeing that shape and how it effects her views and opinions, which should be enticing for any fan. So, is Season 2 better than Seaon 1? In the end, yes, most definatly yes.I hope that I can continue to be there for Clementine as she goes through this jam, and I can't wait to see what directions it takes her in...			"

												Season two marks the next chapter in Telltale’s The Walking Dead. The Walking Dead emphasizes narrative and character development over all else. If you’re looking for solid gameplay, you may be disappointed in that regard. On the other hand though, TWD excels at providing an engaging story and features extremely likable characters. It plays out in the form of a point and click adventure game which feels a lot like an interactive movie. There are no puzzles, and the gameplay is handled through quick time events most of the time. Season two continues shortly after where the first left off and this time you’ll be playing as Clementine opposed to Lee. Seeing the world through the eyes of a little girl immediately makes the game feel more depressing and hopeless as she has to fend for herself now. The zombies, which felt fairly weak in season one are suddenly a much more dangerous threat for Clementine to deal with as well.The story telling is second to none; however my main issue with The Walking Dead is the whole illusion of choice aspect. At the time of this review, only the first episode of season two is available but this problem was quite prevalent in season one. At first glance, the game will make you feel as if your choices have a major influence on the story. Upon further investigation, you’ll realize that regardless of your choices, you’ll always be brought to the same conclusion. This makes The Walking Dead an extremely enjoyable experience the first time you play but it essentially eliminates any element of re-playability afterwards.If you’re looking for a great story, definitely check it out; just don’t expect to influence it much.For a more detailed review of Season Two, here’s a review video I made for episode One:

												Really great continuation of the story from the first game. Even if there is only 1 episode now I can say that game is really amazing. The idea of giving players to control the Clem is really great. I really enjoyed all the situations that she was placed in and it was giving me chills...If you havent bought it yet - DO IT!			"

												Genre: AdventureBefore playing that game you should first play Season 1. You are going to enjoy it way more if you have played Season 1 first.The game is based on the comic book series from Robert Kirkman and plays in the months following a zombie apocalypse. It is the sequel to The Walking Dead Season 1 and you can import your decisions from the first game. It is not necessary, but recommended. It has the same gameplay as part 1 and plays similar, but sadly you have even less gameplay involved. It is like a movie with some possibilities to interact with the script. I personally enjoy it, because i love good stories, but some might want to play more than just watch.It is still recomendable, even if only for the story.Positive:+ very good storytelling+ good voice actors+ breathtaking moments+ Characters from Season 1 appear+ you can import your Season 1 savegames+ different endings+ nice comicstyle graphics...Negative:- ... that are not up to date- too little interaction, it's almost like a movie- too short- episode format means that you have to wait some months to play the next chapter (outdated, as the game is completely available)In the end this is a great game if you love good stories. Fun gameplay: ca. 8 hoursAchievements:Type: PlayingDifficulty: Very EasyTime needed: Little			"

												The Walking Dead Season 2 continues a short time after the events of Season 1, but this time, you play the role of Clementine instead of Lee.Season 2 continues with the same cell-shaded art style and narrative-driven formula that Telltale has used with Walking Dead Season 1.  There were some minor interface changes that improved the experience and felt very good once getting used to them.  Also Season 2 did appear to make it a point to get right into the action with a little less focus on the down time.  The tone of the game remained very much like that of Season 1.  Even though you are playing as the 11 year old Clementine, Telltale did not hold any punches in the story and many of the situations that you are placed in can be very unsettling.  I could definitely see the difference in the character, and how she has grown as a survivor, with all of the innocence of a normal child her age long gone.  Just like in Season 1 you just don't know whether the living or the dead are the bigger threat to you, and there are a couple of really heartbreaking moments right out of the gate.Decisions from Season 1 and the 400 Days DLC are imported if you choose and the events of Season 2 will be altered based on those prior choices.  While Season 2 can be started without playing the prior season, I highly recommend doing Season 1 first so that you have a better understanding of what is happening and to have your choices imported rather than being randomly selected for you.And like Season 1, if you are an achievement hunter, it seems that the achievements will come simply by playing through the game, so it is very easy to get 100%.The music sets the mood for the game appropriately.  And dang, that song ""In the Water"" that is played during the end credits...Anxiously looking forward to the upcoming episodes for this season. "

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a game I was excited to play after I finished the heart wrenching first part. I wanted this game to have an even better story, tougher decisions and character attachment. And that is where my review comes in.I'm kind of on the fence about this review because while the gameplay was better and the story was also good along with many tough decisions, it just did not make me feel the attachment I wanted to feel towards the characters. The gameplay is definitely better with better quick time events and oh boy, there are some very tough decisions to make in this game as well, starting from the very first episode. But in the entire game, my attachment towards most people was not as high as compared to Walking Dead: Season 1. Yes, characters died and it made me feel bad, sometimes terrible but I didn't feel that rage or that rush of emotions or that melancholy that I did in the first part.All in all, this game was pretty great in almost everything but just didn't match up to it's first part but this does not mean you shouldn't play it, it's still a great game.

RATING9/10GOODThe Walking Dead Season 1 story continues through, but you're not playing with Lee anymore, but Clementine, a little girl that Lee found in the very first season. Episodes of second season are somewhat shorter, for example in first season episodes were somewhere between 120-150 minutes long, these in season 2 are 70-90 minutes long, it's not really big of a deal but I expected them to be even longer. While this is second season it's not really better than the first one at all, yes episodes of second season are more packed with action and all that stuff, but nothing really that I found more ejnoying than the first one. If you finished first season definitely pick this one up too, you won't regret.BADI found characters in the second season little bit boring, everything else is just fine and excellent.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season Two on Steam  9.5  / 10Expect nothing less than the Whole Gruesome Story of the Walking Dead including the full sights and sounds of biters and walkers…. I could almost smell them ! Season Two follows the survival of Clementine soon after the end of Season 1.  A Grim Story the choices we are forced to make are Heartbreaking, and the ending is devastating. For the full impact I recommend you play the Season One game first and then this Season Two game. Chapeau to Telltale games for streamlining in favor of  Story over Puzzles, it just works.Take note Achievo-Hunters: 40 Steam Achievements and 100% completion are guaranteed in 8 hours.Released in December 2013, and played in September 2015 on a Win7 Gaming Laptop.

												Once again, I've decided to review a game that can easily be considered ""old"" by now. And once again, that has happened because I really enjoyed the game, and I'm hoping that some day, somewhere, someone will be on the fence, not knowing whether they should buy this game or not, and my review will help them make that decision. I really enjoyed the game, just as I enjoyed season 1, and even if you're not a fan of the series, of even the comic books, you'll certainly love the game if you're a video games fan.Without any further delay, I present to you my review of The Walking Dead, season 2.GameplayI'll be making a considerable ammount of comparisons to season 1, as I'm expecting people to have played that one before considering season 2.As expected, season 2 picks off a little while after season 1 ends, and if you did, in fact, play season 1, you'll be able to use that save so that the game adapts to the choices you made in the past.This time Clementine won't have Lee around, which she will sorely miss, and so will we, but that's ok, because she's a nice girl, and Lee taught her everything she needed to know in order to survive.From the get-go the story is more focused on the human side of what's left, and not just run/hide/kill zombies. Obviously, there will still be zombies to kill, and zombies to hide or run from, but it won't feel as important. You'll have to make choices, some harder than others, and they will tailor the game as you go along, or this wouldn't be a Telltale game.You can expect the same graphics you had one season 1, with some tweaks to the graphical hiccups you might have felt while playing the previous season.You can also expect an incredible soundtrack, which adapts effortlessly to the scenario at hand.Pros Probably the most important thing is that if you played Season 1, and even the DLC (400 days), you'll be able to use that save so the story gets tailored with the choices you made before, and not just some random events; The story turns out to be more violent, with more human interactions to it, making it a great sequel to season 1; Great graphics; Managed to maintain the standards of season 1 sountrack; Amazing voice acting, as season 1 had, despite not having Lee's soothing voice around anymore; Great improvement on the menu sounds over season 1 (this is a +++ for me).Cons Might take some time getting used to the ""new"" UI and functions if you played season 1; Despite having a great story, sometimes it feels all the paths lead to the same place.VerdictI'd give it a 9/10 as I just don't feel it's as fluid as season 1, and the life/death situations aren't as exhilarating.P.S. I also shed some tears in the end of season 2, too. I miss Lee. "

												Just finished the first episode. The story so far is just as good as the first game. The new interface is a definite improvement. Looking forward to the next episode!Edit after playing the last episode:Overall, not nearly as epic as season 1, but still a good story. I felt like the choices you made this time around had more of an impact on how things turned out, which I liked. If you enjoyed season 1 then season 2 is a must own!			"

But to me it's not just a game, it is an amazing example of how common people could have (re)acted in an incredibly tough and harsh situations of their lives that show up throughout the story. When you judge characters for their behaviour and decisions and, on the other hand, you're not sure how would you have reacted being in their place, and when you're afraid of losing them, because in The Walking Dead (and in real life as well), you can't be sure about anyone's fate - and that's an amazing experience this game shares with you.Many memorable moments / lines that gave me a mix of different feelings and especially soundtrack (while listening Remember Me, episode 3 credits song, I was just sitting, staring at credits and listening to that masterpiece, slowly absorbing the story and the song) - if a game can give you feeling like this, then you know it's worth your time...So once again, Thank you Telltale! You guys are amazing and can't wait for season3!			"

												An enthralling tale of friendships, loyalty, betrayal and subterfuge.  Powerful dialogue despite sometimes unbelievable circumstances.  In this season you get much more development of the Clementine character, from an almost helpless child to one making decisions that define her and determine (to an extent) the group's fate.Recommended!

Posted: July 24, 2014
												I'm going to have to say, ""No"" on this one. Here's why:I didn't expect my choices to matter much. They didn't matter much in the first game. Even less so here, and that's fine.Why I bought the game was for a quality story with well-written, fleshed out characters and an interesting plot. That's where the game falls short, for me.Without divulging spoilers I'll simply point out a few things.- The adults in this game are shallow, vapid and near-idiotic humans who seem unable to make even the most minor decision without consulting an 8 year old girl. That this was done as a means of getting you, the character, involved seems obvious.  But the writers forego any attempt at logic or reason in the method they chose to get you involved.  The group doesn't know whether to trust person X.  ""Clem, what do you think?""  The group isn't sure where to go to avoid the next traumatic event or to deal with a current situation. ""What should we do, Clem?""  In this sense the adults nearly all only exist as a means to an end, the end being making you feel as if the things you say and do matter.  They don't. Most people familiar with the first game know they don't matter. Keeping up the pretense at this point comes at the expense of actually having to make these characters think and act like... people. - Likewise there's inconsistency in their behavior. For the most part you, Clem, will be the voice of reason, the arbiter of justice, the pacifier of aggression, etc.  Until the game feels it's time to remind you that you're just a little girl, again. At that point the rest of it goes out the window and the adults are suddenly knowledgeable and efficient and wise and you're just a wee little lass who's lost and alone and probably needs a hug, yeah?   Okay. Humans are inconsistent, self-contradictory, forgetful, all of those things. The trouble is the writers didn't bother to put any sort of justification in to explain this idea or expound on it, with one or two exceptions.  There are a couple of decent characters here whose inconsistency and reluctance to make hard decisions is directly tied to their past experience. The rest not so much, if at all.- The dialogue choices I was given often left me wondering whether the people writing them in one scene were at all aware of the things written in other scenes.  You're presented with a choice at one point, say, and then later that situation is referenced, but you're given no option at all to remind anyone of the previous conversation or interaction or meeting or whatever it was.  It completely pulls you out of any immersion in the story, and leaves you feeling as if you could just as easly have clicked things at random as they popped up.  Again, this isn't about making a difference in the overall plot or the fate of any particular person. It's about consistency, and it misses the mark in a big way for me.In short, at full price the game doesn't even stack up to the first Season, much less improve.  If you can get it on sale at half price... yeah, sure, as long as you don't expect too much from it in the way of a compelling cast of characters that you'll get invested in, or consistency in their behavior and atittudes.   Otherwise, save your money for something else.			"

												“I know Lee would die for this game”Speed 3.5/5 - Speed varies depending on how fast you want to complete the game, I felt like this season was shorter than the last one but sometimes speed isn’t that much of a factor when playing. Some episodes felt like they were taking forever to finish but overall it was not that bad.Graphics 5/5 - Graphics for this game were slightly better than the last game but mainly stayed on the same level. I haven’t played as many games as other gamers have but I though the graphics for both games were amazing, I give props to the designers.Story line 6/5- Amazing storyline, just as good as the last one but I felt that this one went more into depth with certain characters. More of the characters had back story which really makes this game a must play. Compared to the first game it has more suspense and what I felt was an overall better story progression in where they tried to tell what happened to every character.Horror2/5- Some jump scares but they are very slight, it’s not really a horror game like Outlast. I am a fan of Horror and love blood and gore, and while there was some blood and gore I felt like there could have been more.Action 4.5/5 -While this is not like a typical action (being where you are doing the moves yourself) game I found that it had its moments, most of the actions came from the decisions you made both verbally and physically. The more decisions you make the more action you tend to receive depending on the story.Suspense 5/5- Very suspenseful, makes you question what is going to happen next just like in the first installment. Playing the game while the stores were still being release made me mad because I wanted to find out what happened next. It was frustrating because when I was on the edge of my seat the on the next episode of the game would pop up. To make things my frustrating there is news of a Walking Dead Season 3 game said to be released in December so the means more waiting for us.If you are a fan of the Walking Dead video game then I recommend the second installment of the series, I have played both and personally I believe season 2 is something that can definitely compete with season 1. I have spent up to forty five hours playing both games and have gotten all of the achievements for both of the games, and it was worth every second that I played. If you remember in the first walking dead you played as Lee, a father like figure who is constantly watching out for Clementine, a small girl whose parents left her at home when they went on vacation. As the story progressed you grow attached to the characters especially Lee and Clementine but depending on which root you choose you are left seeing Clementine surviving on her own. In this season you play as Clementine as she survives through new dangers and experiences while she grows up in this apocalyptic society.  She is constantly outsmarting the adults around her, which in my opinion shows that she adapted well to the society and that Lees death wasn’t in vain. In each danger or crisis you once again have to make decisions that will not only affect Clementine but the other characters around her. Overall it was an amazing game for both the first and second seasons and I recommend this game to all of my family and friends. Here were some things that I thought the gamer could expect when playing the Season 2 of the Walking Dead game:What to expect -	Blood and gore, while not as bad as the game Outlast there is still slight blood and gore -	A child constantly outsmarting the adults that she is around-	New characters will great back stories that make us question the decisions that we make-	Zombies, as the mentions this is the Walking Dead so zombies are a given-	Tears , keep a box of tissues handy people trust me it can be sad at timesWhat not to expect -	Do not expect it to be like the TV series, they are two separate matters and have completely different characters. Sorry but there will be no Daryl Dixon, or Rick Grimes in this game.-	Butterflies and sunshine, it’s a Zombie apocalypse the only way you get that is if you die.-	A season three anytime soon, the earliest they stated its going to be released is by December 2015 and knowing them it will probably be longer than that. -	Lee coming back riding on a horse like a knight to save clementine.-	MMO and competitive game play, this is not like CSGO or COD, if you are looking for this , it’s not your game	What type of computer it takes to run:http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri I recommend this cite if you are not sure how your computer runs to see if your computer can handle running the game. It is a trusted cite that I myself have used many times on my old computers to make sure they could run the game. "

												Finally the fifth episode is out which concludes the second season. Thank you telltale for this amazing game. It was less emotional for me but still very good. The second season is more gloomy, people are dying on every step and you must make some tough choices. There's that feeling that there's no hope, you feel this on every step. When you feel like there's a small chance that everything will be alright, something bad happens and it repeats again and again until you understand that there's no hope. Nice to see how Clementine matured, the life was harsh to her. You remember how defenseless and vulnerable she was in the first season and now she's much tougher, has seen much more pain and can defend herself and look after herself. The game is almost identical to the previous one. Same graphics, same controls, same everything except for the characters and story of course which are main aspects making this game awesome.There's nothing to say more about this great game. Just buy it and wait for the third season which i hope will be same as good as the previous ones.			"

												And Telltale does it again!Wasn´t completley sure about making Clem the main char, but they did it very well. Our girl struggles for surviving in a very bleak world, where every rare laugh could be your last.. or turn into a cry at least.Seriously, if they offer some sentimental or positive feeling, in the next minutes fate has something in store for poor Clementine, which makes her live even more harsh.Don´t know if Telltale wants to keep this up the whole season (could be a bit much for the little girl - and the players) but for the beginning it works very well.

												Honestly one of the most gripping storylines in a game i have ever experienced. Controls and plays very similarly to the first series with few small minor improvements and tweaks. the multiple choice system in this series seems to have much more effect on how the rest of the game plays than in other games offering a similar mechanic.  the action scenes in the game are well scripted and have a lot of tension and makes the player feel very in control and makes accomplishment and survival seem that much more earned. the charecters are not as relatable and enjoyable as in the first series but this game is DEFINETLY worth your time and money			"

												Season 2 of The Walking Dead picks up a year or so after the events of the first game (needless to say, you should play that first if you haven't already). This time around, you play as Clementine, who is no longer the scared little girl from Season 1. Without spoiling anything important, the plot centers around a new group of survivors Clementine encounters, and the challenges they face. Gameplay is exactly the same as the previous game. You mostly choose between various dialogue options, with occasional breaks for action sequences (click the mouse on Walkers to kill them, mash the ""Q"" key really fast, etc). There's not much in the way of ""game"" here - it is simply an interactive story. As with the first season, the voice acting is top notch, and the visuals work very well for the game style. I have no complaints at all about any of the technical aspects of the game. On a side note, if you import your save files from Season 1 and/or the 400 Days DLC, the choices you made in those stories will be reflected in Season 2. This is a nice touch. Unfortunately, in the case of 400 Days, the results are mostly inconsequential, which felt like a letdown.What makes Season 2 different is the new cast of characters. Unfortunately, that's also the game's biggest issue. For whatever reason, I just never felt a big connection to anyone in this game, except Clementine (and one other person, which I won’t spoil for plot reasons). I can’t really place my finger on why this is. Maybe it's a combination of the novelty of the first game having worn off, and pretty much knowing exactly what to expect out of the Walking Dead universe by now. I'm not sure. None of this is to say the characters or the plot are outright bad by any stretch. That's not the case at all. I just didn’t feel as involved in or as attached to any of the characters as I did in the previous game. That said, there are some genuinely good moments across the 5 episodes, and plenty of those patented Tough Choices (tm.) that have become the hallmark of the series. The highlight is Clementine, who ends up being a great protagonist. It's great to continue her story and see her progression from child to adult under unthinkable circumstances. Overall, I enjoyed the game, and it’s well worth playing for anyone who enjoyed Season 1. I always felt the legacy of the first game would be hard to live up to, and that proved to be true - just go into Season 2 with lowered expectations and you probably won’t be disappointed.			"

												Just when I thought I wasn't gonna cry as much as I did on season 1, episode 5 just completely wrecked me! A well deserved sequel to the masterpiece that the first game was, while keeping the fantastic storytelling and characters. The multiple endings give the game a little more replayability, and even if you only play it once, The Walking Dead Season 2 is still a must play.➡️️Final Rating: 9/10			"

												Walking Dead: season 2 is pretty cool I guess.This adventure game follows the hit comic book series: Invincible.  You play as Clementine, the only competant person on planet earth. She's ten, by the way, what does that say about you guys? I mean, I live in a box, you guys don't have an excuse. After the events of season 1, Clementine is on her own after losing the remainder of her original group. Now on her own, Clementine must face the cruel realities of a world that no longer cares for her, or has animal crackers.That's only for maybe the first 30 minutes, actually. Soon, Clementine finds herself in a group you may or may not like. Because this is Walking Dead, and there are more douches than the product aisle at Zellers. Thanks AMC. I can't go much more into the plot without having to spoil things for people, for example when they find out that Clementine is the last Airbender. that really caught me off guard. The game follows the typical Telltale format, it's an adventure game where you spend more time talking to people you don't like then spending time hitting zambonies with hammers. This isn't really a bad thing, since the dialogue and back stories of all the miserable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you have to hang out with is actually interesting to listen to. But this being a video game with a main protagonist, a lot of the plot centers around Clemmy herself. This sometimes doesn't translate well, when a group of fully grown adults expects insermountable things from a ten year old girl, who doesn't really have much competition outside of the fifteen year old girl who may or may not have autism. It's never really explained. I'm going to be perfectly honest, Clementine probably deserves better than this. If you gave her four boards and a hammer, she would probably have a wood lodge with a fire place and a playstation built before sun down. This still doesn't change the fact that the adults around her are completely unreasonable. I've been told that it is a very emotional story, but I didn't personally find myself crying or feeling depressed over the events that transpire. This may be because it just didn't hit me at the right level, it felt forced, or I was just cooking a pot of baked beans when sad things happened. Who knows.Should you play Walking Dead: season 2? It's one of those games people really like to talk about. Though it's not for everyone, you can always get it while it's on sale. And you can be like all the cool kids with their bop its and their Pokemon cards and their Street Shark Action figures. Why couldn't I be like them, MOM!?15/7, how come Krillin didn't have a nose?

												A stirring and well-acted journey, Season Two of The Walking Dead may not deliver the breakthrough experience of the first season, yet it retains the emotional punch that makes this undertaking just as heartfelt and gut-wrenching as we all so fondly remember. Each episode builds upon the last, and we open with the slightly older and more experienced Clementine being once again ripped from the last vestige of Season One’s survivors. These initial scenes, when Clementine is truly at her most vulnerable, allow new characters and personalities to fill the void, and they are definitely a step up from those that we have love and lost before.I would actually state that new characters such as Luke, Rebecca and the reprehensible Carver create a far bigger impression and provide a longer lasting memory. The performances by the voice actors is incredibly top notch, and the screams from Sarita during a particularly grisly moment are some of the best acting this medium can produce. By the end of Season Two Clementine and the other survivors will have experienced levity, horror, fear, love, friendship, anger and many other emotions beside, with a strong cast that have truly become their characters.But among it all, there is Clementine. By the end of Season One you loved this little girl, and you wanted to protect her from the horror that has become of the world. Put into the spotlight herself, she thrives as a character in and of herself. Through the course of Season Two we see her grow, mature and even command the respect of those much older. She is strong-willed and can even have a lick of malice, depending on your actions. It’s a thrill to see her change and be changed because of the actions of others, and she can be both the voice of reason and the voice of spite.As with Season One, the dialogue is the main gameplay element that will take up the most of your time. While engaged with the other characters there are usually four options and a timer to quickly speak. Staying silent is also an option, and what you say, how you say it, and if you choose to speak at all can place other character’s lives in your hands. You cannot mull over your responses, weighing the pros and cons over your eventual choice – the game’s dialogue is fast-paced and demanding, and can have an intensity that other games couldn’t even begin to touch. This dynamic is as much a source of tension as the ever-present zombies, and these choices do affect how some situations play out.However, beyond dialogue, there remains a noticeable lack of direct interaction in The Walking Dead Season Two. Opportunities to explore the varied settings are far and few between, and these settings are much smaller than they appear at first glance. It’s hard to feel engrossed in the environment when you spend the vast amount of your gameplay ignoring it and talking to the next character to advance the plot. Quick-time events do vary the action on occasion, but the pacing of the gameplay is rather ho-hum.Despite these concerns, Season Two is still a strong enough experience to merit your time. Clementine’s story is enough to carry the game through any interactive short-comings. The quality of the experience is measured through how torn you feel when a beloved character is inevitably killed. While Season Two doesn’t have the impact that Season One has made – it is another strong showing from the great storytellers at Telltale and comes highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed Season One.8.0/10 "

												Season 2 of the Walking Dead starts off very well, episode 1 really got me in terms of emotions. I especially enjoyed episode 2, however later episodes get a little boring and repetitive. The final episode makes up for it though.The interactive parts have been nicely improved since the first season, but there's also much less exploration you can do. There are some tough decisions to be made and consequences to deal with, which really affect the story and leave you wondering if you made the right decision... as once again, people's lives depend on you.Unfortunately some parts of the story are not so well thought out as in season 1, on the other hand, the character development is very well done. Some of the characters just grow on you and you really start caring about them a lot. Do protect them please :)I really enjoyed playing this one, it might not be as truly amazing as season 1, but if you liked the first season, it's a must-play. Some games can really mess with your emotions, this is definitely one of those that you won't forget.			"

												*sigh*What to say about this.+ Cool graphics as always.+ Awesome voice actors as always.+ Almost breathtaking environment and atmosphere.- I just find bit unlucky the controlling. Sometimes you have to click left mouse button and hold it and then press an arrow key or asdw.. REMEMBER THAT or you are gonna repeatedly do a one thing for few minutes just like me.And one more thing - If you will but the DLC 400 days for WD 1, you will see a connection between the characters in WD2. If you don't buy it, it's okay. No need to. But maybe you could miss something!The feeling: I'll be honest with you. It was brutal, thrilling, exciting, I was sweating my pants.. Maybe it got me too much, when I catched myself yelling ""I KNEW IT I KNEW IT!"" completely aloud, I almost woke up our neighbours. It didn't make me cry as WD1, because the ending isn't so emotional and Clementine is acting more grown-up than before - if you let her of course. Many times you will think: (spoiler for WD1); I miss Lee :,(So yeah, 9/10 or 90%.. however you like it.			"

												After the superb Season 1, which turned out to be one of the most emotional stories I ever experienced, it was going to be hard to raise the bar, understandably. I felt this season to be a little less impactful, mainly because something like the relationship between Lee and Clementine, which made the bulk of the strength and emotional resonance of Season 1, is not present. Theirs was truly special and made for a magical story. Connection with other characters this time around feels a bit less strong, mainly because there's much more chaos this time, their situation is always dangerous and things change very fast. This actually makes sense in this world, but overall I felt that character development and relationships between characters suffered for it. That being said, though, there are still all the emotional moments and tough decisions that make you feel your choices very acutely, which is still the main focus of the game. Actually, deciding who to trust, who to follow, what to do is even stronger this time around, as you will be put in the middle of different people and situations and how you choose to interact has different reactions and consequences. Once again, Telltale are masters of the ""shades of grey"" in regards to every character and dialogue, nothing is linear and obvious, making the experience very engaging. There's also a few different endings this time around, which are interesting to explore and make it so your late game decisions do really have consequences.  The main take away from this season, though, was Clementine: how much she grows in every way as she shifts from being a little girl in understandable need of protection into the beginnings of a capable, prepared and charismatic person, in spite of being only 11.In conclusion, though I felt that this season was slightly less strong than the stellar first one, there are still lots of emotional moments and tough decisions as you'd expect. And watching Clementine develop and go through everything she goes through, mostly bad and difficult, granted, was a delight.			"

												Put simply, if you liked the first game then you'll love the second.It's a fascinating adventure with some truly gruesome moments. The characters are so well crafted and generally make such strong first impressions that you'll decide pretty quickly which ones you care to see survive and which ones you won't mind sacrificing if the chance arises. Some characters' lines are instantly memorable. The villains are genuinely boo-hiss. If you're like me you will be so invested in the game you'll only come off it under extreme duress!			"

												Another amazing season from Telltale Games. In this season, if you don't know already, you play as Clementine and depending on your season 1 choices lays the road you will go. You are faced with many hard choices throughout this season and is more emotionally effective because you play as the young girl and not an adult. You are faced to make choices no girl should have to and this leads to a lot of problems either way. The games sounds, characters (and returning characters) and music were absolutely amazing yet again. This season had some very tense, frustrating and saddening moments which all helped this game become one of my all time favourites.If you haven't played the first season, I highly recommend you do.10/10 for feelerinos, and expert crafting.

												Most of the Telltale games gets you really invested in the story and it's safe to say, that the story plays with your emotions. The Walking Dead: Season 2 is not an exception. When I played the first episode, I thought to myself, that Telltale Games will not pull off something like the original game and I was right at first. The first episode and maybe, half of the second didn't make me attached to the characters. As the game progresses, you start caring about several characters, about the events going on without even noticing. If you are left with a choice where you have to pick a side or do something, you will wish you had that extra 10 seconds to think about it, while at the start of the game it didn't feel as important. You will feel even more attached and invested in the story after each episode, so don't jump in conclusions right when you start playing it. Trust me, I didn't want to play like a little girl at first either. I recommend TWD:S2 not because it is a good game, but because it is one of the few games that actually makes you feel something inside, makes you think about morals. Pretty much shows the human side of you. While on games like Postal, Manhunt, Killing Floor etc. you'll feel anger and no remorse. Some games make you absolutely neutral. It's safe to say that both The Walking Dead games are worth your time and the full price.  "

												As most of you may know, you play as Clementine, a young girl thrown in a world where every time you see a glimpse of hope it does not take you much time for things to get messy again. It took me around 9 hours to finish all the episodes and there was times I wish they could last longer but in the end it was a nice journey. Choices in this game will matter, however not all of them and they may not lead to the impact you may expect. You'll be facing reactions from others in which they will remember what you did, to whom you stood up to or what you have chosen in a moment where there was not time to reflect properly. While the big decisions can impact the story I wish they would make more decisions and create a bigger impact around every character instead of a comment every now and then. Clementine is really young, but she became very aware of how harsh the world can be. Sometimes, innocence will make her believe in people she shouldn't or spare someone when it might not have been the best decision. However, I felt they put too much pressure for a little girl. Too often you will have others asking what you (Clementine) think about some themes, what should they should do or forcing her to choose a side, a path, who lives, who dies. I find hard to feel immersed in these parts because in a world where everyone is fighting for food, ammo and their very own survival it does not seem realistic to put so much weight and the destiny itself in the hands of a young girl. I understand that this is you, the player, who is making the choices but during Season one it was much more easier because you were Lee and I did everything to protect my sweet pea. Now that you play as her I can't help but feel that others rely too much on a opinion from a young girl and it seems... unreal. Unfair too.The soundtrack is nicely done. The main theme is a mix of hope and despair and get you in the mood really quickly. Most of the story elements will be more or less intense depending on how you play. As some of you may know, you can't expect much gameplay wise since it's a Story driven game so it's important for you to relax, be Clem and let yourself be part of this world filled with death and little hope. The more you let yourself get lost in the world the better your experience will be. It is not a game for everyone, that is for sure but if you like to listen to a story while making some decisions that could change the destiny of some people, I say, give it a try. Looking back, the first Season made a bigger impact on me. First I had to protect someone more than everything and Lee was an amazing character with a great voice and warm morals to keep his sweet pea safe from everyone, walkers or not. There was more Point & Click aspects when comparing to the Season Two, in fact I don't recall a moment where I have to stop and think about solving something, which can be a shame if you enjoy a little puzzling in your point & click games (as it should be!). Finally, I found no issues while playing this game aside of two achievements not unlocking at the start of the 5th episode. I unlocked them by replaying those parts. In the end, I had great fun with this game and I hope others can experience the way I did. My only advice would be: Do not trust anyone.			"

Product received for free
Review Season Two is set a few years after Season the first game. Here Clementine is a preteenager trying to survive without Lee.You can notice from the first interaction between Clementine and Christa that Clementine misses Lee a lot and that nobody will take his place.We see a girl becoming an adult and missing her adolescence.What makes things worse it that we are responsible for this evolution.It's sad to see a girl like Clementine being forced to take important and difficult decisions.Her evolution is based on our decisions, what gives us the weight in any choice we make.The choice that seems the ideal at that moment quickly becomes something caothic, out of control, where we don't know how to react and decide in the next moment.Sometimes we get a lump in our throats, but also we breathe angry, because we need to survive, and we want to smash the button to kill that character!Just like in the comics or the TV series, our main goal here is our own survival than the group, whatever it is.There is always a place or a name to get attached to... ""We need to get there"", ""It's not far from here"", ""We need to keep moving"". These are our incentives throughout the game.GameplayThe game is an interactive history, it's the history that drives us, not the gameplay.The exploration is not the objective, just like the puzzles are not difficult.It's possible to import the savegame from Season 1 along with the decisions you took. If you didn't play any of the episodes, the game will make random choices.You can play Season 2 without having played the first game, since most of the characters from the first game aren't present in Season 2, but you'll miss the background history from Clementine.Just like in the first game, you feel like at any time something will happen that will get us in trouble and as the game progress we are sure that this is a true survival game, because everything is important and every choice we make will lead us to a complicated situation.Rating:9/10For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

												Great game,great story! If you played this I'm sure you can't say that it's a bad game. You have hard decisions to take but in the end you will see the face of every character you met. The game follows the evolution of a little girl found and raised by someone who helps it untill death. Also both seasons follows in main among others the evolution of Clementine(main character) from a little helpless girl to a real survivor, all settled in an apocalyptic zombie world. By the way I think the game could make a little psychological profile of yours using the decisions taken in some circumstances. (10/10 for me)			"

												It's with a heavy heart that I write this review, but I really can't recommend Season 2, even though Season 1 was one of the best game experiences I've ever had. I knew Telltale wouldn't be able to make lightning strike twice, but I had at least expected the quality to be close to the first episode. It wasn't. Especially starting Episode 4, the game really herps itself beyond all derp.Without spoiling overmuch, the game's shoddy writing becomes painfully apparent when you realize that your input, as a player, doesn't mean anything. Characters you choose to save get killed off a few minutes later anyway, and characters get a bridge dropped on them as soon as the game feels like shifting the conflict between two different characters. In between is Clementine, who has become a massive Mary Sue in this game, in that everyone wants to win her for themselves - but somehow, no one is actually influenced by what Clementine says or does. Because the game is going for one particular outcome and by God, you are going to GET that particular outcome!Plot holes abound, and the game keeps trying to go for a cheap Player Punch, and it grates. Especially the conclusion, which is transparent and obvious from miles away - but Hell if Clementine (the character they ALL listen to) can stop anything from happening, since she's utterly useless and only serves as a spectator. Telltale wanted to tell THEIR story, and the player isn't being put in control, but simply dealt with.Please think twice before you buy, and if in doubt, get the Wolf Among Us instead, because THAT is quality worthy of Telltale.

												EDIT: I SHOULD MENTION NOT TO TAKE MY PLAY TIME INTO THIS YOU SASSY HARLOTS , i do a lot of model swapping with the telltale engine and thats why theres so many hours put into it.alright, after a while of playing through this game and finishing the ending episode a few times I've finally decided to give this an actual review. First off: if you're expecting a game that actually takes your choices into account, you might as well go and replay season one. The choices don't really matter in general, even the disposition of characters doesn't change except for a few throwaway lines. You could be absolutely horrible to a character but they'll still treat you like their best buddy next episode, regardless. Most of the things you say have no impact, and if a character asks you to do something and you say you'd rather not you're forced into doing it anyway. Characters you just met unrealistically expect the most out of you, and the fact that you're an 11 year old is completely ignored most of the time.There is little to no constant characterization. You have no development time for any characters, and no time to sit down and get to know people more. You are unable to form actual bonds with characters like you do in season one, and there is little to no backstory for many of the characters you're around. Character development is practically thrown out the window for the most of this season. An entire character's arc from season 1 is brought back for no reason, replayed exactly the same way as it was for the first game. The character himself is brought back and his death scene is ret-conned even though his character arc was resolved in the first season.You don't get any kind of closure for any characters. Their character arcs are either small or non-existent in the game and many of them are killed off for shock value and forgotten moments later. Characters you go through the effort of saving either die later in the episode or off screen, pretty much making your effort useless because you don't get any more character development for them, unlike the first season where determinate characters got actual closure and characterization if you save them. Others act out of character enough to get them out of the spotlight.Older characters treat you as if everything is your responsibility- You're made to do many tasks and when other character's question this it's quickly shot down by the person forcing you to do it. I get it, Clementine is a certified badass and she's supposed to be growing up, but it gets incredibly ridiculous when you're blamed for not being able to save the lives of some characters and so forth. The one character that is your peer and actually treats you your age gets barely any acknowledgement and is treated terribly through the game.You can tell the staff for the second season didn't much care for most of their new characters, not even bothering to defend them in interviews like first season staffers did. I.E.The creative lead and writer of season one, Sean Vanaman, when talking about a rather disliked character in season one, Lilly, challenged people to think about why she acts that way. The season two staff hardly treat their characters with such respect, calling characters useless and terrible. Killing off and keeping characters is determined by how fans receive them and this gives an unfortunate end to many characters and forced screen time to others.The game is fast-paced and short, giving you a whopping 9 hours of playtime, and leaves you feeling empty. You push through with no actual goal, plot points picked up and dropped various times throughout the game. The 'big bad' is killed the episode after he's introduced and serves little to no purpose. I could go on about the things wrong with this game. I pushed through the final episode feeling no emotional attachments to the remaining characters other than Clementine, only finishing to see the resolve of the story. The ""multiple endings"" are achieved through one simple choice, not determined through how you act in the story, and are over all unsatisfying.If you insist on playing the game, I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale. I, regretfully, bought it for full price, and if you're as opinionated as I am you're gonna leave feeling cheated.also you still don't get to hug sarah. 0/10. what a ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 continues with the story left off with Season One and 400 days (This is best played before Season 2). It is a much better adventure game than the first with some very hard decisions and more QTE sequences. The game is intense and heartbreaking, especially the final scenes. The story is well put together and really does make your previous choices have effect in some way. A entire character in the game, that is well developed like the main ones, could be different from person to person. The story has many twists in it, but it is not all doom and gloom. There are scenes where the group has hope, and those are some of the best.Season 3 has already been confirmed for next year. I cannot wait for it. This is the best point and click game I have ever played.10/10			"

												It just keeps getting better :), the Walking Dead Season 2 continues the story from Walking Dead Season 1. So apparently all the choices you made in season 1 also has a impact on season 2. As well as season 2 will eventually have a major impact in the upcoming season 3. Only thing that was a pain was waiting for the episodes to be release as they were being released months apart from each other.			"

												This time you play as Clementine through the whole season. This led me to laugh hard at the start of the game from the unintentional humour that came up by playing as an 11 year old girl. There is a part where you have to choose between saving two people being attacked by zombies, one of them is already bitten so if you leave him to be munched on by 4 zombies his friend says to you “why didn’t you save him!”……. I mean dude…….she didn’t even have a weapon! Clementine’s dialogue response options should be… A)	Are you f*cking kidding me?B)	I’m an 11 year old little girl you absolute muppet!C)	If you could aim and didn’t jam your gun like a dumb*ss maaaaaaybe he would have survived, you incompetent redneck hillbilly drunkard!D)	…Before you comment and tell me you can save the other guy, I know you can right, but it’s still absurd to shout at a little girl that she should have attempted to fight off 4 zombies at once to save a guy already bitten that she barely knew.There were some other parts where the other characters seemed forced by the writers to speak to you in a certain way, or ask your advice on adult situations, or even tell you things that no adult would talk to or tell a child in real life. I see that as laziness on the writers part, they could have gotten round that if they had Clem eavesdrop instead, but I guess that would have made it too stealth orientated for them. This is gonna be subjective, but I also found most of the characters you meet either unlikable (Bonnie, Nick, Rebecca, Carlos) or generic (Luke, Alvin, Mike) to really care about. I just wanted most of them to be killed. The first season’s characters had about half I actually liked and got me invested in their survival. I think they dropped the ball here, you could argue it’s further into the zombie apocalypse so the people would be more irritable and c*ntish but still, it really p*ssed me off how nearly everyone treated Clementine like sh*t. In the first season they were all looking out for the kids.It’s still pretty good overall though in terms of pacing and story, but I did figure out what certain characters were doing before I think you were meant to, which in turn made me choose a different response for Clem than I maybe would have had they been able to really pull the wool over my eyes.

												Where do I start with this one. Ok, firstly, I'm going to say it straight up, TWDS2 did live up to my expectations. I'm not sure why, but a lot of people thought that Season 2 was going to be better than Season 1. Now I'll agree that this was a great game and I loved every second of it, but it wasn't better than Season 1. I personally don't think Telltale will ever create something as magnificent as Season 1 Of The Walking Dead. Now that we've cleared that up, onto what I thought about the game. I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead, especially the games (I haven't seen the TV series, but apparently it's nothing spectacular) and this was a treat for me. I enjoyed what they did with the interface of the game, and I felt like the game in general, along with the soundtrack, was clean and on par with what I was expecting. Now the story is where this game both excels and falls. Telltale's Walking Dead series is known for it's story and characters, and I felt like they didn't forget that most of the time. But some events in the game just make me question their thought processes when designing them. Most of the characters were well-developed, however there were some who seemed to be introduced into the game, and killed out in the following 2-3 chapters. Back when I played Season 1, I didn't understand why this was the case, but now I'm enlightened about the subject, and surprisingly, it makes for a richer experience whilst playing. Overall, no matter what Telltale does with this series, I don't think I could ever hate this series. I was going to give it an 8 at most, but for nostalgic/personal reasons, I am giving it a 10/10 rating.			"

												lik dis if u cry evertim---But no, really, this game (so far, mostly season 1, but still) is probably the only game that can make me cry. The characters are extremely lovable, which means your heart will break more and more every second. I have loved each episode of this game, and I think Telltale's ""choose your own adventure"" type mechanic is what makes it so great. It allows you to have a unique playthrough everytime, which makes it fun to start discussions with other people and talk about the choices you made.Overall, this game is one of my favorites, especially since I'm a big zombie apocalypse/post-apocalyptic fan. I'd definitely give this game a 10/10, because there is nothing bad I can say about it.			"

												The second one in the series and still... good enough. Sadly, they made Clemetine the main protagonist here. I really like her and that's not the main problem, but with her (a KID!) being the player's character, story and other (new) characters come off as rather annyoing and stupid. Like... there is a six-group of adults and almost everyone of them let's Clementine decide or handle the most important issues. I know, I am the player, I have to do the dirty work, but you have to make it LOOK BELIEVABLE. Just my opinion maybe, but some parts just felt too forced and unbelievable because of this (and other stuff). I mean, Telltale always forces you into stupid situations but when it's too much, it breaks immersion and reminds you, you're just being forced to watch a rather stupid story, than being and taking part IN a better story. Still I recommend it, because the ending. I loved it.the good stuff Clementine is back! AND someone else. They both made the second season of the game great again! story is pretty thrilling (but has LESS to tell than the first one, not a really downside for me though) some small and fun-to-see connections to the first season and 400 days DLCthe bad stuff still the same problems, a lot of the other characters suck. now even more (not more characters, but more sucking) decision-making doesn't really matter most of the time in terms of emotional manipulation and ""forcing the player into stupid situations"" - this game really is a whole new level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!

												Even better than the first Season. Starts out slow, but geats great in the end. The game really feels like a journey.In this season you play as Clementine who's character is being developed brilliantly here. Making her less whiny and more interesting than in the first season. I also had the feeling that this iteration looks better (as in the graphic novel style is more fleshed out) and is not quite as dark as the first one, relying less on zombies, but on humans and the social dynamics to keep the tension.A definite recommendation.

												Following from Season 1, Walking Dead Season 2 is just as spectacular. This time you control Clementine, as she begins her journey with Christa & Omid to reach Wellington far away in the north. Expect an extremely gripping and deep storyline. For the remainder of the review I would like to highlight what I wrote for Season 1 - as my thoughts are exactly the same. I highly recommend this series to everyone.""Literally just completed the story... What an incredible journey this game took me on. Can't remember the last time I felt so strongly connected to a games set of characters, feelings, backgrounds... I've hardly touched this particular Point & Click game style before but I am pleased to say that through this Telltale experience I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't just feel like I'm experiencing the story, I'm controlling it! My decisions ultimately changed the way my story progressed. This is not something I've come across alot in games, therefore its great to see this being a unique feature in The Walking Dead.I can see now why its rated as ""Overwhelmingly Positive"". If you are one of the crazy people that haven't purchased this yet, go ahead and go for it. An unforgettable gem worthy of anyones time & money."" "

												Can they make Season 2 still interesting after Season 1? Hell yeah they can!This review won't be so much about the basics of the game, since it's a sequel, so I will talk more about the differences/improvements of this game. If you like to hear more about Season 1, you can read about it in my review for that game, which I REALLY recommend playing it before this game (of course). I will avoid spoilers as much as possible from now on.In this sequel, you play as Clementine. She has aged a bit, so she's tougher and more careful about her environment. The game continues on the choices you made in Season 1. You can still make a lot of different choices, but none of them seemed out of place for her in my opinion; she's still the sweet caring girl as you knew her.This game is way more cinematic, and by that I mean the cutscenes look more different. They're taken from more different angles, the (face) animations are way smoother and the music can be intense. It also has way less glitchy animations, for example: if someone was staggering in Season 1, their model would shake/trip a bit. And in Season 2, I've only seen it once or twice in the whole playthrough, so that's a lot better.Another difference between the games, is that in Season 1, you could investigate a lot of things, walk around and talk with other people between the cutscenes. In Season 2, they have limited this a lot. It didn't really bother me that much, since the story and the decisions you make within the cutscenes are still good, but it could've been a bit more I guess. Also, the story was more diverse in Season 1 and had more emotional moments, but that doesn't mean Season 2 doesn't have them as well.Although this game is shorter than Season 1, it's still really good. It has a lot of improvements, the story is awesome and it feels like a true sequel. I liked both of them, since I see it as one big story. If you played Season 1, I definitely recommend getting Season 2.			"

												I have to say, I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead. Now that we have that out of the way, let me start. The Walking Dead game is hundred times better than any other TWD source out there, (even the Comics), and is the best there is.The choices actually do matter, I have spent countless hours comparing my lee, (and now clementine), to my friends and noticing very huge differences between each playthroughs. I feel as though that every single person gets their own experiences from this game and that it is truly unique to each player. I have never seen this in any other game before, and it truly shows what a magnifence piece of artwork this is. The gameplay itself is bare, you click things. Literally, but even with that, I find myself having a higher heart rate, and more adrenaline than any other FPS or whatever game out there. I feel more emotions playing this game than I do playing with Russians or BR on Dota. And that's saying alot.Even though most of this is useless banter, I definitely recommend this.			"

The game follows your decision from the first game and its DLC 400 days.The story is much darker than it was in the part one and decision-making becoming more complex.The game will surprise you with a few extras if you played the first part carefully.For me, a huge plus for a great story and a good final.However, the game is a little poorer in the story than in a number one, in my opinion, but I recommend it 100%.CZECH:""Nic netrvá věčně.""Pokud jste nehráli první díl tak si jej zahrajte dříve než tento. Hra navazuje na vaše rozhodnutí v prvním díle a jeho DLC 400 days.Příběh je podstatně temnější než byl v jedničce a rozhodování začíná být složitější.Hra vás překvapí několika bonusy pokud jste hráli pečlivě první část.Za mě obrovské plus za skvělý příběh a dobré finále.Nicméně hra je o něco málo chudší v příběhu než-li v jedničce, podle mého názoru ale doporučuju jí na 100%.

												10/10 -It's like starring in your own survival horror film. I like how the first season is linked to this game from the decisions you made. This game makes you feel like you are in control of your own destiny instead of just watching a movie unfold in front of you. Do I leave this person alone or help them? Do I kill this person or run away? Should I save this food for myself or share? You get lots of decisions like this that can be stressful on purpose and you get a time limit in doing so that will have you on edge and it will effect the story and characters dramatically and what direction you will be taking going forward.

												This game is another amazing telltale game. Definately a must play if you loved Season 1. If you havnt played both, you owe it to yourself to buy Season 1 and 2. If you arent interested, at least buy it when they are bundled and on sale. No seriously. Everyone needs a copy of this game, some tissues and chocolate. Amazing just amazing, Just dont go onto the discussion boards at the moment. There's a huge war going on about the ending. Play the game THEN go on the discussion boards DAMN IT. *Grabs pitchfork and runs back*			"

												So, I just finished playing the finale so I think I can make a proper judgement on this game now. First off, I think Season One was great. Not absolutely outstanding but it had me laughing and crying and I enjoyed it. The puzzles were great, the choices I had to make were difficult and I was always on edge, the characters were well written and I was in tears by the end. This season has been...nothing but a disappointment. I'm not even sorry for saying that. Secondly, I didn't care about anyone in this season. Literally no one. What I usually say is that Season One was great as I played as Lee and I was always worried about Clem because she was young and I felt very protective of her (as someone with a younger sibling it was easy to fit that role). This season, playing as Clem, I wasn't worried about her anymore. I was supposed to worry about the others in my group and I hated everyone else, I can't think of one character this season that I liked. Now, obviously, that's my opinion, but still. It ruined the story for me. I didn't care who died, I wasn't worried.Lastly, this season was more of a movie or something. I was constantly just sitting around watching characters I hated having conversations that I didn't care about and I felt so incredibly bored. The choices I got to make during conversations were useless. I could have just sat silent through the whole thing and it wouldn't have made a difference in the long run. Buy it if it's on sale I guess, but I'd just recommend watching someone else play it or go read the wiki if you wanna know what happens. I don't plan on playing the next season anyway, that's the main thing, and that sucks because I was so excited for this season and it just wasn't worth playing imo.TL;DR - This season was basically 90% walking and talking and 10% actually doing anything of interest, and I'd have had more fun reading the wiki than actually playing this.

												The Walking Dead Season 2 picks up right where season one left off. Within the opening moments of episode one, Clementine finds herself lost and alone. She meets old friends, makes new ones and has to make some hard choices in a perpetual series of lose-lose scenarios.The game consists of 5 episodes and it takes something around 8 hours to finish all of them.Each episode contains points where the player must make a significant decision, which influences the plot of the story. A great feature is, that the game tracks how many players selected which option and lets the player compare their choices to the rest of the player base.The voice acting and sound is excellent.The graphics are better than Season One, with more subtle facial animation.The Walking Dead Season 2 is one of the most amazing, shocking, emotionalising point-and-click adventure games available.A must have for fans of the TV series and comics - Great game!Sound 10/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is the sequel to Lee and Clementine's story. Now, the focus is set on an older Clementine, as more or less 2 years passed since TWD: Season 1. It means mainly that as she's still a kid, while there is still action, the game is more about survival, stealth and less about saving people or sparing (or not) lives, even if Clementine will be confronted to some though choices that may be a life or a death sentence.The game is like the first one: you're looking around, you're taking items with you and you talk a lot. Your choices will impact the game, though everything done before will have a minimal impact in the fifth episode. So, yeah, if you're expecting different endings, there are only 3 major endings and in two of them, you have a decision to make that will result in two sub-endings. You'll tell me that it was the same case in the first game, but your relationship with everyone had an impact in the beginning of the fifth episode. Here, there is none apart from an episode to another (a character that lives will appear if he wasn't killed before for example). Even if you choose one action on another and decide to rewind the chapter and do the contrary, you'll end up with the same reaction, which means that some choices aren't really impacting the game.Here's the brief story of each episode. I'm trying not to spoil you on it, though, as the game is relying also on your emotions.After the events in the first season, Clementine is now travelling with Christa. However, some bandits separate them and Clementine finds herself alone in a forest. She meets a group but what will happen?In the second episode, Clementine is now integrated with the group, though they lost a member. However, the visit of their enemy Carver will make them leave the cabin. Now being pursued by Carver, will they find some help? And what will be in store with Clementine? Will she find a friend that she thought was lost a long time ago?In the third episode, the group is captured by Carver and comes back to the shelter they left months ago though. How will they manage to escape? Who is willing to help them? Why Carver is interested in Clementine?In the fourth episode, the escape didn't go as smoothly as they thought. But Rebecca is ready to have her kid, some members are still missing and you need items to prepare the birth. And one of your friends really needs to get out of his grief...In the fifth episode, after the encounter with the Russians prompted by the lies of one of their members, the group is trying to find a shelter in the winter, with a baby. Your long-time friend is showing more and more his bad side. What will happen to Clementine?The story is well-written and relying on the feelings you may experience. The fact that now, you're the little girl is also playing a great part of it. You want her to be safe and generally, you're driven by the fact that as she's still a kid, you need her to be a little naive or innocent. However, the options in the game allow you to make a character that has seen so much in life that she can be hard and react as an adult. But Clementine can also be by herself and way more mature than some adults in the game. Even when afraid, she's not giving up (besides, if you want to advance in the story, you don't have a choice in the matter).The graphiscs didn't change from the first game, it's still in a cell-shading look. However, the season isn't the same: we're at the end of fall, beginning of the winter. TWD was more set during late spring/summer and was ending at fall. However, this factor isn't really important per se but it's nice to see different landscapes, some with snows. Besides, as usual, the game is making you move around, though the episodes isn't set in a town or around it, here, you're really in the forest, more in the wild than TWD.The soundtrack is as usual good and fitting to the ambiance, after all, you're in a post-apocalyptic world if I may say. And you're confronted to an harsh reality.Anyway, in the end, TWD: Season 2 didn't really bring something new apart the change of protagonist, going with the change of the ""scope"". But if you like TWD, you'll like this game too. If you like TTG's way, you'll like this one too. If I recommend the game? Sure, I bought the season from episode 1 and suffered the patience to wait for each episode. And it was a joy when the game was updated. But at least, TWD: Season 2 is putting you in the shoes of a kid in TWD's universe and only for that, you need it. Besides, as usual, with choices to make, you can replay a lot the game after to make the story that will be the much better for you, though myself, I tend to stick to my personality and I don't want to make a Clementine that isn't caring a little.

												Season 2 has you taking on the role of Clementine this time. In the zombie apocalypse apparently 11 year olds are considered adults and are supposed to be responsible leaders for a rag tag group of survivors. On a positive note you can be as ruthless and as much of a sociopath as you wish because most of your fellow survivors aren't very likeable. You survive this season with a bunch of incompetent, overly emotional fools and sycophants.That all said, it was much the sameness from the first season and it was enjoyable, just not to the same extent that the first season was.

A text review is provided below.The Walking Dead Season 2 is a point and click adventure game which serves as the sequel to the original The Walking Dead. I’m going to preface this by saying that you should NOT be playing this game if you haven’t played the original game. It does not make any room for those that do not know what happened in the first game while making a whole lot of references to it indeed.So assuming you have played the first walking dead, let’s start with reviewing what’s new in season 2. Well, quick time events are back. And in my review for the original game I mentioned them without really ranting about how much I hated them, how stupid they were, and how I wish they were gone. THIS time around though I want to say that The Walking Dead Season 2 took the horribly done quick time events from its predecessor and actually made them better. It’s hard to explain, but they don’t just pop up at stupid moments anymore or have the same premise each time. They actually work well now and I felt they helped add to the game experience far more than the last time around, but I still find them a little pointless, and if you are interested in this game you should know that yes, they are still here.The graphics have seen an overhaul. In fact there’s one scene in the game that does a flashback to the original that copies the original graphics, you can actually see the difference quite evidently. The game didn’t sound as empty this time around so they definitely improved on their soundtracks and ambience. I never once lost immersion in this game. Not once.The gameplay is very much exactly the same. A point and click adventure puzzle in between story segments. There isn’t much to tell or much to say got improved here. Fans of the point and click genre will love it, while those that are here only for the story will likely find themselves trying to find what they have to click to move the story along every time such a segment comes along.This story is arguably even better than the first one now that the perspective has transferred to our lovely dear Clementine. You now get to play as the character you spent the entire first game protecting at all costs. It is a rush to survive in this zombie apocalypse, and this time you get to play as a child! This is a very unique way to play. Your small size makes you very useful in certain situations, but at the same time no one ever takes you seriously because you’re a child. Paired with this very interesting new perspective comes the return of a couple of characters from the first game. Every chapter of this story and the situations you find yourselves in are thrilling and probably overall just the perfect followup to the original walking dead. And this game can be a LOT more gruesome than the first one. If you’re queasy … then there’s a few scenes that will make this a game that isn’t quite for you.HOWEVER. This game has the same exact problem as the first one. Your choices mean jack♥♥♥♥♥♥in just about every single instance. If a character is supposed to die then that character will die no matter what you do. If they’re supposed to live then they will no matter what you do. It’s the same garbage illusion of choice amidst a typical linear plotline as the first game. The quality of the story makes up for a lot of this for your first playthrough. But honestly, NEVER rewind and NEVER do a second playthrough with the intent of making different choices lest you find out just how shallow the choices in this game really are. Nothing you do matters for more than one sentence out of someone’s mouth.Overall I think The Walking Dead Season 2 really did improve on what the original Walking Dead created. They also didn’t fix the biggest issue from the first game, but they did fix most of the smaller issues without introducing new ones. It gets an 8/10 from me. One point up from the original walking dead for providing a better game experience overall and for letting me play as my dearest little Clementine. However they still advertised this based on your choices affecting the story. And meanwhile your choices have literally no influence on the story whatsoever just like in the original game. I do recommend it, definitely for the story and point and click adventure aspects. Just do not buy this game if you’re looking for an interactive story where your choices will actually influence things, because that is NOT what this is.To see my original The Walking Dead review, go here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/recommended/207610/ "

												Please excuse my tears as I write this. This game is a MASTERPIECE. I am so emotionally invested in this story that I have tears as I write this. I finished the game about 5 min ago and had to rush here to write this positive review. If you are like me and are a sucker for a good story, please read no further because you'll love it.The game excels at putting you in the midst of intense situations where your choices change the outcome of the whole story itself. Let me tell you, these choices are not morally clear, or easy. They make you think over every possible ramification as the timer is ticking on what you have to choose. The game forces you to live with your gut’s choices, making it as if you were really in this situation making the choice yourself. This style of narrative is the future of gaming. It emotionally involves you to a new level, and you start to feel as if the relationships you have with these characters are real and yours. Now I am off to the corner of my room as I will sit patiently and wait for season 3! BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT THESE AMAZING DEVELOPERS! "

												Even though I have played both seasons through 3 times each, I do not feel like I am capable of describing the greatness of this game, in the matter that it deserves. When you're done with the game, and you want to play it again, you want to experience it, like it was your first time all over again. For obvious reasons, you should purchase Season 1 before this, as this is simply more of the same. If you plan to buy this, there is simply no reason not to get season 1. If you feel like it, and have the spare cash at hand, purchase the '400 days' DLC aswell. It's not long, and doesn't follow our main protagonists, but it's simply more Walking Dead. What's not to love?You may be into FPS or RPG's, but this game deserves to be played. It's a story like no other. Give it a shot :)			"

												Zombie stories resonate with a lot of people.  On the surface they are fantasy pulp but the best ones have a firm understanding of human drama.  They can trick sociopathic man children flogging their dolphins over their bug-out bags into a damn good soap opera.  Walking Dead Season 2 continues the ability of the first game to shame the original source material and the television show on how to make a good zombie story.Some people may have dropped the haterade on this game but they aren't powerful sensitive men like me.  Several times I had to doff my fedora and mop the salty dew of tears from my granite face with the soft velvet.I give this game 5 out of 5 fatcats.			"

												Telltale's emotional rollercoaster continues with a new season including the usual 5 episodes. Prepare for some tough decisions from the perspective of Clementine this time!The game offers the usual gameplay style with its interesting, cel-shaded technology. Of course, the characters are once again interesting and it is very easy to get attached to them and, well, to let them go once and for all proves to be the opposite!The decisions are pretty hard and the roughly 8-hour long story offers multiple (completely different) endings. At this point I have only seen one (read about the others) but it almost made me shed some tears.Season 2 is better in almost every aspect. A great sequel to its successor - the only downside for me was that they upped the gore to a bit too high a level. At times it was just too much for me (again, considering that everything is experienced by an 11-year-old girl).If you have not picked up Season 1 already you must do so for 2 reasons:1) Season 1 is a must to know the background of Season 22) importing your save file is possible and you can see how far-reaching your choices can be in this game - without importing any save games the game will randomly select the decisions for youI look forward to Season 3 and, well, anything else Telltale releases in the future!

												After the amount of praise that Season 1 got, I honestly thought it would be really hard for Telltale to manage to do it again. I'm glad I was wrong. Season 2 takes off right after where you stayed in Season 1 and this time you play as Clementine. If you've played Season 1 and/or the 400 Days DLC, your actions will carry over to this Season.Telltale managed to keep the pace up on this one and I feel that this time, the decision making situations were alot more intense. This is one of those games that you can't really exemplify because by doing so I'd be ruining it for you. What can I say is that if you've really enjoyed The Walking Dead Season 1, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy playing through Season 2, it has alot going for it and I'm eager to see how Season 3 turns out.

												Just gets better each season.Brilliant story very captivating and can be very challenging in making what you would think is the right choice.  There where a few times i would make a choice and then would think soon after was that the right choice.  With the small time frame you have to make a decission, the presure is on.  There are some moments in the game you have to be quick at reacting otherwise your out!  However in real life there is no time to♥♥♥♥♥♥about when theres a herd coming your way!  Gameplay is brilliant and is very addictive.  Graphics and Sound are spot on.  I did the full 5 episodes back to back in a day or two, in my opinion is the best way to keep the flow of the story rather than breaking it up.  If you have played the 1 season, then you will definitely will enjoy the second.   "

												The writting is nowhere near as good as the first one. Whereas the first season was devoted to the theme of self-reinvention in the face of apocolypse, in this case a murderer finding redemption in becoming the guardian of a child, season two is nothing but ""what crazy set piece can we make Clem go through next?"" First episode was fantastic though, shame about the other 4.			"

												Whether you played The Walking Dead Season 1 or started playing TellTale games with The Wolf Among Us, Season 2 is a great, great game. It is possible to play this game without playing the original, but that does mean the events from Season 1 will be randomly generated for you. If you like games which integrate stories in an immersive and beautiful way, please play Season 1 first.Back to Season 2, Episode 1. At first, it felt like more of the same to me. Which isn't a bad thing, really. But afterwards, after finishing it, it felt like so much more. Playing as Clementine, burdened with the events of Season 1 gives you a past, a past which haunts you, but also made you who you are today. You can choose to stay a more ""nice"" Clementine, or you can choose to follow Lee's advice and follow more  survival-esque dialogue decisions. This means you might coerce and use language you're not used to from such a little girl. It's up to you.This interactive game hits the right note every time and gives you an uneasy feeling every now and then. But it's an uneasy feeling that fits with the story and universe, an uneasy feeling that immerses and lets you experience what a human apocalypse would be like as a little girl.And, oh is it ♥♥♥♥ed up. Now shooh and go play TWD Season 2 already. Or Season 1. Go play The Walking Dead!			"

												One of the most emotional game series I know. This well written mix of a TV show, comic and game really knows how to suck people in. The game makes it feel like you control almost everything, even though it's linear as hell. That's why you should never replay it. Stick with that amazing first experience. Do play season 1 first or you will miss out on so many levels. There are still 3 more episodes to be released, and I really can't wait to continue the story. This makes it one of my favourite games.			"

												After playing the first season of The Walking Dead, I just had to get season 2.I was in two minds about it, because I have heard from many people that it isn't as good as the first season, and it's not nearly as worth it. Since the people I have heard this from were mostly close friends I believed them, but wanted to give it a try anyway, because that first season was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had in gaming, and I don't typically like point and click games.So I bought it while on sale, and I can tell you right now, all those people who said the game wasn't good were just flat out wrong. It is a matter of personal opinion, but in my opinion, the second season is just as good as the first.I can't say that this sequel is better than the first season, but only because the first season was so incredibly good. But it is not worse either.I am going to avoid all spoilers, which is going to make this maybe slightly vague, but I will do my best to explain why this is just as good.The characters in the second season are just as lovable as in the first. At first you might not realize this, but it is true. The game takes a few characters from the first season and masterfully blends them into a whole new world of new people. You will miss some of the people from season one. That much is certain. But the new characters, and the interactions between them and characters of old, does a good job at making up for it.You might also not feel at first glance like your choices make much of a difference, but you will find that the story actually fans out much more than in the first season, and your ending can be completely different than that of others.And I assure you the end will be very satisfying. As I said in my review for the first season, this game will tear out your heart, rip it to pieces, then clumsily glue it together, and feed it back to you. It is the ultimate masochist experience.I have reached two different endings in this game and I am so amazed by how different they are. The first one left me just shocked, not even sure if I want to replay it. I barely made myself retry the ending, and I am so glad I did so now.You will just have to try it yourself, and don't listen to what other people are saying, it is likely they got an ending which was not as satisfying, or didn't even give the game a fair chance. It is just as good as the first, in other ways perhaps, but just as good.So if you want to go on the emotional rollercoaster of a lifetime (again), get this game.			"

												Warning: Spoilers ahead.Oh, Clementine, you have grown up so fast.If someone told me while I was playing the first season of The Walking Dead game that there will be a second season, and the main character will be a slightly older Clem, I wouldn’t believe it. What can a little girl do to affect the lives of other survivors – to the point of her decisions making a difference between surviving and becoming zombie chow?Well, it turned out – she did make a difference. Kind of. Your choices and reactions in game could save certain people – but only until they die a different way the next episode making a lot of the choices you made unimportant in the grand scheme of the story. Up until the very last moments of the final episode where your choices made all the difference.This was the story about Clementine. And this is one of the possible ways of how it ended.In “my” ending, after Kenny and Jane decided to kill each other – and Kenny won, the surviving trio of Kenny, Clem and baby AJ decided to look for the fabled Wellington – and they found it. However, the good people of Wellington won’t let them in because of the “overpopulation” issue. Kenny leaves to the wild by himself after agreeing with Wellingtonians to let Clem and AJ in, since “they’re so small and don’t take up much space”. Clem, crying and holding baby AJ, enters the safety of Wellington’s walls.THE END.But, rewinding the chapter and trying to make different choices makes the ending shockingly different. In another possible ending, Clem and Jane return to Carver’s store to rebuild and try again. Yet in another, Clem walks away on her own. Well, plus the baby. In that ending we see her smearing herself and the baby in zombie guts and fearlessly entering a huge walker herd.And those are just a few of the many possible endings.Now, this many absolutely different endings probably means we won’t see Clem in the already announced The Walking Dead Season 3. Or we could, but maybe this time as an adult. However, that is not very likely.In any case, Telltale did an excellent job of making game characters we truly care about. From the never-forgotten Lee, to the brave and naive young Clementine, to the both lovable and hateable Kenny, these are the characters we will never forget.And in video game design, that is a great accomplishment.

												An unforgettable experience. It follows the story of Clementine, the kid from The Walking Dead Season 1. An interactive movie-like game with harder and faster decisions to make every time you advance in the storyline. Expectional story writing based on Robert Kirkman's comics, amazing soundtrack. This game makes you take hard decisions, in a maximum of probably 10 seconds each, decisions which all have powerful consequences behind them. You take full responsibility to what might happen after you take the decision and you're afraid of what it might cause, but it also makes you proud of your decisions. You tail how Clemetine's character is, how others see you. It brings out your smartest moves, your worst fears and your craziest sides you didn't even know you had.Once you buy the game on Steam you get all the episodes as they come out. Each decision counts, the ones from Season 1 and the DLC aswell. So I suggest buying those before playing this game. Not only the story will make more sense but you'll be more attached to the characters and you'd be happy to know that your past decisions are being counted aswell.So there you have it, action, tension, regret, joy, sadness. Above all you need to survive.""You're either living or you're not. You ain't little, you ain't a girl, you ain't a boy, you ain't strong or smart. You're alive."" - Chuck, The Walking Dead Season 110/10 "

												Finally decided to buy the game, was planning to buy it on the PS3 back when it was released but wasn't really bothered to go to the store and buy a copy of it, but i luckily switched to PC gaming back at the end of June, and decided to buy this game (and Season 1) somewhere at the end of July. Watched a Let's play of the game on YouTube too back when it came out, because i played season 1 on PS3 back then and just really loved this game sooooooooooooo much, but yeah the game is really awesome (even tho i know whats going to happen in most parts because like i said i watched a Let's Play of the game) really fun, and just really well made, the story follows up (almost) immediately after the end of season 1, so i would recommend you play the first season (with dlc) first before going on to season 2 as it probably will get confusing if you just jump in at season 2 immediately. But yeah like i said the game (both seasons) are worth the money, you really get to love some charachters and hate other charachters which really shows that this game can touch you with feelings and that it isn't just a point and click game. Really worth BUYING!!!!Also somewhere at episode 2 there will be a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE surprise waiting :D10/10 Great sequel to an amazing series!			"

												WARNING: SPOILERS FROM THE WALKING DEAD: SEASON 1!!!I might as well get this out of the way, I bawled when Lee died in the first game. That probably isn't a shocker. However, what makes this statement shocking is the fact that even after I knew the death scene through and through beforehand (before I even played the game, heck, even before I considered it) I still bawled. It's hard enough to make someone truly cry from a game's wonderful story, but for Telltale to do that but still make me cry after I knew it was coming, well, that's something I've never seen pulled off by a game before. Where am I going with this? The ending alone from season one set up some pretty ridiculously high expecations for S2. After my first playthrough, I was definitely satisfied, but not like I was with Season 1. I still shed a few tears during some parts of the game (the 5th episode was REALLY emotional) and like I said, I was most certainly satisfied with my purchase.GraphicsAlthough keeping the same style as the first season, I can tell it is far more detailed. Some of the newer characters look great. The environments also look beautiful and I haven't taken that many screenshots like that since Skyrim IIRC. However, I noticed that sometimes the characters would glitch out, plus the voices and mouth movement was pretty inaccurate. But, if you don't pay attention to that kind of stuff, you'll enjoy the graphics.GameplayObviously, this is the low point of the game. But, it did seem downgraded compared to the first game. The gameplay still has QTEs but now has a severe lacking of puzzles compared to other point-and-click games. Although there are some understandable reasons (An 11 year old girl and a 37 year old grown man, look at the difference) and so Clementine, despite being a strong girl, still isn't capable of doing some tasks. However, that doesn't mean they had to take out the puzzles altogether and double the amount of QTEs. However, there were lots of tough decisions, if not many, many more than the first season. However, I would prefer the decision-making be classified in the ""story"" section instead. Another con I noticed is that the game was only 9 hours. Very short. Overall, the gameplay definitely fell short to me.StoryThis is the car engine. A human's heart. The thing that keeps them alive. In this case, the story for The Walking Dead. And I have to say, the story was 100x darker than the first game. HOWEVER, it didn't truly escalate until the last episode. Even without Lee, this story was brilliantly told. You even reunite with Kenny and his new girlfriend Sarita but you also realize he is, well, becoming insane. The cast is much better than the last season, for sure. There was Jane, who treats you like her deceased sister, Luke, who is one of the only characters who isn't crazy, and even Bonnie from the 400 Days DLC. They're all friendly, but then the final episode is where it truly gets dark. This is where I believe the story falls a bit short. The first season started getting dark (in a bad, yet good way) around the third episode, while this one gets emotional around the finale. I'm not saying the other episodes sucked, but it took some time to truly enjoy the experience. But, the other episodes didn't suck. Something sad will happen in each one that somehow scars another character or even Clementine. For once, I didn't find anyone truly annoying, but I HATE Arvo (intended by TT of couse) but he wasn't an annoying character compared to the one-dimensional fillers from the first season. I would say the saddest part (without spoiling too much) is when you have a dream about Lee in the last episode. ""Promise me you won't leave me"" gets me every time. Plus, if you pull the right strings, Kenny's ending can be very, very emotional. He's the only character (besides Clem) who didn't die in the first season. In the end, the story is amazing, but it wasn't as emotional as season 1.AudioThe amazing voice acting is back. Everyone, and literally, EVERYONE, played their roles beautifully. Carver was a truly terrifying villain with a voice and personality like his, Clementine also has an amazing voice actor. And for once, NO ONE WAS ACTUALLY ANNOYING! Well, Carlos had some quotes that made me facepalm. He REALLY needs to take an IQ test. The music was pretty good, but I felt it was lacking something. But, either way, the voice actors make up for the music.ReplayabilityAlthough the replayability isn't usually intended to be high, the story will stick with you for years and years. Trust me, The Walking Dead's plot makes the TV version look bad.VerdictIn the end, Season 2 did live up to expectations, despite the fact it had quite a few flaws and also wasn't as good as the first season was. Either way, if you loved the first game, you'll enjoy playing this game and playing in the shoes of Clementine!Graphics- 9.0/10Gameplay- 3.0/10Story- 9.0/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability- 7.0/10.:8.6/10:.+Outstanding cast+Amazing voice acting+Tougher decisions+Enhanced visuals+Amazing finale-Took time for the story to become emotional-Music fell flat-Too many QTEs-Short			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 follows the events of the first game through the perspective of Clementine who was previously in need of care and nurturing but is now learning to be independant and to be able to survive on her own. Throughout the enourmous trek of this game your group becomes more and more dysfunctional, fights and disputes start between fellow group members and you learn that Clementine is most likely more capable than all of them combined. It accurately reflects on what states people are capable on going through under certain conditions and the extent they'd take to survive. Decisions  are especially difficult in this game particuarly when choosing who to appeal to and whether to be selfless and get yourself into danger or let the others take the blame. (Also the game restores your previous save from The Walking Dead Season 1 so your previous decisions will not go unaccounted for which makes it really feel like a continuation from the first game). Graphics are better than ever in this instalment and they have a real emphasis on the atmosphere in the game making the game beautiful to play through. If you played through and enjoyed the original instalment I definitely recommend you buy this game.P.S. this game is depressing as all hell so only buy it if you're ready to endure some real feels.

												I finished the game just a few minutes ago. Telltale Games never fails to get me emotionally attached to the characters in The Walking Dead series.  Clementine's growth is definitely noticed from the beginning of the game all the way to the end. Suspense racks up as the story unfolds, forcing the character to make difficult decisions in moments of danger and sadness. Season Two is worth all the money (I paid for it during the summer sale, hehe).			"

												I finished the game just a few minutes ago. Telltale Games never fails to get me emotionally attached to the characters in The Walking Dead series.  Clementine's growth is definitely noticed from the beginning of the game all the way to the end. Suspense racks up as the story unfolds, forcing the character to make difficult decisions in moments of danger and sadness. Season Two is worth all the money (I paid for it during the summer sale, hehe).			"

												Season 2 is another excellent edition to The Walking Dead series, which continues to be the most faithful offshoot from the original comic books in both pacing, tone, and characters. However, given that the first season is such a masterpiece of storytelling, I'm probably spoiled in saying that I did find that some of the writing felt a bit lacklustre. Paticularly in the sense that I felt that the choices you make have less impact on the progression of your story, to the point that the game makes a big deal about giving you the chance to save some characters, only to ignore them for almost an entire chapter before they die anyway. Some of the conflict feels more forced as well, with some characters performing complete 180-degree changes in their attitude because someone needs to start a fight to make things interesting. But, that's a lot of criticism for what is still an excellent game. The first two chapters are superb and utterly harrowing, there are quite a number of possible endings and you have complete freedom to decide, and the shift of focus to Clementine as a playable character was an inspired decision.

												This is a story about a girl named Clementine who is eleven years old and she has to survive a world that was normal to worse by the next day. She had a friend named Lee Everett who cared for Clementine more than the world itself. But sadly he may not be with us this season.In this season she has to take care of herself, to survive and to travel from place to place. There is one thing though, you must decide on how you choose to play.It's all about the decisions in this game so choose wisely...If you like the walking dead then try out the wolf among us you won't regret it, I promise.Play the whole season NOW!!Season 3 will be out in late 2016, hopefully we get a DLC while we wait for the next season to arrive.And don't just stand there, play episode 5, and don't forget your tissues!

												"" The walking dead "" is the same, from the fall-off comic book graphic to the point & click - mechanics, you walk with WASD and click on the subject of the investigation or to pick them up.It is the main character who is the big difference. Clementine is more exposed and vulnerable than Lee was - she is after all still a child. But she's not just physical plant since the first game. Here she is more capable : able to handle weapons, use the environment to their advantage and have basic survival skills . This requires the need that she must use their accumulated knowledge to cope.How and what I choose Clementine to say or do will have consequences later on. These choices - that must be done on time, is the essence of the game. The moral choices are of course the most exhausting. Should I help a character or not? Who should I save the life of? There is no right answer. But as the game quickly and well manage to establish the characters, there is an emotional effort on my part, that makes these choices grab. It gets heavy, ruthless and crippling to see terrible events pass and know that I could have chosen differently.Clementine is superbly written, feels incredibly human in their desperation and loneliness, and proves at the same time smart, stubborn and have good instincts. Clementine was in the last game chiselled sympathetic and courageous. Here she gets an expanded emotional spectra, through the choices you make - she may, for example, behave suspiciously , sad or friendly. She becomes a much more interesting person and in the coming episodes will hopefully evolve even more.			"

If you have not played The Walking Dead Season 1 yet, you probably shouldn't read this. I reserve the right to spoil things that you would know by the time you play Season 2.Episode 1One of the things that I was most excited about was the fact that the decisions I made during Season 1 would carry over and have an impact in Season 2. And indeed, the game found my save files and imported them properly, but I didn't notice anything during the first episode that had anything to do with what I had done during Season 1.Being that Clementine is a lot smaller than Lee, the combat played out much differently. Instead of struggling with the zombies and trying to bash their heads in, Clementine usually runs and dodges away from whatever is chasing her. There were also far fewer puzzles, and those that were present were fairly straightforward. Honestly most of the episode was a continuous push forward, with few hub areas to simply explore and talk to people.Overall I would call this episode a setup episode. Telling you what it is setting up would be a spoiler, but it might be in your best interest to wait and find out how good the next episode is before deciding whether or not to buy the whole season.Episode 2I wasn't really sure what to expect from the second episode because the first episode didn't have much going on in it. I didn't know enough about the group of people I met to make predictions about what was going to happen. Luckily the second episode picks things up; well, it's not lucky for the characters in the game, but you know what I mean.The most important thing that happens in this episode is the people in your new group get fleshed out more in a big way. The Walking Dead would fail completely if it didn't have strong characters that you care about. I found myself drawn to the people in the group to varying degrees, much as I would in real life.The biggest challenge Telltale faces in this game is finding ways to give the player agency in ways that make sense for an 11 year old girl. For the most part I think they succeeded, though there were a few exceptions; for example, who would leave Clementine alone to figure out how to turn off a wind turbine?Unfortunately I cannot go into the best things about this episode without spoiling everything, but trust me: The Walking Dead 2 is officially now worth getting. There were a lot of surprises, which I was not expecting. I thought I was prepared for anything that Telltale could throw at me, but I was very wrong.Much like the first episode, they end with a huge cliffhanger. If you hate dealing with those, you might want to wait until the third episode comes out, but that will probably end on a cliffhanger as well. I'm enjoying playing it one episode at a time, but I wish I had somebody I could discuss things with.Episode 3This episode was structured very differently from the other episodes we've seen so far from The Walking Dead. It almost felt like the story it told could stand on its own, with some fleshing out of course. In particular the ending had so much closure I'm not sure where they are going to take the series next, other than the obvious problem of continuing to survive in a zombie apocalypse.My favorite thing about this episode was how Clementine really came into her own. In previous episodes the writers came up with ways for her to influence events without being the main actor. Here she does almost everything that is needed for the group's plans to work. Of course one of the characters brings up how crazy this is, so the writers were not unaware of the stretch they were taking here. I hope this opens up the door for Clementine to do even more cool stuff.I believe that I have now seen all of the characters from the 400 Days DLC, though most of them showed up briefly and had very few lines. I am looking forward to seeing them more in future episodes. If Telltale doesn't use them more I am going to be pretty disappointed.This episode didn't let up on The Walking Dead's tendency to be emotionally taxing. I kept alternating between cheering characters on and cursing at the screen when things went wrong. And that's just the way I like it.Episode 4Amid the Ruins brings us back to the more familiar Telltale formula, with action sequences interspersed with characters talking while walking and even a hub area where you can take a break and look around a Civil War memorial.I mentioned in the last episode that Clementine carried the group in a way that is not normal for an 11 year old girl. This episode did feature Clementine contributing heavily, but not in ways that felt forced by the writers. The flow and pace of the episode felt much more natural, with almost no moments that pulled me out of the game.There were even a few genuinely humorous moments, mostly provided by my new favorite character, Mike. I wish he had gotten a chance to shine earlier, and I certainly hope that they do not kill him off. Small chance of that.Episode 5I was hoping that I would be able to make it through a season finale of The Walking Dead without making any decisions I immediately regretted or crying. I failed. It was a fool's hope anyway.Much like the finale of season one, there were very few times where they give the player the opportunity to take a break and look around. It was mostly a constant push towards the end of the episode. They did give the characters a break at one point, which also let me become more attached to them. This was no doubt part of their grand plan to break my heart, but those are not things that you realize while playing.There was one situation that I saw coming from a mile away because the writers focused on it so much for the last couple of episodes. On the other hand there was another closely related situation that I did not see coming at all.As a whole I enjoyed the second season of Telltale's The Walking Dead, though not as much as the first season. I would say that the main factor was the faster turnover of characters. I did not get enough time to get attached to most of the characters before they died or were otherwise removed from the group. I cannot remember many of their names, or how they died. In contrast I remember almost all of the characters from season one.I am not sure if Telltale will make a third season, and frankly I am not sure how wise it would be for them to try. It is easy for the player to become jaded to the loss they are constantly subjected to in this series. The second season also had much less of a cultural impact; out of my Steam friends, the number of people who have played the second season is less than half that of the first. I would certainly play a third if they made it though.			"

 10/10	  Ok, first of all, you MUST complete Walking Dead: Season 1 first in order to really feel the story. It's not that you can't run this game without the first game, but you have to start from season 1 in order to really appreciate the story.    IMO, the first game was a little better, but this game was also superb. Definitely a must play if you played the first season. The story is well-written, unpredictable and has some twists. Not going to cover much about the story, you just have to see to believe it ;)  I can't really find any flaws to this game, and that's the reason I give this game a perfect score. Please forgive me if I overlooked at some cons in this game, I just couldn't find them.  In conclusion, buy this game if you liked season 1, if not, don't buy it becasue if has the same formula as the first game.**PRO TIP: Sorry for the minor spoiler but if you want to have the BEST ENDING, I strongly recommend you to stick with Kenny.

												It must be easy for developers to make games where killing, death and survival are fun and exciting because there are few games that can take these same actions and make them cause feelings of grief, sorrow and loss. How many times have you made a decision in a game, and regretted it (while knowing full well that you made the right choice for yourself, or for the greater good, whatever your perspective). If you are willing to let yourself play a game and feel these, and other emotions, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is for you.I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 and was pleased to play this through, often so engrossed in the story that I would play through an entire chapter at a time. The writing is tremendous, the characters are interesting (and often tragic), and the gameplay, while not twitchy, is satisfying for how it can make you feel as if you are a real part of the story. I realise that you likely have read a dozen other reviews praising this game, and that you know how amazing it already is, but this is as much for me as it is for you - I will not feel complete until I have recommended this title to the public, and maybe, just maybe, helped another person experience this masterpiece.

												As a huge fan of the The Walking Dead (TV series) I can honestly say that this game fits in well with the lore. I truly feel like a character who's doing their best to survive while meeting and working with other survivors to make the most of a bad situation.The game is definitely not a Left 4 Dead for those who are looking for that kind of a zombie game. The story, however, is incredible. You feel like you're truly a part of the cast of a television show or a movie. I am not usually a fan of 'Adventure' games, but this one has quickly become one of my favorite games on my computer.			"

												Brilliant story telling game. Full stop....Well ok, for a review it ain't worth it.So, if you've played previous Walking Dead 1, you'll see this game has exact same graphic design, music/OSTs and gameplay. Copy paste, just different scenario/dialogue/characters (some are familiars like Clementine or Kenny). There's an annoying thing of credit scrolling after every chapter ends, though. Bearable, but mildly annoying.Game's split into five chapters, each chapter will give you a brief review of how you acted on that particular act and compare it with other players. Game's not that long, like what, six hours at most? No replay value either, once you beat it, you'll get full achievements. Just maybe want to rewind some parts where you made choices that had different outcome of who would have survived.The real shining point is its story. You'll still be forced to show your true color in a dire need. If it's your first playthrough, most likely it's YOU who YOU are if YOU were in the position Clementine is in. This is what makes Walking Dead good, you are immersed by the story and imagine what would you do from the bottom of your heart. You'll be very attached to the characters you play and meet in the game. Not many games do have this ability to engage their playerbase. So what are you waiting for? If you've picked this up on previous sale, download it and play. You will really appreciate what this game has to offer.			"

Acting/script - 8/10 - It was mainly great, few parts seemed too unbelievable and cheesy.Gameplay - 9/10 - I loved being able to decide the fate of your group and the people around you - it's kind of a slow game, so you have to be a patient gamer.

Another great and incredible game from TelltaleFirst, I have to say that I really loved the first one, it is one of my best game experiences so far. With this said, I'll tell you why I recommended  this game.Let's talk about the story. Just excellent. We have 5 episodes (like the first one) which ones became better and better. The dialogues are great and the new characters feels fresh. Voice acting for every single characters are all well done. I personally feel the story intense, there are parts with a lot of action, also there are some fun parts and of course, the sad moments.The gameplay is pretty much like the first one, point n click adventure with moments of dialogues. Nothing to complain about it. One of my favorite things about this game is the soundtrack, especially the ones when you are in the middle of hard decisions. That was one thing I really loved from the first one, the soundtrack.My final words are: For me, this is a 9/10 game. It has beautiful visuals, great story, excellent voice performances and nice soundtrack. This is a must have if you have played the first one and you are a fan of The Walking Dead in general. Go buy it, you will not regret it!			"

												Did you like the first season? Then you totally should like this one.The gameplay has not really changed; you still have to make choices throughout the entire game, and these choices will change how people see you; which will influe how the story will be told and how you interpret characters' behaviour.I recommend this game, because it brings a really fresh breath of air to me; you must appreciate it just like it is: an interactive story-driven movie in which you are the hero.Playing as Clementine, the innocent little girl from the first season, might sound wrong: what could a little girl do after all? But Clementine has grown older, she has seen some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ She's now mature and has great decisions to make, depsite her age.All in all, the game is an awesome sequel to the first season, taking into consideration what happened in the previous game, as if you were the writer. The graphics respect the tone of the comics very well; sometimes colourful, sometimes picturing the gruesome reality of rotten corpses and slaughtered people, sometime the simplicity of the rare happy moments. Talking about emotions, they are well shown through the narrative moments and through the events.If you want to continue the awesome adventure you've been through in the first season, by all means, play The Walking Dead - Season 2!

												I loved the first game.  Unfortunately, this one comes nowhere close to it.  It is no longer an adventure game meant to cause the player to reflect on how their values hold up when pushed to the limits (a stressful post-apocalyptic setting where ideals are never realized).  Instead, it is a 3D virtual novel with very little agency at all.  It was very rare that Lee ever did anything that directly conflicted with my agency.  However, Clementine's options never seem to fit how I want to react, and many situations are not only uninteresting, but simply convenient writing.Also, although this is not an inherently negative aspect, each episode takes substantially less time to complete than the previous game, so on top of being unsatisfied with the content, I'm also getting less of it to judge it on.  Unfortunately, I regret my purchase quite a bit.  I don't feel down that I'm out $20; I'll gladly add that to them as extra payment for how great the first game was.  Instead, I feel cheated on the time I invested into the game.  No, you should not carbony copy a game when making a sequel, but this really isn't even in the same realm as the first game.			"

												In my mind, Clementine's story ended in the last moments of the first season. I don't want more of her story. I want stories of other people. New ones every season. With that mindset, I entered Season Two by convincing myself this was a different character, despite the same name.Overall, the story is compelling enough to overcome the continued Tell Tale jank (graphical glitches, mechanics, interface, action sequences, cliche'd story pieces). There are a number of caveats, though. Even more than the first season or even Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead's Season Two feels like you have even less player agency. In fact, by the end of the game, it has driven you into a contrived situation where you are forced to make decisions you wouldn't want to make in a situation you wouldn't have allowed to happen all to manufacture shock in the final moments that fall short, because you keep saying ""but that's not what my decisions would have been... you just forced me down this path"". And, like other Tell Tale games, that is exactly what has happened. You made a series of largely inconsequential choices with no bearing on the overall tale.If you're willing to put up with some more Tell Tale Games jank and can get this at a discount at any number of points during the year, it is certainly worth experiencing. Just don't expect it to have the same impact it had the first time you entered The Walking Dead world via TTG a couple years ago. The luster has started to wear and I think we're  going to start seeing how long stories can overcome a lagging engine and mechanic, before that has to be improved and brought up to date. "

												With Clementine in another group of survivors, how long will this group last? How will you get food? Do you need to trust strangers?The emotional rollercoaster of Season 1 is still here, with life-or-death decisions and too many regrets... If you fancy zombies and watching TV, then this is the game for you. Buy now and feel the guilt, sadness and rage.			"

												Another great story in the Walking dead universe told by TellTale games, however this time I couldn't help but feel like something was missing.-------Final Thoughts at the end-------Gameplay          Just like the first game in the series(and most of TellTale's other games) the gameplay is a mix between point and click, puzzle solving, and quicktime events. The puzzle situations are not hard nor are they long which helps a story heavy game like this keep moving at a steady pace. Most of them are, find the item and use it on whats blocking you, or use items in a certain order. You can explore around most areas and find other things to interact with in the world and sometimes may find another way to solve a problem. Quick time events will happen during some cutscenes, but are not to bad to react too(lots of mash Q then press E)For the most part the gameplay is your average point and click adventure game with the addition of quick time events.Graphics            The art design is the beautiful cell shaded art that we come to know and love from TellTale. The levels and areas are well designed and gorgeous to look at. The characters are well crafted and fit perfectly into the world around them. Cutscenes look smooth on my medium spec PC and have no framerate issues, even my girlfriend runs this game smoothly on her low end PC.Audio            Audio is well done and makes you feel part of the world whether it be the stumbling feet of zombies from the world around you or the sweet ambience sound of the forest. The voice acting is well done and the voices fit the characters they were chosen for. The emotion is made aparent through the voice acting. Story            I'm not going to give any information about the story line here, I will simply explain how the story line felt. The story line flowed smoothly and you can see the concequences of your actions take place, however I felt like no matter what choice you made their was no real ""saving them"", they would simply just die another way soon after. Also after playing through the game I felt like something was missing, I felt I had no real connection to any of the characters, they kind of just came and gone. This has to be my biggest issue with the game, this may have been because the story was not as intimate as Lee's and Clementine's was. I felt like TellTale just couldn't capture that same feeling in Season 2.Summary            At the end of it all, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a great game to pick up and play as it will take you through an amazingly well crafted story in a beautiful cell shaded design. Its hard to put down because the story keeps you engaged and you will find yourself wanting to keep going to find out what happens next. I would recommend playing the first season first as it will help you understand the storyline better and help show the changes made in clementine.			"

												It's the sophomore slump for Telltale Games' The Walking Dead! Hurray, Clementine is back! And so's that guy from the first season! Also, all the zombies from the first season are back.So I enjoyed it, but predictably I enjoyed it less than the first season. This is because the second season kind of didn't have a very consistent tone - the writing was not as strong this time around. The first season had a great hook - the zombie apocalypse was starting, everybody was still figuring out the Rules, everyone's become desperate refugees trying to survive in a world gone crazy, themes of parenthood, humanity, survival, all that good stuff.The second season is not as great in the storytelling department. Everybody's figured out the rules, the zombies are relentless and they show no signs of stopping (even after two years in, they rot but not enough to do something like fall apart), and the writers are trying to catch lightning in a bottle again by showing how Clementine grows up while many of her compatriots fall apart from stress unconvincingly. This is partly because the episodes have been shortened from two hours to 90 minutes, but also because I think the writers weren't doing so great a job here writing the characters in a consistent, believable manner. Come on, you survivor ♥♥♥♥ers, if an 11 year old is telling you how badly you're behaving and you ignore that then maybe I don't want to save you guys from being zombie chow. Carver (the antagonist of the survivalist community that the group has escaped from) had great moments, but he was killed off too early in my opinion. I would have loved to see him wading through a crowd of zombies going straight for the group for the later episodes. And the ending is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed and could have used a little more emotional balance other than KENNY IS CRAZY AND JANE KEEPS POINTING THAT OUT, WHO YOU GONNA TAKE TO THE ZOMBIE PROM? OOPS LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN PUNK'DAnyway, SOPHOMORE SLUMP but there's still these great, punchy emotional moments to be had by playing, and I still liked the story enough to not complain about the actual gameplay again, so I recommend it. I'm wary of how Season Three is going to turn out, though. It could be the emotional, weighty comeback that it needs (like a Return of the Jedi) or it could come home, stumbling drunk and fumbling through the napkins, reciting a bunch of drunken pablum about zombies before passing out on the kitchen floor (like a Superman 3).

												A fantastic follow up to the first season! It starts out with a bang and doesn't relent. If it's an emotional rollercoaster you're looking for then you'll certainly find one here; just like the first season. Again, voice acting is among the very best in video games and the storyline is likewise engaging too. Against the original season, this one has comparatively shorter episodes, which is a shame – though they feel more streamlined with fewer filler-type puzzles this time around. The new group of characters may feel out of place at first but they quickly grow on you as you follow their plight. There are some brilliantly crafted surprises along the way too! The action-packed build up to the ending pays off; the climactic finale offers several branching paths that radically change the outcome of the story – offering a rewarding and genuinely satisfying conclusion to the season arc with superb character-defining moments. All in all, it was a ride I thoroughly enjoyed. Can’t wait for Season 3!			"

												~TL;DR~If you're a fan of the series I recommend the game, if only to see how Clem has grown. The story is interesting enough, but the choices and payoff are lackluster. Or at least the ending I got was. - 6/10 -*SPOILER WARNING*The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a good game. It looks good, it plays well, and makes me look forward to the third game coming later this year. That said, it isn't quite the continuation I had been hoping for. Season 1 was a fantastic game that had me enthralled from start to finish and in the end I was left in tears. Season 2 just doesn't have quite the same impact on me that the original had. As I progressed through the story I felt like many of my choices didn't matter. It really seemed like only the final choices had any real outcome. I didn't really connect with anyone quite as much as I had with Lee. I did try to care for some of the characters. Luke, Kenny, Jane, and Mike were the characters that at first interested me the most, however by the end I only cared to keep Clem safe and Jane seemed like the best choice for survival. I also wasn't particularly happy about the roles characters from 400 Days played. I wasted time trying to get them all to go to safety, but they ended up being either goons for Carver or traitors, in Bonnie's case. I bought and played this game quite a while after its original release so I knew some of the endings. I teared up a bit at the ending where Kenny brings Clem and AJ to Wellington only to sacrifice his spot for theirs. It was a great ending that really meshed well with the Kenny I knew from season 1, but in my own playthrough I couldn't connect with Kenny. I ultimately ended the game with Jane and the family, which felt like an incomplete ending. Seeing the father's gun and how Clem reacted to it had me interested to see if they would turn on them, but it just faded to black. Also, judging by the first trailer for season 3, I don't think it matters which ending you chose. It may be that season 1 was just too good to follow up, and if that is true I hope season 3 can overcome this. I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead. I love the show and the comics and I want to continue to see stories in this universe, but next time I also want my choices to matter more. If you're a fan of the series I recommend the game, if only to see how Clem has grown. The story is interesting enough, but the choices and payoff are lackluster.

PresentationOver the years, The Walking Dead became a huge franchise spawning multiple comic issues, a TV Show and numerous video game adaptations as well, including Telltale's story-focused adventure. Season 2 of The Walking Dead picks up a while after the ending of Season 1 as you take control of Clementine, the little girl you were trying to protect during the first season. This change of character also changes the way the story unfolds because as a kid you can't be the leader of a group anymore and the world looks and feels different seen through the eyes of a kid forced to grow up faster and stand by her decisions making the entire adventure much more gruesome and unforgiving. Just like in the previous season your choices affect how the story unfolds in the end, but unlike Season 1, this season focused more on the actual characters and what they are all about, meaning there was less interactivity with the environment and the constant movement from one location to the next one makes each location meaningless, without leaving many memories or things that you were attached to in that place. Season 2 pushes the boundaries of story telling in a game even further, packing high tension moments with drama, occasional comedy and those great cliffhangers at the end of each episode, making you constantly wonder what's going to happen next and giving you some sort of ideas on who you should expect to make it out alive, without actually spoiling it for you and even better surprising you when you were wrong.Rating: 9.5GameplayThe gameplay in The Walking Dead Season 2 differs very little from Season 1, borrowing some visual cues from The Wolf Among Us to make it feel more user-friendly, leaving the main things that made Season 1 so great to begin with untouched. While in Season 1 Lee's foot was bandaged pretty quickly and without showing too much this time around when it comes to bandaging a wound the game takes no step back when it comes to showing off just how harsh and gruesome the world can be seen through a kid's eyes. The rest of the game is still the same point and click open area sequence, allowing you to explore the world around you for a bit, then usually followed by a cutscene and some quick time events or a quick choice that you are forced to make in order to change the direction in which the game is headed for you in the next episode. It is once again interesting to see how much your story differs from your friends' and the fact that there are multiple endings once you reach the final moments of the season shows that the developers really meant it when they said the series adapts after your choices you make and even though throughout the first three episode that doesn't seem like a big game changer, by the end of the season, The Walking Dead manages to craft a unique story in the way you meant it when you made those choices.Rating: 9GraphicsThe graphics of this game still have the same comic book feel to them, but with the gore and violence levels turned up a little, making the experience feel like an adult focused struggle story of a young girl stuck with the entire world against her. The characters look good, but none of them are really memorable except for a couple of newcomers and some old friends. The usual problems that Telltale has are still here meaning that you will get the occasional frame rate dropping more or less depending on which platform you play on and the lip syncing is not always on spot, but these are small problems that won't affect your overall experience as you will be more interested in how the story unfolds.Rating: 8.5AudioThe first season had Lee and his deep voice that stuck with you for the course of the journey, and then there were some other characters who you could recognize instantly by the sound of their voice, but this time around it feels like the most memorable characters are actually old acquaintances like Bonnie from the 400 Days DLC and some other returning faces from Season 1, since as good as the voice acting is in Season 2, new characters lack the time and personality traits to make them feel unique and attached to your story The soundtrack is one of the greatest to date in a story-focused game, always leaving you with that perfect song at the end of each episode, making the choices you made have an even greater impact on you.Rating: 9ExtrasAfter finishing this season and knowing that there are multiple endings I wanted to go back and get the other ones, but in the end I decided that I will stick with my original choices no matter how I felt about them. The games that have more than one possible outcome usually want you to play again to get another one but here's not the case. While you could get all the endings by replaying just one small part, that would mean changing the save file for that and all the achievements are already there from your first playthrough since all of them are awarded for just completing a section of an episode, so it was just more convenient to look it up online and leave my save files alone.Rating: 8VerdictThe Walking Dead Season 2 is a good follow up to the huge success of Season 1, but in the end it felt a little weaker than before as the characters weren't as memorable as before, but the whole journey of Clementine alone is worth the purchase. If you like games where the story comes first this is the game for you; if you like zombie survival games this is also made for you, but most of all if you like Telltale Games this is definitely the game for you.Rating Overall: 8.8Check out the full review and a lot more about The Walking Dead: Season Two at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=278 "

												The Walking Dead season 2 takes place 16 months after the events of the first season. You now control a 11 year old Clementine which makes the world feel even more dangerous since taking down a single walker takes multiple strikes because she lacks the strength to destroy the brain. It is a shame we don't get to play as 9 year old Clem and suddenly get a jump cut saying “16 months later”  with nothing else added on how she survived or what she went through when she was most vulnerable. That doesn't mean she won't be in danger though, as she will be receiving plenty of horrific injuries. Her voice is no longer high pitched and cute like in Season 1, she now sounds depressed after all the stuff she has been through. And since it has been so long after the outbreak most of the survivors are very selfish and jaded or just flatout insane. Nothing has really changed from Season 1 besides the story and a few new inputs during quick time events.  There are much less puzzles and less chances to talk to characters while walking around. They will usually just repeat one line and tell you to do something which helps keep up the pace of the game but also has less time to flesh out the characters.  It makes sense that they wouldn't want to converse with a little girl but it comes off as a bit silly how dependent they are on her at times. This time around they focus a lot more on human evil and pull it off very well. You will frequently feel intimidated by the insane people and more so by the people at your side as they start to lose it. Which brings me to the choices. It makes since that most people will ignore what you want to do but when you do make a choice it feels a lot less satisfying than in Season 1. They just feel lazy and the outcome will feel the same no matter what you pick, making it feel less like a choose your own adventure game and more like a point and click game with occasional dialogue choices.The game feels like it was rushed out before they could fine tune it to the quality of the first. Not that I'm saying it is a bad sequel though. I personally enjoyed it more than the first due to the helplessness of playing as a child. It is a very “fun” and tragic journey that I refuse to spoil here.  Not bad at all if you don't compare it to the original. Though one thing I just have to mention is that they make you sit through the credits that lists the whole staff and their pets five times. That's just unnecessary but at the very least they throw in some good music each time. Still if you liked the first season and want to know what happens next this is a very solid purchase that is every bit as emotional as the last season.			"

												Season 2 of The Walking Dead continues the story and plays pretty identical to the first game. It's still primarily an interactive movie revolving around making tough choices and living with the consequences of those choices. While the 2nd season is a decent game, I didn't feel drawn into each character's emotions like the first one. I just felt a sense of distrust in all the characters which made it easy to not get emotionally attached to any of them. The game is also significantly shorter than the first which means there wasn't as much time to form a bond with the characters. For me, it was a ho hum experience overall.			"

Seeing the father's gun and how Clem reacted to it had me interested to see if they would turn on them, but it just faded to black. Also, judging by the first trailer for season 3, I don't think it matters which ending you chose. It may be that season 1 was just too good to follow up, and if that is true I hope season 3 can overcome this. I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead. I love the show and the comics and I want to continue to see stories in this universe, but next time I also want my choices to matter more. If you're a fan of the series I recommend the game, if only to see how Clem has grown. The story is interesting enough, but the choices and payoff are lackluster. Or at least the ending I got was. - 6/10 -			"

												The first game was great. I could not see how this could become nothing else but just a lackluster sequel. Oh boy, did I get that wrong. This is a must if you have played the first season. There is plenty of new characters that are mostly likable but it's amazing to see how our Clementine has grown so mature over the years. This game will punch you in the feels, just like the first one did.			"

												I was very excited about Season 2 when it got announced. Season 1 of Telltale's The Walking Dead was my favourite game of 2012 and I got introduced to the whole franchise through that game. Because of that, I've pre-ordered S2, which is something that I've never done with a Telltale game before. (I do appreciate my efforts for trying it out something new, playing the game from the start and waiting for the upcoming Episodes, but I also regret it a bit because of the waiting between Episodes)Season 2 had a rough start, some really unmemorable characters and it basically lacked any central plot. Truth be told, I thought only Episode One was decent at best, while Episodes Two & Three and Four were actually between Good-Great and it wasn't until the Season Finale where I've finally said that the ride was absolutely worth it. But was it worth the wait?In short, both yes and no. It was worth the wait because of all the crazy stuff we witnessed in the Season Finale, but it also wasn't worth it, because the overall Season had some really rough parts that could have been fixed with better writing. It's safe to say that the Season Finale, while it was incredible, it was also a ""bit too late"" at that point. People's reactions with the entirety of the Season have been mixed; some liked it, some thought it was just filler.While I like Clementine, I still feel that playing with Lee in Season 1 was better. His actions had bigger influences on future events, while playing with Clementine I felt that none of the people I've met in the game considered me or my actions seriously. It also felt weird that many of adults relied on a little kid during intense moments.I also have to give credit to Season 2 for being more inventive and giving us scenarios that have never really been done in the comics and the TV show (for example, Walkers on the frozen lake).It all boils down to this. Season 1 had better writing and memorable characters, while Season 2 had more creativity. I highly recommend both Seasons, although I don't blame you if you won't end up liking Season 2 as much as Season 1, because let's be honest here; Telltale set the bar way too high with S1.			"

It makes you think and even sometimes regret choices you had to make in the game...It all ties in from Season 1...Grab it, well worth the price and damn near as good as the show.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season Two was one of the best games I have ever played! Significantly better than season one and honestly, if you are looking for a game to play with your boyfriend/girlfriend on the couch together, this is it!!!! My love and I, sat down one night, meaning to just play one, maybe two, episodes and ending up playing all of it. The story is breathtakingly well written and omg the characters become so well developed! This game is just amazing! I cannot express in enough words to say it but you just have to play it yourself!			"

 The Walking Dead: Season 2  Continuing adventures in a world ruined by zombies, however, our main hero is no longer Lee Everett. This time we will play as a girl named Clementine that we know from the first season. Get ready again for a good portion of a great and engaging storyline, many interesting characters and places, amazing soundtrack and the choices that they have once again they do not have that much matter in gameplay. However, it's still a great game with a great storyline that can pull in like a good movie. As for me it is an interactive movie that I highly recommend and it is definitely more profitable than going to the cinema.  "

												The Walking Dead: Season Two brings out alot of emtions and feelings in it's very well written and greatly paced story.In the game you play as Clemintine. Basically, Clemintine has seen some sh*t. She has been through alot and I would reccomend that you play the first game to understand the events of the second game. She finds herself joining this group in hope to find her ""lost"" friend Christa (also in the first game.) The story then kicks in after that. However, the story does slow down from time to time but when you progress through it, it really feels like YOU are getting to know these characters and that YOU are Clemintine going through all these issues.This game contains  alot of mature content, so expect to see people die and to see alot of things that you wish you hadn't.There is a slight chance that the game might make you smile and a more definate chance that you might tear up a little along the way, but in the end the game really leaves a somber yet satisfied feeling in your head and will leave you thinking about it for days on end.If your'e looking for a zombie killfest, then you'll be disappointed. This game focuses on story and that's what the game's ultimate goal is and it surpasses it's goal by a mile. I would 100% recommend this epic expierience for people who are looking for a great story and very good writing.			"

												Telltale does it again with the second season of The Walking Dead and you already know whether you'll like it or not. I would say the sequel manages to be even grimmer than the first game primarily by making a child the main character of the story and putting her through some pretty dark things by the end of it. Although it does take a while to sink in that a group of adults is deferring to a hyper-competent child to get things done most of the time but then again this is a Clementine show through and through, whether by making us witness her character growth and making her the decision maker in contrast with the first season. Story-wise it's about another group of survivors, their circumstances and how Clementine fits into all of it, although it also heavily hinges on a returning major character from the first season and a LOT of the impact will depend on how attached you were to said character.This will either be a major boon or major bane in the last episode which is somewhat weaker than the rest and leads to an, for me personally at least, unsatisfying ending. Another negative, aside from Telltale's traditional life long quest to remove more and more of the actual gameplay from player's hands, is the fact that most characters from 400 Days are used in a very expendable manner when a whole lot more could've been done with them.

												This is a somewhat odd game.Most people will be familiar with TellTale's style by now, 5 episodes, a few hours each in length.Due to the fact that this is a sequel to The Walking Dead comparisions shall be made.I'm not a particular fan of the The Walking Dead (TV series) I watched the first series and half of the second and just found it ridiculous and stopped watching it.So I didn't really have high hopes at all for The Walking Dead. But I was surprised, it's pretty fantastic however I picked up the sequel much later on and whilst it does have it's high moments, it still has a great story and it's still a TellTale experience. Unfortunately all of the choices from the first game don't really matter and the choices in this game don't really seem to matter as much, it feels like whatever you choose you end up with the same end result.Same comic book style. Voice acting is good, story is good, wasn't particularly a fan of the new characters but I enjoyed the return of  Kenny .The game is enjoyable overall, maybe I had high expectations for the sequel and shouldn't have done. It's a good, not great. You aren't missing that much by not playing it but I do recommend it when it's on sale.			"

												Season 2 was an incredibly different experience from Season 1. I was incredibly emotional through Season 1. Cried my eyes  out after every episode. Could not play more than one episode in a day. For season 2, I played 4 episodes in one day and didn't shed a tear. No sniffles. No, that does not make me cold hearted. We follow Clementine immediately after Season 1 and follow her journey. Clementine is amazing. This is both the games strength and weakness. We all love Clementine. She has been through a lot of stuff. However, all the adults around her put way too much responsiblity on her, making all the adults in this game look incompetent. There isn't really a Lee/Clementine dynamic. There were characters that I liked, but I never felt a connection with them like I did in Season 1. I will still play a Season 3 if one comes out, just out of love of Clementine.  If you are interested in Clementine's story and willing to put up with some weak story and character points, its worth it. I found this flawed game interesting and intriguing enough to play through to the end, and hope for the best for the survivors. And their survival in the hopeful sequel to come.			"

												If you haven't played The Walking Dead Season 1, definitely go play that first before considering this game. You have to know some characters and events from it to fully understand/appreciate this story.That being said, I do wish some of the lessons Lee gives Clementine in Season 1 based on your choices there carried over to Season 2. But since you're controlling Clementine in this game, it's really up to you whether those lessons manifest in your choices as her here. Otherwise they won't show up in cutscenes or anything.Compared to Season 1, I don't know which was the better game. Both of them had difficult decisions to make, and both centered a lot around your relationships with the other characters. However I did feel more tense with this game since there seemed to be less uplifting events compared to Season 1, and there was a lot of physical abuse shown that wasn't against zombies. There was also some talk about intercourse if that makes any difference to you. But Season 2's story still had twists and turns, jaw-dropping moments, and a teary ending that made it worth playing/watching.Pretty much the same game mechanics as Season 1 except two new actions that deal with moving the left analog stick, one of which requires you to also simultaneously hold A (xbox). Unfortunately it doesn't look like you can remap buttons if you have a disability that makes these controls difficult. But I do think the game improved fight scenes, in that if you're using a controller, moving the cursor in the general direction of the enemy now locks it onto the target vs requiring the more precise positioning as with Season 1.Overall, if you enjoyed the first game, I think you would definitely enjoy this one too. This game's a couple hours shorter but I think still worth a playthrough.			"

												This was as good as the first season! I loved every bit of it. It wasn't too full of cliches and you get to play as little girl which isn't over used and it's pretty unique experience. Clementine isn't that little 8 year old little girl she used to be in the first season. She is a survivalist now, hardened by everything she saw and experienced in first season. I think the story in this is really good and it won't stuck in one place which I was a bit afraid of in the first episode. There always something new and all the characters were interesting as well. Whether this is the final season or not doesn't really matter as the ending brings kind of closure what happens. I have only played this once and got sad ending so I hope that there will be season 3 soon. There are cameos of characters in 400 days, nothing major but it's interesting to see them and know their backstory. If you liked the first season you should buy this, especially if you're walking dead fan.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a great follow-up to the fantastic TWD: Season 1 from Telltale. TWD: Season 2 does improve over TWD: Season 1 in some ways, while the experience is still littered w/ fantastic storytelling, character development, and important decisions to make. If you weren't a fan of TWD: S1, I don't think S2 will sway you into becoming a fan of the series, as this series and these style of games just might not be for you (i.e. adventure games mixed with a lot of interactive story elements - such as Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy and The Walking Dead: Season 1).Often, a lot of the decisions the player makes as Clementine during this zombie-apocalypse, you will have very limited time to make a decision, which makes often for a very gripping & intense experience. Like the previous season, things are often very intense here. You will have to make decisions here in this bleak game-world, which will cause rifts between yourself and the other people in the group that are trying to survive in this zombie-apocalypse - and this is where a lot of the tension comes from. Also, adding to the tension is that this game is so focused on story + character development, that characters you will care about - well, you'll have to make a decision on what to do. Since this is TWD - expect making bleak + dark decisions, which often are in the realm of choosing b/t gray-clouded areas. Often, players will be choosing b/t the lesser of a few evils; or making what feels like a the morally good decision where the outcome is just still down-right horrible.Just like with S1, S2's story + character, & decision-making stuff is pushed into the forefront. In this Season, you are Clementine (who returns from Season 1, but is now fully playable this time around). Clementine is stuck with a group of mostly new survivors, who are trying to stay alive in this zombie-apocalypse. This is what the game actually is. If you're looking for a typical type of game with challenge put forth in combat, puzzles, and things of that nature - don't. This is not that kind of game.Though, S2 feels like it often offers up more action sequences in the previous season.  If you were hoping for more action sequences in S2, you'll probably be happy with that change. With that change, though - it feels like there are less puzzles offered than what was in the previous Season. S2 feels a bit more on-rails, less areas to explore, and less items often in the inventory - which can makes these puzzles a lot easier than what was in Season 1. While this is labeled as an adventure game, do not expect mind-numbing puzzles: most of these puzzles are very logical and very easy to figure out. If you were hoping they'd improve that by having more difficult puzzles or another difficulty to offer up tougher puzzles, don't. Actually, the puzzles in S1 - which weren't even remotely hard, anyways - were a bit more challenging. When you make choices + decisions, they will often shape the journey of the experience itself in certain ways. They might even make the final outcome of the game different even. Having a bit of a different journey itself and final outcome, for fans - this could make the game worth any replays they would want to give the game. Since you can import directly from S1 + 400 Days DLC, in which your decisions can matter from those - there could even be reasons to replay and start from S1, play 400 Days, and then run S2.When it comes down all to it, after around 9.5 hours w/ this game (according to Steam), The Walking Dead: Season 2 is an excellent adventure game + interactive story. If you were not a fan of TWD: Season 1, then I don't think TWD: S2 will turn you into a fan of the series. While the experience is fantastic, it still offers up a lot more of the same greatness that came forth in S1. Great characters, storytelling, voice-acting, dialogue, and decision-making are what make this game as great as it is. If you haven't played S1, well - you should start with S1 and then play 400 Days DLC b/c your saved-games can be imported right into S2. While TWD: S2 does not have the freshness of a new experience that Season 1 offered up, TWD: S2 is still great and most definitely worth experiencing for fans of TWD: Season 1 and those into a mix of adventure games + interactive stories.Final Grade = A-.

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is based off the comic book 'The Walking Dead' and the television series. The story is about the zombie invasion and it is set in a post-apocalyptic setting.I will keep this review very short and sweet. To start off with, I felt season one was very strong and I loved the feature where season two continued the game based off your season one choices. But as the game continues, it is emotional, intense and really engages the player. All in all, this game is incredible. The artwork is brilliant and it's a massive hit of a game. The game is at a good length at over 9 hours for all five episodes, however there is so much that happens that the length is long.And for feature-related things, its an interactive story so your choices matter, which is a major positive.I recommend this at any price. I am looking forward to season three. 10/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												Season 2 enjoys an overall improvement especially in the storytelling and graphics department. I'm only 3 episodes in (since only 3 are available right now) but the tough choices have already piled up. It's also an added bonus that you get to meet interesting new characters. How are they interesting? It's hard to say without spoiling it. ersonalities are more spread out and experience is more common this time around. The game also shifts the focus off of survival by supplies to immediate threats. With that said, you can expect more action (sort of). So far so good! I do hope that the last 2 episodes continue this awesome streak.			"

												Unfortunately, that’s really the extent of the effect you have on The Walking Dead’s narrative. Like in season one, picking sides causes people to react to you in different ways, but the plot still moves forward just the same. Decide to steal someone’s medicine or let them go; you’ll be in the same spot regardless of what you end up doing. Occasionally your choices will affect who lives or dies, but everything always ends up reverting to some kind of status quo. Moment to moment, The Walking Dead is thrilling, and it feels like your choices matter--examine it too closely and you realize that you’re merely given the illusion of choice. It’s no worse than the first season, but it ends up feeling more obvious the second time around.Still, while the choices you make might not necessarily affect the overall story, they certainly affect how you feel about its numerous characters. I was worried that season two wouldn’t be able to deliver characters as compelling as the ones we got in season one, and that’s certainly the first impression I got when Clementine stumbles upon this new group. But over time, you get to know them and really connect with them as people. Luke attaches himself to Clementine as a surrogate big-brother, and the badass lone-wolf Jane teaches her how to survive at all costs. Even Carver, the megalomaniacal head of a budding utopia (and voiced by a scene-stealing Michael Madsen) feels relatable--his my-way-or-your-face-smashed-on-the-highway approach to leadership is extreme, but in the end, he’s only doing what he thinks he needs to do to survive in this harsh world. As in season one, season two’s cast follows a wide range of personalities, and each one is flawed in their own unique ways. They’re all capable of great acts of kindness as well as sweeping acts of betrayal--just like, you know, real humans are.Unlike season one, season two completely sheds its extraneous adventure game roots. It doesn’t bog itself down pointless puzzles or fetch quests (people who remember finding batteries for a certain radio know exactly what I’m talking about). Rather, season two is constantly about forward momentum, as it propels you from one bleak scenario to the next. For the most part, this works in its favor--and whether you’re running from zombies or enjoying a brief respite, every moment feels deliberate. It really is a roller coaster ride of emotions (mostly depression), and Telltale has nailed the art of the cliffhanger in this series.That said, season two’s pacing feels off. Major plot points are wrapped up by episode three, leaving the back half of the game to languish in this weird survival purgatory. There’s no real endgame--merely survival--and the last two episodes drift along aimlessly until the season's ultimate conclusion. The payoff is certainly worth it, as its exploration of the evils any of its characters are capable of finally comes to a head--I just wish it didn’t take so long to get there. Even with these pacing issues, season two is still worth playing, as there are some truly surprising moments that will make even the most hardened player reel in shock.Season two also keeps its signature quick-time events intact, and if you hated them in season one, you’re going to hate them here, too. When you’re not navigating The Walking Dead’s myriad life-ruining decisions, you’re mashing buttons or matching on-screen directional prompts to avoid bandits or shambling zombies. Like the plot, these QTEs certainly feel like you’re doing something, and they definitely spice up the action, but they occur far too frequently, and your input is way too basic to be anything more than contrivance at best, and the red arrows have a tendency to blend in with all the action on screen, leading to more than a few frustrating restarts.Even with its hiccups, season two of The Walking Dead is absolutely worth playing, with an interesting cast of characters and a narrative that is still sufficiently gripping despite its less interesting parts. It’s not quite game of the year material, and it doesn’t feel as necessary as season one, but Telltale proves that Clementine’s story is one well worth continuing.			"

												Aimlessly wandering. There's no real goal in this season, just stuff happening and you're a passenger. The whole ""playing as a child"" idea sounds neat a first, but soon just makes you all the more aware of how little your choices mean in these games. The story tells itself, and your minor changes ultimately mean nothing. This gets even worse at a definite point in Episode 5 when it just takes the controls away from you and decides ""It's story time now, you don't even get the illusion of choice."" Any time you save one character from death, you just watch them as they silently carry on with their inevitably short lives. There was a chance for them to die, so for the script's purposes, they're dead. They're still hanging around, but they serve no purpose and are just walking targets, waiting for a piano to fall from the sky and crush them.Not to mention (spoilers) after Episode 2 it just turns into the Kenny show so you get to spend the next 3 and a half episodes watching him be an unbearable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while he ignores anything you say to him. It's just a roller coaster of unlikeable characters, extremely predictable actions, and a script that doesn't seem to have any desire to do anthing interesting. Honestly ""roller coaster"" is a way too exciting way of describing it. Just quit with Season 1 and enjoy that without souring the whole experience with this horrid cash in on the concept.			"

												This game did something special. It wouldn't exsist the way it does without episode 1, but it does things that I haven't seen often in stories. This game really emotinally hooks the player. It asks you to make choices that make you care more about the next. It really says some things about maturity, the human condition, and hit me harder than nearly any story has before. You should play this, because you'll probably walk away with more than you would from nearly any other title. If it hits you like it hit me, it will be an experience that will make you ponder about what's next.			"

												The sequel is just as good if not better than Season 1.  The story told in this season is filled with heart wrenching choices that affect the rest of the story.  Graphics look similar to Season 1 and still look good, except that I felt the animation and graphics were smoother and less glitchy than Season 1.  You have a lot more action to deal with in this game than its predecessor and it is well implemented.  None of the puzzles are difficult, most there to pace the game properly and allow you to speak with individuals in your group to get more background story on them.  As typical in the series, the choices you make can be tough and emotional and what's even better is that the choices from Season 1 come back to affect the game here in Season 2.I highly recommend playing Season 1 before Season 2 simply because it's nice to see your choices making a difference in the way you interact with other characters in this game.  It's not necessary, but it will help, especially since they do often speak about characters, both minor and major characters, from the first game.Another great addition to the Telltale Games library.

Im not a great fan of the TV Series but the game has a brilliant storyline with decisions you make from Season 2 influence how you play season while choices you make in season 2 can go either way.Episode 3 was by far my favourite episode with 5 close behind.100% Recommend trying this game and season 1 if you have not already! :D			"

												** Currently played 2 Episodes **I could just say ""Telltale games did it again"" and leave it at that.Fact is, if you enjoyed the first installment from ""The walking dead"" you'll enjoy this installment just as much as the first one. Up until now i have played 2 episodes and there was already so much action, drama, tear-jerking and hilarious moments, it's impossible to sum it all up in one review.All I can say is that the story is intense and way darker than in the first season in my opinion, the gameplay is fluent and there are lots of different choices you can make that have an impact on the ending you'll get (to my knowledge there are 5-6 different ending this time) so the replayabilty is probably higher than in the first installment.But yeah, as I said: If you have enjoyed the first installment, you'll love this one. There are new characters, you'll eventually meet folks you know from the first season and all of them play a valid role. Sure, the gameplay mostly consists of dialogue, but the story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Believe me, if there is a stressfull situation in the game, it's not only Clem who's gonna be stressed out, it'll affect yourself, as well.For me, this game is a straight 10/10 and my personal Game of the Year so far.Edit: And I almost forgot: I, personally, already loved Clementine in the first season, but in this one she is a straight up badass.

												When Telltale Games announced this continuation, every single person who played/watched the critically acclaimed first season had the same response:  ""But the first season was far too heart-wrenching, beautiful and exhilerating.  With [event that happened in the final episode of season 1], how can we get that same experience with a second season?Short answer: you won't.Clementine is the playable character in this season, and it is a wholly different experience.  People underestimate you, giving you a distinct (and extremely interesting) advantage.  Soon, people you don't know (as well as ones you are close to) will see you as the dangerous force you are.  But the best part has to do with :Lee:Everything you have said and done in Season 1 is reflected in Clementine.  Were you really nice?  More tame dialogue.  Was your version of Lee comparable to Samuel L Jackson?  Prepare for a Clem who knows how to curse.The choices you make matter, and say farewell to scripted dying:  By Episode 3, at least two characters can either be alive or dead, thanks to some split-second decisions made in Episode 2.  Play this game.			"

												If you are reading this review, I am assuming that you've already played the first season of this game. Gameplay wise, there's not much difference compared to the previous game. As for the story, it seems to be focused more on survival and just making it ""from one day to another"", but there's still place for emotions. Just not as much of them as the first game had. I think I've enjoyed season one a bit more, but if you've liked the previous season I don't see a reason why wouldn't you like season 2. The only flaw is, again, the fact that our choices don't affect the big picture most of the times. Oh, and the graphics improved some. I'm not a guy who cares much for grahpics, but they've done a great job with shading. As for the fact that we're playing as a child now... This didn't affect my experience, really. As in, gameplay-wise it's all the same... Story wise, of course people treat Clementine different than they've treated Lee. And Clem being smaller and all, has a bigger problem killing zombies than Lee did. But that's all.			"

It's rewarding to see how far her character has developed since the events of season one. Season two is brutal - some of the decisions you're forced to make WILL make you stop and think, and that's an amazing feeling that Telltale is becoming quite good at creating.			"

About The Game:The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a story driven adventure based on the highly popular comic books & television series of the same name developed by Robert Kirkman.The game starts off right from the end of the first season where Clementine has met up with Kirsta and Omid after the events of the original game.From the very beginning you're brought right back into the great story telling & suspensful gameplay that you've come to expect from Telltale Studios, all is the same except for that it's now around about 3 years later and Clementine is no longer the child from the first game.The Story:This time around the story focuses on Clementine and her experiences in the world of ""The Walking Dead"", it's a long journey that is anticipated right from the beginning to the end & a worthy experience for all gamers who appreciate a good story.The Story for ""The Walking Dead"" is a very long one and has so many different outcomes that it is really hard to write down, the best i can really say is that it's quite the rollercoaster ride & i really urge you to just give it a go. Check out Youtube playthroughs to determine whether or not this is a game for you.The Gameplay:The Gameplay for The Walking Dead is the same as all Telltale games, it's designed really to be an interactive story more than a game, you push buttons that prompt your character to use different dialogues which determine many different things in which the character react to you, think about you & what they'll do for you & solve puzzles in order to progress further in the story.It's an interactive movie really you watch the game unfold while giving it mild plot changes during gameplay with the occasional Quick Time event that determines whether you die or not.The Verdict:The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a game that is not for everyone but it's certainly an experience for people who love a solid story or if you're a fan of The Walking Dead comics or TV series, or even if you're just a Zombie fan.While this game has a very solid story & it's great to go through and try different things on other playthoughs it really just shines brilliance when you take the time to get to know each character and determine which characters you would want on your side in a real apocolypse scenario.While the gameplay is pretty much just Quick Time Events it's 1 of those games where it works because it's not designed to really make you work, unlike a Third Person or First Person game you are playing a game in this you're watching & creating a story.This game also receives a 10/10 along with the first game because they're just so damn good. It is everything i expected for this series and nothing let me down.It would have been nice to feel like some of my decisions really made a difference but it doesn't really matter all that much because the game is set on a very straight story that can't really be branched because of it's close steps towards the comic book narritive.Do I Recommend This Game?:Yes i do recommend it and it's well worth a play as i said throughout my whole review.If You Haven't Played Season 1:Other Games Similar You Might Like:The Wolf Among Us:Jurrasic Park:Or you can just check out the whole catalogue of Telltale games as they're all very similar:http://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Telltale%20GamesCheck Out My Review For Season 1:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/207610/ "

												This was such an interesting game, it truly was. For those who enjoy games that are based more on plot than FPS or anything else, this is the game for you.

It's a story of a young girl who is lost in a world filled with chaos and the undead. Clementine has to survive throughout this with the people she's met, taking her on a wild journey to escape from the dead. It was a truly heartbreaking and emotional game, but I would put my funding into a season 3.

												I'll get back to a more in-depth review eventually, but from what I've seen, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one too. It's as least as good as the previous game. Note that content is being released episodically, so you won't get the whole story yet.2014.03.09: The episodes feel a bit shorter than in the first game. There's really not time to explore much or get to know the other people. The events and action scenes are great though.2014.05.26: There seems to be fewer decisions to make, and overall the game more cinematic than interactive. It's just not quite on par with Season 1 on that front. However, the story is good and action sequences nice and gory.			"

												After how good Season 1 was, Season 2 had pretty big shoes to fill that it probably never could fill in the first place. But it's not too far off either. Season 2 follows up from Season 1 (woohoo for imported saves), though sadly 400 days seems like it was a waste of time after all. I want to say there is less action this time around, but that wouldn't really be true. Rather its that the change from playing as Lee Everett to Clementine that results in less fights for the player to get involved in directly, which is kinda neat in its own way. 10 year old girls aren't expected to do as much melee stuff as a 37 year old man would, though you still do some of that here.There's also less adventure game style puzzles to do... alot less. Most of the gameplay here is dialogue choices and relatively brief action sequences, which almost puts this game into visual novel territory. It's a shame because there are far fewer opportunities for wandering around just chatting or interacting with the environment, which weakens the character development a bit for the new faces that don't get much time. It means that Season 2's episodes are generally shorter, but it also means that you spend less time wandering about and more time following the plot. A plot that is still quite good, though perhaps not as likely to bring people to tears as some of the bigger moments of Season 1 did. Nothing in Season 2 got that to happen for me, though the finale came close as you find yourself making rough choices that can give you very different endings (unlike Season 1, which ended the same way no matter what).I'd say the high points of the season are found in Episodes 2 and 5 (which are also the longest episodes), with the other episodes mainly serving as build-up towards those bigger moments. I'm not sure where this series will go from here, but it seems very likely that we will see a Season 3. Whether that is with who ultimately makes it out of Season 2 or not (which has to consolidate the varied endings for this season), or if it is an entirely new cast, is uncertain. Until we find out... enjoy this one. It's pretty good. :)			"

												I just went through the game and in my oppinion, it beats Season 1 by far. There is more violence (physical and mental), I had the feeling my choices do effect the game far more than in EP 1 and I ALMOST shed tears a few times. -> But I'm too manly hue hue! Again, a really nice open end which makes you wanna play more (or again) instantly. Especially when it is in sale, go get it and spend some nice hours with a hot tea on cold and cloudy game with this good game.10/10			"

												Another rollercoaster ride of emotions, this Season 2 imho is not epic and heart moving like the previous one, but the idea of seeing how Clementine's growing up and shaping her character after all that happenend to her in S1 was a perfect choice from Telltale. The first episodes slowly introduce the new characters and relationships between them, then from the end of Episode 3, through EP4 and 5, everything speeds up, taking you to the final escalation and to five different possible endings. Choices you make during S2 are not determinant until the last minutes of EP5, and that's a shame because this gives you too little REAL decisional power, but it was nice to have a so hectic and variable ending. Now I'm curious to see what will happen in Season 3 and if the main character will change again.There are also some plot holes here and there, things happen without explanations, some questions are left there without a real answer. I also found some new charaters to be really interesting and well built, others instead barely newsworthy. And well, sometimes Clementine is appointed with decisions and tasks too heavy for a small girl like her, not realistic and a bit forced by script and gameplay reasons, but fun nonetheless!I liked Season 2, I recommend it to everyone who loved Season 1, however you need to know and like Telltale narrative and graphical style, so if you never played TWD or The Wolf Among Us, start from there before buying this one.

												The sequel is just as good if not better than Season 1.  The story told in this season is filled with heart wrenching choices that affect the rest of the story.  Graphics look similar to Season 1 and still look good, except that I felt the animation and graphics were smoother and less glitchy than Season 1.  You have a lot more action to deal with in this game than its predecessor and it is well implemented.  None of the puzzles are difficult, most there to pace the game properly and allow you to speak with individuals in your group to get more background story on them.  As typical in the series, the choices you make can be tough and emotional and what's even better is that the choices from Season 1 come back to affect the game here in Season 2.I highly recommend playing Season 1 before Season 2 simply because it's nice to see your choices making a difference in the way you interact with other characters in this game.  It's not necessary, but it will help, especially since they do often speak about characters, both minor and major characters, from the first game.Another great addition to the Telltale Games library.

												If you are reading this review, I am assuming that you've already played the first season of this game. Gameplay wise, there's not much difference compared to the previous game. As for the story, it seems to be focused more on survival and just making it ""from one day to another"", but there's still place for emotions. Just not as much of them as the first game had. I think I've enjoyed season one a bit more, but if you've liked the previous season I don't see a reason why wouldn't you like season 2. The only flaw is, again, the fact that our choices don't affect the big picture most of the times. Oh, and the graphics improved some. I'm not a guy who cares much for grahpics, but they've done a great job with shading. As for the fact that we're playing as a child now... This didn't affect my experience, really. As in, gameplay-wise it's all the same... Story wise, of course people treat Clementine different than they've treated Lee. And Clem being smaller and all, has a bigger problem killing zombies than Lee did. But that's all.			"

												The gameplay is more refined in Season 2, focusing on the game's strengths while reducing the classic point and click sections, which often broke the flow in Season 1, to a very healthy minimum. It is indeed a stellar interactive experience from beginning to end.The story, however, suffered in Season 2 - the absence of the dynamic between Lee and Clementine hurts the game and similar bonds aren't formed. New characters the player is supposed to care for rarely live longer than half an episode.The game is trying to show the impact this post apocalyptic world has on Clementine but is ultimately leaving the player equally jaded and emotionally drained. It's hard to tell if that makes the game successful or not ...That said, despite its flaws, it still has some of the best storytelling in any modern game and should be considered a classic of the genre much like season 1.

The first games major flaw for me was how none of the choices you made changed anything, this game doesn't suffer from that quite as much and your options are much more varied than before. All in all it's worth it, especially if you catch it on sale, and it's much more likely to leave you feeling in control of how you play compared to the first.			"

												Once you start, you can't stop playing. Unlike the first season, this one has less emotional feedbacks. The controls are less confusing and you get to play through Clementines eyes. This little girl is growing up so fast, she has been through hell and back and it's time for her to make the choices. It has a nice story but it's not as great as the first season and how it drags you in so deeply. Regardless, if you're a fan of the other season then you have to play this one too, and the others to come. I am purely addicted now, it's just a shame that I have to wait months at a time for new episodes :(			"

												Calm the fukc down, no spoilers. I get your pain.Robert Kirkman is a man of entertainment and many talents. And he's a kinda a guy you would give Oscar to or slap so hard.Well, judging by franchise decisions for ""The Walking Dead"", Kirkman's should be greatly awarded AND punched in the face even harder. The guy, alongside his collagues gave us AWESOME COMICS, pretty solid novels, some great games and probably the ♥♥♥♥♥iest zombie show that ever stumbled on our screens. Yes, I am talking about AMC's The Walking Dead and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HATE IT. In case you need to ask why, you either don't know what ""The Walking Dead"" is all about, or you're ignorant and you should be slapped, too.Now, let's get back to episodic adventure game ""The Walking Dead"" that's published by Telltale Games. In 2012 we got Season One, consisting of five episodes, and now we're stuck in the middle of Season 2, with Episode 4 on the way, biting our nails and hailing a great villain Bill Carver voiced by one and only Michael Madsen.In case you haven't tried The Walking Dead before, it's an episodic not-really-adventure-but-more-of-a-interactive-novel game that puts you in position of choosing dialogues and actions which will directly influence the story - yes, it's a game that requires less reflexes than any other zombie game. Without need to dissect the Season 1 here, I'll skip to Season 2 right away.Season 2 leans even more toward storytelling mode. It's a story driven season that will require even less actions, movements, but the decisions shall be huge and will leave you wanting more. As for the characters, Clem is back and she's back in black, you're gonna love her 'new' character. You'll meet some ol' friends and enemies, and if you have your Season 1 and 400 Days saves - the game will continue directly based upon your choices in previous Telltale TWD games. Characters are portrayed pretty nicely, most of 'em are not flat and you'll have your own satisfaction or disappointment with their destinies and what you choose for them, and that thing is pretty important when it comes to games that are story and emotions driven.The Walking Dead Season 2 needs some more action, but it gets you pretty pumped up with a story and therefore, I can't really complain. It's violent and hectic and if you love the world of TWD comics - this, in a pretty good way, comes pretty close.Either way, you have to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy not to acknowledge the following - AMC's should seek game producers to work for their show, because this is WAY BETTER than that lame a$$ stuff served for fourth year now. If you've played Season 1 - get it. If you did not - get Season 1 first.			"

												I'm assuming anyone that reads this review has played the original game. Spoilers will be your undoing if you read on and haven't played the original all the way through yet.This season had a lot of hard choices in it. I'm not sure if my choices actually mattered at all honestly. Similar to the first game come to think of it like how even if you chose not to rob the station wagon you would rob the station wagon anyway because your friends would ignore you and take it's contents or how if you saved Ben he just died very soon after anyway. But you still feel like your participation mattered.The layout of the dialoge options were different from part 1. In part 1 I had gotten used to tapping 1-4 to repond with the choice I wanted to use. In part 2 you get clickable boxes instead. It's a minor difference I guess.Otherwise the gameplay is a lot more of the same as part 1; walk around until you trigger an event and mix the occassional quicktime event into the formula.As I play I do moreso feel the nagging feeling that my actions in this game (including part 1) don't effect anything. There comes a point in part 2 where it's obvious where things are headed and as much as I try to steer it away -- whether by calming things down, arguing against, or getting physically involved -- it barrels straight into the bad time I saw coming a mile away. In the finale I had the option to be the reason for the bad time or just sit back and let the bad time happen because of someone else while I looked away. In other words when it comes down to the nitty gritty I feel as much as I do get into the game it doesn't actually let me get that interactive. I can change minor details - such as what side I take when arguments take place - but not major ones like the outcome of the arguments or the actions that follow said arguments.Ultimately I should consider it more of a movie than a game and not truely expect to change the outcome. And as an interactive movie I see it still as a very good movie. by game standards I'd give it 3/10, but as an interactive movie - which is truely what it shines as - I'd give it a 8/10.			"

												I'm going to be simplistic here.This is a worthy sequel of the first season.It has everything season 1 had to offer experience-wise as a game.The only difference is that Season 1 finishes and leaves you with a feeling of a big chapter actually coming to an end.In this season that feeling of completion is not so strong. The final chapter has some very important events to witness however the end leaves you with the feeling of expecting to see an actual epilogue. Even a cinematic.I literally thought there was one epilogue chapter to play through after the credits. Instead I was like ""wait. that's it? now everyone's waiting for season 3? and they already anounced TWD Michonne instead of Season 3?!?!? Why?What happened? Clementine is not interesting enough for you anymore?!?!""I really do hope they bring Season 3.I'm going to be disappointed if they don't.Yes. It is recommended. If you loved Season 1 as much as I did you have no reason not to buy this especially now that it's cheaper.			"

												I love this game the most out of the three twd telltale games partially because of bias (I played this one first for some reason) but even without bias I think the game has great writing and some awesome characters. It is also pretty awesome to have Clementine as a protagonist and seeing her grow after season 1.			"

												Great game. The only thing they do wrong with both The Walking Dead and The Walking Dead Season 2 is too many people die regardless of the choices you make. They need to make it where not everyone dies and the choices you make either kill them or save them. Its the only disappointing thing in this game series. The game series is great just the choices you make should reflect what happens in the game and who lives or dies. I recommend this game and love the game series. Just the game series needs to be more influenced by your decisions and outcomes.			"

Get the game but don't hope for much in terms of a strong story following up the events that lead to some pretty warm hearted moments.  "

												After the first season of Walking Dead I was keen to see the way the second played out. Without giving anything away in terms of plot, the writers are keen to show a frank and thorough storyline and this starting episode doesn't disappoint. Much time is taken to allow the characters to show their personalities, even a subtle nuance in a character allows us to make our own choices. Its choices that rule this game - every player has his or her way of playing. Drama is at its highest as we have come to expect from this series.The only gripe I have is the revised control system, which I didn't find that responsive and there were a few keys moments where I had to go back to complete the scene because of this. Some of the language used in one of the menus I don't think translates very well to a European English audience as it didn't give a clear outcome of what would happen when was pressed, again making me replay sections of the game. For me, this is a minor detail - that being said I think the season one controls were fine and didn't need a rehash.For anyone who has played the series this is a must - and if you haven't please start with season one! Well recommended.			"

												As good as last season so far.  Only real complaint I have is I wish the episodes were at least a bit longer, a complaint that I'm sure is not new.  However I'm not asking for a 20 hour marathon.  Actually I think 5-8 hours per episode would be fantastic.  The extra time spent on getting to know the characters would be worth it.  As it stands though it still does a great job.There's a slightly updated UI in place now.  It's more sleek and polished.  Quicktime events also make better use of the thumbstick now. The game is still as tense as ever in these moments.If you liked Season 1, you'll most likely get into this one as well.  As for people who didn't like Season 1, then this one won't be changing your mind either.			"

												An Interactive Story game, you mae choices that affect who survives and what happens throughout the story. Based off the Walking Dead comic books, it continues the story of Clementine after the original season ended. The game is a great game and I do reccomend it for anyone who likes interactive stories and the Walking Dead series. It's graphics try to emulate a comic book feeling, but I feel that it distacts from the drama and intensity of the game.			"

												So, one question you could possibly have on your mind is: how does this game stack up against it's predecessor? If you want the short version, they added/improved a lot of game mechanics, but the game only goes downhill from there. Keep reading if you want to know more.The UI and other mechanics have been enhanced slightly, you no longer have to walk everywhere as there is now ""fast-walking"" which can be used by holding down shift.  Selecting dialouge options is easier, as well as the various actions you can perform on characters, they changed it all to cursor based so you can click on each option independently, instead of having to use the mouse wheel. Quick reaction times also got some love, as now in some cases you need to use WASD to move out of the way, but I wouldn't consider this a breakthrough or anything special, I'm just putting it out there on the table.Now that we've gone through the good, here comes the bad...the actual story and episodes. I really liked the first 2 episodes, the first most of all but after those two, everything just started to seem...I don't know...off? I can't really describe it, maybe it's just because in the first season I felt like I had more freedom, and as I went through the episodes it was like my freedom to make certain choices and my ability to move around freely just seemed to be near diminished. The last episode seemed to be the worst in terms of choice making. Why couldn't I just shoot Arvo? I wanted him dead for the longest time. Why did I have to choose between shooting Kenny and Jane? Kenny proved he was unstable, so I ended up offing him, then it turns out Jane was being just as big of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as Kenny was? Just to prove her point that he was unstable?? I applaud telltale for making a series as complex as this, but I would seriously prefer it if they take their time with the next season. I was honestly surprised when Episode 5 released when it did, just one month after Episode 4, I expected it to take MUCH longer than that, and it probably should have.Anyhow, I will most likely be picking up Season 3, despite the slight dissapointment I obtained from playing this one. If Season 3 turns out to be very similar to this one, I don't think I'll be playing the series anymore. Do I still recommend the game? Yes, it's still an enjoyable title, it's just not as enjoyable and memorable as the first title. "

												The Walking Dead is the pinnacle of modern day point-and-click adventure games. Its strongpoint is its dynamic storytelling and character development, which are tailored to player choice, not unlike role-playing games. This game creates characters better than most others, they feel more alive than any other game due to how responsive they are to your dialogue choices. Combined with the intensity of the plot, The Walking Dead is one of the easiest games to connect to, rivaled only by some of Bioware's RPGs. It's a definite must-have for any gamer, no matter how experienced you are. The Walking Dead is an interactive story, much better than the television show, and it's a fine demonstration of how good and personal video game storytelling can be.			"

												Amazing, I recommend this to anyone and everyone who has an appreciation for fine storytelling. Think of it as a mix between a Heavy Rain, Sam and Max, and of course, The Walking Dead. In this game your choices actually matter, they have an impact on what the rest of your game will be like, which is not something you see everyday. The cell shaded art style gives it a unique comic book feel, wish makes it stick to it's roots from The Walking Dead comic, which is nice, sometimes it can draw you away from the experience but overall it doesn't matter. Asides a few technical bugs, like characters disappearing and re-appearing, there is nothing that extremely catches your attention. The characters though, damn, playing as Clementine and choosing sides (or being neutral) between different characters throughout the game builds more of a relationship, and brings you more in-depth with how people are affected by the apocalypse. This is great so far, you'll see when you play it for yourself. which you sure as hell should do.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a good game, but not as good as season 1. The story doesn't catch you as much as season 1 does.One funny fact: You don't need the save game file of season 1 at all. If you start playing season 2 the game searches for a save game file of season 1. If the game found it you have to chose the save game file. In season 1 I have 2 different save game files. On my 2nd walkthrough I always have chosen other answers, for example in my first walkthrough I let Lee slowly turning into a walker and on my 2nd walkthrough I shot him in the end. Now to the funny part: After having chosen your save game file, the season 2 game always shows (in a short way) what happened in season 1, ALWAYS showing Lee in the end slowly turning into a walker even if you may have shot him in the end. That is why you don't need season 1 and I do not know why the game searches for a season 1 save game file.And my second funny fact: Some answer options are absolutely unnessecary. An example: In the beginning of the game I answered Christa something about Omid when we were in the woods. It showed ""Christa will remember that"", but damn it, you don't see Christa in the entire game anymore, so where da **** will she remember it? There are several situations like that where it shows ""X/Y will remember it"", but 1 moment later the person is gone for the entire game or is dead 2 seconds later. Maybe some decisions are important for the future season, but as you don't need season 1 at all maybe you don't need season 2 at all for season 3 which would be really really bad because there are 5 possible endings in season 2. If season 3 starts randomly in a place where you shouldn't be because of the ending you have chosen, then it is an epic fail. :PAnyway, it's a nice game, has a nice setting, but doesn't catch you as season 1 did. I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead, loved season 1 and I had to buy season 2. It is still alright to play it, but season 1 was better. :) Still, those who played season 1 must buy this game. :)			"

												REVIEW OF EPISODE 1 + 2 ONLY! (ONLY ONES OUT AS OF NOW)I will update this in future.If you liked Season 1, you should buy this right away, if you never played Season 1 it's probably best you play Season 1 first since it's so great and has a great story that continues into this and your choices from that game affect this game.Episode 1 lasts like 1 Hour 40 Minutes. Episode 2 lasts about 2 Hours.The story continues from Season 1. Clementine, Omed and pregnent Christa are trying to survive.You play as the now 10 year old girl Clementine in a zombie (Refered to as Walkers/Lurkers) apocalyse.In a series of events, Clementine is parted from Omed and Christa and meets with a whole new group and a famillar face, this game is so tense and has to be the most amazing game I've ever played.The gameplay of this game is amazing and fits in very well with the cutscenes, during these cutscenes you choose what your character says and does and what you do Seriously affects the story, no crap just your own experience in the zombie apocalyse. The game outside these cutscenes takes the form of Point and Click, click on things, collect and click on more things but the game is so fun and the story is so interesting that this never gets boring.The game runs better, a lot of new gameplay feautures have been added and the graphics have been given an amazing update from last year.You HAVE to get this game if you played Season 1, don't end it there!Amazing so far and there's another 3 episodes still to come!

												I called the first season one of the most emotional games I've ever played. So, my standards for this one going in were extremely high. It was probably impossible to ever have met them. But it's not just that season two isn't as good as the first one. It's not very good at all.The problem I have with a lot of zombie fiction is how self-serious and forcibly edgy it can get. The Walking Dead show and comic suffer terribly from this at time, but the first season of the game managed to mostly avoid that. There was hope, there was humanity, but there was still that dark, ugly side that we all love the genre for. People died suddenly and terribly. It was sad. The characters were imperfect and divisive, but they felt human. Which made it all the harder to see them go.But this time around, it just seems like much of the cast is only there to die. They get a single personality trait, and then development gets tossed aside in favour of counting down the minutes until another one of them is torn apart or whatever. I'm sitting here trying to remember anything about some of them aside from how they died. There were plenty of shocking moments, but they came so often and without any weight to them that it hit that terrible, damning point overly bleak stuff like this can reach: I stopped caring. I was no longer worried about the cast (aside from Clem herself) and didn't care who lived or died anymore. There was no one to root for but her, and the plot seemed to be going absolutely nowhere aside from the group walking forward.One major character seemed to be written to be intentionally divisive. You'll know who I mean once you meet them. But the way it's done feels clumsy and irritating. Which is a problem when a huge amount of the drama unfolding centres around this one person. I was just exhausted listening to them speak by the end. That said, the season does have a really strong opening episode. It's harrowing and brutal and tense all throughout. Just like the rest of the season should have been. But after that, it becomes a parade of meaningless death without any real purpose. The first season had a goal, even if it wasn't a very good one, had a main character with a purpose, and it had a proper arc to the overall plot. But this one is just meandering for four episodes before they decide that's all, folks. Also disappointing: most of the cast introduced in the 400 days add-on for the first season is absent or irrelevant. That DLC had a lot of cool mini-stories that I would have liked to see developed more. One character does return full-time, but the rest are forgotten. I'm still a big fan of what Telltale is doing in their other stuff, and I don't have any technical or gameplay complaints to bring up. But I have to say they totally lost me here. It just felt like they didn't know where to go with things and the edge was just too strong to take this season seriously or invest myself emotionally. Which is probably good, because I don't think I could take being as devastated as last time all over again.			"

												I for one love The Walking Dead: Season 2. Definately worth the purchase! The storyline is definately the reason I keep coming back for more with beautifully developed individuals, personalities, situations, choices and plot progression. (( BEFORE YOU PURCHASE: It would be well worth your time and your money to BUY and PLAY the FIRST game before Season 2 . The choices you make in the first game carry on through to this game! - If you don't, the choices from the firstgame are generated randomly, so its worth buying the first for the emotional connection to the characters, the tough choices you made and seeing the direct consequences of those!))Alittle different to the first game, also a firm favourite game, in terms of the game interface, instead clicking on the option boxes rather than scrolling through the choices. A little odd to begin with but I found it extremely easy to click back into.The graphics are definately easy on the eye and again, my favourite artstyle in a game for a long time. (And it mirrors the Grahic Novels of The Walking Dead. Lets not bring up huge collection of artwork and books from the series that is threatening to cave in the floorboards of my room... haha...) The choices you make, the visuals and the audio is fantastic and credit must go to the entire developement team! Overal, I definately believe people must try this game! If you prefer games such as Call of Duty, Battlefeild or anything in that style in online multiplayer, then it may not be your go-to choice but if you are anything like myself you will like this game. If you love games with character, plot and consequences, this game is definately for you! The characters reach out and touch the sections of your soul that are usually reserved for close friends and family, especially when you have played the first game! I'm not one to demand, but go play this game! Haha! Till next time, Can't wait for Episode 3 to hit the store! ~Ree			"

												The Walking Dead series is by far one of the greatest game series there is out on the market. It such a casual game where your desions can shift the whole story, from deciding who to side with in a argument to who you will choose to save from a pack of walkers the game can play with your emotions from one click of a button. Most franchises argument over who has the better game  and make judgements through graphics, fast pace gameplay and shooting. Telltale says ""Screw it, we dont need any of that stuff the make a good game"" ill tell you that they do not disapoint, making it one of my most loved games.  If you have not purchased The Walking Dead series do IT NOW! YEP SEASON 1 & SEASON 2 HECK! THROW IN 400 DAYS DLC. JUST BUY THE GAME			"

												This game is absoluteley fantastic! I seriously recommend this too everyone that hasn't played this yet. The whole story is really wel thought through and especially the endings are all freaking heartbreaking. (''endings'' because the game can end in different ways. It depends on the choices you make through the game) All the characters are really interesting and not boring or anything. I never expected this, but this game became one of the best games i have ever played so far. Perfect! If you love the show of TWD and you love a good storyline then go play these two masterpieces!! Both games:10/10			"

												If you've made it to the second game, you probably already know this is hardly a game at all.  More like a choose-your-own-comic-game.  If for some reason you stumble on this review having never played Season One or Season Two, I recommend checking to see if this is even your thing.  With that out of the way...Season Two was even better than Season One, mainly because of the change of protagonist.  Not that there was anything wrong with Lee, but playing as an eleven-year-old girl is so much more interesting.  Clem is inherently and automatically so powerless in some situations, and yet incredibly powerful in ways you wouldn't expect.  That's one reason that makes this one of the more interesting narratives in all of gaming right now.  If... you call this gaming.I can't comment on the extent of the branching story, because I have and probably will only play this once for a long while.  However, I imagine it's probably a fair amount of illusion of choice going on.  Nonetheless, this is worth your time.			"

												Season 2 of The Walking Dead continues where you left off in episode one, this time from the prespective of Clementine. The interface is largely the same, with a little bit of modernization in terms of look and feel of the UI, and a stronger sense they are eschewing some of the more traditional puzzler mechanics in favor of storytelling.And that they do well. In the conclusion I found myself unconciously making choices not on what I thought my desired ""win state"" was, but instead what was the right way for The Walking Dead, and in so doing found a very satisifying emotional experience; one that made me think of what would happen to the characters as a result. Brilliant, emotional storytelling.			"

												This game will play with your emotions, I guarentee it. In the season 1, you play as an adult who would do everything to protect the last person he is caring about. Now, you play this last person, and it's worse than ever. Now, Clementine is 11, and her childhood is completely ruined by this ♥♥♥♥ed up world. By the choices you will make, you will get through anger, sadness, hesitation, and a lot more. The moments of hapiness are now as short as her hair. I don't know what to say about this game. This is a masterpiece of storytelling. And I want more. It's been 5 days now, and I can't get it out of my head.This game has destroyed me emotionally. "

Yeah, i kinda missed playing as Lee, but playing as Clementine and seeing how much she has matured from the first season is awesome, and it's awesome playing as her. This Season has as much tear jerking scenes as the first one, and if there isn't the same amount, then it is more tear jerking.In my Opinion, the Season started off a little bit slow, but every episode got better and better, then Episode 5 comes out and just blows me away. If you have not played the first season, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND playing it before this season, so you develop the relationship with Clementine and other Characters. Some Characters that are in the first season are back in this season, so prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for some tears.If you don't have this game, it is a must buy, even if you aren't a fan of the TV series, chances are you will still fall in the love with this game. This is a game about building relationships with the characters and storyline, if you just like running and gunning games like Call of Duty, then this game isn't for you, but if you do love storylines and building relationships with characters, then this game is for you.I'd give this game a perfect 10/10, the ending had me in more tears than the first one, and i can tell you,♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan in Episode 5. Last thing is last, if you read this full review, thank you for taking your time to read this entire thing, you are awesome.			"

You play as Clem an 11 year old girl who witnesses things no person should ever have to see.This game has a tendonsy for players to get very attached to some of the characters, this game also has a tallent to turn the story from a zombie horror game to a sob fest in a blink of an eye. (Moral of this.. dont get attached to  characters)The graphics are fun to look at and reminds you of a comic from your childhood. 9/10Very fun game. Highly recommended			"

												What I love about this series is how it's story captures me and places me in the situation of how I would actually react to this in real life. You have to consider long-term effects, morals, etc. of your group and decide what you think is best to survive. It is linear in the aspect of things will happen, no matter what choice you take, but it's who you take with you to the end that matters and what type of person you choose to be. There were quite a few heart-warming scenes, and a few that made me sick... but that a game can make me feel so much makes it worth the money. You don't get stories like these in games anymore.			"

												Season 2 of the Walking Dead starts off very well, episode 1 really got me in terms of emotions. I especially enjoyed episode 2, however later episodes get a little boring and repetitive. The final episode makes up for it though.The interactive parts have been nicely improved since the first season, but there's also much less exploration you can do. There are some tough decisions to be made and consequences to deal with, which really affect the story and leave you wondering if you made the right decision... as once again, people's lives depend on you.I really enjoyed playing this one, it might not be as truly amazing as season 1, but if you liked the first season, it's a must-play. Some games can really mess with your emotions, this is definitely one of those that you won't forget.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is an epic drama encapsulating the life of a little girl called Clementine. The game includes difficult choices that ultimately lead to dangerous consequences. However you play it, there will always be hard decisions that require a lot of attention.This incredible Telltale game carries on from the previous storyline of Season 1.I would definitely recommend the game to anyone who has played Season 1 and wants to give it a try,(however if you are thinking of getting Season 2 first, I wouldn't because the gameplay of Season 1 will ultimately affect this gameplay,) personally I bought it during a sale, when it was reduced to £4.99, and I feel as if this game should be worth £15.00 on steam instead of full price of £18.99, but that's just my opinion.There are 5 acts in this great game, however Act 1 and 2 didn't really impress me, the gameplay seemed slow and the decisions that needed to be made were relatively simple, and didn't come at a huge cost. However Acts 3, 4 and 5 were much better, with a better more adaptable storyline with more action and more difficult decisions.Personally I played this game quite passively and tried to stay out of combat too much, whilst trying to make friends with everyone and not get in their way, however I couldn't do this for the whole game as some decisions required me to choose 1 side.The improved gameplay from the first Season also made it stand out more and the Main Menu and UI was improved from the previous season.I finished the game within a week of buying it, and although it may be a short playtime, it makes up for in gameplay.Looking forward to Season 3 and hopefully it will be as good as the previous 2!!!Overall I give this game a 9.1/10!!!! The only fault of this game would be watching the credits after every Act, as it gets a bit repetitive! SPOILER ALERT: Lee will be met again sometime in this playthrough!!!  "

												My expectations were set extremely high for this game because of The Walking Dead season 1, Season 1 was my game of the year and easily makes it into my current top five games of all time.Telltale followed up their masterpiece with another work of art, a rich story driven game, beautiful visuals and once again; near impossible decisions. The walking dead season 2 is set just a little while after season 1, you play as Clementine in this survival story. Clementines character is really well developed and right from the get go you will feel strongly attached, especially after the events of season 1.This game is a must buy for anyone that has played season 1 and if you haven't played that then you should definitely add it to your wishlist.Overall Pros+Amazing story writing+Great voice acting+Thrilling and exciting+Beautiful visualsCons-Episodes still seem rather short			"

												Season 2 is not like Season 1. Let's get that out of the way now; the tone is much darker than the previous installment in the series, and much of this is due to the character whose eyes you see the world through. In Season 1, you play as Lee, a good man who made a huge mistake, who tries his best to protect his friends and, specifically, a little girl named Clementine. After an emotional roller coaster of a season, we have no idea who among the group survives, with the exception of Clementine, who has survived the ordeal of the finale to enter into a new and uncertain place. In Season 2, you ARE Clementine. During the whole of Season 2, you experience all the horrors of a world gone mad. However, there is no one to shield you from the darkness; despite still being a child, your Clementine has to experience the weight of adult decisions made in a nightmare world. Season 2 is at times visceral, nihilistic, and genuinely painful to get through, especially if you developed any sort of affinity towards Clementine in the prior season. You'll meet all sorts of engaging characters, both old and new, but you'll often watch as they are quickly and brutally snuffed out, just another casualty in this constantly expanding hell on earth. The quicktime events compliment the narrative action well, though they feel more frequent and more urgent, as protecting Clementine from zombies suddenly becomes a direct survival experience. Rather than seeking to save someone from life as a member of the undead in a way that was so common in Season 1, you're often trying to save yourself from death while managing the fates of others.Here's a brief spoiler: everybody dies. This game does a great job of hammering home the futility of life in this particular narrative world, both in the grand scheme of things and in the eyes of others, but it manages to make most deaths hit hard until it finally numbs you to the sensation of watching the life leave another character's eyes. By the end of Episode 5, I felt somewhat hollow and broken, as I was no longer able to trust my naturally altruistic intuition. During these episodes, you are betrayed, lied to, and ultimately left staring into the abyss as friends fall around you. I went from trusting the group, always following the altruistic path of the ""hero,"" to slowly descending into pure self-preservation, ignoring my previous instincts of group protection and ""doing the right thing"" for the sake of surviving. This season's story is well-told, and though it has some occasional weak points (Too many of the events seem overly emotional on the brink of pure manipulation, when a less heavy-handed approach might have done), it is a fantastic tale that will affect you in ways the good literature should. I highly recommend it in all the ways I would recommend a good book, as this is not a video game in a traditional sense. If you're looking for an affecting, well-written story that will make you consider both your place in the world and the true disposition of your heart, give this one a try.			"

												Review written after completing the game, I have also played the first game.I AM NOT GOING TO SPOIL ANYTHING.This game goes away from the first games exploration and puzzle solving decision making to a heavy focus on story and dialogue.Overall impression:During my playtrough I felt hindered by the designers, most of my time was spent with dialogue. Now there is nothing wrong with that, I enjoy Telltales way of making dialogue quite a lot but when the decision making left to the player is minimal and  has no large impact on how the story progresses you kind of feel bored with the actions the player can make in conversation.(Obviously there are big decisions but the majority of the game does not have the same feeling as conversation in the Walking Dead (1)).More depth:My biggest problem with The Walking Dead Season 2 is how ridiculously linear the levels are, there are not areas for you to explore there is only areas for you to press W until you reach the next queue for more dialogue. In The Walking Dead (the first game) you were more free to roam around and find mission objectives and you could decide to listen to your friends and get more mission objectives but obviously exposing yourself to more risk. That is what this game lacks, exploration and more variation on how to influence the world around you.Tl;dr:If you want to find out about what happens to Clementine then pick this game up. I just wish they had more exploration and more depth to the conversations. It does not feel like the first Walking Dead Game in my opinion but it is a good game non the less.8/10 and that is in comparison to 10/10 for The Walking Dead (1)			"

												tl;dr: generally okay season, but don't go into it expecting it to be as good as season 1.The season isn't even done yet, we still have one unreleased episode at the moment, but I still feel like I know enough to say that it probably will not be worth it. Season 2 does not live up to the impression Season 1 left on me, and, as a whole, I think I liked the season 2 cast more. But it doesn't matter, in the end. We complain about our choices not mattering in Season 1, because no matter what you do, everything converges onto one point by Episode 5 - Omid and Christa make it out of Savannah, and Lee sacrifices himself for Clementine. But never have I had so many of my choices invalidated in one episode than in Season 2. Having just played Episode 4 - nothing I did mattered that episode. None of my choices. Major characters dying without speaking lines, major characters dying in the most bogus ways possible, yet Telltale still tries to pass it off as shock factor.And at this point? It's not. I played Season 1, and I know it's the zombie apocalypse and that people are going to die. Maybe that's meta gaming, but it's going into the game knowing exactly what I bought. I bought the game for the cast I knew I'd eventually come to love. The cast I knew I was going to die, but I knew I'd do my best to keep them alive. The cast I wanted to get to know, the stories of the survivors I wanted to hear. We get... almost none of that, here. In Episode 4, we get more about one character's backstory (whom we met in the previous episode) shoehorned into 90 minutes of gameplay than we have any of the other characters we've spent the rest of the season with. Only for that character to bow out, because she 'doesn't want to see Clem fall.' Ridiculous.The writing is good, when it wants to be. When it needs to be, it falls flat. Characters completely change their personalities between episodes without us knowing why or seeing how - because they're off screen 75% of the time. There are significantly less hubs in Season 2 than there were in Season 1, meaning you barely get to talk to these characters when they are on screen. And when you do get to talk to them, you get one line, one subject, then it's done. But yeah, the story is still as emotional, but now I don't know if I'm crying at a character's death because I'm genuinely sad they're dead - or because I'm disappointed at the loss of potential.At the time of this review, the day of Episode 4's release, I can say I'm not excited for Episode 5 at all. Let it come, let me cry, let it be over.			"

Some stuff felt like it would happen no matter what you did.That being said the characters are still great, story is still intense and its an overrall great game.They seem to fixed my biggest problem the the first season, choosing to save one character when the character you chose to save would die very soon anyway!Really great continuation			"

												A little bit shorter than the first season, but packs an equally powerful emotional punch.It's common knowledge by now that Telltale has never been known for explosive or exciting gameplay, but that's hardly ever been the point. When you find yourself as deeply engrossed in a game's plot as this, things like ""pulling off awesome headshots"" or ""badass stealth kills"" fall by the wayside. The Walking Dead games I feel I can safely recommend to anyone with heart and an appreciation for good storytelling (which, should really be everyone). I myself, have never cared for TWD TV series, nor have I read the comics, and I can't really say I'm a point-and-click gamer, but I have nonetheless been enjoying the $h!t out of this series.			"

But I suppose thats not too unrealistic judging the world this game is set in. World gets darker and more hopeless people get darker and more selfish.It is a pretty good game though.  Choices arent easily made. Theres just one point I`d like to point out. Youre playing a adult in a 11 year old body. Clem isn`t really a child. Not anymore. Thats not nessesarily criticism i just kinda wanted to say it. I mean I got no idea how it would be to grow up in the apocalypse. So I suppose her beeing grown up in this season isn`t too bad.			"

												Like all Telltale reviews, by now you should know what you're getting. It's a playable story with limited decisions that you play for the story and good voice acting. So what's up with TWD Season 2? It's good. Not quite as good as Season 1, TWD2 is still a worthy title. I don't think you can call this game ""fun"". After all, the choices are depressing. Your ability to actually change things is exceptionally limited. It's more of an interactive story than a game. Still, I find this series compelling to play and the narrative gripping. Clem is one of my most favorite characters in all my gaming years (stretching back to Pong). The voice acting continues to be a major strength of the series. I found Season 2's quality more variable than Season 1. There were far more gut-punches in #1, far more difficult decisions in #1 than in this season. Still, this has it's moments. But frankly perhaps the biggest flaw is that there are too many characters that you don't really get to know them. They seem - and often are - expendible whereas in Season #1 the group was tighter and better fleshed out.If you haven't played Season 1, get that first. But these titles are really worth your time because they tell such great stories.			"

												SPOILERSShort Version: An exceedingly good game let down by a couple of tiny gripes for me. The characters aren't as accessible, and the story moves too fast, taking the grim, tense slog out of the post-apocalyptic world. The Walking Dead Game: Season Two was a game I awaiting with my teeth buried into my knuckles in anticipation, staring at the calendar for each episode of the five-part season. Prior to playing I had some serious fears for the game, not least that it was following The Walking Dead Game: Season One, which was most probably my favourite game of 2012, so well done Telltale for that. Suffice it to say therefore that Season Two had some huge booties to fill. For me there are two things that prevent Season Two from achieving this. One is something that I can explain myself to an extent, but it nevertheless does bite at my immersion-loving ankles, the other is perhaps the most surprising qualm I've ever had with a game. Enough build up. Problem one. One of my favourite aspects of Season One was having a wealth of moments where your entire group was sat milling around by a broken-down train, or hiding out in a drug store. As Lee you could seize these moments of tranquillity and have a chat with all of your companions. Not only was there ample supply of these moments, but the conversations themselves were full of options so you could get to know your fellow man/woman/child/Ben. Having long, character defining conversations, where each character could say something to entirely change how you see them, for better or worse was one of the most engrossing things about Season One for me. It made each moment with them matter. They could reveal themselves to be a closet racist, or a snobbish elitist at heart, or they could show a depth of empathy and caring you'd not expected from them and never would have. However, in Season Two, these conversation moments are whittled down, instead with a heavier focus on story (more on that later). While this could not necessarily be a bad thing (more story, more value for money etc) it means that I never felt much for any of the characters. While every death in Season One struck me in some way, characters came and went in Season Two like cars on a motorway. At some points I barely had time to remember their names and 'poof', they were dead or split off or otherwise departed. This meant that even as far as Episode Five people could die and my reaction was the same as if I'd just watched them scratch their chin. Given that by the timescale of Season Two, the zombie apocalypse has been cracking on for a good year and then some, so perhaps this less talkative batch of people works; everyone's realised that getting to know people well isn't a worthwhile investment. But it still makes the game feel shallow to me (by comparison with Season One, it's still gloriously rich compared with most, don't get me wrong).That's problem that I can explain myself. Problem two though is a baffler. Due to the lack of slow, conversational moments to regulate the pace of the story, Season Two barrels through what I could have happily seen spread over Season Two and Three really. Yup, too much plot! So much happens in such a short space of play-time that, even though your character has gone through more ordeals than you can shake a dismembered limb at, I still felt cheated at the end. I finished the finale (which is a gloriously heart-breaking set of decisions that caused me a have a very restless night's sleep, so applause for you again Telltale, I'd ruffle your hair were you here), and looking back over the game, felt like I'd played the Cliff Notes version of the story, rather than the full text. There was so much potential for character development and building some horrific tension and decision-making into Carver's community. I'd happily have stayed there and let characters evolve and come to terms/blows with the situation a lot more. But the story seemed to feel the need to charge headlong onwards. Exploring Carver's world could have been fantastic, but it's gone now. Shame. My main gripe story wise was that it became suddenly very linear. I saw an opportunity with Carver in Episode Three. My Clementine was by that point a cold, logical, unshakable zombie/bandit annihilation machine, and I saw the opportunity to stick with Carver. You want to survive, you join the winning side. To hell with the broken people you started out with. Life is for those who can keep it. But I was funnelled into making a decision I didn't particularly want to make, and this probably soured much of Episode Four for me. However those are just two small(ish) issues that, because I'm a whiny git, I'm blowing out of proportion. The Walking Dead Game: Season Two is a fantastically made game, which slicker graphics, faster paced action and drama, and the same tough decisions, which ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT on the outcome this time. I'm perhaps overly critical on what I'd consider issues that spoilt what would have definitely been my favourite game of 2014. If it had stayed a little truer to Season One, with a batch of characters I could get to know, it would have been a marvel of just how phenomenal a game could be. Instead, it's just very, very good. Given what it could have been, being an 8/9 out of 10 game is somehow a disappointment.  "

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING BUY IT NOW!!!The story is beautiful!!!! This game will make you want to play it to the end from the start. Its like the show in some ways but a different person with a different story. A better story I think. Make the choises you would make and say what you would say and the ending will be satisfying and be what you want it to be. I recomend this game to anyone who likes TWD.			"

												Taking off where the Season One left, Season Two lets you control Clementine, the adorable little girl you have fiercely tried to protect in the previous season. While the world stil lies in ruins and zombies are creeping at every corner, Clementine will struggle against the odds while wandering the wilderness, encountering new characters and making new bonds with them through an epic storyline. Controlling Clementine drastically alters the combat mechanics, while you will try to escape the fight or use the environment to better against the odds. Immerse story, skillfully written dialogue and an adorable but sturdy protagonist will make yourself lost in the atmosphere of a dark and desperate world.			"

												in The walking dead season 2 we played as Clementine.Clementine is now eleven years old and one of the most badass female character for her age.What i like about this game is the way telltale connect the walking dead season one story with this one with such detail.i mean..... when Lee said a word in season one it can affect the season 2. it's just amazing how they keep that detail.The walking dead season 2 is pretty much like the first season.I feel like that this season's episode is shorter and we can't interact much with the environment.but still...... the story is great as usual by telltale and the character development. And as usual.... i care so much about the characters in this kind of game.Like i said in my review on season one.... this is not a first person shooter zombie game or that kind of thing. This is a point and click episodic game. some of you who doesn't like this kind of game might find this game to be boring. But i said this game is AWESOME10/10 for me			"

												A little bit shorter than the first season, but packs an equally powerful emotional punch.It's common knowledge by now that Telltale has never been known for explosive or exciting gameplay, but that's hardly ever been the point. When you find yourself as deeply engrossed in a game's plot as this, things like ""pulling off awesome headshots"" or ""badass stealth kills"" fall by the wayside. The Walking Dead games I feel I can safely recommend to anyone with heart and an appreciation for good storytelling (which, should really be everyone). I myself, have never cared for TWD TV series, nor have I read the comics, and I can't really say I'm a point-and-click gamer, but I have nonetheless been enjoying the $h!t out of this series.			"

If for some reason you stumble on this review having never played Season One or Season Two, I recommend checking to see if this is even your thing.  With that out of the way...Season Two was even better than Season One, mainly because of the change of protagonist.  Not that there was anything wrong with Lee, but playing as an eleven-year-old girl is so much more interesting.  Clem is inherently and automatically so powerless in some situations, and yet incredibly powerful in ways you wouldn't expect.  That's one reason that makes this one of the more interesting narratives in all of gaming right now.  If... you call this gaming.I can't comment on the extent of the branching story, because I have and probably will only play this once for a long while.

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is an epic drama encapsulating the life of a little girl called Clementine. The game includes difficult choices that ultimately lead to dangerous consequences. However you play it, there will always be hard decisions that require a lot of attention.This incredible Telltale game carries on from the previous storyline of Season 1.I would definitely recommend the game to anyone who has played Season 1 and wants to give it a try,(however if you are thinking of getting Season 2 first, I wouldn't because the gameplay of Season 1 will ultimately affect this gameplay,) personally I bought it during a sale, when it was reduced to £4.99, and I feel as if this game should be worth £15.00 on steam instead of full price of £18.99, but that's just my opinion.There are 5 acts in this great game, however Act 1 and 2 didn't really impress me, the gameplay seemed slow and the decisions that needed to be made were relatively simple, and didn't come at a huge cost.

												Season 2 of the Walking Dead starts off very well, episode 1 really got me in terms of emotions. I especially enjoyed episode 2, however later episodes get a little boring and repetitive. The final episode makes up for it though.The interactive parts have been nicely improved since the first season, but there's also much less exploration you can do. There are some tough decisions to be made and consequences to deal with, which really affect the story and leave you wondering if you made the right decision... as once again, people's lives depend on you.I really enjoyed playing this one, it might not be as truly amazing as season 1, but if you liked the first season, it's a must-play. Some games can really mess with your emotions, this is definitely one of those that you won't forget.			"

It is linear in the aspect of things will happen, no matter what choice you take, but it's who you take with you to the end that matters and what type of person you choose to be.

												Season 2 of The Walking Dead continues where you left off in episode one, this time from the prespective of Clementine. The interface is largely the same, with a little bit of modernization in terms of look and feel of the UI, and a stronger sense they are eschewing some of the more traditional puzzler mechanics in favor of storytelling.And that they do well. In the conclusion I found myself unconciously making choices not on what I thought my desired ""win state"" was, but instead what was the right way for The Walking Dead, and in so doing found a very satisifying emotional experience; one that made me think of what would happen to the characters as a result. Brilliant, emotional storytelling.			"

Now, you play this last person, and it's worse than ever. Now, Clementine is 11, and her childhood is completely ruined by this ♥♥♥♥ed up world. By the choices you will make, you will get through anger, sadness, hesitation, and a lot more. The moments of hapiness are now as short as her hair. I don't know what to say about this game.

												tl;dr: generally okay season, but don't go into it expecting it to be as good as season 1.The season isn't even done yet, we still have one unreleased episode at the moment, but I still feel like I know enough to say that it probably will not be worth it. Season 2 does not live up to the impression Season 1 left on me, and, as a whole, I think I liked the season 2 cast more. But it doesn't matter, in the end. We complain about our choices not mattering in Season 1, because no matter what you do, everything converges onto one point by Episode 5 - Omid and Christa make it out of Savannah, and Lee sacrifices himself for Clementine. But never have I had so many of my choices invalidated in one episode than in Season 2. Having just played Episode 4 - nothing I did mattered that episode. None of my choices. Major characters dying without speaking lines, major characters dying in the most bogus ways possible, yet Telltale still tries to pass it off as shock factor.And at this point? It's not. I played Season 1, and I know it's the zombie apocalypse and that people are going to die. Maybe that's meta gaming, but it's going into the game knowing exactly what I bought. I bought the game for the cast I knew I'd eventually come to love. The cast I knew I was going to die, but I knew I'd do my best to keep them alive. The cast I wanted to get to know, the stories of the survivors I wanted to hear. We get... almost none of that, here. In Episode 4, we get more about one character's backstory (whom we met in the previous episode) shoehorned into 90 minutes of gameplay than we have any of the other characters we've spent the rest of the season with. Only for that character to bow out, because she 'doesn't want to see Clem fall.' Ridiculous.The writing is good, when it wants to be. When it needs to be, it falls flat. Characters completely change their personalities between episodes without us knowing why or seeing how - because they're off screen 75% of the time. There are significantly less hubs in Season 2 than there were in Season 1, meaning you barely get to talk to these characters when they are on screen. And when you do get to talk to them, you get one line, one subject, then it's done. But yeah, the story is still as emotional, but now I don't know if I'm crying at a character's death because I'm genuinely sad they're dead - or because I'm disappointed at the loss of potential.At the time of this review, the day of Episode 4's release, I can say I'm not excited for Episode 5 at all. Let it come, let me cry, let it be over.			"

												SPOILERSShort Version: An exceedingly good game let down by a couple of tiny gripes for me. The characters aren't as accessible, and the story moves too fast, taking the grim, tense slog out of the post-apocalyptic world. The Walking Dead Game: Season Two was a game I awaiting with my teeth buried into my knuckles in anticipation, staring at the calendar for each episode of the five-part season. Prior to playing I had some serious fears for the game, not least that it was following The Walking Dead Game: Season One, which was most probably my favourite game of 2012, so well done Telltale for that. Suffice it to say therefore that Season Two had some huge booties to fill. For me there are two things that prevent Season Two from achieving this. One is something that I can explain myself to an extent, but it nevertheless does bite at my immersion-loving ankles, the other is perhaps the most surprising qualm I've ever had with a game. Enough build up. Problem one. One of my favourite aspects of Season One was having a wealth of moments where your entire group was sat milling around by a broken-down train, or hiding out in a drug store. As Lee you could seize these moments of tranquillity and have a chat with all of your companions. Not only was there ample supply of these moments, but the conversations themselves were full of options so you could get to know your fellow man/woman/child/Ben. Having long, character defining conversations, where each character could say something to entirely change how you see them, for better or worse was one of the most engrossing things about Season One for me. It made each moment with them matter. They could reveal themselves to be a closet racist, or a snobbish elitist at heart, or they could show a depth of empathy and caring you'd not expected from them and never would have. However, in Season Two, these conversation moments are whittled down, instead with a heavier focus on story (more on that later). While this could not necessarily be a bad thing (more story, more value for money etc) it means that I never felt much for any of the characters. While every death in Season One struck me in some way, characters came and went in Season Two like cars on a motorway. At some points I barely had time to remember their names and 'poof', they were dead or split off or otherwise departed. This meant that even as far as Episode Five people could die and my reaction was the same as if I'd just watched them scratch their chin. Given that by the timescale of Season Two, the zombie apocalypse has been cracking on for a good year and then some, so perhaps this less talkative batch of people works; everyone's realised that getting to know people well isn't a worthwhile investment. But it still makes the game feel shallow to me (by comparison with Season One, it's still gloriously rich compared with most, don't get me wrong).That's problem that I can explain myself. Problem two though is a baffler. Due to the lack of slow, conversational moments to regulate the pace of the story, Season Two barrels through what I could have happily seen spread over Season Two and Three really. Yup, too much plot! So much happens in such a short space of play-time that, even though your character has gone through more ordeals than you can shake a dismembered limb at, I still felt cheated at the end. I finished the finale (which is a gloriously heart-breaking set of decisions that caused me a have a very restless night's sleep, so applause for you again Telltale, I'd ruffle your hair were you here), and looking back over the game, felt like I'd played the Cliff Notes version of the story, rather than the full text. There was so much potential for character development and building some horrific tension and decision-making into Carver's community. I'd happily have stayed there and let characters evolve and come to terms/blows with the situation a lot more. But the story seemed to feel the need to charge headlong onwards. Exploring Carver's world could have been fantastic, but it's gone now. Shame. My main gripe story wise was that it became suddenly very linear. I saw an opportunity with Carver in Episode Three. My Clementine was by that point a cold, logical, unshakable zombie/bandit annihilation machine, and I saw the opportunity to stick with Carver. You want to survive, you join the winning side. To hell with the broken people you started out with. Life is for those who can keep it. But I was funnelled into making a decision I didn't particularly want to make, and this probably soured much of Episode Four for me. However those are just two small(ish) issues that, because I'm a whiny git, I'm blowing out of proportion. The Walking Dead Game: Season Two is a fantastically made game, which slicker graphics, faster paced action and drama, and the same tough decisions, which ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT on the outcome this time. I'm perhaps overly critical on what I'd consider issues that spoilt what would have definitely been my favourite game of 2014. If it had stayed a little truer to Season One, with a batch of characters I could get to know, it would have been a marvel of just how phenomenal a game could be. Instead, it's just very, very good. Given what it could have been, being an 8/9 out of 10 game is somehow a disappointment.  "

												Season 2 is not like Season 1. Let's get that out of the way now; the tone is much darker than the previous installment in the series, and much of this is due to the character whose eyes you see the world through. In Season 1, you play as Lee, a good man who made a huge mistake, who tries his best to protect his friends and, specifically, a little girl named Clementine. After an emotional roller coaster of a season, we have no idea who among the group survives, with the exception of Clementine, who has survived the ordeal of the finale to enter into a new and uncertain place. In Season 2, you ARE Clementine. During the whole of Season 2, you experience all the horrors of a world gone mad. However, there is no one to shield you from the darkness; despite still being a child, your Clementine has to experience the weight of adult decisions made in a nightmare world. Season 2 is at times visceral, nihilistic, and genuinely painful to get through, especially if you developed any sort of affinity towards Clementine in the prior season. You'll meet all sorts of engaging characters, both old and new, but you'll often watch as they are quickly and brutally snuffed out, just another casualty in this constantly expanding hell on earth. The quicktime events compliment the narrative action well, though they feel more frequent and more urgent, as protecting Clementine from zombies suddenly becomes a direct survival experience. Rather than seeking to save someone from life as a member of the undead in a way that was so common in Season 1, you're often trying to save yourself from death while managing the fates of others.Here's a brief spoiler: everybody dies. This game does a great job of hammering home the futility of life in this particular narrative world, both in the grand scheme of things and in the eyes of others, but it manages to make most deaths hit hard until it finally numbs you to the sensation of watching the life leave another character's eyes. By the end of Episode 5, I felt somewhat hollow and broken, as I was no longer able to trust my naturally altruistic intuition. During these episodes, you are betrayed, lied to, and ultimately left staring into the abyss as friends fall around you. I went from trusting the group, always following the altruistic path of the ""hero,"" to slowly descending into pure self-preservation, ignoring my previous instincts of group protection and ""doing the right thing"" for the sake of surviving. This season's story is well-told, and though it has some occasional weak points (Too many of the events seem overly emotional on the brink of pure manipulation, when a less heavy-handed approach might have done), it is a fantastic tale that will affect you in ways the good literature should. I highly recommend it in all the ways I would recommend a good book, as this is not a video game in a traditional sense. If you're looking for an affecting, well-written story that will make you consider both your place in the world and the true disposition of your heart, give this one a try.			"

												Once again telltale have done an outstanding job! The Walking dead season 2 follows the survival of Clementine shortly after the end of Season 1. The story continues, the choices , prehaps mistakes you have made follow you to season two.  Game once again makes you come across very hard and very often emotional choices that in the result the story changes.  I have honestly thought that telltale wouldn't pull it off the change of the main character from being Lee and then playing as Clementine but they managed to creative an amazing adventure that once again will make you really emotional.  This game deserves easy 10/10.			"

Telltale did not disappoint in continuing the engaging emotional story they brought with the first season of The Walking Dead. The emotion is unparalleled, and left me with many feelings like before. It introduced many new characters, and delivered unexpected outcomes. The voice acting and soundtrack remain extraordinary. While I miss playing as an adult and being taken seriously by the individuals within the story, playing as Clementine brought diversity to the gameplay and allowed the players to dive deep into her perspective. Thank you once more Telltale, for this beauty. 9.6/10.0 "

												Taking off where the Season One left, Season Two lets you control Clementine, the adorable little girl you have fiercely tried to protect in the previous season. While the world stil lies in ruins and zombies are creeping at every corner, Clementine will struggle against the odds while wandering the wilderness, encountering new characters and making new bonds with them through an epic storyline. Controlling Clementine drastically alters the combat mechanics, while you will try to escape the fight or use the environment to better against the odds. Immerse story, skillfully written dialogue and an adorable but sturdy protagonist will make yourself lost in the atmosphere of a dark and desperate world.			"

												Usually not a fan or sequal games, as I feel they either deviated too far from the last game, or didn't change enough. Walking Dead so far does a good job of continuing from season 1 and still makes me feel like it's a different game by putting me in the shoes of Clementine instead of the Lee. The Story line doesn't have a linear path which I feel fits the chaotic zombie apocolypse feel. I feel it's a little strange and hard to believe how much faith a group of grown people put in the choices of a 10 year old girl in such a chaotic time however, but would still give this game a solid 8 out of 10.

												Telltale comes back with the second season of The Walking Dead and it does not disappoint! This season focuses on Clementine and how much she has grown up since the events of season one. She has witnessed some truly horrific events and it has changed her as a person. She is no longer the sweet little girl from the first season. She is willing to do whatever it takes to keep her and her loved ones alive. You meet a lot of new characters that you aren't sure if you will care about them or not. But as you get farther in, you get to know the characters better and you either fall in love with them or hate them. You still choose how the story plays off and some decisions will affect you in later on episodes. There were some very crucial decisions that I don't know if I could even make if I were in Clementine's shoes. Once again the writing and acting is top notch and never failed to entertain me. I was at tears at the end of the last episode and thought the ending had as much as a powerful impact as the first season did. There was a even a moment that made me cringe and it made it even better because it showed how hard it is to do things on your own. One thing I would take off for this season would be that I felt that some of the characters were wasted. I felt that they had more potential/development but suddenly they were just dead. Also, for most things when you make a decision, you basically get the same result if you were to make a different choice. But overall, The Walking Dead Season Two was an awesome experience and I will play it again sometime soon. If you still haven't bought this game, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this really long review and buy it! 8.6/10+ Clementine's Story is amazing.+ Crucial decisions leave you thinking.+ Writing and acting is excellent.+ Has a very high emotional impact.+ Masterful last episode.- Some characters were wasted.- Diverse choices lead to same results.

												Before you think about buying this game, I strongly recommend that you buy and play Season One of Telltales The Walking Dead. It is necessary in my opinion. Not only will it help you understand the tone of the game, but it will help you understand who the main protagonist in this game is. TL;DR at the end. Spoilers are marked in  These.	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Let me just get this out of the way. No. This game's story is not as good as Season 1. That said, it is hard to beat perfeciton. The story in this game is probably a 9/10, compared to the 10/10 that was S1. You play as Clemintine. Just like the first game, you come across survivors. In the beginning you can see that this group is not as strong as Season 1's group. Thats not me saying these characters are awful. What I am saying is that they are more of a broken group. They may be together, but they each have their own opinion on how to handle things. It is up to you to help guide them along this journey. One of the reasons most people tend to not fancy this season is because of its tonal change. Sure its still about surviving, but its more stressful and less light hearted. For me, that makes sense. The first season was about couping with the way the world has changed and dealing with walkers. In this season, walkers are still an issue, but humans are becoming a real threat. You are always second guessing a new face. Are they friendly? Can we trust them? Should we rob them? This season starts with Clemintine  a few months following the death of Lee.	 You are with two survivors in the beginning  Christa and Omid from Season 1.	 That changes pretty quick though  They don't make it.	 Then you find a new group that you stay with throughout the whole season. I will list some pros and cons from this season of Telltales The Walking Dead.Here are the pros:1.) Clemintine is a great character.2.) The group of survivors are an enjoyble group.3.) The decisions you make matter.4.) Each episode takes place in a new and dangerous setting.5.) Multiple endings.6.) Spoiler  Dream sequence with Lee.	7.) Spoiler  Re-unite with a survivor from Season 1.	8.) Episodes do not drag out as long as some in the first season.9.) Improvements to the controls in this game.10.) Little to not frame rate drops. ( I only experienced one.)Here are the cons:1.) Sarah plz.2.) Some outcomes should have a middle solution.  You should be able to take some of the medicine from Arvo.	3.) Somethings are left unanswered.  Like why was Arvo putting medicince in a trash can? Damn it Arvo!	4.) The last 1/5 of Episode 4 has an intersting conclusion.  Why are the Russians in America? Arvo plz!	5.) Some of the animation is off. Final Thoughts:This is a great game. Its story is darker and more violent than season one, but the characters are still entertaining. The decisions that you make have consequences. The ending to this game is not as black and white as it was in Season 1. SPOILER FOR SEASON 1:  The man who captured Clemintine is a monster. Lee dies no matter what. You must protect/save Clemintine from him.	  The game has a clear good ending though.  It's when you let the Season 1 character kill the Season 2 character. You join them to find the safe place. Then you leave with the Season 1 character.	  It is a huge build up to the ending though. Lots of drama in this game. If you played and enjoyed Season 1, than Season 2 is right for you. If you have never played a Telltale game, then I recommend that you buy Season 1 of Telltales The Walking Dead. It is worth it, and then buy this season. If you did not like Season 1, then  you must hate quality story telling	 this game may not be for you.TL;DR:This is a great game, and a great sequal to an amazing game. It is not the 10/10 that Season 1 is, but its a 9.2/10 at the least. Has a great story, great characters, improved controls, more action, and more walkers. Highly recommended.*Stare back			"

												Like all Telltale reviews, by now you should know what you're getting. It's a playable story with limited decisions that you play for the story and good voice acting. So what's up with TWD Season 2? It's good. Not quite as good as Season 1, TWD2 is still a worthy title. I don't think you can call this game ""fun"". After all, the choices are depressing. Your ability to actually change things is exceptionally limited. It's more of an interactive story than a game. Still, I find this series compelling to play and the narrative gripping. Clem is one of my most favorite characters in all my gaming years (stretching back to Pong). The voice acting continues to be a major strength of the series. I found Season 2's quality more variable than Season 1. There were far more gut-punches in #1, far more difficult decisions in #1 than in this season. Still, this has it's moments. But frankly perhaps the biggest flaw is that there are too many characters that you don't really get to know them. They seem - and often are - expendible whereas in Season #1 the group was tighter and better fleshed out.If you haven't played Season 1, get that first. But these titles are really worth your time because they tell such great stories.			"

												Played as a child with a messed up childhood, just like me.Pros-Awesome unique gameplay-Awesome Protagonist -Character development for everyone in the game-Intense Actions Squences and Quick Time Events-Unique and cool graphics-Characters connect together well/not so well-Foreshadowing-Good DialogueCons-Its painful waiting for each episode since each ends with a hook/cliffhanger-It's painful to watch characters die, every character's death is painful even the clumsy and stupid ones. -May experience a few bugs, I experience noneThis game can make you happy, sad, angry, emotional and even cry, Get this game people the price doesn't matter its the experience that counts. Only 1 question I want to ask, Where is the next episode?EDIT: The Final Episode was released and I played it ( a few weeks ago) and now its time to give my final rating.Rating: MUST BUY!!!, its basically like $5 per episodeFinal Verdict 10/10 This game made many gamer around feel their inner emotions and successly made us attach to the characters either by hate (Carver) or love (Kenny).

												I need to start with the statement that Season Two is still good. However, it's pretty far from the brilliance of Season One. Clem works well as a protagonist and will like to help shape her as she is growing older. However, the dynamic narrative that worked so well between Lee and Clem in the first season is lacking and never made up for.The basic problem of the season is the lack of purpose. You don't have a major goal really at any time, you don't feel like there's a natural flow and so all the little events, personal drama, human loss and so on end up feeling meaningless. The other characters are either unbelievable (so stupid?) or just never fully developed before they disappear and this is in big contrast to Season 1.So as I said, It's definitely worth playing but not nearly as good as the first (7/10).

												What can I say....I was so excited to play Season Two and to find out how Clementine had been surviving after Lee and I wasn't dissapointed. I LOVED IT! It felt like I was given more choices to decide the play of the game and that was perfect! The music helped create the ideal mood for each scene, at times I was more afraid to continue because of the music and not what was playing on screen. It was nice that Kenny was back and I liked the new cast as well. I can't go into details because of spoilers sweeties but I will say I did curse the game and my computer more than once over things that happen and were going to happen regardless of my choices. I would definitely recomend this game to anyone. I am not the gamer expert in my family and I was and still am excited about the entire Walking Dead Series at this point.			"

One of my favorite games. I'll probably end up putting as many hours into this as I did Season 1.[SPOILER ALERT]PROS-+ Another amazing story.+ Story follows Season 1 pretty great.+ I became emotionally attached to more characters.+ Kenny ♥+ Choices from Season 1 are coming back in Season 2.+ Characters will die or live based on your choices.+ I cried again.CONS-- Way too many possible endings: Clementine can be on her own with A.J. She could have left Jane alive but left her. She could have killed both Kenny and Jane and thus being alone with A.J. Clementine can be with Jane and A.J. at Carver's camp and they can let the family stay. Clementine can be with Jane and A.J. at Carver's camp and turn the family away. Clementine can be with Kenny and A.J. after refusing to stay at Wellington. Clementine can be at Wellington with A.J. after leaving Kenny behind.   There's just too much to make a good continuation that flows well into the next (possible) season.9.5/10 - Would Cry With All Endings "

												If you like great story telling this game is for you. Clemintine (MAIN) is trapped in a Zombie apocalypse and must make hard/difficult choices to live, from letting people die to leaving them. Personally I like this game because of the story telling and how they have put this game together. I noticed some minor bugs but nothing that would turn me away from this game, since it's mostly about the story.They have a very good feature where you can chose to be nice rude or neutral  in a conversation or to stand out and voice your opinion.Thing's I loved about the game are they really make you get attached to characters and when/if they die (Some choices need to be made) they really feel liek someone you knew in real life died. (If you played the First season (WHICH YOU BLODDY WELL SHOULD BEFORE PLAYING THIS SEASON) you will know what I mean by getting attached to characters.) "

												The Walking Dead: Season 2StoryThe story is very much the same one as the First Season, survive the zombie apocalypse but this time a crazy psycho called Carver will take you from safety and put you into his camp where you will attempt to escape from and find out that you and this mad man are quite alike, the other episodes are all about surviving and dealing with certain situations that you get yourself into. The new characters are not as likable as the Season 1 cast but this will make you have a harder time to decide who dies and who doesn't which makes more sense but this makes you think why do I care if Sarita dies for instance which is a little annoying but also better for the player when they have to make a tough decision. I have to say the episodes of best to worst go in this order.Episode 3: In Harms WayEpisode 5: No Going BackEpisode 2: A House DividedEpisode 1: All That RemainsEpisode 4: Amid The Ruinsbtw this is my personal opinion.GameplayThe Gameplay is again a point and click adventure game but replacing the puzzles that took a long chunk out of the episodes with QTEs (Quick Time Events) which are done rather well they are definitely better than Season 1s.GraphicsThe Graphics are slightly better than Season 1 and have had a slightly more realistic look to the environment instead of the comic book style from the first season of The Walking Dead.Final VerdictI think that on a technical basis this is better than its predecesor but from a perspective of the story I think the first season has more shockers than this one.The Walking Dead: Season 28/10btw can't wait for Season 3 of this amazing game series.

												Well, here i go, perhaps no one will read this, but I feel like I owne it to the game.   Things you MUST DO is to play TWD Season 1, you'll expereince why and please, make the choices as they were your own, as if you were Clementine or Lee. Now, lets go deep into the subject. In TWD season 1 you play as Lee, but what you don't realize is that you ARE Lee, Lee's choices are your choices. They reveal what kind of moral status you have, what kind of person you are. Your stablished duty is to raise and protect Clementine, but this isn't the main objective of the game; its the way how you are going to do this. At the end, after having met a lot of people, having friendships, having enemies, chosing the fate of some people, you will notice which kind of human being are you, and if you played as the moral guys we all are, you will be proud and happy for Lee, yourself, or dissapointed, to then change you view life   Now, TWD season 2. Gosh, this will make you feel stuff. You are now Clementine, no objective more than surviving. This is where you get to know you as a human. Lying to survive or telling the truth?, robbing or giving?, helping the weak or to guard for the group and your future? After this and having finished the game, you'll understand what are you, no bad or good choices; just you. It's a continuous martyring to get to know your kid (innocent/ corruptible side and adult (leader/paternal role) point of view of life and it's development through the game.     The characters, the music, the ambient and the situations will make you feel hate, empathy, compassion, fear and happines. 100% you will cry, but let it go, don't hold it, it's a good cathartic situation and you'll feel great   Just buy it, you won't regret, I swear it.

												While in the last game, we played as Lee, an intelligent, strong, adult male, this time, the playable character is Clementine, the young girl who we spent a large part of the last season protecting. Clem is still no more than ten years old, and the way that potentially changes how the player will interact with the world in this season is exciting. For her age, Clementine is certainly quite clever and strong, but the world of The Walking Dead is full of monsters, zombie and otherwise, and there's no question she's more vulnerable and less powerful than Lee was. One of the challenges of this is balancing between giving the player agency in the world without giving Clem influence she shouldn't have from a narrative point of view. This is going to have to be a very different story, and with the setup, it's somewhat hard to see how it will pay off the way the first season did, but we'll have to wait and find out.In terms of gameplay, very little has changed from the first season. Most of the important interaction comes from dialogue choices, with QTEs and a few simple fetch quests tossed in to break things up. Like in the original, you will sometimes have to make some tough choices, and the game will keep track of how you choose, leading to slightly different situations. I sometimes miss the more difficult puzzles found in Telltale's earlier titles such as Tales of Monkey Island, but their more recent games seem to be going for a different type of genre, so it's probably best not to make direct comparisons. This is less an adventure game and more of a visual novel, albeit one that does a very good job of keeping the player within the lines while simultaneously making them feel like the story is their own. Perhaps things will change up in later episodes, but I don't really think they have to if the main concept is pulled off properly.screen1136x1136-9From a technical standpoint, well, this is an iOS version of a Telltale game, so things aren't going to be completely airtight. In particular, I should give a clear warning to people on older hardware. If your hardware was not officially supported but could run the first season in some fashion anyway, don't count on the same here. Things went pretty smoothly on my iPhone 5S, but I've seen tons of complaints from people on circa-iPhone 4 tech. Given Telltale's history, don't count on much technical support after the fact, either. One thing that did work quite well is the save game import. As long as you kept the first season on your device, you'll be able to import your final data for that. There aren't many ramifications in the first episode apart from the ""Previously"" opening, but I'm sure things will come into play in less subtle ways eventually.From here, I'll write up a bit about each episode as they're released. As with the main review, I'll do my best to avoid spoiling anything current when talking about each one, but there may be spoilers for prior episodes as we go along. Tread at your own risk!			"

												Telltale's The Walking Dead video game series is my favourite part of The Walking Dead franchise, lots of people don't understand what makes it so great, or just assume it's not too good because they watched someone else play it on Youtube and think that's the same thing as playing it. However, they need to experience it for themselves - sure, at times the choices don't seem to matter a great deal regarding outcome, but the thing that makes the choices great is just how hard they are to make. You can tell just by the other players' choices at the end of each episode just how brilliant they are because the majority of the choices are split pretty close to 50/50 - getting close to that with every episode as the choices become harder and harder to make. This is an immervise and dramatic interactive experience, there isn't a whole lot of gameplay in the traditional sense, there's some small areas to look around in at times, there's a lot of dialogue to choose and there are a few quick time events - but overall not a whole lot. I don't think this makes it a bad thing, it works, it's enough to make you feel like you're there. For those of you who think that the choices don't matter, this game is a lot better than the first for choices. Not only are most of the choices harder, but they also do change things more. For example, a choice in the first episode makes the first 20 or so minutes of the second episode completely different. More people can survive depending on your choices, it isn't just a choose one or the other thing this time around. Also, the biggest thing of all is that there are multiple different endings to the season, all brilliant in their own right - not just one like the first game.Please play this game if you care about storytelling in video games, because this is one of the finest games for that.

												Walking Dead: Season 2 is Telltales sequal to their critically acclaimed game, based on the hit comic book, The Walking Dead, and their 3rd entry into the ""game is taleared to your actions"" style of story telling, after The Walking Dead and the brilliant Wolf Among Us.There is so much I wish I could write about this fantastically done game, but I'll try to split it into what makes me love these style of games and the tiny little nit-picks that stop it from being an even better experiance.First off, anyone who has played any of Telltales titles I'd mentioned above and probably see they've been getting better and better with every installment. The major issue I had with the orignal Walking Dead game is that a LOT of the choices for me felt very one sided, you could say a little black and white. Season Two manages to really give you tough choices this time round, everything really does feel 50/50, characters aren't as really deemed ""good"" or ""bad"" the things they do in the world can really be taken differently depending on the person playing. I found myself a lot of the times really thinking ""Should I really do this?"" or ""Is X maybe right?"" and even after making the choice feeling that self doubt, wondering if I'd made the right choice.Overall, they've improved on the idea of what you do effects the story so much over each game, and it really does add to some replayability, since some decisions might mean certain events might not happen, or some people might not survive, it makes you want to know all the possible outcomes. The story telling is just so well done in this series. Telltale just do such a good job sticking to the tone and feel of a universe while still being able to add their own touch to give it that unique flavour. The Walking Dead comics have always been very character driven and about conflicting veiw points about how an average person can live in such a hellish world. Telltale stick to that formula perfectly, making very real and believable characters, some likeable and others... Not so likeable, but overall adding to the drama of the story, not one character (to me at least) felt super out of place, everything has a reason for being there and it all adds up for some interesting situations.The team at Telltale really do need to be praised for all the work they've done. You can see a lot of thought and effort has really gone into making this game be as immersive as it can be. Oh and the voice acting is just as smooth as ever, so a big gold star for the actors, too.Now for the things that irked me in some places, which surprisingly isn't an awful lot; if anything they really are just nit-picks i'd like to see improved on in future games.The puzzle solving elements really were lacking compaired to the original game. In Season One, there was a LOT of times where you had to figure out how to get out of sticky situation, ultimately deciding whether you walked away in one piece, or became a tasty Walker snack. In Season 2 it tends to just either tell you what to do or give you the bare minimum of things to interact with in order to progress the story.I'm not asking for Sam and Max style ""I'll combine two random things and place it on something I never would have thought to"" style of puzzles. Just something to cut up the drama and make me think for a bit, whether it be to reflect on my latest actions or to simply enjoy absorbing the environment.My last thing to really bug me is animation. Now I don't mean it looks bad, actually the oppiset, the art style is amazing, it sticks to the comic book really well. What more gets to me is sometimes how characters move or react, it can sometimes feel very stiff and robotic at times or even a little goofy the way certain characters are placed or the way they stand, It just seems a little unnatural to me. I would really love to see some more fluid movements in future games, possibly even a little motion capture thrown in. Hell, If I have to pay a little extra for an even better experiance, I can live with not eating for a bit.Final thoughts are really this is a unique game, it probably won't be to everyones tastes but for me it sits just right. I love interactive stories, and having the world change to my decisions makes it that something more special.If you like good character driven stories filled with conflct and tears, well written and brilliantly acted, you should probably play this.tl;drIs good game. You like interactive story, go buy this, maybe play original first though.			"

												Just like The Walking Dead Season 1, The Walking Dead Season 2 will give you the feels and you'll have to make extremely tough choices in the game. This game has a lot of drama and amazing dialogue that will make you care about the characters. The voice acting is phenominal! I definitely recommend this game to any gamer who loves drama, atmosphere, zombies, and story rich stuff! This game is worth playing and buying it on sale or full price!			"

												While in the last game, we played as Lee, an intelligent, strong, adult male, this time, the playable character is Clementine, the young girl who we spent a large part of the last season protecting. Clem is still no more than ten years old, and the way that potentially changes how the player will interact with the world in this season is exciting. For her age, Clementine is certainly quite clever and strong, but the world of The Walking Dead is full of monsters, zombie and otherwise, and there's no question she's more vulnerable and less powerful than Lee was. One of the challenges of this is balancing between giving the player agency in the world without giving Clem influence she shouldn't have from a narrative point of view. This is going to have to be a very different story, and with the setup, it's somewhat hard to see how it will pay off the way the first season did, but we'll have to wait and find out.In terms of gameplay, very little has changed from the first season. Most of the important interaction comes from dialogue choices, with QTEs and a few simple fetch quests tossed in to break things up. Like in the original, you will sometimes have to make some tough choices, and the game will keep track of how you choose, leading to slightly different situations. I sometimes miss the more difficult puzzles found in Telltale's earlier titles such as Tales of Monkey Island, but their more recent games seem to be going for a different type of genre, so it's probably best not to make direct comparisons. This is less an adventure game and more of a visual novel, albeit one that does a very good job of keeping the player within the lines while simultaneously making them feel like the story is their own. Perhaps things will change up in later episodes, but I don't really think they have to if the main concept is pulled off properly.screen1136x1136-9From a technical standpoint, well, this is an iOS version of a Telltale game, so things aren't going to be completely airtight. In particular, I should give a clear warning to people on older hardware. If your hardware was not officially supported but could run the first season in some fashion anyway, don't count on the same here. Things went pretty smoothly on my iPhone 5S, but I've seen tons of complaints from people on circa-iPhone 4 tech. Given Telltale's history, don't count on much technical support after the fact, either. One thing that did work quite well is the save game import. As long as you kept the first season on your device, you'll be able to import your final data for that. There aren't many ramifications in the first episode apart from the ""Previously"" opening, but I'm sure things will come into play in less subtle ways eventually.From here, I'll write up a bit about each episode as they're released. As with the main review, I'll do my best to avoid spoiling anything current when talking about each one, but there may be spoilers for prior episodes as we go along. Tread at your own risk!			"

												Well, here i go, perhaps no one will read this, but I feel like I owne it to the game.   Things you MUST DO is to play TWD Season 1, you'll expereince why and please, make the choices as they were your own, as if you were Clementine or Lee. Now, lets go deep into the subject. In TWD season 1 you play as Lee, but what you don't realize is that you ARE Lee, Lee's choices are your choices. They reveal what kind of moral status you have, what kind of person you are. Your stablished duty is to raise and protect Clementine, but this isn't the main objective of the game; its the way how you are going to do this. At the end, after having met a lot of people, having friendships, having enemies, chosing the fate of some people, you will notice which kind of human being are you, and if you played as the moral guys we all are, you will be proud and happy for Lee, yourself, or dissapointed, to then change you view life   Now, TWD season 2. Gosh, this will make you feel stuff. You are now Clementine, no objective more than surviving. This is where you get to know you as a human. Lying to survive or telling the truth?, robbing or giving?, helping the weak or to guard for the group and your future? After this and having finished the game, you'll understand what are you, no bad or good choices; just you. It's a continuous martyring to get to know your kid (innocent/ corruptible side and adult (leader/paternal role) point of view of life and it's development through the game.     The characters, the music, the ambient and the situations will make you feel hate, empathy, compassion, fear and happines. 100% you will cry, but let it go, don't hold it, it's a good cathartic situation and you'll feel great   Just buy it, you won't regret, I swear it.

												The Walking Dead (Series) is one of the most original game series released in the last years.. In my (arogantic) opinion, story in this game can equal even to famous Grand theft Auto: V.

												Before you think about buying this game, I strongly recommend that you buy and play Season One of Telltales The Walking Dead. It is necessary in my opinion. Not only will it help you understand the tone of the game, but it will help you understand who the main protagonist in this game is. TL;DR at the end. Spoilers are marked in  These.	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Let me just get this out of the way. No. This game's story is not as good as Season 1. That said, it is hard to beat perfeciton. The story in this game is probably a 9/10, compared to the 10/10 that was S1. You play as Clemintine. Just like the first game, you come across survivors. In the beginning you can see that this group is not as strong as Season 1's group. Thats not me saying these characters are awful. What I am saying is that they are more of a broken group. They may be together, but they each have their own opinion on how to handle things. It is up to you to help guide them along this journey. One of the reasons most people tend to not fancy this season is because of its tonal change. Sure its still about surviving, but its more stressful and less light hearted. For me, that makes sense. The first season was about couping with the way the world has changed and dealing with walkers. In this season, walkers are still an issue, but humans are becoming a real threat. You are always second guessing a new face. Are they friendly? Can we trust them? Should we rob them? This season starts with Clemintine  a few months following the death of Lee.	 You are with two survivors in the beginning  Christa and Omid from Season 1.	 That changes pretty quick though  They don't make it.	 Then you find a new group that you stay with throughout the whole season. I will list some pros and cons from this season of Telltales The Walking Dead.Here are the pros:1.) Clemintine is a great character.2.) The group of survivors are an enjoyble group.3.) The decisions you make matter.4.) Each episode takes place in a new and dangerous setting.5.) Multiple endings.6.) Spoiler  Dream sequence with Lee.	7.) Spoiler  Re-unite with a survivor from Season 1.	8.) Episodes do not drag out as long as some in the first season.9.) Improvements to the controls in this game.10.) Little to not frame rate drops. ( I only experienced one.)Here are the cons:1.) Sarah plz.2.) Some outcomes should have a middle solution.  You should be able to take some of the medicine from Arvo.	3.) Somethings are left unanswered.  Like why was Arvo putting medicince in a trash can? Damn it Arvo!	4.) The last 1/5 of Episode 4 has an intersting conclusion.  Why are the Russians in America? Arvo plz!	5.) Some of the animation is off. Final Thoughts:This is a great game. Its story is darker and more violent than season one, but the characters are still entertaining. The decisions that you make have consequences. The ending to this game is not as black and white as it was in Season 1. SPOILER FOR SEASON 1:  The man who captured Clemintine is a monster. Lee dies no matter what. You must protect/save Clemintine from him.	  The game has a clear good ending though.  It's when you let the Season 1 character kill the Season 2 character. You join them to find the safe place. Then you leave with the Season 1 character.	  It is a huge build up to the ending though. Lots of drama in this game. If you played and enjoyed Season 1, than Season 2 is right for you. If you have never played a Telltale game, then I recommend that you buy Season 1 of Telltales The Walking Dead. It is worth it, and then buy this season. If you did not like Season 1, then  you must hate quality story telling	 this game may not be for you.TL;DR:This is a great game, and a great sequal to an amazing game. It is not the 10/10 that Season 1 is, but its a 9.2/10 at the least. Has a great story, great characters, improved controls, more action, and more walkers. Highly recommended.*Stare back			"

												Oh Jesus, ANOTHER REVIEW? I bought this mainly because I was really intrigued from the first season. I was 50/50 with this, I really enjoyed the gameplay and the new choices and the structure, but it just didn't contain that extra sort of buzz you had with the first one; although this varies on the in-game choices you pick. Everyone is different, people prefer the first, people prefer the second, but for me the first was definitely the best. Although, it is still a very very good game and is really worth the price.          *A FAMILIAR FACE?*Chapters:1) All That Remains2) A House Divided3) In Harm's Way4) Amid The Ruins5) No Going Back			"

												Telltale games pulls off yet another tug at your heart strings with the sequel to the hit Walking Dead game. taking place 16 months after the end of episode 5, You take on the role as clementine as she learns the hard way about surviving on her own in the world of the undead. In Just the first episode there are moments that'll make you cry, cringe, scream, and panic as you do whatever you can to make sure that clementine will survive. a few characters will also reappear and specific dialogues can be chosen if you played the previous game along with the dlc. I can't wait for the next episode to be released, but I can tell that just from the first one, that the game is off to a good start.			"

												I enjoyed this very much. Not much game, as many others have said, but a fairly compelling story. It wasn't quite as emotional as the first story (but there are plenty of ""feels"") but it was creepier than the first story in exchange for that. I don't think you'll be playing this very often - it is more of a linear interactive movie than a ""game"" in the true sense of the word - but I also suspect you won't be sorry if you play it once either.

												Season 2 of the walking dead is probably one of my top 25 games of all time – it is great!Let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the TV show.  But this game is mostly unrelated, so don't let that hold you back.The graphics are not going to impress you, that's it.  But that's okay too.  TellTale uses a shell shading style that masks the low-end graphics.  But graphics aren't the focus here, story and characters are.The characters are well developed in this series, perhaps more so than the first.  The story is more exciting.  The game play has shifted to being more story based and less “lets look around for some batteries.”  The largest complaint that I had with the first season was that the game purports to be all about the choices you make and how it affects the world.  However, at the end of season one the ending was always the same, or at least nearly the same.  Yes, some characters may have died and others lived, but in the end you ended up in the same situation.  Season two drastically changes that.  In fact, there are several different endings.  I don't even know how telltale plans to stitch this together into a cohesive season 3 without making 5 different games!Considering that this game isn't very expensive even at full retail, and it really is one of the best games you can buy, you would be crazy not too.  Who could imagine, our favorite game is one where you play a ten year old girl?			"

I was 50/50 with this, I really enjoyed the gameplay and the new choices and the structure, but it just didn't contain that extra sort of buzz you had with the first one; although this varies on the in-game choices you pick. Everyone is different, people prefer the first, people prefer the second, but for me the first was definitely the best. Although, it is still a very very good game and is really worth the price.          *A FAMILIAR FACE?*Chapters:1) All That Remains2) A House Divided3) In Harm's Way4) Amid The Ruins5) No Going Back			"

												I liked this game much better than the first one. I'm going to say, this is still my second favorite choice based game I have ever played. I did like Life is Strange much better, but who doesn't like rejecting teenage boys? Jokes aside. This game was not spoiled for me like the first game; maybe I would have liked the first one better. I kept my word, and never trusted anyone. This was my goal for the game, don't trust hope and trust no one. The game has 4-5 endings, much better than only two like the first game had. I loved my ending, since I didn't follow hope, it was exactly what I wanted for an ending.The beauty of the game is, you're a cute little girl, and no man is ever going to punch you. You can be a ""c***"" to anyone you wish and watch them contemplate hitting you. In other words, if you like the first game, buy it. If you haven't played it, buy the first game. You won't get gold class tickets for the feel train otherwise.			"

												First season of The Walking Dead made by Telltale games was intense, a big dose of emotions. As Lee we were taking care of Clementine, the protagonist of Season 2.Second season is even more intense and emotional wrecking than the first. A story about Clementine, a young girl who lost her parents, forced to survive in the post apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Of course she's not alone, she's accompanied by a group of other survivors. Story which suprise in every episode. Game has great written and dubbed characters.And of course the decisions - Decisions which are sometimes heartbreaking, not even one was easy for me.As for the gameplay, this time it's even more like interactive movie. First season has more adventure like gameplay than second, but that doesn't make second season worse. In my opinon, when it comes to story telling, Telltale will give you what you want on high level.Pros: Outstanding and touching plot with many twists. Fantastic characters with great voice acting. Very good soundtrack. Hard decisions.A game like this can be called a piece of art.My rating: 9/10 "

												I liked it.Not as good as season one, but it had some great moments and Telltale is getting better at the game part.No bugs was nice.Maybe it's been too long since I played 400 days, but it didn't seem like the characters from that played much of a part in this game, certainly less than I was expecting. I honestly didn't care much about most of the characters in this season, I think that is it's main flaw, when people start dying, it didn't have the same impact as similar situations had in the first season.episodes 1,2 and 5 were greatepisodes 3 and 4 were a bit slow.I think I'll wait until all 5 episodes are out before I buy the next Telltale game, I like them, but I like playing them better all at once, and the number of times this game went on sale between episode 1 and 5 was crazy.

The Walking Dead: Season Two has you dealing with more heart-wrenching choices than its predecessor.Even though this season wasn't as emotional as the previous one - it still managed to keep up. It offers a new perspective, since you now play as Clementine. You get to decide on how you should deal with growing up in an apocalyptic environment - where it's all about survival.As usual, it has loveable characters with great voiceacting. The artstyle is true to the comics'. I'd also recommend playing the previous season if you haven't.			"

												Although at the time I am writing this review, only episode 1 has been release, this game is one of the most intensive on the edge of your seat story line games i have ever seen. Season one made me feel real emotion, and no difference in season 2. Although there are minor gameplay changes, (Which I do not have an opinion on), the game itself starts strong, and hopefully, like the last season, will end strong. I STRONGLY reccomend this game to those who like games that you choose your own dicision, and live through the consequences.			"

												In season 2 you play as Clementine herself and watch as she has to grow up in the hostlie horrible world. The second game is even more intense, cruel, sad and mostly touching. I really love this series because it simply has the best story. Because even when humankind faces world full of zombies, they still don't cooperate but murder each other instead. Anyway, this game has it all - apart from the story also perfect voiceovers (including Micheal Madsen as the main antagonist), dramatic music, wonderful comic-style graphics and so on. The only thing some might view as a negative is the fact that it's more as an interactvie film than a game, but that's fine by me.9/10			"

												I liked it.Not as good as season one, but it had some great moments and Telltale is getting better at the game part.No bugs was nice.Maybe it's been too long since I played 400 days, but it didn't seem like the characters from that played much of a part in this game, certainly less than I was expecting. I honestly didn't care much about most of the characters in this season, I think that is it's main flaw, when people start dying, it didn't have the same impact as similar situations had in the first season.episodes 1,2 and 5 were greatepisodes 3 and 4 were a bit slow.I think I'll wait until all 5 episodes are out before I buy the next Telltale game, I like them, but I like playing them better all at once, and the number of times this game went on sale between episode 1 and 5 was crazy.

												In Season 1 playing TWD player role with Lee was totaly ok, but in season 2 its pretty interesting, how you need fit in this role with Clem, little girl rolling all business, taking all the important decisions and fighting againts zombies better than grown man, interesting. :D Anyways, awesome story, awesome game, loving it. Better interface and less boring searching parts than is S1 game. 11/10 and 12 times better than TV series.			"

The Walking Dead: Season Two has you dealing with more heart-wrenching choices than its predecessor.Even though this season wasn't as emotional as the previous one - it still managed to keep up. It offers a new perspective, since you now play as Clementine. You get to decide on how you should deal with growing up in an apocalyptic environment - where it's all about survival.As usual, it has loveable characters with great voiceacting. The artstyle is true to the comics'. I'd also recommend playing the previous season if you haven't.			"

Can this game get any better? Just amazing! The Walking Dead Season 2 was as good as the first one, and a bit better. You think choices don't matter so much? This season's ending changes that all!!Short Summary of Season 2: Clementine makes it to Omid and Christa and they continue surviving together. Clementine encounters another girl in the bathroom and the girl shoots Omid by mistake. A while after we see Christa and Clem around a campfire. We can see that Christa's baby didn't make it. Christa is attacked by a group of survivors and she and Clem split up. Another group finds Clementine and she continues with this group. A lot of other things happen and we see Kenny back, but to know the rest you just have to play!Opinion: This was really really amazing. The voice acting is very good and the graphics are more improved than season 1. The soundtrack in every ending of an episode is really nice and the choices you've made are showed in the ending like season 1. I wish here was the short summary in the end of season 2, which shows your relationship with the characters just like season 1. The writing of this season was just as good as the first season and the ending was just a big WOW. I mean I bet everyone didn't even know what to do at that point, kill Kenny who is your old friend but he was losing it or kill Jane who is very experienced but made a very wrong action to show what Kenny has come to? I personally choose to kill Kenny. The reason for this is because he was really losing it and he didn't go well with other group members, after all he wanted to be with Katjaa, Duck and Sarita.Short list of Pros and Cons:Pros:- Great Graphics

The fact that Clementine is the main character doesn't mean the game will go easy on her because she's just a child, don't worry. She'll see worse things than Lee saw in the first season.Buy this game if you liked the first season.If you have not played the first Season go play that one first, since this is a direct sequel.

												The patience and hype for the release of this game definitely did not disappoint. The first 10 minutes of Season 2 takes you on an emotional rollercoaster with recaps of the first season and a tragic transition into Clementine's journey. The first chapter I felt was a little short, but it was a great introduction to Clementine's story after Lee. I'm very excited to see how the story is going to unfold for all of the introduced characters, not just Clem.			"

												Season 1 was absolutely fantastic. I'll admit I cried like a little girl at the end of it.Season 2 is no exception. Has you on the edge of your seat throuought.Decisions from Season 1 and the 400 Days DLC are imported if you choose and the events of Season 2 will be altered based on those prior choices. While Season 2 can be started without playing the prior season, I highly recommend doing Season 1 first so that you have a better understanding of what is happening and to have your choices imported rather than being randomly selected for youOn the emotional side:Sometimes I want  to play through the entire season 2 in one sitting because it's such a great game. But, I can't. It's too hard. Too emotional. So I have to take breaks. Playing more than two sittings of The Walking Dead a day or every other day is very rare because of the strong heavy emotions it causes. And that is just one of the many reasons that The Walking Dead 2 is such a good game; it causes people to feel real emotions: emotions of hate, love, sadness, scardness. Emotions I can not say I've experienced in quite a while, especially in a game?!. If you can not handle that ^ then don't bother playing this game. because that's what it revolvs around.On a technical side:Graphics are great, (no surprise there). The camera movements are real, as if you're watching a movie with real people in it. The camera pans in and out and over. Great.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic throuought, and if you are into music I definitely reccomend listening to the song at the end of every episode while the credits run; most of the time if not aways, it is related to the episide you just completed.Voice acting is smooth and powerful with real emotion just like the first season, and unlike any game I have ever seen.One tiny negative bit I noticed with this Season is that you cannot use your mouse wheel to scroll down the list of responses to the conversations that you are having, like you were able to do in the first Season. You were also able to scroll through your actions of what you do in the game as well so in this season I find myself misclicking something on the screen because I'm used to scrolling, or I find myself nearly missing a timed answer in a conversation because I remember that I can't scroll and have to click. This minor detail can easily be dealt with , however, because mouse sensitivity on this game (as opposed to Season 1) is much more smooth despite no option to change it, and thus makes choosing one of the choices simple and effortless.To recap: Fantastically emotional, personal, and powerful. Music is the best. Unbelievably top notch graphics and mouse movement, with a small change in controlls that can be more than easily dealt with and learned.If you can not already tell, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is just as fantastic as the first Season, and is definitely (besides The Walking Dead: Season 1) the best game I have had the happy pleasure of playing in the longest time. ☆☆☆☆☆ 5/5 stars all the way			"

												**EDIT AFTER COMPLETING THE FULL GAME (SPOILERS)**This game was truly amazing. Right from the menu, you immediately feel the suspense and the dread, because you just know something bad will more than likely happen when you get into the Episode.This season introduced some new mechanics that Season 1 didn't have, such as dragging your mouse to move objects, and choosing a direction suddenly during a high-speed cutscene. The characters weren't as memorable, as they all progressively died throughout the story in some of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways.  Some choices and the fates of some characters seemed a bit linear, such as Nick, Sarah, and Luke who, regardless of what choice you make, will still die anyway. Which is a shame, because the entire cabin gang had amazing potential to be story changers, but you still either end up with Kenny (who we already know), or Jane (who basically ♥♥♥♥ed you over multiple times).Also, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED TO CHRISTA?!However, the game kind of redeems itself at the end, where you can end up in 4 different scenarios for the end. I'm very interested in how this will tie into the 3rd Season or TWD: Michonne.			"

												Here we are again, after we've had some time to recover from the emotional rollercoaster that was The Walking Dead: Season One. Just to remind us of how terribly sad we were at the end of that, Season 2 reminds us of our past choices right off the bat. F**k you Telltales!The Walking Dead is all about hard decisions. It forces dilemma onto you at every chance it gets, cutting deeper and deeper into your moral consciousness, up to a point where you might feel like being a good guy doesn't always work. TWD offers a terrifying insight into human nature by driving humanity to the edge of extinction. And to make things even better, this time you play through the story from Clementine's point of view. The little girl is not so little anymore after the events of the first season and sets out to survive on her own.After having reviewed the first season, there really is not much to add. It's still a Walking Dead game, it's still a Telltales game. If you enjoyed the first one and are keen to find out how the story progresses, do yourself a favour and pick up Season 2!			"

												Boo! Scary outdoor zombie horror! I didn’t feel scared from the intro screen of trees and a flowing river. Looked more like a multimedia exhibit you see when you go to a national park.  Quiet pines, rolling waters, and piped in elevator music showing how the eco-system works on an LCD screen. Maybe the water doesn't calm you.  It’s slightly unnerving with no people. And the music is in a minor key, making for an unsettling mood. That’s how I played the game pretty much. Unsettled. Fairly intrigued by what may happen next, but not really scared in the least. This is a storytelling. You weave in and out of decisions that affect the game, yet not the entire outcome.  Then, at the end, you have some tough choices and at least a handful of endings that I can tell.Episode 1 was my favorite.  It had a dog! Woof Woof Woof.. And it’s that odd ability of a dog to make us smile that Telltale uses to explore how delicate the tipping point between a relationship or betrayal can be.  That theme popped up again and again as I played throughout the chapters.  Nothing was safe, everything could turn with one sudden character decision.  Often, that decision wasn't yours.  That made it less interesting, honestly.  I just waited for some character to screw up because my actions did not affect the final outcome as much as I would have liked.  The scene with Clem doing surgery was gut-wrenching and oh my god - really? - yeeesssh. That was hard to watch let alone do the actual actions to finish the job.  Episodes 2-3 carry into the storyline well, but Nick is a total downer with his whining! After a time I was just wanted to get rid of him.   The only moment I liked was in the shed when he reveals “I had to kill my Mom.  Sounds weird when it comes out, huh?”.  That was a personal opening up..  Probably the best part since  the rest of the scene he is in a drunken stupor. The episodes tied well together, though, and are an enjoyable part of the story of Clem.  There is a weak point with the main action, however.  If you have seen the TV show or read the graphic novels, it honestly doesn't introduce anything new.  And it makes the game a tad boring because of that familiarity.Episodes 4-5 go into darker territory.  This is heart of darkness stuff where characters don't just lose themselves, they hone a whole new set of malicious skills.  Eventually it comes down to trust and distrust. What constitutes trust in armageddon? Do you trust yourself? Will I survive without my friends?  Would I abandon them or betray them...are they a threat?   Those are the questions that reverberate till the end of the game.As for the gameplay. There isn't much there.  Really. Rayman Rabbids is harder.  I  only died once and that was because I didn’t see an object fast enough.  Want to shoot a zombie?  Just click whatever, it’s very hard to miss. Telltale made this extremely user friendly, and while it introduces more casual players, it hurts the gameplay for those of us who like more challenge.  I found this arising time and time again.  When I expected a scene to be stressful while running through windows or grabbing equipment before the time was up, it never happened.  Instead you are literally guided through step by step.  I had more challenge playing Spy Fox with my 7 year old.  Perhaps some folks had issues with season 1 causing them to die several times.  But that’s the fun of it!  I missed dying. Tension.  Where is the tension?  I did not feel any.  Visuals are great ( unless you are addicted to anime and want it to look less messy) and I thought the voice acting *made* many of the characters.  Menus are fine. I was able to play at my max of 1080P with no lag on a mediocre system, and the colors change with the episodes which is neat.  Technically, no issues.It’s a good game all in all.  Just wished I could feel more terror and care more about the characters. In season 1, Lee and Clem had a strong relationship that ultimately claimed Lee’s life.  And it gripped you.  WIth Clem on her own, she bounces back and forth from one set of people to the next.  There aren't any strong relationships with anyone.  Even her strongest friends are undermined by that heart of darkness theme. Can’t feel the love, man. No trust.  Makes for a colder story than season 1.  But still a walking dead story to the bone.  If you enjoy storytelling, this is for you.			"

												Instead of giving the shortest review of a sentence that people have seemed to given, I've got an actual review. To anybody who has not played the first season to begin with, I suggest buying that first, or you simply will not enjoy the game to it's best potential. In relation to it's predecessor, the Walking Dead Season 2 is a remarkable game. Telltale seem to have taken their base game and feedback and improved upon it excessively. To begin with, the normal overlay has been edited to be more eye-catching and simple to allow for a balance, to give a fresh feel to the overlays, as well as improving the graphics wildly with this change and even giving revamps of the Season 1 Cutscenes into HD for the starting titles. It has also allowed for more effective animations and less lag within the game, spec wise improving greatly from where the last game knocked off, preventing more of such bugs as walking glitches and cutscene lag. Story wise- Well. You can't say anything. Telltale seems to strike at every moment they can with their games and have yet again woven an encaptivating tale that is absolutely brilliant! I loved the first episode, if a little short and cannot wait for the second. So far, they have expressed many subtle changes that are seen only from the most skilled writers and I cannot fathom how anyone could not enjoy this storyline and how they express the dire situation of a little girl in a post-apocalyptic world. To anybody who reads this- Buy this game and the first. You will not regret it and will be greatly impressed by Telltale's work.			"

												The first two episodes annoyed me because Clementine felt powerless and just along for the ride while other characters took decisions and drove the story. Fortunately, the rest of the episodes have her much more in charge.This season isn't as good as season 1, and didn't make me emotional once, but it was still good. But I expected much more.Season 1 made me bawl though. This one, not even close. That's a silly way of saying that this season had nowhere near the same impact on me. I barely cared about any of the characters.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season Two is an amazing sequel to The Walking Dead (Season One). In this sequel, you star as Clementine as she treks through a new setting with unfamiliar faces. Unfortunately it's nowhere near as good as the first in story. For me anyways, there were way too many instances of ""why did she do that?"" from the dialogue or actions. It also feels significantly shorter due to a lack of direction. The first game, if I remember correctly, chose a clear long-term goal within the first three episodes; this is different. Season Two is more dynamic and more of a ""we have no plans, so make everything up as we go"" type of deal. Don't let this fool you though, as it is the choices you make that define the game. Season One is a must play for this season to make an impact on your emotions because a lot of what you learned and what you experienced makes a difference. There's a minor connection to the 400 Days DLC as well but that is not required.Overall this is fun. It's compelling to know that every decision makes a change in the future. Lastly, I will say that Episode Five is a conclusion that ends not just Season Two, but Season One and Two.Also, it would have been nice they had some sort of more keyboard support rather than just use it for movement and quick time events (ex. using the WASD keys to choose answers).Obligatory score: 8/10Edit: Updated review to reflect the whole game including Ep. Five.			"

												One of my friends wrote a detailed review for this that convinced me to buy the game so i'll link a part of it here: Episode One: Everything Is RemainsUnfortunately, that will never come to pass, and so let’s focus on what’s in front of us. Being created by Telltale and being based on a comic and TV series, it makes complete sense that the game is structured episodically (5 appears to be Telltale’s favorite episode number, the only time they strayed was Season 1 of Sam & Max) and belongs to the adventure genre, although not in the classical sense (aka mind-bending puzzles). This game is part of the new wave of adventure games in which the adventure is highly toned down and quick time events and quick decision making which heavily influence the plot rule. This new type of adventure game, clearly targeted at consoles as opposed to PCs, because consoles can’t Point ‘n Click (speaking of, Sony, isn’t it time you released Heavy Rain on the PC? I mean it’s been 4 years already, get over yourselves) is of course not intended as competition for oldschool-style adventures, but as an alternative to watching a movie (one episode has a movie running time).You can read the full review here[in2gpu.com].

												The eagerly anticipated continuation of Telltale Games' Walking Dead series, it picks up where it left off in the first season. We now follow Clementine's journey north after the events that took place in Savannah, Georgia. You play as Clementine and you'll encounter hardships and trials a little girl should never have to face. It'll have you cringing, looking away from your monitor and looking back again with your hands over your head. I've never cringed due to a game before but this just hits the right emotional spots. They made me care for the safety of a video game character. The only other studio, in my case, that has accomplished that was Crystal Dynamics with their Tomb Raider reboot. But there was a difference. I cared about Lara Croft in a pseudo-romantic way. I care about Clementine like how a father cares about a child.I've only played through the first episode of season 2, and I must say I'm grinding my teeth for more. It's as good as the first season, if not better, and it shows promising potential in areas where it can outdo the first. Kudos Telltale Games, another job well done. Keep at it!This is arguably their best release yet.			"

												I loved The Walking Dead: Season 1 by Telltale Games, and I also love the show and browsed the much more gore-filled comics. I thought at first that switching the main protagonist from an adult man like the first season, to the little girl that portrayed the daughter-like character would somehow diminish the story somehow and feel like you had less control of situations, but that's not the case: I felt it was much more fun to play as Clem than Lee, in fact. Telltale likes to tell a great story, and they successfully did so in this season, which I can tell by the, at this time, one episode that's released. You will get a love-hate relationship so strong that you will feel like you are in an abusive relationship with someone you love and still love them anyways. Some of the choices they have make me want to kill them (and they will make you feel) and might have been better if you could somehow change the outcome (like the very beginning, but I guess the story would be much different if it had a split option).Overall, in season 1 I only cried during the finale of the game (season 1, episode 5), but this season has already made me tear up in just the first episode and I'm not afraid to admit that. Season 1 made you care so much for the character you now control, to the point where they feel real and like family to you, and when you see them in danger you will do whatever you can to fix it.Even if you have zombie fatigue... Get this... This game is far too good for you to pass up, but you should 100% play season 1 and the 400 days DLC before digging into this one. I cannot wait to see what's in store later on in the season; hopefully I won't have to attack Telltale for ruining it, but I'm sure that won't happen.			"

												8/10 a worthy sequel to The Walking Dead. Season Two of Telltale's fantastic Walking Dead, Season Two lives up to its expectations. Although it is perhaps a little short, the story continues seemlessly into Season 2, as the player is put into the shoes of Clementine. Her development and story here from child to adult is just as emotionally charged as Seaon 1, and is a requirement if you loved Season 1. Characters are again Telltale's niche, and the ones on offer here are just as engaging as in Season One. Only negatives are its play time which edges on the short-side, and the reduced number of puzzels in comparrison to Season One.+ Continues the fantastic narrative.+ Again, characters are interesting and dynamic.+ Clemtine's transition into adulthood is wonderful writing.+ Morally ambiguous choices which stick with the player.- A little short in length- Reduced number of puzzels/hub areas in comparrison to Season One.

												Disappointing. Meh. But yeay Clementine. Whereas I shed a tear at the end of season 1, I was simply annoyed during the second half of season 2. There are nearly no puzzles or interesting gameplay mechanics that would keep me invested. Annoying gameplay: A room with 5 interactable objects, one of them which progresses the story. If you pick it first, you'll not get the chance to interact with the other 4. The game goes simply on and you have to reload if you are curious. It's not more than a simple interactive story at most times. Which is ok, but it leaves the player out too much by holding their hand too much. The story developed ok over the first half but then it lost me. Shorter than season 1 it could not establish the connection it had before. The first three episodes are enjoyable due to the plot and its one twist, but after that it just gets boring, producing false climaxes and an unsatisfying ending. If you're interested in the story about Clementine and what happened to her after the emotional ending in season 1, you should play it through. Personally I expected more and was left unsatisfied.

												Of course, I'm writing this review having only played Episode 1 so far, but going by just this one episode I can say the quality of the writing has been successfully carried over into Season 2. The intensity of the situations, the tough choices, the emotional roller-coaster rides, they're all back. If you were a fan of Season 1, which you should be, then you won't be disappointed. If you aren't yet a fan, then you should go buy Season 1 and play that first. For the rest of us grizzled old Telltale faithful, here's hoping for more of the same for the next 4 episodes of Season 2.			"

												I feel a bit bad writing this, but after loving the first Walking Dead game from Telltale, I just can't make it past the introduction of this sequel.  Forced stupidity and bad choices the player has no control over for the sake of manufactured drama just shouldn't come that early in the game.  At the very least, such railroading shouldn't come amidst offering the player other, benign choices in the same time frame. "

												The Walking Dead remains an example of fine storytelling. I had hopes that this breakout series from Telltale would iterate, evovle, and build upon the formula. I imagine a story that we could each steer to our slightly unique destination. And why wouldn't they have the funds to do this given the success the first season. But it has not come to pass.The first season gave us a hard road with small detours that ultimately led to the same conclusion. It never lived up to the promise of 'Mass Effect with zombies', but it compensated with some intense situations and choices which mattered - at least in the short term, over an episode or three. Sure, if you tugged at the strings hard enough, the illusion came crashing down, but you had the feeling that an honest effort was made, one perhaps tempered by realistic budgets. By contrast, the path laid out by season two is largely a straight line, with ""choices"" often being resolved within the very same dialoge tree. Choosing the ""Silence option"" in conversation often results in the other character responding with a suitably vague response that would have adequately covered the other three conversational choices. The dramatic ""end of episode"" choice you make in episode 3 is revealed to have had almost no input into episode 4, being resolved in the first 30 seconds. And I have no reason to expect that the almost identical choice you make at the end of episode 4 will play out any differently. I am ameniable to granting the game a suspension of disbelief, but that doesn't mean you should take advantage of that. This violates the contract between player and game and you find yourself increasingly unwilling to give them the benefit of the doubt. You need to put forth a little more effort to make this more than a two hour cutscene. The end of episode ""Important decisions"" screens are telling - ""Who did you sit with at dinner"" is not an meaningful gameplay choice. So I get what they're saying. There is no stable family group for Clementine. She is adrift in an unforgiving world, and making bonds with other characters is hardly worth the effort because everyone leaves in the end. And you fall into that rhythm along with her. It's easy to throw in the towel. ""Jimbo will remember that"" means little when he's out of the picture 20 minutes later. And when you have half an episode to make a connection to a character, there's no real sense of tragedy when they're gone. Contrast this to the first season when a beloved character was mauled or shot. Has the magic been dispelled, or have we just become numb to tragedy, or was it an intentional design? Being helpess to save anyone but yourself may be an important lesson, but it is an unsatisfying pill for a player to swallow when we are expected to play out that role in someone else's shoes. We don't have enough time in each episode to have this lesson be the bittersweet one they want us to see. It's presented too fast out of necessity, and becomes trivialized.So if we can't explore deep relationships with other characters, that narrows the domain of notable choices down to ones related to our character's environmental situation. However Clementine is not old enough to make any fundamental decisions about her adventure. I agree with this. She shouldn't be making any of the major calls for the group. Clementine is a young girl, but as players we bring the benefit of wisdom to her choices. Thankfully the game doesn't force us to make silly childish decisions, but neither does making her a battle hardened survivor who abitrates all group decisions feel quite right. Not yet. But that leads us to the question. If the themes that are being explored do not particularly lend themselves to an interactive format, then is this the story that should have been told? We're stuck in limbo here, with no easy solution in sight. What's more, fewer of the situations are as captivating. Think back on the first four episodes of season 2 and try to remember anything that really stood out. The dog. The, um. Christmas ornament.  Can you remember what happened in episode two? I think an ingredient is missing. I think this form of storytelling has legs and Telltale is onto a fantastic idea with their recent games including Wolf among us. I enjoy the time I sit down with each episode. I'm being critical and a little hard on Season 2 because I see such a bright future here and I look forward to new installments of these series a great deal. They are fantastic games you can play alone, or play with a friend, or play separately and then talk about the next day. They are powerful stories and you are at the heart of them. Yet, a little reflection shows that we still have a long ways to go with this format, and I am already impatient waiting for progress. But if it isn't Telltale which brings us to that next plateau -- then who?			"

												Walking Dead season 1 was really good. Walking Dead season 2 is really... the contrary of it :-the choice of having a child as the main character is a bad idea, because the only result is that the child acts like an adult. In fact, the child is often the only one acting as an adult -the other characters have no consistency-the episodes are too short, the stories are often uninteresting (except for ep.1 and 3), some of them are just a total waste of time (ep. 4)-the choice you make have absolutely no incidence on the story-the gameplay is weak : no puzzle, you're just invited to click 3/4 times per episode of the screen (except opening scene in ep. 1 and closing scene in ep. 3)-and last but not least, the scenario is full of incoherences, the worst being the very end of ep. 5, which is complete nonesense			"

												Found myself not caring about any of the characters in second season during whole playthrough. Most of the dialogs seemed out of place and awkward. Big amount of decisions I was forced to make were irritating, to say the least. At times, I wanted to slap the crap out of the characters Clem had to engage with. Final chapter was so boring and predictable, it seemed like it lasted for hours. That ONE particular bit, which surely was added with best of intentions, felt like a cheap shot. And even though I am pretty happy with the finale I got (probably simply because of the attachment established in first season), it was an underwhelming experience.			"

												Although the game isn't downright awful, I wouldn't recomend it. The whole game screams ""Your choices matter!"" which is one gigantic lie. Characters can be killed off in earlier parts of the season, but it makes no difference if you keep them alive, or kill them on the spot. I recall one moment of the game, where I chose to save a character (You know who if you've played it) just to have them die literally 15 minutes later. There was also a point in time where I saved a character in Episode 2 just to have him mutter a few words and dies a few episodes later. And I can't forget that pointless 400 days DLC. Even if you managed to save a few characters, they only make small cameos and disappear from the game for the rest of the time. Most of the characters you run into are very forgetable, and lack development. Oh, and don't forget that every adult in the game is useless! At one point, they can't figure out how to turn on a windmill, so who else to go to but the 11 year old girl, right?I would, however, highly recommend Season One if you don't have it already. Season Two just couldn't deliver with all the hype Season One had.			"

												This is one of the best writing and storytelling that I ever seen. It even put Hollywood to shame. I have not seen season 3 of the TV series, but I think the game is better than the show in so many levals. After playing ep. 3 today, I am very confident about that. First off, I want to give kudos to the talented writers of this game. You guys did an amazing job! In most movies, shows, and video games, I can kind-of guess whats going to happend next, or who is going to die. However, you guys always pull it off to the point that many times you caught me offguard. I am always at the edge of my seat and wanted to know what's going to happened next. This is a surely a sign of amazing storytelling. I love the art direction! I can definitly see this game going to be timeless. Even when all games in the future with all of their realistic graphices, people are still going to appreciate this comic-style graphics. Great idea!I have nothing negative to say! Even if you are not into ""point-and-click adventures,"" this game takes a step beyond that! It will be a great detriment for anyone, if you have not check this game out. Even though the game is not finsih, So far the game is amazing! However, I do understand that you want to wait for them to finish it. Just make sure that you finish season 1 before you get this game.			"

You actually cringe with the player and grimace at disgusting scenes. They game does these so well. It really suchs you in and draws you in.  The three main complaints with it for me are one: Lee was a much better protaginst than Clem. The UI is also more clunky and in the way. The on screen text options are too big. The group of survivors at the house don't seem as well thought out and created, but it's a fantastic game other than that!			"

												So far it keeps up with the standard set by the first episode of the first game. The emotional value is there and the game is more immersing. You actually cringe with the player and grimace at disgusting scenes. They game does these so well. It really suchs you in and draws you in.  The three main complaints with it for me are one: Lee was a much better protaginst than Clem. The UI is also more clunky and in the way. The on screen text options are too big. The group of survivors at the house don't seem as well thought out and created, but it's a fantastic game other than that!			"

												This was a really good episode.  In season 1 the first episode did not pull you in like this one did.  The feels start to get played with even from the start!  The action sequences were spectacular just like in TWAU ( one of it's strong points), I didn't like some of Clementines decisions it felt irresponsible but then again I think that's what they are going for by playing as a child so if that's the case they nailed it!Clementine knows how to survive man!  She's tough.  I was skeptical at first playing as a child but the concept of how to play her just makes it even more interesting.  9/10 Great start.			"

												My impression after Episode 1:Walking Dead Season 2 is phenomenal just like season 1 of the Walking Dead.Its literally a feels simulator. So much emotion in just a 1 hr and 30 min. I am so excited for the upcoming episodes based on how good the first episode is. Telltale games are expert storytellers.My impression after finishing Episode 5:Telltale does it again with a shocking finale to an excellent game. The choices you have to make are excruciating. By the end of the episode, you feel as if you truly lost some good friends. I rarely if never feel emotional after a game but this game is an exception. Telltale knows how to pull on your heartstrings. If you can make it thru the end without shedding a tear, you are not human. This game overall deserves a 10/10. Worth every penny and every second of your time. If you plan to only play one game this year, this along with Telltale game's other masterpiece Wolf Among Us should be on that short list. I can't wait to see how Telltale will try to one up this emotional roller coaster with season 3. This is easily a contender for best story of 2014 and dare I say GOTY. At this point, please do yourself a favor and just buy this game and play it through to the end.			"

												The first game was brilliant, this game is even better. Watch how the little girl you raised as Lee in the first game survives without Lee and in most situations by herself. She seems to have learend this kind of leadership aspect from Lee so her decisions make a huge impact on what happens. This game brings so many emotions, terror, disgust, joy, helplessness and of course, sadness. There are moments in the game that can be heartwarming and other moments that can make you cry tears. For a ""Point & Click"" adventure it also has a nice pacing of action, any given moment a Zombie or even a full horde may appears, ruining your day by someone getting bit, decisions have to be made in these situation, the outcome can change how the game progresses. The Walking Dead Season 1 was already like that and it was brilliant, Season 2 just stays in this and it is STILL an amazing experience. This means it also got replay value, make another decision next time, see what happens. The story and character development, the good and the bad is truely amazing too. I don't want to spoil anything but a certain character appears you are just glad to see, and then you see him fall apart emotionally and getting angrier and angrier.Overall, this game is absolutely worth every single cent, if another game is gonna be made, I will definetly buy that too. I loved seeing Clem growing up and now fighting for herself and I would like to see more of that.			"

												Another great game that I love from Telltale. Again Telltalle made this season better than season 1 despite the story was more interesting in season 1. But now you are Clementine and they did good to get me fully immersed with her character.At last we have multiple choices of endings and not ended up with the same conclusion albeit you had with different choice like in season 1. Telltale has improved the game with better gameplay, plot, and characters. Totally recommend it even at full price!Final verdict: 9/10 "

												As great as Walking Dead 1, but unfortunately I feel like we didn't have enough time to bond with the new group so I don't exactly feel bad about what happens to them except for just a few characters contrary to the first season where almost everyone mattered to me. But the story is going fast and a LOT of things happen so be prepared! I can't rate it since the last episode isn't out yetEDIT: Okay I finished it! It is defenitely worth buying, I wasn't sure about where this was going and thought the connection between people wasn't as good as in the first one but now that all the episodes are out I can say it was really well thought, very emotional and, as always, the ending is great (there's also different endings! which I think is good since not everyone would agree with only one, cause there's SO many hard choices in the end).If you like hard choices, action and learning about characters, this is exactly the game that you need.Tenouttaten.

												First of all i want to say, DO NOT BY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT HAVE SEASON 1 AND THE 400 DAYS DLC. This is because this game is very widely centered around the choices you make, so if you have not played both the first season and the 400 days dlc, you may not understand some of the things the main character talks about, as they would have been made for you in season 1 and 400 days, but more importantly, YOU WONT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING IN SEASON 2 BECAUSE IT LEAVES OFF WHERE THE FIRST SEASON ENDED. However if you have both season 1 and 400 days, i would definately reccomend picking this up, as the first episode is great and sticks to the main games roots, but also adds a few new features to spice the game up a bit. The other episodes are not out yet but i can safely say i dont think telltale can do anything wrong with this series, so if you want to get it now i would definatly go for it. I hope this review helped make your decision on whether to get the game or not easier, bye :)			"

												Sigh. What to say about Walking Dead...It's gotten a bit stale, the zombie formula, due to over-saturation and a general loss of vision as to what makes the genre fun and interesting. This is all painfully obvious when it comes to the Walking Dead in either the visual novels, the TV show, and even the games... They've all begun to boil down to this:Revolving Door of Death, attendance mandatory; Please don't attach yourself, these people will die soon. Death isn't the dramatic part of Zombie Apocolypse, guys. Death is Final, it's just.. like that. Done, over with, heartbreaking, morose. It can be used effectively in a medium where death has been assumed to be 'against the rules' of the established work, such as when a main character suddenly dies. It helps the reader understand that rules are off the table,♥♥♥♥♥♥is getting real, no one is safe. We can see Drama From Death in many recent venues, namely the wildly popular Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, for whatever reason people latch onto these two series like life preservers because the Authors tend to be cynical and treat it with a tongue in cheek fashion. 'Oh you like this person? Here, watch them die. It's dramatic, feel sad.' And that's FINE, that' an effective way to tell -A- story. But when you're dealing with a franchise such as GoT or TWD the repeated themes of people dying pointlessly just begins to grow stale. (Spoilers below)Lee dying at the finale of the walking dead season 1 was great, it was dramatic, I cried like a god-dammed baby. It was literally the most emotion a game had made me feel in quite some time. All of the deaths up to that point also resonated -deeply-.. but that's the thing, isn't it? It was a new story in an established Universe. It got a free pass to make me like a character and then kill them in a horrible way to feed on my tears.The Walking Dead: Season Two.. doesn't get that free pass. In fact, it's brought down because it sticks to the formula so closely, so formulaic in its slow, methodical way of picking off a cast of characters that it becomes rote. You become numb to the loss of a person, dead inside and guarding yourself from caring because you know that these people will be dead. It's just how the Walking Dead WORKS, right? If you're going to continue drawing drama from Death, you have to -convince- us that perhaps it's over, perhaps the death is done now, perhaps that person won't die...Telltale just didn't manage to get this across to me at all in its full run of this season. I didn't care to watch anyone die that died. I saw it coming. It was as it should be.'Not to say this is a bad game, I like it, it just lacks emotional impact.. except for the reason I recommend this:  There's like 5 branching paths that the ending can end on, each brought to that point by your decisions and each varying WILDLY from the other. Like.. this is freaking revolutionary for a Telltale game, I can't even begin to gush about how good of an idea it probably was to do this! The endings range from mediocre to heartbreakingly excellent... Like.. literally the ending I first got ripped my heart in half and did it WITHOUT BEING CENTERED AROUND A CHARACTER DYING IN MY ARMS. tl;dr Good Story; I liked it, but notot as good as Season 1. Worth your money.  "

												Season Two of the Walking Dead is another masterpiece in storytelling from Telltale, a developer who are quickly becoming one of my favourites thanks to this franchise and Wolf Among Us. I'm not sure if there's another developer out there on such a hot streak right now.In season two the player controls Clementine. At first I wasn't sure if this was a good idea. My interactions with her were the best parts of season one, especially seeing how she reacted to and learned from my decisions, and I was worried that her personality might be spoiled. However, I quickly found that it presented an interesting roleplaying opportunity that influenced the way I interacted with other characters. Being younger means not having a leadership role, and trying to be more persuasive rather than just taking charge. Meanwhile being physically weaker meant I had more respect for the bad guys' strength, and situations where I might have just attacked immediately in season one as Lee, I found myself being a lot more cautious.Along the way you'll meet lots of new characters as well as a couple of familiar faces. The dialogue is well written and voice acting is excellent. You'll encounter various threats from both the living and the dead, which result in some very tough choices. Most scenarios don't have an obvious best answer, and many consequences are unpredictable. You're just trying to do whatever it takes to keep everyone alive as you stumble from one bad situation to the next.The core gameplay mechanics remain intact. Most of the time you'll be making dialogue choices, many of which will influence the story in some way. Compared to season one there are less sections where you need to walk around and find objects to solve puzzles. I think this is probably the main reason why the episodes are shorter. I finished season 2 in 8 hours compared to 11 hours for season 1. Combat sections are again controlled by QTEs but they are relatively painless. I think there was only one section where I died multiple times. I didn't experience any bugs or crashes.My only real disappointment is the lack of effect carried through from my season one choices. There was a line of dialogue here and there, but nothing really significant.I highly recommend playing the Walking Dead. If you enjoyed season one, there is no reason to think you would be disappointed by season two.			"

												Season two was again a great story that has been told. But I had the feeling that this is even less of a game than season one has been. There is not really much to do, and it is quite impossible to fail or lose while playing The walking dead season 2. That beeing said, if you make decisions, these decisions are hard and seem to really matter for your world. I really liked The walking dead season 2. But if you expect more than just a minimum amount of interaction, you are expecting too much.			"

												Another season of heartbreak simulator, basically the same all around it has improved visuals, textures, although they're all still cartoony and it feels more of a independant game rather than well ya know, dlc or whatever you'd think of it as.Gameplay wise there's really not that much different, although first person shooty segment that made me smile in season 1 is gone here which kind of sucks but o welp.Graphics are pretty much close like i said though they feel different and they are slightly improved.If you played season 1 and/or 400 days then you owe it to yourself to complete the story and get this one too as it carries over the choices so perfectly actually that you won't feel it's a different game, still fun and heartbreaking though. :<			"

												It was a fun game to play. My only problem with it is that some of the situations you are forced to participate in don’t have a reasonable explanation as to why you are in fact such an integral part of the plan... I mean you’re playing as an 11 year old (if I’m not mistaken) but for some reason you seem to have a better understanding of complicated machinery than the adults in your group. That being said; the soundtrack is great and matches the atmosphere, I particularly enjoy the art for some reason xD. The voice acting is, in my experience not great, maybe it was just me but the voice and movement of the characters lips was out of sync for random lapses through the game. What i did really enjoy was how interactive they made running through hordes of zombies and how badass you feel when you take a walker out after taking out its knee and stabbing it through the head.

												Excellent expansion from season 1! One of the few games that makes me question my decisions in game and legitimately made me cry in the end! (One of the few games to have ever done that) Basically the game is an interactive story where you have to make tough decisions which often to lead to an either positive or negative effect...but sometimes it's not that black and white (just like real life)...Your decisions in game can affect the outcome of certain situations and how the other survivors see you. Game is depressing as ♥♥♥♥ but one of the few games to where I actually give a crap about the characters because you become invested in the hardships you go through and theres a ton of that since it's well the apocalypse and all that jazz...Anyways if you like story driven(interactive story) games not really focused around combat then this def worth buying...but like I said be prepared to get the tissues out unless you are a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Just gonna say this now, this is spoiler free.This game continues after the first season, and it is DEFINITELY worth buying if you've played and finished the first, and to those who haven't played neither the first or second, there's a lot to experience here.The game has a very nice and deep story to it, and it proves that a story can really make a game wonderful. There's multiple endings to this game which I really hope they branch off if they make a third season (Which totally seems like they will, it'd be blastphemy if they don't).It's good to see that the developers have improved how the game plays compared to the first as well. For example, holding the shift key will make you move a little faster, and instead of using the mouse wheel to scroll through actions, you have a circle which pops up with your options, and the dialogue options are much larger too. Not to mention the fact that the decisions which you make in this game feel like they have more of an impact, and you can make the story a lot more the way you want it to be.If you're a fan of this series, it's definitely worth looking in to, I'd recommend getting the first game and playing that as well before doing this one, so you aren't missing out on any bits of the story.

												Following in the footsteps of the critically acclaimed First Season, Season 2 had a very difficult task to match the emotional intensity the previous game bestowed. It's debatable which game is more emotional (I'd say their on par), but Season 2 is undoubtedly more intense than ever before.Sequels in any form are difficult. Whether it be games, movies or TV shows , it will always be hard to match the original, especially if it is held in such a high regard. I feel Season 2 has suffered some unfair criticism because of it. Season 2 had to do be very different from the first, it couldn't fall into the trap of copying everything that Season 1 did so well, otherwise people would have complained. Since you changed it up a bit people have complained about certain things. No matter what Telltale did, it was impossible for  them to please everybody.Clementine throughout this series has become in my opinion, one of the most consistent, well developed characters I have ever seen. With the options we're presented it's up the player to choose how they wish to develop the character. You can try hold onto her innocence as long as possible, or you can fall under the darker nature of the story I'd absolutely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a strong, emotional story. It has a very strong atmosphere, a great soundtrack and some unforgettable moments.			"

												If you played the first season of The Walking Dead Telltale game or you enjoy watching the show or the reading the comics.  You wont be disapointed in this second season of Walking Dead.  Just like in walking dead fashion you get tough choices and people around you die in this zombie horror world.  You now play as Clementine. Will you make it out alive as Clem? Well play and find out! More man tears or girl tears!!!  This point and click adventure game is really fun and if its on sale a must buy, an awesome game.			"

												Both seasons of the walking dead have been great. I enjoyed playing the first season so much that i played a second time with my whole family watching and they all loved it to the point were none of us could stand waiting for the next episode of season 2 to come out. There are a few episodes of season 2 and 1 that arent that great but when you combine the whole story its one of the best ive seen in a very long time. i highly recommend this game for the truly awesome, tear jerking, heart warming, depessing tale that it is.

												9.7/10.... Simple, the first game made me fall inlove with the series and this one was perfect for me except one flaw (which I'm going to put last simply because it is a spoiler!) This game is a great follow up to 400 Days (which didnt have as much in it as Id think, but a bigger impact on Season 2 than the entire first half of season 1) this game has the nice graphic novel art style that the first season used and the decissions in this one were much more thoughtful, even the small ones that really didnt change anything other than someones opinion for a short amount of time. This story really blew my mind away when... well when you play it you'll know the part I'm talking about. Although I wish they had explained the beginning a little more than they did, it was almost as if the game was picking up with the slow story that Season 1 had and doing the oppisite, where it would skip days, weeks, months at a time and there would be sudden weather changes in bursts. The one part I really didn't like was the fact that (This was the spoiler I talked about in the beginning, SPOILER!!!!) you can't get rid of Kenny no matter how hard you try.. The entire last two episodes I was trying to forgive Kenny and keep him but he just kept ruinning things for the group, the final choice of the Season was the best though... I cannot wait for the DLC and next Season!			"

												It has now been a few weeks since I've played Season 2 and I'm still not really sure how I felt about it.As a whole the game is fine.  I got a solid eight hours out of it, less than the ten or so it took me to complete 1 but still comparable.The music is still great and so is the animation style.  Choices are difficult and having a timer on them creates the illusion of tension: you need to act and you need to act now.  It plays like 1.Unlike Season 1 the episode transitions are more jarring.  The story is much, much more linear this time around than it was in S1 and each episode effectively starts where the last one ended without missing a beat.  Additionally, each episode ends on a pretty strong cliffhanger giving it a very television feel, suiting the game well considering it's labeling system of episodes and seasons.  Because of this tightness between the episodes, however, I very early on began wondering why this was produced in an episodic format.  While the transitions work well to support that, the narrative does not.  Episodic gameplay does not seem necessary and perhaps even devalues the core experience of playing Season 2.  Oh, and at the end of each episode are unskippable credits.  Yeah, I could have crashed the game to get around that but come on.  I get that some people may not have worked on the same episodes but would it have been so hard to remove these, or at least add a skip function?Gameplay wise not much as changed.  There is much, much less walking around, exploring small areas and interacting with the environment/characters.  Instead you spend the majority of your play time in chat cutscenes.  In that regard S2 feels much less like a game than 1 but it also focuses on the strong points of 1 as opposed to the weak navigation and point and click puzzle solving.Discard any concerns you have for Clementine serving as the player character as she fits the role pretty damn perfectly and much better than Lee in many circumstances.  Making tough choices with her has a lot more weight as you're now working with much more of a blank slate, and that's the beauty of these games.  They're not about zombies, or the story or the characters: they're about you, your choices and the story you want to tell with the character you're making.  Trust me when I say Clem is a much better fit for that role than Lee ever was.As an aside, the plot of episode 1 is pretty weak.  It very much felt like I was being manipulated with cheap story elements to feel a certain way.  After a few chapters the game picks up but the very early parts are extremely weak.  As a whole the plot is fine though it did feel like it was just shuffling about and wasting opportunities at times, which summarizes my feelings for the game.  It was alright and a good form of entertainment but compared to the long strides that S1 took, s2 felt like it was just killing time while setting up a much better S3. Do I recommend it?  Sure.  It may have overall felt like a weaker game than Season 1 but that's not saying much.  It's still a good game.			"

												This was pretty good. It's nowhere near S1, but if you liked S1 you'll be happy with what you get. If you didn't like S1 because of the action sequences, you definitely not like this. The action sequences are a lot less varied and generally worse. They just feel like filler most of the time. The pacing is also worse than in S1. There's a lack of the ""ups and downs"" that happen in S1, which is kinda numbing after a while.In short, if you really liked S1, you'll like this.			"

The story is incredible, the acting is very intriguing, and the options you make is even more emotional and sticks with even closer than in the first game.The story is very deep and the sensation of the hardships and burdens of the world around you is really shining through. I would say that Season 2 is more cold and harsh, so have that in mind if you where disturbed or otherwise from Season 1.This game is getting a 10 out of 10 from me and i am hoping for a franchise with a lot of sequals and standalone games to come.A must have.

												I was a bit hesitant to get into this season as I hoped it would be a completely new/seperate story.  This is not the case, as you play as one of the characters from the first season (taking place after the events of the first season).  However, after playing through the first three episodes I can say without a doubt this game is fantastic.  It's shaping up to be better than the first season - and that is no small feat.			"

												(NO SPOILERS HERE) This game really surprised me.  I thought there was no way it could be better than the first season.   But the ending of the final episode was -=AMAZING=-.Actually, the first ending I saw.. It was decent enough.  But when I handled the last major decision differently I got a completely different ending that blew me away.  I hadn't cried like that in years and years.It is very likely you will see the same ending I saw the first time you play it.  According to the ending statistics about 80% of you chose that same option.  After all, it's the most reasonable, logical choice.  This is a tragedy because most people will never see the other endings.  My advice for you is to go back and replay that last scene.  Don't go with logic.  Go with your heart.  This alternate ending is so much more resonant and powerful.  You'll thank me!There are more than two possible endings based on that final crucial decision.  I just can't watch them right now.  That second one was just too powerful.  I need to rest on it for a while.  Phew!			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing crazy. It will test your morals and make you question yourself, and after every major decision a part of you will want to go back and choose the other option. This game is brutal, it will make you care for characters and then make you watch each and every one of them die before your very eyes. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.But seriously, it is an amazing sequal. One thing the first one did better was character development. It made you interact with all the different characters and made you learn about their past and care for them. In the first game you play as an adult, so it seemed valid that most major decisions were made by you. In this game however, you play as Clementine, and 11 year old girl. It just seemed a little odd that everything always came down to you, and that everyone was so willing to listen to you and take your advice. These things are the only faults I found with this game, and they're very minor. I love this series, and I hope season 3 comes out soon.9/10			"

												This game takes your feelings and stabs them with a knife. Multiple times. But that isn't meant in a bad way. Just like the first Season of The Walking Dead it is really interesting to see the character developement in this game. This game (aswell as the prequel) are in my opinion one of the greatest pieces of art there is in video game culture at the moment. You may think the zombie theme is overused right now but this game is bringing this scenario to you on a new level. You start to personificate with Clementine and i personally partially sat in my bed thinking about the decisions i made in game even hours after i had played. I am not quite sure if i like it more than the prequel. The minor bugs that kinda bugged me in the first game aren't to be seen in this game. Still i for myself found it easier to personificate with Lee in the first game, which is probably caused by the fact that i am a near-adult man.In the end, I think of this game as one of the best sequels i could have imagined. The short time you will need for this game (it took me ~10h) is one of the very few drawbacks. Still a lot of people will find replayability in this game, just to see how other decisions would have influenced the game. If this game is ever on sale (and knowing Steam, it will be)buy it as well as the first season. It is more than worth the money.So. All summed up. Telltale never fails to make a story you will still remember in months. And this game is another great example for this.  One of the greatest experiences the gaming market has to offer at the moment.My personal rating: 92/100 I am already hyped for Season 3.			"

												Fantastic game, rich, deep emotional storyline that stands well on its own or following on from Season 1.My only critisism of the game would be the way it was released in seperate episode installments weeks apart from each other.  Instead or creating a sense of eager anticipation, buying the game early before all episodes were released, simply created a sense of frustration and annoyance.  If/when Telltale release a Season 3 I shall certainly not be rushing to buy it as soon as its available and will instead wait until all episodes have been created and released.Apart from this minor critisism the Walking Dead Season 2 is a must have for any fans of this genre.

												Season 2 of the Walking Dead lives up to the quality of the first one only this time the choices are tougher as we play as Clemintine, the young girl so use to losing everything. The second season enhances the experience offered to us in the first one with an easy to use user interface and more drama. This game purely focuses on the events after the first game and '400 Days' DLC- taking previous save files into account for how certain characters react or whether or not they even appear. The events vary in pace though still following the 'quick time' game mechanic. This games strength lies in the endings and the fact it does end for most.			"

												What an amazing and incredible game! A master piece! Regardless of awful graphics and odd at times camera work. The story telling, the characters and their relations and choices that they make and most of all little Clementine make it more of a interactive movie than a game. No! Not a movie, an art! And of the best possible kind, one that makes you think, feel and most of all leaves a mark upon you.The first season was phenomenal, this one's no worse. Very different but not worse. In season two Clementine's no longer a little scarred girl one has to keep an eye on at all times. This time, even though it's only months later, she's been through so much and seen more than anyone should in one life time that she seems to be the only real voice of reason amongst all characters. Every choice that you take, every little decision is counter parted by the consequences - be it good or bad. Just fnished it and still have goose bumps and are sort of overhelmed by it all...10/10 Would most definitely like to see how it all wraps up in the end (if season three ever comes out).			"

												Second season kicks off with a bang! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you scream in anger, it will make you clench your teeth in suspense. An emotional roller-coaster like no other. Loved every second of it.Although the choices feel somewhat familiar at times, the storyline is far from boring. Action sequences will give you sweaty palms and the dialogue sequences will make you scratch your head. On occasion you will have to make split second decisions you'll most likely regret in some capacity (but in a good way).This game does a good job in plowing through your psyche and exposing your attitudes towards everything.An absolute must-play not only for the fans of adventure games. Or zombies.			"

												Ultimately, I recommend this game, especially if you played TWD Season 1. In fact, if you haven't played Season 1 yet, I would HIGHLY recommend playing that first. Season 2 won't have as much of an impact without Season 1 first. Season 1 is one of my favorite games of all time. Without saying anything that might be a spoiler, let me just say that while Season 2 is a good game and I would definitely recommend it (especially when it goes on sale), I think it's a step down from Season 1. That being said, it's still a solid game, and it's well worth playing to continue the story of The Walking Dead. Good job Telltale Games. They have a knack for making you care about your decisions in their games.			"

												Years ago, I was told to watch Requiem for a Dream. It was so good they said. It was such an epic story. What it ended as, was 2 hours of mental torture to watch a sad kid cry after suffering the results of heroin abuse.Well, The Walking Dead Season Two is the Requiem of Dreams of video games.The story is amazing. It's a fun game. It really is.But I have never hated a set of writers more. I have never been so insanely angry at game creators for any reason at all. This game is hours and hours and hours of brutal torture for the player. Watch as a little girl is distrusted by everyone, and hated even by people she held dear, as she simply struggles to survive in a true hell on earth.400 days wont make you hate any of the new characters any less, but at least you'll understand why Bonnie is such a pathetic little.... no... no, this isn't the place for that.Trust nobody.

												I just finished the game. The feels. The feels.10/10But I do question the impact of your choices sometimes. It feels like it didn't matter sometimes.Also I didn't like how sometimes when a character died, there's almost no reaction from the characters (it felt like some characters didn't even notice that they died). Even if the a particular character liked/cared about the person who died.My first play through of all episodes (you get all episodes when you buy the game) lasted almost ten hours. There is replay value if you want to see what happens if you picked a different choice.The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a great game. I recommend while it's on sale. The best reduction for the game as of making this review is 75% off.			"

												DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A PARTIAL VISION OF THE GAME IN THE CURRENT STATE AS OF 1/17/2014.THIS REVIEW WILL GET UPDATED AS EACH EPISODE COMES OUT.Telltale's The Walking Dead is back with yet another season of heartbreaking zombie apocalypse stories.This time we control Clementine, the girl from season one, while she travels North to escape the madness in the cities. Controlling Clementine may sound crazy; she's a kid and all that. Telltale noticed that too I guess because they let some time pass between season one and this season so she can grow up a little in this world and roughen up. It worked. Clementine is a tough kid who grew up in a world of brutal and savage survival with bad people in each corner and surrounded by the dead.All actions in season one somewhat have repercussions in the events between last season and season two, and Clementine remembers all Lee taught her.In terms of technical factors, this game uses the same engine, albeit a little changed in terms of UI, but it's virtually the same gameplay and graphics. Remember, in this game the important thing is the story, not the rest. The engine is good enough for me and the graphics are inspired by the comic books so it's cool, and the gameplay is awesome as always with all Telltale games.Finally, if you're expecting a zombie shooter, go get DayZ or something like that. If you like adventure games like Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion, Sam and Max and all that, and love drama and zombies, this game is for you.Now, I'll begin reviewing each episode. This review will be updated as I play each episode as they come out. I'll try to keep it spoiler-free as much as I can.__________________________________________________EPISODE ONE: ALL THAT REMAINSThis episode has a chapter which serves as re-introduction, helping you to remember all that happened in season one, and makes the leap to the current events bringing you up-to-date with where and how the group (or what's left of it) is.However, soon after you start the game, tragedy will come. I mean, seriously. First 5 minutes and you'll already be crying, so you can expect that.After that sad part, all will brighten up a little. But it will be taken from you again. Yes. This game is an emotional rollercoaster.New characters will be introduced and you will see each of them develop, either by themselves or by the actions Clementine takes. I must say the new characters are really good and I expect a lot from them. From some I've already seen how they are and what they're capable of, how good and caring some are and just how sad or how crazy or bad others are. Also, Clementine is surprisingly good in reading other people. She could tell how they were just by listening to them a little. An useful skill I must admit, because in that world it's needed to know who you can trust.In the end, there will be a decision similar but not entirely equal to the one in A New Day. You will have to choose quickly this time, because now it has a timer and you being idle will count as an option too, leading to three possible outcomes. I encourage you try them all because they are all great.The next episode will be cool and will bring some unexpected (or totally expected?) surprises, as we can see in the trailer at the end of the game, which once again will reflect your actions and decisions from this episode.Season 2 is up to a great start, and I hope all episodes keep this quality standard. I really enjoyed this, as it is really as good as season one, which was perfect in every sense.Too bad we now have to wait for episode two. Well, I'll sit down until it's out... is it out yet!?!?!? __________________________________________________EPISODE TWO: A HOUSE DIVIDEDSeason 2 continues and it's starting to take shape! We did our waiting and I must say that although it was long and I suffered it, this episode had a lot of stuff in it and surprised me. I played it twice to see how many outcomes there were and I could see there were many, which is awesome because it's like having many stories.This episode brings back a character we thought lost, adds even more characters to the cast, and unmasks the main antagonist. We also get more character development and get to see the human nature at its finest. The apocalypse starts becoming more and more political. Tensions and issues begin to surface.The finale was great and it's there where we get to see the more different outcomes which dramatically change how we'll continue.All in all, it was an excellent episode, and I can't wait for the next. Too bad Telltale is taking so long to release these. I just hope they hurry and get the next episode for this (and The Wolf Among Us) out by at least April.__________________________________________________EPISODE THREE: IN HARM'S WAYThe most brutal The Walking Dead episode yet. Can't say anything else about this episode. All I can say is, after playing this, the Governor and Negan are sissypants compared to what you see here.I can't wait for the next episode.__________________________________________________EPISODE FOUR: AMID THE RUINSThis is where it all went downhill. We see now that the choices we made don't matter. There are choices in this episode that won't matter in the end. We'll see that even if we do or do not do something, it won't have effect in the future as things will be the same. I believe Telltale focused on The Wolf Among Us so much they didn't care about The Walking Dead anymore, because this is the laziest written episode yet.__________________________________________________EPISODE FIVE: NO GOING BACK... aaaaaaand it's still ridden with lazy writing. Every single thing that happened in this episode makes you think ""I played through all this to see THAT happening?"". I mean, it desperately tries to cling on to the past, like they're afraid that this season wouldn't do as well as the first one; it makes a lot of unnecesary reminders that Lee was the best, showing scenes from season one... YES, LEE WAS THE BEST, BUT IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. I feel like this season was a reminder that season one was great and nothing else. It's like the things that happened here didn't matter at all; all that matters is ""what would Lee do if he was here"". And this is why I feel like this episode fails altogether. Rushed, with twists and turns to the worst every time they could. How did it come to this?But hey, the ride was sweet while it lasted. I still recommend it because up until episode four it was worth playing. It still is, but the last two episodes really weren't as good as the first few. I blame The Wolf Among Us, which was awesome, and probably made Telltale have to cut a few things here and there from The Walking Dead to make the other game a success. But still pisses me off. Really, a lot.			"

												As much as I prefer the first game, this one has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of my love too. Following Clem after Lee's death remained interesting throughout to the end and, (potential spoiler I guess), seeing characters from 400 Days was even more interesting. The game obviously managed to give me as much feels as the first, having made me cry a couple of times. -Spoiler again-! The option to shoot Kenny was something I saved until last for the different endings. As much as I could've strangled him at times during the first game and this, I loved him as much as I loved Lee. Almost, any♥♥♥♥♥. But, yeah. Once I shot Kenny and had the conversation dialog pop up, I exploded in tears. Games never usually have an impact on me emotionally, but holy pencils. This did. Overall, story rich ofc and even a few laughs can be experienced, I'd recommend this game for sure!			"

												There are issues - many of them - with Telltale's follow up to one of their most successful titles. Relationships between characters galvanise in tepid fashion regardless of one's choices. Some choices fail to bear the tantalising payoffs that they tease. The supporting cast is no way as endearing enough to care about as their predecessors. Worst of all is the whole pacing of Season Two. But never before has a video game so unapologetically demanded the player to mold a young child in the palm of nightmare. The perennial choice here is define an optimist or a realist of this growing heroine and what type of survivor she will become in a world gone to ruin. Telltale makes an emotional bedrock out of this one particular character portrayal. Yes, guiding sweet Clementine onwards from her tearful ending in Season One is excessively cruel and often heartwrenching, ensuring that by its conclusion the innocence we all desperately wanted to save will be gone forever.

												Once again, a gritty, truly fracked up storyline. Clementine is much more grown up, and she is certainly no longer untainted or innocent, but any last shred of humanity she had is tested in this sequel. It is near impossible to play the game neutrally, so you are forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. Or, are they even evil? Or good? Is there a difference anymore?			"

												I don't believe anybody is really interested in reading my humble reviews anyway, but if you really do, then i expect you to have played the first game already. I do try to not spoil that much tho :)Of course i recommend the game. After that badass first game, the second season kept the high standards. The story is, again, very well written and has cliffhangers and unexpected moments everywhere. You can never pretend what is going to happen next. And you really catch yourself being speechless, because something happened you never expected or a situation or reaction didn't turn out as you thought. The developers really created a very thoroughful game. That's for certain.In case of the characters. They are as good as the once from the first game. A lot of different personalities. All as different as a bunch of desperate survivors can be. Some are sad, some are aggressive and some you like the moment you meet them the first time. And yet everybody can change the next moment. It all depends on how you play. Very good job. The graphics are still the same, but that isn't somethign negative per se. If you like that style you are happy if not you are either screwed or you try to deal with it. Trust me after some time you don't even notice it anymore because the story and characters are so fascinating. You just want to get on and on and on :)Some new game mechanics found their way into the game as well. Not many tho. It pretty much is more like a little enhancement. YOu have a wheel now where you can choose from different options that you can perform. Chatting or grabbing or looking. You cann decide it now via a simple mouseclick and don't have to scroll down now. Also there are now some new QTE. You can now dodge here and there and clem can run ...... i wouldn't call it run, but she can move faster now :)Other than that. The game is like the first one. Great. If you want an impacting heart wrenching story. Buy it. NAO:			"

												I loved the first season of this game and while I didn't think the second one was as strong and I played it in half the amount of time, even though I did not rush through anything - I  still throughly enjoyed the game.  I thought Clementine held her own as the lead and I didn't know if she could.  Still had a lot of great characters, though I have to admit I wasn't as involved with them as I was in the first one - just a couple I cared about (I don't want to say anything about it due to spoilers).  Still VERY much worth checking out and I will play the third one with open arms if they make one.  Again, I didn't cry... it was my allergies...			"

												While not a total let down, Telltale knows that very little will top the first season. So with that in mind, I think the whole season is actually pretty good. I was entertained mostly and while the episodes are short, who really wants them to drag it out? It was a quick and to the point aftermath of Season 1, and the ending (No Spoilers) was a good one, never going to top the original, but they knew that and gave us something a little different this time. I just wish that there was more choice/consequence variety in the series. While you would expect Season 2 to have a little more, it doesn't. I'd say it's worth a play if you enjoyed Season 1 and want to see the aftermath. Direct and to the point. A good game and I'd give it 7.5/10 for a good effort at following up the first.			"

												Just like season 1, I laughed and I cried.. but the second season of this amazing series is unfortunately the weaker of the two, although still a masterpiece in it's own right. The stakes are higher, and while season 1 has you bond with Clementine on a personal level, season 2 directly puts you in her shoes, allowing you to mold and shape her character even further. This was a brilliant move for a variety of reasons, as given Clementine's age, she's physically far weaker than Lee was in season 1. Instead, she has to approach dangerous scenarious by being quick and clever in order to survive, making you feel more helpless than you did in S1. This changes things up a lot and I'm very happy with the direction Telltale took. Additionally, depending on the choices you make during the final episode, you have access to a variety of drastically different endings that from the looks of things, will give everyone a very different season 3, thus increasing the replayability.Well done Telltale.. you've done it again.

												see the thing with the first TWD is that it had a ""meh"" plot, but the ending somehow manage to be better than the entire game itself, besides being really emotional; now this game is kinda different, the plot was a little flat but really dramatic and entertaining, i loved the fact that they included more endings, they are all diferent from each other and they all provide a good setting for a third season, but in my case the only ""emotional"" ending was the [spolier] kenny [/spoiler] ending, long story short, this game is beautiful, almost perfect, buy it and play it, simple as that			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 just shows how great story telling can be in video games, up there with Mass Effect and Fallout. This game has made me felt emotions few games have ever done to me, to anger to pain and even sadness. I hope they continue this trend to Season 3 and may it be one hell of a ride in that one. 10/10			"

I knew I was going to love this season but not as much as I ended up so in the end. I absolutely loved the game and cannot wait for season 3 even though this one is going to be based on Michone.

Summary (TL;DR)This is the second installment in TellTale's The Walking Dead series, and while I enjoyed the game, I did have my fair share of technical issues that didn't seem to be fixable.If you are reading this and wondering if the 400 Days DLC for Season 1 is worth it, I would say it's a 50/50 chance.The characters from that only make a small appearance with the exclusion of one character, but even with a randomly generated choice for the DLC, the game is still seriously playable without having had that in the first place.There are many jabs and pokes towards characters from the first season, and your choices as Lee have made an effect on Clemintine and how she does things. TTG also cleverly put Clemintine in a few of the same situations as Lee was in, but you will need to keep an eye out for that.If you loved the first season, the second will be just as enjoyable.Pros Great story Great graphics Fairly long gameplay (About 1 1/2 hours per episode) Has achievements Achievements can be earned in a single playthrough Controller support New Improved GUI Choices have a HUGE impact on the series now Many different endings Choices from Season 1 and the 400 days DLC carry over When running into a wall, Clemintine doesn't continue walking to the wall as it was in Season 1.Neutral Points No trading cardsCons Almost every choice you had made with characters from the 400 days DLC doesn't affect gameplay, with the exclusion of one character. Keeps asking for my Save File from Season 1 every time I start a new episode. Scene selection is only available (for me at least) for Episode one. Episode data didn't save when I tried to start the same episode back to where I was Too many different endings, and it will be confusing if you continue to play as Clemintine given all the different outcomes. Minor subtitle issuesRating8/10			"

												An interesting and exciting story as all set in the walking dead universe is.Though in the First game we were promised ""this game is changed and tailored to how you play"" and the amount of outcomes or ultimate changes were at MOST limited to non-existant.Thought it was a great game it wasn't tailored to how you play at all.Also this new Premise of ""you play as a little girl but people don't treat you like a little girl"" honestly doesn't seem clever but just extremely lazy writing, one of the characters has a daughter about 15 whilst Clementine is what 9 or 10? yet he cares for her but treats Clementine like she is dangerous. It simply does not seem realistic and whilst I can appreciate that stand-point someone not treating a little girl like a little girl should be a rare occurance, people are different and if we are supposed to believe everyone would just act like that I'm not buying it.Its simply another way of making a strong main character without taking too much of a time gap between where we saw Clementine and Lee so we know whats been happening yet not taking the time of writing it from a little girls perspective and how people would view her, every single person treating her like she's is a 30 year old male is just unrealistic and lazy.There has only been one episode of this game so far and buying a game and getting a small amount of playtime with months in-between the next episode is a bit of a joke, but I can't make a full review based on this one episode but if the characters start treating her a little more realisticly according to what she is (which isn't ment to be positive all the time just accurate) and they do infact give real story and end-game altering choices in this installment then I would say get the game but for now I can't make a solid judgement.

												After the long wait for the Season 2, I have finally finished it. I will not give any spoilers, because that is the single-most irritating thing to read if you actually want to read a review. This is the first point-and-click game I've played. The series is enthralling. The first season was driven by the need to save Clementine. Nothing else matters. It was always to ensure her safety. This season manages to be different by mainly being driven by self-preservation. In this way, I do not think it is as emotionally intense, since I make the first-hand decisions to stay alive. Still, I try everything I can to keep those I care about alive, and in brilliantly irritating fashion, sometimes, it's just not possible. The music, is one of the strongest components of the game for me. It is a constant reminder of those left behind and the mistakes made throughout the series. It is truly whelming when the theme music is on and there are times when it makes your heart cringe. People that do not like this style of gaming say they would rather just watch a TV series instead. I can stead-fastly say that this series has captivated me more than any TV show has ever. All I can do now is sit and wait for Season 3 to come out (which I was extastic to hear, has been green-lit). Fantastic story, great music, comic book true graphics, decent character development, and a whole lot of feels, I would 100% recommend this game.			"

												Following the events and choices of the first season, you take control of Clementine, attempting to survive not only the undead, but also the living in a zombie-plagued world.Improving heavily on the elements of the first season, the second season is worth every dollar and hour you spent on the first - and more.The overall production quality and polish make this season feel more like an interactive movie rather than some convoluted, zombie-filled puzzle game. You can really see and feel the effort that went into improving and out-performing the first season. The choices and story in this season don't feel like they're being sacrificed by obligatory puzzle-game mechanics; and the dialogue doesn't feel awkwardly forced for unnecessarily meaningless drama to cover up the blatant puzzle-game focus which dominated the first season. The elements in the second season flow with harmony, complementing eachother, rather than competing with eachother.With improved graphics, style, scenery, and atmosphere, the settings and faces of the characters are much more realistic, and the game had a major improvement in production quality overall. Very polished.With improved controls and intuitive interaction with the settings, puzzles, and QTE's, there are no more annoying hicups from crappy design flaws, and NO MORE ambiguously written choices which end up doing the opposite of what you intended.The dialogue and reactions from the characters are MUCH more realistic and believable, and easier to connect to and be immersed with in the story.MAJOR improvements were made in the writting of the story, focusing on many heavy themes about life, death, trust, redemption, hope, and survival.I cried.

I also liked how you see Clem is now molded and still being molded by the apocalypse. The fun choices come back and you get to decided to be Badass, B!tch or little girl Clem for the game. I chose a mixture of Badass and B!tch Clem. The end of Season 2 was better than how it started because your option if choice could of gone 3 ways. But somehow and someway Telltale with make people start off Season 3 the same. I just hope they don't.

												I have to say that if you enjoy walking dead you will enjoy this game very much even more then season 1 of the walking dead. In season 2, the story continues and gets crazier and crazier the more you progress through the game. Even if you dont like the walking dead, you still will love this game and have emotions at moments of the game for characters and actions that happen. Season 2 left me wanting even more for this game, I was pumped when I heard that they announced a season 3  for the walking dead game even though it looks like its far off from realese due to TellTale making several other amazing emotional games like this like game. Everybody NEEDS to play this series.This is one of the few games that made me cry in my whole gaming experience other then a few other games but there really arn't many games that do this to you. That is what makes this game so awesome ontop of the storytelling its a long rollercoaster throughout the game to survive. You get to make decisions that affect the story which is cool so its almost asking what you would do if this was you in this situation and what you choose effects the story and your choices carry over to the next season etc. Two words, BUY IT!

												See.. This game has everything you would point for ""point and click"" action. It binds your save games(if you have them) from season 1, and changes the season 2 episode accordingly.Season 2 seems to be improved at first sight, and this time you're really gonna find yourself making decisions, which will make you wanna play the same episode again and again, to see how you can change it.To put it simple. I bought the game today at around 11.30(CET+1), and I now (at 18.30(cet+1)) I find myself having finished episode 3, and wanting to complete episode 4.So in  short: If you like the first one, then you gotta have this one also.FYI:Only downside (at the moment) is that you can't skip cutscenes or the credits after each episode. I don't know if this is only when you play through the first time, or if you just can't. That sucks a bit.			"

												On its own I can definitely recommend getting the second season of the 'Walking Dead'. You will be a little lost with out playing the first one though. Despite all my griping about the game and how I won't be getting the next season in the series I can still safely recommend that you get this game. The story is still really strong and compelling and will drive you to tears just as much as the last game, although the lack of any real choice might equally drive you to tears when you are on your third play through and its all the same. The game also looks and sounds just as good as the last game. But, the lack of any new technical updates might be viewed as a minus by some people. Like I told my friend, I rate this game ten out of ten, but I won't be buying again.If you want, you can find a more extended review here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-walking-dead-season-two.html.

												Ho...um, okay. So I had previously bought all the 1st season on xbox and intended to get S2 as well. I kept putting it off and off and off even when S2 finished and released on PC, it wasn't until the day I wrote this review that I bought both it AND S1. I've already completed S1 on xbox and I just played the first episode of S2. This game is something else let me tell you. There isn't any middle ground or any sort of ""oh you didn't really decided anything, don't worry, it'll happen anyway"". Every time you have to make a split second decision on this you feel the panic as if you were actually there and thats what truely captures that frightened, survivor feel. Without spoiling anything, imagine if you have to choose between going with one person and choosing another, its a panicked situation and you don't have time to plan out the decision so choose quickly and choose NOW. These make or break scenarios which are scattered both obviously and subtley are what makes this and any other similar telltale game a masterpiece. Its been beautiful watching Telltale become the powerhouse in game and story telling that they now are. I hope they keep making fantastic games.More important however, is that you buy this game, you will definetly not regret it.			"

												Following in the footsteps of the critically acclaimed First Season, Season 2 had a very difficult task to match the emotional intensity the previous game bestowed. It's debatable which game is more emotional (I'd say their on par), but Season 2 is undoubtedly more intense than ever before.Sequels in any form are difficult. Whether it be games, movies or TV shows , it will always be hard to match the original, especially if it is held in such a high regard. I feel Season 2 has suffered some unfair criticism because of it. Season 2 had to do be very different from the first, it couldn't fall into the trap of copying everything that Season 1 did so well, otherwise people would have complained. Since you changed it up a bit people have complained about certain things. No matter what Telltale did, it was impossible for  them to please everybody.Clementine throughout this series has become in my opinion, one of the most consistent, well developed characters I have ever seen. With the options we're presented it's up the player to choose how they wish to develop the character. You can try hold onto her innocence as long as possible, or you can fall under the darker nature of the story I'd absolutely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a strong, emotional story. It has a very strong atmosphere, a great soundtrack and some unforgettable moments.			"

It does not tend to bother me that decisions made in Telltale games are largely illusionary, but this was the first time that I felt what I was doing was inconsequential in the grander scheme of things (aside from the ending, that is. I will gladly give them that one.)The plot also did not seem as engaging as in season one, but a very likable cast and protagonist more than made up for it, as far as I'm concerned.

												WDS2 continues from S1 with Clementine escaping the chaos, continuing her journey with some familiar friends.  In the WD tradition things head south quickly and we begin the next chapter in this excellent interactive story.In terms of gameplay there have been a few small changes from S1, primarily in that the narrative and characters are getting more emphasis as I believe they should in this format.  There are no actual puzzles to solve here; however there are occasional moments of interaction and minor exploration.  There are some QTEs also, possibly more than the previous game, which succeed in creating tension.The big emphasis hewever is shaping Clementine through her frequent dialog choices.  Will she be cold and heartless?  Will she be reserved but empathetic?  Will she be courageous and pious?  There are many more dialog choices in this season, and the impact on the way other characters perceive Clementine is noticeable.  As with last season, your choices can impact who lives or dies... although in some situations you have no choice but to determine how Clementine deals with the death of a friend.As with S1 the general story progression is fixed but minor plot points and character relationships can be influenced by your actions and dialog.  You could replay the game and try some different choices but I suspect the outcome would not be very rewarding.Graphically the game feels a bit improved but only incrementally.  The animation seems a bit smoother and the facial expressions are also improved.  The style remains hand drawn cartoon-inspired which is appropriate.All in all I'm glad that Telltale decided to focus on the narrative and character development.  Rarely does a game invoke an emotional response like this one did.  I am looking forward to another season of this series and will snatch it up for sure.9/10 "

												I can't even remember a 'recent', single-player game that has hooked me in like this.The gameplay isn't its strong suit. Hell, it's barely more than a point-and-click.No. The strength is in the characters and the choices.The Walking Dead got its hooks into me within the first 15 minutes. Then, it wouldn't let me go until I was crying in the foetal position because of the choices I had made.It's pretty rare for a game to have characters that you genuinely care about, not just modern titles.The Walking Dead has the best characterisation I've seen for a long time. Clementine (and Lee from Season 1) is one of the most sympathetic characters out there.It's really tough to describe. It's something you have to experience first-hand.If you enjoy single-player experiences like I do, you're doing yourself a disservice by not buying The Walking Dead Seasons 1 and 2. Seriously.This gives me hope that not every single damn game that comes out from now will have ♥♥♥♥♥♥, tacked on multiplayer because that's 'all people want anymore'.10/10, will definitely play again.Christ, it's been a while since I rambled like that.

												The Walking Dead Season 2 is a very soulful, realistic title, which introduces well-made game mechanics and thinking strategies, it always has you thinking each moment of the game, and puts you in the protagonist's place and state of mind. There are also many different ways you can play the game as well, as every decision changes the future. As for the characters, they sure do pack a punch, they are spirited, very well-animated and Telltale games sure did know how to make them. This is not just a videogame, it makes us think on what we would do, think, and act on real-time situations. And not to take every decision, day, or moment for granted.			"

												Just like season 1, I laughed and I cried.. but the second season of this amazing series is unfortunately the weaker of the two, although still a masterpiece in it's own right. The stakes are higher, and while season 1 has you bond with Clementine on a personal level, season 2 directly puts you in her shoes, allowing you to mold and shape her character even further. This was a brilliant move for a variety of reasons, as given Clementine's age, she's physically far weaker than Lee was in season 1. Instead, she has to approach dangerous scenarious by being quick and clever in order to survive, making you feel more helpless than you did in S1. This changes things up a lot and I'm very happy with the direction Telltale took. Additionally, depending on the choices you make during the final episode, you have access to a variety of drastically different endings that from the looks of things, will give everyone a very different season 3, thus increasing the replayability.Well done Telltale.. you've done it again.

The first season was the first game to ever bring me to tears and I'm hoping the finale will do the same. TellTale has outdone themselves and has made a game that I can talk to my friends about and come back again and again to get different endings and feelings. The decisions are hard and even though at some points you wonder why every one is looking to a little girl for help you can forgive and forget because it gets intense and you need to hlp two people, but you know one of them will die. I just hope that TellTale can keep this series going long enough for us to get a great ending, but short enough that it doesn't get boring.			"

Since there's so much time inbetween each episode, I'll often replay the chapter using different choices such that after a month I have no idea which playthrough I'm experiencing.+The entire (completed) game goes on sale for 60% on steam the same day the final chapter is realeased.   Really?  So I could buy chapter 1 for $24 or chapters 1-5 for $9 and finish the game at the same time?  Just... what?It's a really great game being sold by a great company in a terrible format.  I would have gladly waited the year or two to play the entire thing in settings chosen on my leisure.  I loved the game, but I feel like I can only recommend future Tell Tale Episodic adventures once the completed packaged is released.  Other than that, I'm actually quite a happy customer.			"

												While the overall story is still very gripping, I feel that there is very little actual choice when it comes down to it. While decisions in the first game would not always result in drastically different outcomes, it felt like there were sufficient real choices to make the game fun to play 5 times through and still leave avenues of choice unexplored. The second game was dull the second playthrough with far too many linear instances where once you know what is going to happen it becomes a very tedious trek from point A to point B with atmospheric effects that only worked the first time because you had no idea what would happen, but subsequent times felt like you were walking through a cheap haunted house yawning at the ghostly moans and twitching curtains. Aside from the lack of replayability, I found myself often wondering why tough guys who had apparently survived the hostile new zombie world thus far were suddenly putting their lives in the hands of a small girl they barely knew. While Lee in the first game was a capable, quick thinking young adult that I found was very easy to trust, it felt very wrong that the same trust was put in a small girl, who was often quite frightened herself. Yet if you enjoyed the first game, you don't care to play the game to death and you can see past the few thinly veiled plot tweaks designed to make our character the hero, then I would recommend this second season as good fun, intense and well drawn.

I found certain conversation replies were not near the extent as they should have been especially if it was myself in that situation, but I suppose that is down to me as you are playing as an eleven year old girl.

In season two you play as clem continuing her jouney the this post apocalyptic world. You continue on with Omid and the other lady who is preganent and you are with them for the very begining of the game until things go awry. You are split up to fend for yourself until you meet another group of survivors. It is sort of a cliché where they were all living there for a long time until you show up and things take a turn for the worst. you meet one of the groups enemies named Carver and have to deal with him for a while. Also one of the characters from season one comes back. If you have seen the pictures of the game in the store you will have seen who it was but if not try and guess who it is.

												((SPOILER ALERT)) There were a few flaws in my oppinion, one of which being the fact that near the end when Clem is shot, the issue is brushed aside. They were more worried when she go slapped or when Sarah got slapped than when Clem gets shot. Aside from that, I honestly only saw a few small things here and there. All-in-all it's a great game, if you've played the first and have yet to play the second, I would urge you to do so.			"

This is a review-in-progress; only episodes 1-3 are available as of this reviewOverallThe Walking Dead: Season 2 game, like its predecessor, is story driven game that is able to create the same sense of mystery, suspense, and action.  Improving on a lot of the systems, you have chances to mend broken relationships and create all new connections with new and old characters as you continue your story through the eyes of Clementine.ReviewThe Walking Dead: Season 2 continues a few months after the events in season 1 bringing together a whole new cast of characters with characters from its predecessor where new connections, relationships, and decisions will be formed.  Along with the new characters is a new perspective, where you once playing as an adult who had the strength to deal with the walkers head-on, you now play as Clementine, a young girl who has to use her wits in order to survive.  As with the predecessor, you are in control of your life, making various decisions for good or for bad to help mold Clementine into the character that you want her to be seen as; I feel as though the decisions have been changed for the better as they still impact you, but will not create as drastic of changes as to how each character views Clementine.  Although your decisions can change certain outcomes to an extent, you are generally tied to the story and will be limited in what can actually be changed.  Although the changes may be limited, the story is still full of mystery, suspense, and action to lead the player to want to know what comes next.Pros+ Unique story+ Improved decisions system+Connect with characters+ Point and click styleCons- Decisions cause limited impact towards the world- Episodic, can take a month or two for the next episode			"

												I enjoyed this just as much as season 1, except for the ending. I feel that season 1 had a much more impactful ending. Although Season 2 seems to have more available endings, only 1 or 2 really leave you feeling a sense of closure.One gripe I do have with season 2 is that it seems to provide even less choice to the player than season 1 did. It frequently gives the illusion that you are making an important decision but in the end, it doesn't actually matter (the same events occur regardless). In one instance, you have a chance to save a major character - if you do so, the character still ends up getting killed later in the episode anyway regardless of what you chose.However, the story and the characters are all still really incredibly interesting and well-written, as always. This is still yet another fantastic experience crafted by Telltale Games, and if you enjoyed Season 1 you really need to play this.			"

Very hard not to play this game all the way through in one sitting and you are in luck as of now since no painful waiting for the next episode to come out.

												Finish Season 1 and 400 Days and bought Season 2 immediately. Didn't expected much for this sequel, but it begins in the TWD style, shocking us with unexpected events and situations. In this game you play as Clementine, and you have sort of 3 ways to develop her, like kind, badass and survivalist (screw everyone else). I felt pity of Clem almost all the time (damm screenwriters) so I choose a mix between badass and suvivalist, killing (leaving to die) everybody that was intering with Clem's plans without leting people notice it though.

												This game has the best history i ever have played, and this game takes you on a giant trip of the feels. The animation of this game is great, and that you can shoose by yourself what you want to continue in the game. ITS AWESOME! And at the part in the last episode when she wakes up with Lee i was like ''omg... no.. no.. is all this just a dream? have i played all this for nothing?'' (but i found out that when i was talking to Lee, that was the dream.) at the end of this game when i shoosed to kill Jane but not Kenny, in the end i was crying, yeah.. crying. This history makkes you cry, just saying. Im giving this game 15/10 because it's good and it make me really  feel like im in the game, the animation is great, you can shoose your own story, and more.. If you are going to bye Season 2 and haven't bye the first one, you MUST bye Season 1 to really be in the game if you ask me, you know. Be sure you sit alone and (use Headset) when you are playing this game.. Trust me it will be much better if you do that. I dont know what more to say so. Peace! and have a nice day			"

												Somehow just not as engaging as the first game. It's possible that the simple lack of novelty is the problem, but it feels more like the story just isn't engaging. One problem is that the biggest character to return from the first game (other than clementine) is one that was incinsistent and non-sympathetic...it's not like ""hey, there's someone we know, great!"", it's more like ""Oh geez, that (expletive)? I thought/hoped he/she was dead!""Anyway...feels like kind of a swing and miss to me, like the magic's gone this time. Still recommended if you liked the first game and want to know what happens to Clementine, but another case of ""if you only play one, you should play the original"".			"

												My impression after Episode 1:Walking Dead Season 2 is phenomenal just like season 1 of the Walking Dead.Its literally a feels simulator. So much emotion in just a 1 hr and 30 min. I am so excited for the upcoming episodes based on how good the first episode is. Telltale games are expert storytellers.My impression after finishing Episode 5:Telltale does it again with a shocking finale to an excellent game. The choices you have to make are excruciating. By the end of the episode, you feel as if you truly lost some good friends. I rarely if never feel emotional after a game but this game is an exception. Telltale knows how to pull on your heartstrings. If you can make it thru the end without shedding a tear, you are not human. This game overall deserves a 10/10. Worth every penny and every second of your time. If you plan to only play one game this year, this along with Telltale game's other masterpiece Wolf Among Us should be on that short list. I can't wait to see how Telltale will try to one up this emotional roller coaster with season 3. This is easily a contender for best story of 2014 and dare I say GOTY. At this point, please do yourself a favor and just buy this game and play it through to the end.			"

Telltale deserves much respect for their ability to continually create a story that allows the player to genuinely invest themselves within in. This ability to emotionally rope the player in is The Walking Dead’s greatest strength, and something that the writers of the television show could stand to learn from Telltale.""-Read the full review here[www.entertainmentbuddha.com] "

												The Walking Dead Season 2 is a very soulful, realistic title, which introduces well-made game mechanics and thinking strategies, it always has you thinking each moment of the game, and puts you in the protagonist's place and state of mind. There are also many different ways you can play the game as well, as every decision changes the future. As for the characters, they sure do pack a punch, they are spirited, very well-animated and Telltale games sure did know how to make them. This is not just a videogame, it makes us think on what we would do, think, and act on real-time situations. And not to take every decision, day, or moment for granted.			"

												Spoiler/剧透预警行尸走肉第二章：Everyone  is ♥♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ except Clem and Kenny. 最爱:Kenny无论kenney做错了什么，无论他的暴脾气如何，无论他如何怪异.在第一部里面，是他修好了船。第二部里面，是他修好了卡车。Kenney他其实就是游戏中的Rick. 这个顶天立地的男子汉，敢爱敢恨.第一部里面失去了老婆孩子，仍然坚强的活着. 第二部里面失去了新的爱人，情绪几近崩溃，最后还是去照顾那个孕妇(♥♥♥♥♥). 最后孕妇（♥♥♥♥♥）死了之后，kenney自然而然的承担起照顾孩子的责任. 最后Jane居然把孩子藏起来考验Kenney，Jane不明白人性经不起考验，这是多么stupid，所以最后她被kenney杀死，我觉得她罪有应得. 而Kenney，最后为了Clem和孩子，放弃自己进入营地，真是感天动地。果断选择和kenney一起。个人感觉是完美结局。Kenny作为一个男人，孤独的男人，他承担的太多，最后被几个♥♥♥♥♥，♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 各种judgement，如同Jane所说，那个什么狗Mike，俄国boy还有那个情妇背后议论kenney，你们几个垃圾有什么资格。屁都不会，Kenney干掉了黑帮头子，kenney是团队的支柱。下面开始判刑：最想他们死而不能死的：1.俄国boy，根本就是个脑残玩意。从clem跟他说，我是个孩子，能别用枪指着我吗。这狗比无动于衷。就知道这是个垃圾。于是，后面kenney几次要毙了他，垃圾团队不听，终于酿成大祸。2.Mike，这个叛徒。你放了俄国boy就算了，还他妈给他枪，这下好了，这狗比成了射击clem的帮凶。3.孕妇， 这就是个长舌妇，burden，以为自己坏了个不知道谁的种就可以成为中心了？大声叫引丧失，根本不关心clem的死活。最后她变丧失了，我就像rick一样，迫不及待给她脑袋来一枪，真是爽下面是喜爱但有致命缺点的：1.Luke，本来对luke很有好感的。但是他以为clem被咬了就把clem摔下来，从此路人。期间一直呛他，没帮他说过话。直到最后，冰里面他救了clem，才终于原谅了他。 LUKE其实是个挺矛盾的人，要怪只能怪他太年轻，老一点多一些担当和决断就更好了。2.Jane，一度很喜欢Jane，对clem很像一个大姐姐。但是她犯了致命错误，最后时刻她本可以不藏孩子。人性不能考验这是多年都说过了的。好人也可能上头干出出格的事，对我来说最后一件事就是一种挑衅。所以Jane你死的不冤，怪不了kenney。要怪怪你自己作死。3.情妇，就是400天里面打死别人老婆的。她给我的感觉就是weak，不能自己拿主意。最后和叛徒二人组出逃。在clem受伤以后才幡然醒悟。不想再说什么。			"

												It was a fun game to play. My only problem with it is that some of the situations you are forced to participate in don’t have a reasonable explanation as to why you are in fact such an integral part of the plan... I mean you’re playing as an 11 year old (if I’m not mistaken) but for some reason you seem to have a better understanding of complicated machinery than the adults in your group. That being said; the soundtrack is great and matches the atmosphere, I particularly enjoy the art for some reason xD. The voice acting is, in my experience not great, maybe it was just me but the voice and movement of the characters lips was out of sync for random lapses through the game. What i did really enjoy was how interactive they made running through hordes of zombies and how badass you feel when you take a walker out after taking out its knee and stabbing it through the head.

												These games are amazing and splendid to play, I would highly recommend them to others. Furthermore they are the only games that I have played where the player gets emotional when a character comes to pass and nervous towards upcoming decisions, which I think is spectacular because the game developers have created a game where the player is totally engulfed into the world of Clementine and series one Lee's world in an apocalyptic Earth. Also the graphics of the games are I think based upon comic drawings and this adds a complete edge to it because everything looks unfamilier so you have to get used to all of the changes. Everytime you make a decision you have to contemplate the outcomes throughout the whole of the game as every choice alters your game experience. So overall well done everybody who went into the creation of this game you have created a masterpiece.			"

The story continues where the last left off and delivers the same if not better tense moments than the last.

												I can't even remember a 'recent', single-player game that has hooked me in like this.The gameplay isn't its strong suit. Hell, it's barely more than a point-and-click.No. The strength is in the characters and the choices.The Walking Dead got its hooks into me within the first 15 minutes. Then, it wouldn't let me go until I was crying in the foetal position because of the choices I had made.It's pretty rare for a game to have characters that you genuinely care about, not just modern titles.The Walking Dead has the best characterisation I've seen for a long time. Clementine (and Lee from Season 1) is one of the most sympathetic characters out there.It's really tough to describe. It's something you have to experience first-hand.If you enjoy single-player experiences like I do, you're doing yourself a disservice by not buying The Walking Dead Seasons 1 and 2. Seriously.This gives me hope that not every single damn game that comes out from now will have ♥♥♥♥♥♥, tacked on multiplayer because that's 'all people want anymore'.10/10, will definitely play again.Christ, it's been a while since I rambled like that.

												See.. This game has everything you would point for ""point and click"" action. It binds your save games(if you have them) from season 1, and changes the season 2 episode accordingly.Season 2 seems to be improved at first sight, and this time you're really gonna find yourself making decisions, which will make you wanna play the same episode again and again, to see how you can change it.To put it simple. I bought the game today at around 11.30(CET+1), and I now (at 18.30(cet+1)) I find myself having finished episode 3, and wanting to complete episode 4.So in  short: If you like the first one, then you gotta have this one also.FYI:Only downside (at the moment) is that you can't skip cutscenes or the credits after each episode. I don't know if this is only when you play through the first time, or if you just can't. That sucks a bit.			"

												Finish Season 1 and 400 Days and bought Season 2 immediately. Didn't expected much for this sequel, but it begins in the TWD style, shocking us with unexpected events and situations. In this game you play as Clementine, and you have sort of 3 ways to develop her, like kind, badass and survivalist (screw everyone else). I felt pity of Clem almost all the time (damm screenwriters) so I choose a mix between badass and suvivalist, killing (leaving to die) everybody that was intering with Clem's plans without leting people notice it though.

												NON-SPOILER REVIEWThe Walking Dead: Season 2 by TellTale Game's is a very much appreciated sequel to the riveting masterpiece that was Season 1. What is the fate of Christa and Omid? Your dearest Clem?Walking Dead Season 2 has a lot of similar aspects to Season 1, but with a better UI, graphics, and just about everything. Dialogue feels more fluid, and controlling Clementine is quite enjoyable, and you'd be surprised at her bravery. Overalll, Walking Dead Season 2 is a great sequel that left me wanting more. If you've never played Walking Dead, buy the first one, and if you enjoy that, definitely this!If you have played the first one and you liked it, you'll definitely like this.SPOILER REVIEWWalking Dead Season 2 opens up with Clem walking with a pregnant Christa and a still cheerful Omid. Omid tells you to clean up, and as your in a bathroom cleaning up, a scavenger walks in and steals your gun, threatening you. Omid comes in slowly, and as he approaches your assaliant, the door shuts making a loud noise. The scavenger turns around and promptly shoots Omid in the chest.Christa comes in and shoots the scavenger dead. Bestowed with dreadful grief.A year later, you and Christa are in a forest, and suddenly when Christa goes out to find wood, she becomes captured by bandits.This is the setup for Season 2, and it is as riveting as it is tearjerking. The story continues on, but I wish not to explain all its anomalies for they differ from your choices, as do all TellTale games...This Episode seemed to merely set up the plot, and I actually found myself missing the locales of Season 1. Hopefully though, maybe we can meet some old faces. Some possibilities are: Lily, Molly, and Kenny, supposing he survived the zombie attack, and because of what Clem(entine) says at the end of the Episode 2 teaser.""I thought you were dead.""9.75/10An overall great game.

												This game makes you cry not kidding...... The strory is up to 10/10 of movie standerds and there are so many different endings. The consequences of your choices may do noting, change your relationship with someone  or kill someone and make your cry ;( . After this game no matter what gender you are you FEEL like you are Clemintime and you are in the apocalypse. The game macanics work magically with the point and click gameplay style at first you may find it boring but then it just ...... words can not explain. The moment you think the group you are in are safe something happens and in this game you find someone not saying who for those who have played the first game and not shore if this game is worth but when you find him you will nit look at any more the one option to humg him :) . This game somehow (I was not expecting it) was miles better then the first one when you see Clemintime make the choices no child should make it makes you feel as if you are loosing who she was in the first game but you can see glimses of her through out the game. I feel the main object of the game is not to survive but to keep Clem and the group from becoming monsters and no not the walkers but monsters who have no emotion. The only downfall of this game is that there is a few technical hiicups now and then but they won't bother you in the slightest.  In conclusion if you havn't played the first one buy that and if you enjoy it buy this and if you have allready played the first one (the chances are that you enjoyed/that game was your life) buy this ;) 10/10			"

												Somehow just not as engaging as the first game. It's possible that the simple lack of novelty is the problem, but it feels more like the story just isn't engaging. One problem is that the biggest character to return from the first game (other than clementine) is one that was incinsistent and non-sympathetic...it's not like ""hey, there's someone we know, great!"", it's more like ""Oh geez, that (expletive)? I thought/hoped he/she was dead!""Anyway...feels like kind of a swing and miss to me, like the magic's gone this time. Still recommended if you liked the first game and want to know what happens to Clementine, but another case of ""if you only play one, you should play the original"".			"

The action sequences were spectacular just like in TWAU ( one of it's strong points), I didn't like some of Clementines decisions it felt irresponsible but then again I think that's what they are going for by playing as a child so if that's the case they nailed it!Clementine knows how to survive man!  She's tough.  I was skeptical at first playing as a child but the concept of how to play her just makes it even more interesting.  9/10 Great start.			"

												This game continues the tragic story of a young girl named Clementine. She is a little older, wiser and at . Great character development and story will keep you glued to the computer. Sometimes you loose the feeling of having any sort of choice as the writers seem to go through the numbers from scene to scene. Lots of twists and turns though as well as suprises. Some of the episodes may not be as engaging as season 1, however the game still manages to keep an emotional connection for the player. Hopefully news of season 3 will be comming soon.

												Among the most intense and gutwrenching experiences I've had in a video game.  As with the first season, the only complaint I can really raise is the lack of dynamic deaths-- losing and retaining survivors more frequently, and longer-term, based on one's own actions (or inactions).  Overall this builds on everything that made S1 great, further cementing Clementine as video gaming's most unsuspected badass.			"

												After completing the first episode of The Walking Dead: Season 2 these are my thoughts*roll cheap television intro with quite possibly 70's music*Okay, scratch the intro, lets talk about before I played the game. So when I first played the first episode of The Walking Dead: The Game, I was a bit skeptical, I'll be honest,  because it just didn't fully capture the vibe of the comics or the TV show, however, being the major TWD fanboy I am, I stuck with it, and my god am I glad I did! Everything about it was so perfectly done... okay well maybe not the interface... or all the glitches..and bugs...Well, my friends! I can safely say that The Walking Dead: Season 2, has changed up the Interface (for the better) and it is now bug-free (well it was in my playthrough at least)! When they announced Season 2 of this beloved cult icon videogame I so heavily adore, I also noticed that they had just been working on another game (The Wolf Among Us) and what's this..? they have just announced 2 more games.. Tales From the Borderlands and Game of Thrones games..? All while making TWD:S2, this got me a little worried that the story will drop off or that there will be a little less effort put into TWD:S2, Yet the good people of Telltale Games have made yet another hit, this game is gripping and it is intense and my god is it unforgiving, everything you loved about Lee is starting to shine through Clem, she is brave and she is strong and she is oh so tough. I'm not going to spoil anything but there is one point in this game which is in. your f**king face.it forces you to watch because if you dont, theres no getting through that section! I found myself shuddering with every action I had to make in that section so much so that I actually said to myself.. wait. its just a game and felt like a complete fool but I didnt care because it just reminded me of the sheer emotional and gut-wrenching power of Telltales writing and excecution of their gameplay! Now while we're on the topic of the writing of this game, I was also worried when I heard it was being written by different people, but wha-la! Another extensively incredible game from Telltale Games, the only complaint, which isn't even really a complaint, its more of a complaint im proud to say that I have, is that now i have to wait for the next bloody episode! Overall this game is already amazing, a very solid start (unlike season 1) to what looks to be another incredibly heart-stopping season, of The Walking Dead, and man, it feels good to be back.Would I reccommend it? Read the top of the review dumbass!9.8/10  "

												I have to say that if you enjoy walking dead you will enjoy this game very much even more then season 1 of the walking dead. In season 2, the story continues and gets crazier and crazier the more you progress through the game. Even if you dont like the walking dead, you still will love this game and have emotions at moments of the game for characters and actions that happen. Season 2 left me wanting even more for this game, I was pumped when I heard that they announced a season 3  for the walking dead game even though it looks like its far off from realese due to TellTale making several other amazing emotional games like this like game. Everybody NEEDS to play this series.This is one of the few games that made me cry in my whole gaming experience other then a few other games but there really arn't many games that do this to you. That is what makes this game so awesome ontop of the storytelling its a long rollercoaster throughout the game to survive. You get to make decisions that affect the story which is cool so its almost asking what you would do if this was you in this situation and what you choose effects the story and your choices carry over to the next season etc. Two words, BUY IT!

												Awesome Game! Specially for The Walking Dead Fans.Great Stories, How it is told is based on the players choices though out the game.Great Artwork for it's genre. Solid Replay Value looking forward to more episodes. Great way to waste a night or 3.Seriously just pick it up and enjoy.Highly advise picking up season 1 first and playing it also great and worth the time and money. "

												As I started the second season of TellTale's popular interactive storybook tale based on the popular AMC television series, I felt very deeply immersed in the story that was revolving around the protagonist. I was given tough choices and had a strong emotional response to every consequence.The continuation from Season One feels seemless now that I recall the events of the past, especially when I see the consequences of the choices in that game affecting the story in this sequel in meaningful ways. At first, the choices I made in Season Two didn't seem so meaningful, but it is slowly creeping up on me as I make progress and the plot begins to unfold. Even the smallest choices have the potential to twist the plot.However, I highly recommend not reading the names of the achievements in this game before returning to the zombie apocalypse. And I personally wouldn't find it enjoyable unless I completed Season One. I can't imagine not experiencing Season One and then even pretending that I understand the protagonist to Season Two.All of what matters to me personally aside, expect a lot of button context actions, dialogue options, and forshadowing that inevitably kicks you in the gut. I honestly don't know why TellTale bothered with so many achievements in an interactive storytelling game, but I can't help but look the other way because this story is told so well that I can't quite put it down. If this series were a physical ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book, then I'd read it until I had to start taping pages back together.			"

Wow the final episode is great.I had the feeling the choices you had to make in season 2 had a much bigger impact than in season 1.Downsides of season 2 is the depth of side characters. They seem a bit shallow and incapable at times, without any explanation why.Nevertheless it didn't stop me from loving this game!On to the next Telltale!			"

												**WALKING DEAD SEASON 1 SPOILER ALERT**After Lee dies in the walking dead season one Clem is left on her own. In season two you play as clem continuing her jouney the this post apocalyptic world. You continue on with Omid and the other lady who is preganent and you are with them for the very begining of the game until things go awry. You are split up to fend for yourself until you meet another group of survivors. It is sort of a cliché where they were all living there for a long time until you show up and things take a turn for the worst. you meet one of the groups enemies named Carver and have to deal with him for a while. Also one of the characters from season one comes back. If you have seen the pictures of the game in the store you will have seen who it was but if not try and guess who it is. All in all this is a good game and is a must buy.			"

												I honestly feel this does not live up to standard of Season One, but was definitely still worth a play.  I would still recommend this game for any fans of the Walking Dead series.  In regards to the game, I felt during conversation sequences that their should have been different replies to the ones that where presented.  I found certain conversation replies were not near the extent as they should have been especially if it was myself in that situation, but I suppose that is down to me as you are playing as an eleven year old girl.  Overall it was still a good game, I will play through it again to see how other conversation sequences effect the game differently.			"

												9/10 - Not as good as Season 1, but still great walking dead game with things you love: walkers, deaths and more walkers and more deaths. From the perspective of Clementine everything looks different. People wont listen to you as they used to in Season 1 and killing walkers isn't much easy either. But in the end, Clementine is the only adult and is forced to make difficult choices.			"

												Well now that I finished all the available content (Up to season 2 episode 4), I have decided its time to write a very detailed review about what I can easly say became my favorite game series of all time.This review WILL contain minor spoilers (Major spoilers will contain a warning before they are written).I am going to review the series (Both games so far) assuming people reading this have already played the first game.Let's get started.This game is hard. Now when I say hard, I don't mean that it is overly complicated or difficult.... no this game is on a whole new level of ""hard"". The game does such an amazing job by playing with your emotions that you can't figure out if you are playing the game or it is playing you. I can't count how many times I found myself tearing up because of an event in the game.MINOR SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!Season 1:In the first game of the series you play as a man named lee, an american history teacher who was on his way to jail for commiting a murder. As the story progresses you are faced with choices, choices you would never wanted to make if it was really you... With each episode the choices become harder as you find yourself getting on the better side of some people in your group and on the worse side of others.But choices arn't the only thing you need to warry about, you have a little 8 year old girl to take care of, named Clementine.You find this little girl about 5 miniuts into the game alone and scared hiding in her tree house in the back yard of her home.The little girl was waiting for her parents to come home from thier vacation when dead started walking the streets. At first Clemntine (I will call her Clem from now on) doesn't really trust you but that soon changes when she understands that  you are the only one who hasn't given up on her.As the game progresses you get to know a lot of people, some better some worse but who is your real friend is up to you to decide. Trusting people will be hard but you have to do what is best for Clem.By the end of the game you (The player) realize that the story didn't revolve around some guy named Lee the game is really about an 8 (by that time 9) year old girl named Clementine. You get to see her grow up, you teach her the basics of survival just to make sure she can live. You also get to see what a post apocalptic world does to a little Innocent girl as she turns from just some first grader you need to take care of to something better and stronger than any adult.MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT SEASON 1 BEYOND THIS POINT!Season 2:In this installment you play as Clementine and you instantly see the change in her. She is no longer that innocent little girl you saw in the first game, she is now colder, smarter, stronger. The harsh post apocaliptic wasteland turn a sweat little girl into something else, something that might seem scary at first but as you go along the story, you understand that those changers are necessary for survival.Along the story Clem mentions Lee a few times and I couldn't just sit there. Every time she mentioned him I had to grab a tissue.Not all tears in this game are tears of sadness. At one part of the game, Clem is just the type of person that can sometimes bring tears of joy to your eyes even when things seem grim, there is always a moment of happynes. In conclution:This is a game for people who want a story. There is almost no gameplay involved but trust me, if the story seems even a little interesting it is well worth your money.This game is not for the weak of heart since it has a way of getting to you. (I rarely cry even in very sad movies but this game just got to me and I was crying like a little girl).This game might not have amazing graphics but it is not important, this game really is something special. Its a clear example of what's inside is what matters.This game is best played alone (since choices of people may very).10/10 WOULD AND WILL PLAY AGAIN			"

												Finish Season 1 and 400 Days and bought Season 2 immediately. Didn't expected much for this sequel, but it begins in the TWD style, shocking us with unexpected events and situations. In this game you play as Clementine, and you have sort of 3 ways to develop her, like kind, badass and survivalist (screw everyone else). I felt pity of Clem almost all the time (damm screenwriters) so I choose a mix between badass and suvivalist, killing (leaving to die) everybody that was intering with Clem's plans without leting people notice it though.

												The walking dead episodes is one of my all time favourite games to play, along with ""the wolf among us"" it is truely a masterpiece. Only game that has made me cry and terrified at the same time it is amazing. i recomend this game 100% to those of you who thinks ""oh look a point and click game not gonna even try"" i had the same tought going into this game. But man the story is better than anything tv can spew out these days. in my opinion its better than the walking dead tv show. And to top it all of you are in full control of the story do you wanna kill that guy? sure, but know it will maybe cause consequense for you later. i love it, i aboslutely love it!

												Spoiler/剧透预警行尸走肉第二章：Everyone  is ♥♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ except Clem and Kenny. 最爱:Kenny无论kenney做错了什么，无论他的暴脾气如何，无论他如何怪异.在第一部里面，是他修好了船。第二部里面，是他修好了卡车。Kenney他其实就是游戏中的Rick. 这个顶天立地的男子汉，敢爱敢恨.第一部里面失去了老婆孩子，仍然坚强的活着. 第二部里面失去了新的爱人，情绪几近崩溃，最后还是去照顾那个孕妇(♥♥♥♥♥). 最后孕妇（♥♥♥♥♥）死了之后，kenney自然而然的承担起照顾孩子的责任. 最后Jane居然把孩子藏起来考验Kenney，Jane不明白人性经不起考验，这是多么stupid，所以最后她被kenney杀死，我觉得她罪有应得. 而Kenney，最后为了Clem和孩子，放弃自己进入营地，真是感天动地。果断选择和kenney一起。个人感觉是完美结局。Kenny作为一个男人，孤独的男人，他承担的太多，最后被几个♥♥♥♥♥，♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 各种judgement，如同Jane所说，那个什么狗Mike，俄国boy还有那个情妇背后议论kenney，你们几个垃圾有什么资格。屁都不会，Kenney干掉了黑帮头子，kenney是团队的支柱。下面开始判刑：最想他们死而不能死的：1.俄国boy，根本就是个脑残玩意。从clem跟他说，我是个孩子，能别用枪指着我吗。这狗比无动于衷。就知道这是个垃圾。于是，后面kenney几次要毙了他，垃圾团队不听，终于酿成大祸。2.Mike，这个叛徒。你放了俄国boy就算了，还他妈给他枪，这下好了，这狗比成了射击clem的帮凶。3.孕妇， 这就是个长舌妇，burden，以为自己坏了个不知道谁的种就可以成为中心了？大声叫引丧失，根本不关心clem的死活。最后她变丧失了，我就像rick一样，迫不及待给她脑袋来一枪，真是爽下面是喜爱但有致命缺点的：1.Luke，本来对luke很有好感的。但是他以为clem被咬了就把clem摔下来，从此路人。期间一直呛他，没帮他说过话。直到最后，冰里面他救了clem，才终于原谅了他。 LUKE其实是个挺矛盾的人，要怪只能怪他太年轻，老一点多一些担当和决断就更好了。2.Jane，一度很喜欢Jane，对clem很像一个大姐姐。但是她犯了致命错误，最后时刻她本可以不藏孩子。人性不能考验这是多年都说过了的。好人也可能上头干出出格的事，对我来说最后一件事就是一种挑衅。所以Jane你死的不冤，怪不了kenney。要怪怪你自己作死。3.情妇，就是400天里面打死别人老婆的。她给我的感觉就是weak，不能自己拿主意。最后和叛徒二人组出逃。在clem受伤以后才幡然醒悟。不想再说什么。			"

												The Walking Dead Season 2 is a very soulful, realistic title, which introduces well-made game mechanics and thinking strategies, it always has you thinking each moment of the game, and puts you in the protagonist's place and state of mind. There are also many different ways you can play the game as well, as every decision changes the future. As for the characters, they sure do pack a punch, they are spirited, very well-animated and Telltale games sure did know how to make them. This is not just a videogame, it makes us think on what we would do, think, and act on real-time situations. And not to take every decision, day, or moment for granted.			"

												It's a superb adventure game for anyone. I think it's just as good as the first season, so if you liked it, get this one without hesitating! There are ~ 2 hours of gameplay in every episode so you can beat the game in ~ 10 hours. It's not too short, but it's not too much either. There's only one con I can mention about WD 2: they should never tell me that ""the story is tailored by your decisions"", because this is just a pure lie. 99.5% of the story is the same, no matter how what you say/choose. Keep this in your mind before spending money on this and you won't feel be cheated.All in all ... it's absolutely recommended.			"

												Summary: Deus ex zombinaMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 11 hrsCards: NoCloud: YesThe Walking Dead Season 2 picks up right after where Season 1 leaves off. Clem, now living with Omid and Christa, set off to survive on their own. While it is much advised to play Season 1 first, you can enjoy Season 2 without having played Season 1 prior. There will be some story elements spoiled in doing so. I'm pretty bummed you can't skip dialog in this game. I wanted to replay the whole game, but this alone made me think otherwise. Adding to that is the fact that you cannot skip credits either. Considering you'll see the credits five times in a playthrough, this decision makes no sense whatsoever. And you still cannot save/load your games at will. It's like the game conspires against you trying to replay.The sound and graphics are pretty much the same quality as the first game. The quality of writing may have gone down a bit, as many options they provide are less thoughtful this time around. Characters change attititudes over small things, and some characters are outright useless. That said, it's still an enjoyable read, and certainly enough to keep your interest to the end.I give Season 2 of The Walking Dead a 8.5/10. It flows at a nice brisk (albeit liner) pace, and does a good job keeping you entertained to the end. My main criticisms are outlined below in the spoiler section.***SPOILER SECTION***I have a theory that Telltale games supports the Novikov self-consistency principle. This idea states that any changes a time traveler makes is history all along. Thus the past cannot be changed, and attempts to change it would result in an event to ensure consistency. Try replaying any chapter and select new choices. Same outcome, right? Unfortunately, because I was aware of my inability to actually influence the story, it removed much of the immersion and I stopped caring about what I picked. Every time I saw ""[This person] will remember that"", I saw it as a death sentence. What was the point in remembering your choices when the NPC is going to die a few scenes later? What was the point in being a good samaritan if you are going to be attacked anyway? Why should I save anyone at all? I mean I'll still do it, but I already know it's pointless. I get that they want to create the illusion of crafting your own story by presenting timed responses, but it's obvious nothing matters. While I appreciate Telltale for trying to tell a solid story, I had trouble suspending my disbelief when most of the remaining humans have have become crazy, corrupt, and/or traitorous. Those that aren't are promptly killed off or slowly corrupted. Why is it always man vs man anyway? No one tries to go on the offensive to cure the zombieism any more. Even if there's no cure in the end, it's something that people should never stop pursuing.There's a consistent pattern that goes on in the entire Walking Dead universe. Main character finds a (usually friendly but not always) group . Group starts to fall apart. Deus ex zombina. People die. Move to new location. Repeat ad infinitum. The ""move to new location"" part I find amusing because whenever someone mentions ""settling"" it always ends bad and they must move. And I'm pretty sure this is because staying in one location would be boring to watch, play or read. If this were real of course people would like to settle. But that would simply be boring to write about and experience. The chart showing your responses compared to other players is interesting, but flawed. A number of decisions are virtually no-brainers. Why would I not climb in the ticket booth when it looks and sounds empty? Decisions that sound dangerous to Clem don't work because we know as players the game will not kill you for it. Typically the only way to die is to fail at a quicktime event. The good decisions have two seemingly good outcomes, or are hard to figure out the lesser of two evils. For example, the option to rob Arvo was a good choice, since you could certainly use the meds. Instead most choices are to be nice or mean. At the very least, if we're given mean choices, I'd like to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥doing it. For example a choice between saving the baby or shooting the Ruskies. You bet I'd shoot Arvo if given the chance (though I'm sure they'll try to spin some tale to make him sympathetic next season). One choice I wish I picked differently was chopping off Sarita's arm, because chopping it off was definitely a bad idea. Of course she'd scream and alert the whole mob if you did that, but I didn't have enough time to think it through. It still doesn't matter, but the option and urgency here was good. While a majority of decisions do not matter, surprisingly you can make an actual fork in the game at the end. I did appreciate this a lot. However, I'm fairly certain the fork will converge right away when Season 3 rolls out.Walking Dead Season 2 is still a good game, I just wish we could make an appreciable difference in the story and the world.

Review for The Walking Dead: Season 2 Pros:Graphic style: Is very well made, it feels nice and is very enjoyable, The Walking Dead universe with it is made very well, world is shown as it should be in The Walking Dead.Choices: Every choice is hard even the smallest one because everyone will remember it, you control the lives of other by helping them or dooming them. Every choice feels heavy and is hard to choose, there is no better way or best choice with which everyone will be happy and survive. Most choices feels like made under pressure because of little time you are given to choose but that's what makes them feel realistic because you regret what you did.World: Is very well made, it feels destroyed, dangerous and horrible. Atmosphere: One of the best things of the game, every thing feels realistic, you feel guilt because of you actions, world is going down and becoming more dangerous every day because Walkers grow in number while humans are becoming less by each day.Story: Very well written, characters feel alive, they are angry, they have emotions, they have regrets. Story itself is hearthbraking as little girl sruggles to survive in a wretched world and every her choice decides the fate of others.Replay value: It has huge replay value because choices change the story and outcome of it, so it can be replayed several times over.Cons:To me there was none, i liked the game from start to end, didn't had any techinal issues with game or other problems.Summary: I recommend the game for everyone who loves games with great storys, heavy choices and to those who like games which have a lot of emotions (may make you sad, happy or even let a tear out).9/10			"

												My Rating - 5.5/10Do I recommend this?Yes - If you like to know how the story goes on, you should get itNo - If you get disappointed easily and hope to much, don't get it.Plot:-Continuing where you left of from Season 1, you now play as Clementine and need to move forward without Lee surviving on your own, meeting new friends along the way. You take the role of a kid who tries to do her best in keeping friends together and foes apart. Keeping the group tight like how Lee did.It wasn't as good as Season 1 and the ending is pretty disappointing. It brought me to tears with an overflowing emotional storm but only for a few seconds. It then ruined the whole experience and gameplay with an absurd ending bringing you to a total cliff hanger of pointless hours of playing this.*SPOILERS*400 Days DLC is an epilogue to this and it doesn't actually do much so I would say it's a total waste of money because the characters that was brought in by Tavia all end up in the same place where you'd be brought to and it doesn't change the story much.Apart from that, the ending is horrible and trashy. You eventually meet Kenny along the way and you get to chose his fate at the end ending up to a conclusion of being in Wellington with Kenny or back to the depot with Jane and coming across newer people. A baby comes along the way (mid story) and that continues on with Season 3 having you (with/without Kenny) will have to take care of AJ, but all in all, it is terrible in my opinion. Disappointing and worthless. It did not have the feel like how it was during Season 1 and it is rather dull I must admit.Personally, I did not like this but you could give it a shot.			"

												Another season of heartbreak simulator, basically the same all around it has improved visuals, textures, although they're all still cartoony and it feels more of a independant game rather than well ya know, dlc or whatever you'd think of it as.Gameplay wise there's really not that much different, although first person shooty segment that made me smile in season 1 is gone here which kind of sucks but o welp.Graphics are pretty much close like i said though they feel different and they are slightly improved.If you played season 1 and/or 400 days then you owe it to yourself to complete the story and get this one too as it carries over the choices so perfectly actually that you won't feel it's a different game, still fun and heartbreaking though. :<			"

												It was a fun game to play. My only problem with it is that some of the situations you are forced to participate in don’t have a reasonable explanation as to why you are in fact such an integral part of the plan... I mean you’re playing as an 11 year old (if I’m not mistaken) but for some reason you seem to have a better understanding of complicated machinery than the adults in your group. That being said; the soundtrack is great and matches the atmosphere, I particularly enjoy the art for some reason xD. The voice acting is, in my experience not great, maybe it was just me but the voice and movement of the characters lips was out of sync for random lapses through the game. What i did really enjoy was how interactive they made running through hordes of zombies and how badass you feel when you take a walker out after taking out its knee and stabbing it through the head.

												Excellent expansion from season 1! One of the few games that makes me question my decisions in game and legitimately made me cry in the end! (One of the few games to have ever done that) Basically the game is an interactive story where you have to make tough decisions which often to lead to an either positive or negative effect...but sometimes it's not that black and white (just like real life)...Your decisions in game can affect the outcome of certain situations and how the other survivors see you. Game is depressing as ♥♥♥♥ but one of the few games to where I actually give a crap about the characters because you become invested in the hardships you go through and theres a ton of that since it's well the apocalypse and all that jazz...Anyways if you like story driven(interactive story) games not really focused around combat then this def worth buying...but like I said be prepared to get the tissues out unless you are a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Following Clem after Lee's death remained interesting throughout to the end and, (potential spoiler I guess), seeing characters from 400 Days was even more interesting. The game obviously managed to give me as much feels as the first, having made me cry a couple of times. -Spoiler again-! The option to shoot Kenny was something I saved until last for the different endings. As much as I could've strangled him at times during the first game and this, I loved him as much as I loved Lee. Almost, any♥♥♥♥♥. But, yeah. Once I shot Kenny and had the conversation dialog pop up, I exploded in tears. Games never usually have an impact on me emotionally, but holy pencils. This did. Overall, story rich ofc and even a few laughs can be experienced, I'd recommend this game for sure!			"

												As a fan of the first season, I was not sure what would be in store for the second. This was mainly due to the change of protagonist from the first season from being a likable confident character to a slightly skittish child. My doubts, however, were put to rest and I can confidently say that Telltale has done an excellent job once more. They have created a story which continues to engage the player and challenge their sense of morality when faced with choices and decisions. While some chapters were better than others, each chapter left me satisfied. Clementine, the main protagonist, develops throughout the game around the members of her group, most of which influence her one way or another. I'm happy to see that Telltale has allowed the player to decide how Clem reacts and which people she wants to befriend. The final chapter sees the toughest choices being made, all which will tug on the player's loyalties and emotions.New players to the Telltale Walking Dead games, I couldn't recommend it more to start with season one. You will miss out a lot of character back story and, with it, part of the richness the series has to offer. In fact, reflecting on my experience and the references back to season one, it's vital.Continuing players from season one, if you loved the story and the game, you won't be disappointed with this instalment.

												I can't even remember a 'recent', single-player game that has hooked me in like this.The gameplay isn't its strong suit. Hell, it's barely more than a point-and-click.No. The strength is in the characters and the choices.The Walking Dead got its hooks into me within the first 15 minutes. Then, it wouldn't let me go until I was crying in the foetal position because of the choices I had made.It's pretty rare for a game to have characters that you genuinely care about, not just modern titles.The Walking Dead has the best characterisation I've seen for a long time. Clementine (and Lee from Season 1) is one of the most sympathetic characters out there.It's really tough to describe. It's something you have to experience first-hand.If you enjoy single-player experiences like I do, you're doing yourself a disservice by not buying The Walking Dead Seasons 1 and 2. Seriously.This gives me hope that not every single damn game that comes out from now will have ♥♥♥♥♥♥, tacked on multiplayer because that's 'all people want anymore'.10/10, will definitely play again.Christ, it's been a while since I rambled like that.

												Zombie fiction in general, but especially this season of Telltale’s The Walking Dead often beg the question: do you have to be stupid to survive the zombie apocalypse or does surviving the zombie apocalypse just make you stupid?I thought season one of Telltale’s The Walking Dead was filled with morons, but it can’t hold a candle to season two’s cast of self-centered, bickering, half-wits. Having played the first episode back when it was originally released, I jumped back into the shoes of Clementine to tackle the Zombie ridden mid-Atlantic yet again. Feeling much more formulaic than the first season and dragging a bit due in part to their attempt to create their own “Governor” character in the first three episodes, The Walking Dead Season Two didn’t quite have the punch of the first especially when it became obvious that any decision I made was going to be “wrong” in some way. Toward the end I decided that the game was no longer about survival or choosing the correct path. With the plethora of idiots and disappointment I was being faced with, I decided that my ultimate goal was to make sure that Clem didn’t end up as stupid and overall awful as these people.All told, despite its uber dismal tone, The Walking Dead Season Two was still entertaining, enjoyable, and well made. After having played The Wolf Among Us however I did find myself missing certain quality-of-life features like not having to press “E” after mashing “Q” during quick time events, or being able to easily see and understand quick time directional cues. Even the credits are friendlier in The Wolf Among Us, because I can skip them, a nice feature to have when you’replaying episodes back to back. The Walking Dead Season Two doesn’t even allow you to escape to the main menu during its credits. All that aside, I’m looking forward to season three and hoping that Clem can find some decent people to hang out with this time around.			"

												The follow up to the critically acclaimed Walking Dead season 1 game by Telltale, Season 2 keeps you incredibly invested in its story and characters.You can see my review of season 1 for the usual details, but essentially it's the same old Telltale gameplay. The game is more like an interactive story, focusing more on storytelling rather than moment-to-moment action. Thus, this game is not for you if you're looking for the next innovative, fast-paced, gameplay. If you're looking for a strong story that may or may not leave you emotionally devastated, this is for you.Like the first game, the gameplay is more of a classic ""point and click"" adventure style game. Throughout the game you'll be able to move around in a very limited area and investigate points of interest by highlighting them with the cursor and using a few different action keys. There are also plenty of quick time events, although unlike other games they feel...""right"" for the genre rather than out of place and annoying. The gameplay is nothing to be excited about - instead, it is a means of interaction, allowing you as a player to move the story along and make key decisions.Again however, the story is what you're here for. Season 2 picks up after the events of Season 1 and its small DLC, 400 Days. You have the option of importing decisions you made in the first game over to new games in Season 2, although this is not necessary (but I recommend it nonetheless of course). You play as Clementine this time, one of the primary characters from Season 1. The gameplay/story differs a bit because unlike last time, you are now a little girl in a zombie apocalypse. Characters amy underestimate you or treat you differently due to the large age difference, along with giving you as a player a fairly different perspective when it comes to making decisions and interacting with characters.Other minor details is the appreciated addition of a ""move faster"" button that you can hold down, so that plodding nature of your character doesn't slow things down too much. In addition, the artwork and graphics seems to have improved compared to Season 1, and there is a greater variety of environments and colours used.For those who played through Season 1, Season 2 is definitely worth getting. Aside from continuing the story and potentially crying some more, Season 2 doesn't feel any weaker and continues to hold up Telltale's golden storytelling standards.If you haven't played any of the Telltale Walking Dead games (or many of their other games for that matter, such as Wolf Among Us), I highly recommend this series if you're at all interested in good story and don't mind a much simpler gameplay.

												Not as good as the first season, which really got my heart pumping. However, it was really enjoyable and I think the decisions that had to be made in this season were way harder than those in the first. They were absolutely AGONIZING, especially at the end. Mild spoiler: I chose Jane. She's not as cool as Molly, but she'll do.			"

												Both seasons of the walking dead have been great. I enjoyed playing the first season so much that i played a second time with my whole family watching and they all loved it to the point were none of us could stand waiting for the next episode of season 2 to come out. There are a few episodes of season 2 and 1 that arent that great but when you combine the whole story its one of the best ive seen in a very long time. i highly recommend this game for the truly awesome, tear jerking, heart warming, depessing tale that it is.

												Still a great game, after the first series and a good intermezzo from 400. I love the switch of the main carachter! Still getting the feeling i am in the middle of it all!But still after episode 1 (got to love that one!), it feels .... less .... challenging, less difficult, and less pads to choose from, example:  for more ""evil/selfish"" or more the "" kind/carring"" side (offcouse there are less and less people, but it is less entertaining on a social level). This had its effect on me and my decisions and the less scary feeling.Still great game, being a big fan (Telltalegames in general and their work at Lucas Arts exaample Sam & Max 1993), i am glad for S3!

												Another Telltale's masterpiece. Better than the first season, Moar Zambies, Moar Feelings, Moar Sadness.The story continues Clem's journey through the apocalypse after the most breathtaking moment in season 1 with his voluntary babysitter, Lee, That killed her zambie babysitter in the 1st episode. Clem struggles to survive the apocalypse and take responsibility that every older man can't take.Carve your own story. The story is based on what decisions you choose, Clem can be a badass little girl or a ordinary cute little girl.If you want to try this game, play the first season and the 400 Days which will affect your choices throughout this second season, which is best if you know what happened in the first game.

												Season Two of the Walking Dead is another masterpiece in storytelling from Telltale, a developer who are quickly becoming one of my favourites thanks to this franchise and Wolf Among Us. I'm not sure if there's another developer out there on such a hot streak right now.In season two the player controls Clementine. At first I wasn't sure if this was a good idea. My interactions with her were the best parts of season one, especially seeing how she reacted to and learned from my decisions, and I was worried that her personality might be spoiled. However, I quickly found that it presented an interesting roleplaying opportunity that influenced the way I interacted with other characters. Being younger means not having a leadership role, and trying to be more persuasive rather than just taking charge. Meanwhile being physically weaker meant I had more respect for the bad guys' strength, and situations where I might have just attacked immediately in season one as Lee, I found myself being a lot more cautious.Along the way you'll meet lots of new characters as well as a couple of familiar faces. The dialogue is well written and voice acting is excellent. You'll encounter various threats from both the living and the dead, which result in some very tough choices. Most scenarios don't have an obvious best answer, and many consequences are unpredictable. You're just trying to do whatever it takes to keep everyone alive as you stumble from one bad situation to the next.The core gameplay mechanics remain intact. Most of the time you'll be making dialogue choices, many of which will influence the story in some way. Compared to season one there are less sections where you need to walk around and find objects to solve puzzles. I think this is probably the main reason why the episodes are shorter. I finished season 2 in 8 hours compared to 11 hours for season 1. Combat sections are again controlled by QTEs but they are relatively painless. I think there was only one section where I died multiple times. I didn't experience any bugs or crashes.My only real disappointment is the lack of effect carried through from my season one choices. There was a line of dialogue here and there, but nothing really significant.I highly recommend playing the Walking Dead. If you enjoyed season one, there is no reason to think you would be disappointed by season two.			"

												Season two was again a great story that has been told. But I had the feeling that this is even less of a game than season one has been. There is not really much to do, and it is quite impossible to fail or lose while playing The walking dead season 2. That beeing said, if you make decisions, these decisions are hard and seem to really matter for your world. I really liked The walking dead season 2. But if you expect more than just a minimum amount of interaction, you are expecting too much.			"

												The long awaited sequel to the acclaimed Telltale adventure, The Walking Dead: Season 2 offers just as much excitement and emotion as its predecessor. The game now allows players to take the role of the beloved Clementine, whom we saw abandoned at the close of Season 1. Clem is now older and more hardened to her cruel apocalypse life. Players quickly meet new characters (friends and foes) that have many mysteries behind them. Though at first it is hard to accept those that feel like replacements for our lost allies of the first game, after Episode 1, I found I had warmed up to this interesting bunch. The new threat of a captivating villain known as Carver paralells events which have occured throughout the universe before. Although it seems like a repeat of the ""evil group"" trope we've come to know, this plot line (without giving away too much) has some twists. Many moments throughout bring heartache, tension, and moral conflicts the likes of which are not often given in video games. The final scene of the newest episode, In Harm's Way, is one of the most thrilling and hard-hitting gaming experiences I have ever had, causing my heart rate to rise and sticking with me for hours after (but again, no spoilers). Aside from some minor graphics errors (ie. objects phasing through each other) here and there, Season 2 has shown a great improvement. The controls are much easier to handle, allowing for better sensitity and a more user-friendly ""choices"" interface. The game also implements new actions, mostly involving the use of the arrow keys for dodging and loosening items. Overall, this game is a must have. I am very excited for the next installment, and hope that the story of Season 2 rounds of as amazingly as I expect it will.			"

												If you like stories more than actionpacked jumping around, The Walking Dead might be just the game for you.I got to admit that I was quite disappointed how Season 2 turned out and it didn't keep getting better up until after Episode 4. Mainly this accounts to that your choices seem to have little to no impact at all up to that point.Episode 5 however gives you all the freedom you should get in the game and is so well written, that it redeemed the rest of the game.

												Just a comment from pcgamers i saw, and it's all i want say, all my choice:""I feel completely the opposite way. Seeing how Kenny reacted, I knew that he had to go. Kenny had become the kind of person that you just really can't be around. I get that Kenny would never hurt Clem, but he so easily could snap at others, just as he did Jane. I mean, I left her too. As much as I liked her, she was no better for tricking both Clem and Kenny. But Kenny had become something of a monster. Maybe monster is a harsh word, but he was a time bomb, as Jane said, waiting to explode. I think that the happy-ish ending robs the story of something very important, and that is the final lesson that Clem had to learn.A lot of what this season was about, to me, was Clem becoming a survivor, preparing to face choices alone. In season 1, we, as Lee, became her guardian and that was all about Lee taking care of her. She became the center of the story because it was a story that was no longer about personal survival, it was about the survival of innocence, which is what Clem was. This season was all about Clem learning how to survive on her own, learning what choices to make, not just in terms of basic survival skills but in terms of making the best choices when it comes to dealing with people. I'm sorry, but Kenny dying was almost a necessity by the end. He was simply too unstable and too unpredictable. Chances are Kenny would have eventually gotten himself, and even Clem, killed. I do admit that in the other ending, where Kenny sacrifices his own safety for Clem and A.J.'s, that was a noble thing to do. And it seems true to his loyalty to Clem. But I feel like it robs Clem of the hardest lesson she had to learn in the game: what do you do when people have gone overboard? Once someone has gone so far over the edge they can't come back, what do you do?The 'happier' ending tells us that Kenny will be able to fight through it, but I very highly doubt this. With all that he has lost and his obvious displays of rage and anguish, I do not believe that Kenny would ever recover. While his sacrifice is noble, he is still out of his mind and can't be saved as far as I am concerned. And I think that Clem needed to learn this. It's the primary reason I killed him. To me, this is the completion to this season for Clem specifically. Of all the lessons, it's the hardest one to learn, but it had to be learned.""			"

												I enjoyed this just as much as season 1, except for the ending. I feel that season 1 had a much more impactful ending. Although Season 2 seems to have more available endings, only 1 or 2 really leave you feeling a sense of closure.One gripe I do have with season 2 is that it seems to provide even less choice to the player than season 1 did. It frequently gives the illusion that you are making an important decision but in the end, it doesn't actually matter (the same events occur regardless). In one instance, you have a chance to save a major character - if you do so, the character still ends up getting killed later in the episode anyway regardless of what you chose.However, the story and the characters are all still really incredibly interesting and well-written, as always. This is still yet another fantastic experience crafted by Telltale Games, and if you enjoyed Season 1 you really need to play this.			"

												Well now that I finished all the available content (Up to season 2 episode 4), I have decided its time to write a very detailed review about what I can easly say became my favorite game series of all time.This review WILL contain minor spoilers (Major spoilers will contain a warning before they are written).I am going to review the series (Both games so far) assuming people reading this have already played the first game.Let's get started.This game is hard. Now when I say hard, I don't mean that it is overly complicated or difficult.... no this game is on a whole new level of ""hard"". The game does such an amazing job by playing with your emotions that you can't figure out if you are playing the game or it is playing you. I can't count how many times I found myself tearing up because of an event in the game.MINOR SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!Season 1:In the first game of the series you play as a man named lee, an american history teacher who was on his way to jail for commiting a murder. As the story progresses you are faced with choices, choices you would never wanted to make if it was really you... With each episode the choices become harder as you find yourself getting on the better side of some people in your group and on the worse side of others.But choices arn't the only thing you need to warry about, you have a little 8 year old girl to take care of, named Clementine.You find this little girl about 5 miniuts into the game alone and scared hiding in her tree house in the back yard of her home.The little girl was waiting for her parents to come home from thier vacation when dead started walking the streets. At first Clemntine (I will call her Clem from now on) doesn't really trust you but that soon changes when she understands that  you are the only one who hasn't given up on her.As the game progresses you get to know a lot of people, some better some worse but who is your real friend is up to you to decide. Trusting people will be hard but you have to do what is best for Clem.By the end of the game you (The player) realize that the story didn't revolve around some guy named Lee the game is really about an 8 (by that time 9) year old girl named Clementine. You get to see her grow up, you teach her the basics of survival just to make sure she can live. You also get to see what a post apocalptic world does to a little Innocent girl as she turns from just some first grader you need to take care of to something better and stronger than any adult.MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT SEASON 1 BEYOND THIS POINT!Season 2:In this installment you play as Clementine and you instantly see the change in her. She is no longer that innocent little girl you saw in the first game, she is now colder, smarter, stronger. The harsh post apocaliptic wasteland turn a sweat little girl into something else, something that might seem scary at first but as you go along the story, you understand that those changers are necessary for survival.Along the story Clem mentions Lee a few times and I couldn't just sit there. Every time she mentioned him I had to grab a tissue.Not all tears in this game are tears of sadness. At one part of the game, Clem is just the type of person that can sometimes bring tears of joy to your eyes even when things seem grim, there is always a moment of happynes. In conclution:This is a game for people who want a story. There is almost no gameplay involved but trust me, if the story seems even a little interesting it is well worth your money.This game is not for the weak of heart since it has a way of getting to you. (I rarely cry even in very sad movies but this game just got to me and I was crying like a little girl).This game might not have amazing graphics but it is not important, this game really is something special. Its a clear example of what's inside is what matters.This game is best played alone (since choices of people may very).10/10 WOULD AND WILL PLAY AGAIN			"

												Play this game.The only people I can see not enjoying the Walking Dead: Season Two are those who fall into the following categories: people who didn't play the first one; people who don't like story-driven games; people who are turned off by graphic violence and/or overly affected by emotional storylines; people who are absolutely revolted by the concept of the zombie horror subgenre; and racists.  That last one was a joke, but seriously, if you're racist, stay away.  There are minorities everywhere.I finished Season Two about an hour ago, and I am reeling.  For fans of the first game who worried that the formula would be stale in the second one: fear not.  One or two plot points are easily predicted, but there are more than enough surprises here to keep the momentum going.  Even at its absolute dullest, the Walking Dead: Season Two is tense, dark and powerfully compelling.  At its best, the game is -- dare I say it? -- beautiful.Season Two wastes absolutely no time punching you in the balls (figuratively), and slowly builds to a brutal and haunting finale that will have you instantly asking, ""What's next?""  If you weren't hooked after the first one, you will be after this.Some reviewers and forum posters are careless about spoilers, so be very careful.  You won't need a walkthrough, so don't worry about anything like that.  Just play, and enjoy having your heart ripped out all over again.			"

												If you loved the first season, you will love the second season. The quick time events are cool, and mix up the gameplay, changing it a bit from the first season. Other than a bit of an improved UI, do not expect too much and you will enjoy it as much as you did the first season.			"

												Amazingly well done! I've played The Walking Dead Season 1, The Wolf Among Us and now this..I most say this series is without a doubt one of the best of its genre, on the market! I can recommend this to anyone who wants a really well put together story, and not just killing people 24/7 using your 35€ ak47.would give this 9/10. The reason it isn't getting 10/10 is due to the waiting between each episode which may cause you to not remember a certian part of the game in the previous episodes.			"

												More uneven than the first season, this doesn't reach anywhere near the emotional heights of the first five episodes. A gruesome mini game in the first episode and a poignant flashback in the last are highlights, but it ends on a flat note.Still, at least they don't spend the entire season moping about in a farmhouse.

												Although not quite achieving the emotional tapestry of Season 1, The Walking Dead's second season is still a rich and engaging story. Clementine is an enormously likeable & fascinating central character for the player to follow while the supporting cast are all well written despite events occasionally becoming the wrong kind of chaos. I look forward to the eventual release of Season 3 with fevered anticipation (and to browsing Tumblr without risking spoilers).			"

Judged solely on its own merits it's still a fantastic game. If you weren't enthralled with season 1 that probably won't change with season 2, but as long as you set realistic expectations this game will not disappoint you.			"

												My impression after Episode 1:Walking Dead Season 2 is phenomenal just like season 1 of the Walking Dead.Its literally a feels simulator. So much emotion in just a 1 hr and 30 min. I am so excited for the upcoming episodes based on how good the first episode is. Telltale games are expert storytellers.My impression after finishing Episode 5:Telltale does it again with a shocking finale to an excellent game. The choices you have to make are excruciating. By the end of the episode, you feel as if you truly lost some good friends. I rarely if never feel emotional after a game but this game is an exception. Telltale knows how to pull on your heartstrings. If you can make it thru the end without shedding a tear, you are not human. This game overall deserves a 10/10. Worth every penny and every second of your time. If you plan to only play one game this year, this along with Telltale game's other masterpiece Wolf Among Us should be on that short list. I can't wait to see how Telltale will try to one up this emotional roller coaster with season 3. This is easily a contender for best story of 2014 and dare I say GOTY. At this point, please do yourself a favor and just buy this game and play it through to the end.			"

												The first game was brilliant, this game is even better. Watch how the little girl you raised as Lee in the first game survives without Lee and in most situations by herself. She seems to have learend this kind of leadership aspect from Lee so her decisions make a huge impact on what happens. This game brings so many emotions, terror, disgust, joy, helplessness and of course, sadness. There are moments in the game that can be heartwarming and other moments that can make you cry tears. For a ""Point & Click"" adventure it also has a nice pacing of action, any given moment a Zombie or even a full horde may appears, ruining your day by someone getting bit, decisions have to be made in these situation, the outcome can change how the game progresses. The Walking Dead Season 1 was already like that and it was brilliant, Season 2 just stays in this and it is STILL an amazing experience. This means it also got replay value, make another decision next time, see what happens. The story and character development, the good and the bad is truely amazing too. I don't want to spoil anything but a certain character appears you are just glad to see, and then you see him fall apart emotionally and getting angrier and angrier.Overall, this game is absolutely worth every single cent, if another game is gonna be made, I will definetly buy that too. I loved seeing Clem growing up and now fighting for herself and I would like to see more of that.			"

Telltale has improved the game with better gameplay, plot, and characters. Totally recommend it even at full price!Final verdict: 9/10 "

												The Walking Dead Season Two is a phenominal experience, everything about the series is crucial and keeps you on the edge of your seat. One small decision you make, can come back and change the way the plot plays out, even one or two episodes down the road. The graphics are stylized cel-shaded look, which is a great decision because it will never show it's age. Each and every character has their own personality and react to situations differently. Clementine is a charm to play as, the actor who portrays Clem has done an astounding job of making the transition between snot nosed kid to a full grown survivor in the form of a child. Everything about this game is great. 10/10			"

												While not a total let down, Telltale knows that very little will top the first season. So with that in mind, I think the whole season is actually pretty good. I was entertained mostly and while the episodes are short, who really wants them to drag it out? It was a quick and to the point aftermath of Season 1, and the ending (No Spoilers) was a good one, never going to top the original, but they knew that and gave us something a little different this time. I just wish that there was more choice/consequence variety in the series. While you would expect Season 2 to have a little more, it doesn't. I'd say it's worth a play if you enjoyed Season 1 and want to see the aftermath. Direct and to the point. A good game and I'd give it 7.5/10 for a good effort at following up the first.			"

												Just like season 1, I laughed and I cried.. but the second season of this amazing series is unfortunately the weaker of the two, although still a masterpiece in it's own right. The stakes are higher, and while season 1 has you bond with Clementine on a personal level, season 2 directly puts you in her shoes, allowing you to mold and shape her character even further. This was a brilliant move for a variety of reasons, as given Clementine's age, she's physically far weaker than Lee was in season 1. Instead, she has to approach dangerous scenarious by being quick and clever in order to survive, making you feel more helpless than you did in S1. This changes things up a lot and I'm very happy with the direction Telltale took. Additionally, depending on the choices you make during the final episode, you have access to a variety of drastically different endings that from the looks of things, will give everyone a very different season 3, thus increasing the replayability.Well done Telltale.. you've done it again.

The first season was the first game to ever bring me to tears and I'm hoping the finale will do the same. TellTale has outdone themselves and has made a game that I can talk to my friends about and come back again and again to get different endings and feelings. The decisions are hard and even though at some points you wonder why every one is looking to a little girl for help you can forgive and forget because it gets intense and you need to hlp two people, but you know one of them will die. I just hope that TellTale can keep this series going long enough for us to get a great ending, but short enough that it doesn't get boring.			"

Really?  So I could buy chapter 1 for $24 or chapters 1-5 for $9 and finish the game at the same time?  Just... what?It's a really great game being sold by a great company in a terrible format.  I would have gladly waited the year or two to play the entire thing in settings chosen on my leisure.

The first season blew me away with its heart-wrenching story and the emotional impact it had on me for months afterwards. I am proud to say that this season is even better, and I (not ashamed to admit it) cried about three times on the last episode alone. It was one of the most harrowing, gut wrenching, emotional games I have ever played. It blew my mind every step of the way and I will never forget it.

												Following in the footsteps of the critically acclaimed First Season, Season 2 had a very difficult task to match the emotional intensity the previous game bestowed. It's debatable which game is more emotional (I'd say their on par), but Season 2 is undoubtedly more intense than ever before.Sequels in any form are difficult. Whether it be games, movies or TV shows , it will always be hard to match the original, especially if it is held in such a high regard. I feel Season 2 has suffered some unfair criticism because of it. Season 2 had to do be very different from the first, it couldn't fall into the trap of copying everything that Season 1 did so well, otherwise people would have complained. Since you changed it up a bit people have complained about certain things. No matter what Telltale did, it was impossible for  them to please everybody.Clementine throughout this series has become in my opinion, one of the most consistent, well developed characters I have ever seen. With the options we're presented it's up the player to choose how they wish to develop the character. You can try hold onto her innocence as long as possible, or you can fall under the darker nature of the story I'd absolutely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a strong, emotional story. It has a very strong atmosphere, a great soundtrack and some unforgettable moments.			"

												If you loved the first season, you will love the second season. The quick time events are cool, and mix up the gameplay, changing it a bit from the first season. Other than a bit of an improved UI, do not expect too much and you will enjoy it as much as you did the first season.			"

												In my opinion it's vital to play the first season first, otherwise it could come as quite boring because of the emotional detachment to the characters.I've finished the full game twice. The second time I took the opossite choices each time and I have to say that not much has changed. So, as in the first season, choices don't alter the events very much. But there are few that do alter some stuff, nothing important at the end though. The only real important choices to take, are the last two. They define the multiple endings this game can have.The game is more about dialogue and choices than point&click action, there's not much ""exploring"" in it. It feels closer to watching a movie than playing the first season.**SPOILER ALERT**About the characters.Of course that everybody who played season one must love Clem.Carver is interesting to me, as it shows what Kenny would become given enough time. Jane also mentioned it.Kenny is a man hard to like, he was quite unbearable in the first season and he's not very different now. But I'm glad I didn't kill him. At the end you can see he always cared about Clem and A.J. more than himself.			"

												WDS2 continues from S1 with Clementine escaping the chaos, continuing her journey with some familiar friends.  In the WD tradition things head south quickly and we begin the next chapter in this excellent interactive story.In terms of gameplay there have been a few small changes from S1, primarily in that the narrative and characters are getting more emphasis as I believe they should in this format.  There are no actual puzzles to solve here; however there are occasional moments of interaction and minor exploration.  There are some QTEs also, possibly more than the previous game, which succeed in creating tension.The big emphasis hewever is shaping Clementine through her frequent dialog choices.  Will she be cold and heartless?  Will she be reserved but empathetic?  Will she be courageous and pious?  There are many more dialog choices in this season, and the impact on the way other characters perceive Clementine is noticeable.  As with last season, your choices can impact who lives or dies... although in some situations you have no choice but to determine how Clementine deals with the death of a friend.As with S1 the general story progression is fixed but minor plot points and character relationships can be influenced by your actions and dialog.  You could replay the game and try some different choices but I suspect the outcome would not be very rewarding.Graphically the game feels a bit improved but only incrementally.  The animation seems a bit smoother and the facial expressions are also improved.  The style remains hand drawn cartoon-inspired which is appropriate.All in all I'm glad that Telltale decided to focus on the narrative and character development.  Rarely does a game invoke an emotional response like this one did.  I am looking forward to another season of this series and will snatch it up for sure.9/10 "

												I loved the first Season and wrote a rave review about it and got the second season right away for more. I did have a good time with it, but I felt it drags on a little too much (which is weird, because it takes much less time to complete than Season 1) and the things that made the first season so great weren't in it for me. Clementine is an awesome protagonist and contributed a lot to the joy of Season 1, and she is just as important here and a real badass. However, they decided to make her like this freakishly wise kid that every adult has to come to for advice... I understand the gameplay reason, and sometimes I really enjoyed it for the reason that Clem really is forced to grow up, but it felt a bit off at times. They could've dialed back on it a little. I also didn't get to establish any bond between any of the other characters. The gang in Season 1 was a lot more interesting and their fates often came as a surprise or a sad feeling, while here I couldn't establish any bonds and their fates fell flat for me. There is still plenty of awesome in this season 2 and it's somewhat worthwhile - as long as you don't expect the same brilliant writing and reduce your expectations on the story. Since Steam doesn't support a Mixed Rating I give it a reluctant recommendation. I wonder how Season 3 will be... I fear for the worst, there is no way they can go with Clementine again and I just don't see how they can keep it fresh even with a all new cast after I played this. We'll see.			"

												The story of season 2 of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead is a bit more intense than the first and as it progresses it's very interesting to see how the influence of other characters as well as your dialogue choices force Clementine to shed her innocent little girl personality and basically turn her into a hardened survivor of the zombie apocolypse. Which is a good thing considering some of the grisly deaths you might meet. Speaking of which, don't expect the death scenes in S2 to be any less gruesome than those in S1 just because it now stars an 11-year old girl. Just like in S1 the nailbiting moments are there, the heart-wrenching moments are there, as well as the occassional WTF?! moment. One issue I have with season 2 is that the story didn't grip me as much as the first. And I think that's mainly because there's too much happening too fast. You rarely get a moment of reprieve in which you can really see some character development of the supporting cast, although it does make it all the more enjoyable when you do get one. That said it's still a great story with Clem being an excellent protagonist. If you played the first one and liked it, chances are you'll like this one. Fingers crossed for a Season 3!			"

												To start, I think that TellTale did an even better job on this game than they did for the first game in the Walking Dead series, and that original one was incredible. In season 2, you get to play as the little Clementine (I was so happy for this!), who really isn't so little anymore. She has grown since the first game, and I feel proud, like a mother. But this game is more than just the protagonist.I fell in love with the story. It made me so inspired as a writer. There were pieces thrown out throughout the episodes that made me cry out, pull at my hair, and simple shout ""what!?"". I think there is no dull moment in this game. It is nitty, gritty, sad, sweet, sentimental, and even romantic (why I think that, I don't know). It even made me think, if the zombie apocolypse really did happen, would I survive? And if I was able to ponder that question, I think TellTale did their job wonderfuly.The only thing I wished was possible in this game was a difference in the outcomes of the choices matter. I wish that there were certain actions in the game that could save a certain character's life. I think TellTale should think about that for the third season of The Walking Dead. 9/10.			"

												(This is mostly a copy/paste from my review for Season 1 as not much changes.)Overall pretty good. The game has a few down points but all in all I would give it 70/100 (50 is average). The game basically follows a group of people surviving the Zpocolypse like the show. It plays as an interactive story and the player makes choices for the main character. There isn't any gameplay really it is just point and click for I would say 75% of the game. The rest are small real time button mashes that you have to do, which are really kinda pointless in my opinion. The good thing about the game is that zombies are actually a pretty big part of the game unlike many ""zombie"" genre media that turns into nothing but soap operahs with a few zombies in the background as plot motivators. A qucik look around the internet and you will find that people get pretty emotionally invovled in this game, so thats always a good sign. For me, it wasn't as engaging but still well worth the time to go through it. Hard to say much else without spoiling the game for those who haven't played it.For the not-so-good. I think the most fusterating part of the game is the controls. They are very loose and don't always work. The control scheme can be annoyingly difficult to manipulate at times. This is slightly better in Season 2 but the changes that were made to the HUD I feel were not nessicarily better, just different. There still were a few times where I died simply becuase the controls did not get recognized in time.The other major issue was as with almost all choice based games there are often times when my personal choice just wasn't an option. You get 2 or maybe 3 choices and none of them are what I considered good so your left with just picking the least bad. That kinda kicks you out of the emersion a bit. This is particularly evident in Season 2 and it's ending. Probably from about Episode 4 and on I wasn't really on board with what was going on but there really is no option for what I would have done and that was pretty dissapointing. There are 5 different endings and while they all wrap up pretty decently, for me it felt like just watching a show I had no control over as the choices had to be made because the ones I would have done where simply not in the game. I was just going through iot to finish it after that point. That isn't to say the story is bad, it is pretty good, but not as an ""interative"" game that claims to be based on your own choices. Some other critique I have is mostly in the way of graphics. Overall it is a good style and the game looks good, but there are gliches here and there and the animations are sometimes wonky. Nothing game breaking or really bad but a lack of polish nontheless. This is much improved in Season 2. The game looks and feels a lot better in the animation department. Although I would also have to say that running into invisible walls was much more apparent in Season 2 as well which was very annoying at times and for the most part fairly pointless.So overall worth it. If you like this sort of game it is definitely worth picking up. If on the fence, it is worth picking up on a steam sale. I played it straight through and I guess steam didn't calculate all my time playing, but I think it was a little shorter than Season 1 @ about 10 - 12 hours total seems about right.			"

												Up until the end of Episode 4, I was really, really loving this game, but it turns out a huge choice you made earlier on (I'll put a spoiler tag at the end of this review) has absolutely no effect on the story and your character doesn't have any say in the matter. It's incredibly frustrating. I still recommend you play it, but that one ♥♥♥♥ up is just too big to ignore.Spoilers: At a certain point, you come across this Russian kid named Arvo, and you're given the choice to either steal his bag of supplies or send him on his way... Turns out that was completely pointless, as he accuses you of stealing the stuff regardless of your choices, and what's worse, there's not a single dialogue option you can choose saying that he's lying or that you didn't steal anything...

												Suspenseful and powerful; Season 2 of The Walking Dead picks up just after season 1 with tougher choices, more drama and a more streamlined interface.  Clementine is now the main character, using what she's learned in season 1 you go through 5 tense episodes that is full of some of the best written dialogue in video games, and make choices on who lives or who dies.  Although all your choices arent black and white, nor are they actually effective - when you're playing through it for the first time you will curse youself for anything you do wrong and will want to playthrough it again to see an alternate take.  With five different endings it will be very interesting where season 3 goes.  Very very recommended.As a season I give this a 5/5			"

The game is way more cinematic than Season 1, which can be good or bad depending on your feelings about that sort of thing, but I liked the change. One thing I didn't like is that now you can't use 1, 2, 3, and 4 to select options in game, but this is ultimately a minor gripe. Play season 1 first for the story; then play this game for an even better story and overall experience.			"

												To start, I think that TellTale did an even better job on this game than they did for the first game in the Walking Dead series, and that original one was incredible. In season 2, you get to play as the little Clementine (I was so happy for this!), who really isn't so little anymore. She has grown since the first game, and I feel proud, like a mother. But this game is more than just the protagonist.I fell in love with the story. It made me so inspired as a writer. There were pieces thrown out throughout the episodes that made me cry out, pull at my hair, and simple shout ""what!?"". I think there is no dull moment in this game. It is nitty, gritty, sad, sweet, sentimental, and even romantic (why I think that, I don't know). It even made me think, if the zombie apocolypse really did happen, would I survive? And if I was able to ponder that question, I think TellTale did their job wonderfuly.The only thing I wished was possible in this game was a difference in the outcomes of the choices matter. I wish that there were certain actions in the game that could save a certain character's life. I think TellTale should think about that for the third season of The Walking Dead. 9/10.			"

												The story of season 2 of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead is a bit more intense than the first and as it progresses it's very interesting to see how the influence of other characters as well as your dialogue choices force Clementine to shed her innocent little girl personality and basically turn her into a hardened survivor of the zombie apocolypse. Which is a good thing considering some of the grisly deaths you might meet. Speaking of which, don't expect the death scenes in S2 to be any less gruesome than those in S1 just because it now stars an 11-year old girl. Just like in S1 the nailbiting moments are there, the heart-wrenching moments are there, as well as the occassional WTF?! moment. One issue I have with season 2 is that the story didn't grip me as much as the first. And I think that's mainly because there's too much happening too fast. You rarely get a moment of reprieve in which you can really see some character development of the supporting cast, although it does make it all the more enjoyable when you do get one. That said it's still a great story with Clem being an excellent protagonist. If you played the first one and liked it, chances are you'll like this one. Fingers crossed for a Season 3!			"

												In my opinion it's vital to play the first season first, otherwise it could come as quite boring because of the emotional detachment to the characters.I've finished the full game twice. The second time I took the opossite choices each time and I have to say that not much has changed. So, as in the first season, choices don't alter the events very much. But there are few that do alter some stuff, nothing important at the end though. The only real important choices to take, are the last two. They define the multiple endings this game can have.The game is more about dialogue and choices than point&click action, there's not much ""exploring"" in it. It feels closer to watching a movie than playing the first season.**SPOILER ALERT**About the characters.Of course that everybody who played season one must love Clem.Carver is interesting to me, as it shows what Kenny would become given enough time. Jane also mentioned it.Kenny is a man hard to like, he was quite unbearable in the first season and he's not very different now. But I'm glad I didn't kill him. At the end you can see he always cared about Clem and A.J. more than himself.			"

												The last episode made it finally feel that your choices had an impact on the storyline unlike Season 1. I'm wondering how they'll do that in Season 3.I personally prefered the ending with Kenny at Wellington and he wanted to leave me there. On the other side I also thought about how it might be better for Kenny if I'd simply end his life so that 'he could be with his family again'. I think Kenny is the best choice because the children are his life, everything he has left to fight for, and he'd do anything to protect them, even though I may not always agree. If Season 3 comes out I'll make sure to play through it with all of the endings because I'm curious how each of them affect the story but my favourite will still be the Wellington one. Going out alone is the hardest one. I dont like what Jane did but I think it's terrible to take away everything Kenny fought for and leave him after a chance of making an end to it. On the other side, killing both of them is terrible aswell. I dont think there was any right decision there. "

Survival is a must. What ever choice is chosen, you feel the weight of it till the end.=Spoiler maybe, prolly not=I became the clementine who doesnt trust anyone. Never again.=End spoiler?=SHOULD YOU PLAY? YES!!Best game by far, the begining was a little forced upon, being thrown with a group right off the bat. You grow to love and hate each and ever one of them. As the game progresses, you watch everything crumble.. Who do you trust... Was that the right choice? Your emotions will be ripped into little pieces. But it is well worth it, the story behind it all, you will hate the choices.. but will love the story. You will be emotionally drained after. Not as bad as first season for some, for others will kill them. I recommend this game because its a dang good game, something to consider playing.			"

This is a review-in-progress; only episodes 1-3 are available as of this reviewOverallThe Walking Dead: Season 2 game, like its predecessor, is story driven game that is able to create the same sense of mystery, suspense, and action.  Improving on a lot of the systems, you have chances to mend broken relationships and create all new connections with new and old characters as you continue your story through the eyes of Clementine.ReviewThe Walking Dead: Season 2 continues a few months after the events in season 1 bringing together a whole new cast of characters with characters from its predecessor where new connections, relationships, and decisions will be formed.  Along with the new characters is a new perspective, where you once playing as an adult who had the strength to deal with the walkers head-on, you now play as Clementine, a young girl who has to use her wits in order to survive.  As with the predecessor, you are in control of your life, making various decisions for good or for bad to help mold Clementine into the character that you want her to be seen as; I feel as though the decisions have been changed for the better as they still impact you, but will not create as drastic of changes as to how each character views Clementine.  Although your decisions can change certain outcomes to an extent, you are generally tied to the story and will be limited in what can actually be changed.  Although the changes may be limited, the story is still full of mystery, suspense, and action to lead the player to want to know what comes next.Pros+ Unique story+ Improved decisions system+Connect with characters+ Point and click styleCons- Decisions cause limited impact towards the world- Episodic, can take a month or two for the next episode			"

												I enjoyed this just as much as season 1, except for the ending. I feel that season 1 had a much more impactful ending. Although Season 2 seems to have more available endings, only 1 or 2 really leave you feeling a sense of closure.One gripe I do have with season 2 is that it seems to provide even less choice to the player than season 1 did. It frequently gives the illusion that you are making an important decision but in the end, it doesn't actually matter (the same events occur regardless). In one instance, you have a chance to save a major character - if you do so, the character still ends up getting killed later in the episode anyway regardless of what you chose.However, the story and the characters are all still really incredibly interesting and well-written, as always. This is still yet another fantastic experience crafted by Telltale Games, and if you enjoyed Season 1 you really need to play this.			"

												See.. This game has everything you would point for ""point and click"" action. It binds your save games(if you have them) from season 1, and changes the season 2 episode accordingly.Season 2 seems to be improved at first sight, and this time you're really gonna find yourself making decisions, which will make you wanna play the same episode again and again, to see how you can change it.To put it simple. I bought the game today at around 11.30(CET+1), and I now (at 18.30(cet+1)) I find myself having finished episode 3, and wanting to complete episode 4.So in  short: If you like the first one, then you gotta have this one also.FYI:Only downside (at the moment) is that you can't skip cutscenes or the credits after each episode. I don't know if this is only when you play through the first time, or if you just can't. That sucks a bit.			"

												A beautiful game that you will have to make tough decisions base on humanity, morality, and wits.This game could reflect you how your inner personallity and conscience really are.Are you a selfish survior? or you are a human with heart and compassion?Will you leave someone behind and get yourself survived?Or you will risk your life to save someone from dying?This game that will make you cry in the very end.One of the best games that I ever purchased on Steam.

												completely addicted to The Walking Dead games, cant believe how easy it is to get caught up in the story, and before you know it hours have passed, i can see my social life suffering until i finish this. Its not all about killing zombies you really have to think about your actions and what you say as the choices you make count.  highly recommended.			"

												last night spent whole night without sleep, without revision about my exam, 5 Hours TWD S2 Marathon because of the save file is gone, and i have to start from episode 1 to episode 3... i could play it on another day, but i didnt, the first time i spent 5 hours(got spent more on other game but with different goal) just to play a episode long for like 2 hours, Telltale got me very good... though i felt tired when i at school and tuition, but i got to say it's totally worth it!Episode 3 In Harm's Way is a excellent episode from S2, after i finish it, it's kind of made me think about could i save more life if i make different choice? if i being heartless will more life be saved? in the end, i'm hope Amid The Ruins will be a Badass episode, look at the slide made me want to know what the plot of it even it's spoiler			"

												I wrote a short review of the first season and only mentioned some flaws with the gameplay... they dont exist in this game. Its damn near perfect. I just wish these seasons were longer. These games are sooooo good. I never want these stories to end. Totally worth the money and the experience. I dont want to spoil a damn thing for anyone so i do apologize if this is vague on the details of the game.... Just buy it! I put off playing the first one for a long time after buying it because i wasn't sure and didn't want to be dissapointed. I never was and now i don't want these to stop. LONG LIVE CLEM!!!

												I honestly feel this does not live up to standard of Season One, but was definitely still worth a play.  I would still recommend this game for any fans of the Walking Dead series.  In regards to the game, I felt during conversation sequences that their should have been different replies to the ones that where presented.  I found certain conversation replies were not near the extent as they should have been especially if it was myself in that situation, but I suppose that is down to me as you are playing as an eleven year old girl.  Overall it was still a good game, I will play through it again to see how other conversation sequences effect the game differently.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 did what I didn't think was possible: it followed up successfully on the masterpiece that was Season 1. When Season 1 closed, I was sure that any sequel would just tarnish the beautiful conclusion to Lee and Clementine's story, but I am very happy to say that Telltale proved me to be nothing but a pessimist. Season 2 is a masterfully crafted emotional story that does a fantastic job of continuing where Season 1 left off. If you, like me, finished Season 1 and thought ""I need more of this - NOW!"", then you should already be downloading Season 2 as you read this review.			"

												Once again, telltale games hasn't failed to bring us a story that no one will forget. Its simple: If you played The Walking Dead Season 1 (and enjoyed it) BUY SEASON 2. Obviously this game was not flashy about the graphics, and as you know, The Walking Dead is all about the story, which never fails to excite, so that the graphics dont even matter. (personally I like the comic book style to this game.) No game like The Walking Dead has ever brought you a story that will get you so attatched to the characters. Good game.			"

It has the same feel like the 1st one, but has that feel of survival and it truly made me feel like I was an apocalypse and I had to make quick, hard, and killer decisions that would affect the story of my game.

Amazing!The walking Dead Season 2 is yet another game from Telltale games and I am getting increasingly wanting to play their other point and click adventure games. Back in 2012 when season 1 was brand new, I didn't get it for ages because despite the hype it was a point and click adventure game, how boring does that sound?! I eventually bought it on Sale and was not disappointed, worth every cent and more! Season 2 takes off of course after Season 1 and the ""400 Days"" DLC in-between the two seasons with every choice you make from Season 1 and the DLC 400 Days carried on into Season 2. Just like Season one the graphics were phenomenal and were very appropriate considering the game (and the TV show by the same name by the way) are based off a series of comic books so it fits to have the art style the way it is, but the HUD or well, dialog boxes certainly changed and it was a bit weird and hard for me to get used to but after a few minutes I was fine with it plus it also made more sense.For me the first scene was intense then it got boring then it really picked up after a very unexpected thing happened from being nice, oh I guess I should mention that in Season 2 you play as Clementine rather than Lee who is the protagonist in Season 1 which is very weird but at the same time it was good to get the perspective from an 11 year old girl in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. For those of you who know anything about the game/story you know Clementine is a very smart girl, she can think and act quickly, she can shoot and she can take down zombies or ""walkers"" as they are referred to in this game quicker than a few of the adults, she really is a kick♥♥♥♥♥chick. The story is as good as season 1, spectacular, funny, nerve-racking, scary, action-packed and some of the lines and the way some characters spoke, you can tell the developers didn't half♥♥♥♥♥it and they certainly went all out. There were ups and downs, it was like an emotional rollercoaster! This has got to be one of the only video games (besides season 1 of this series) that I have sat in front of my computer and legitimately cried over something happening in the game, other times I sat there frozen with my hands over my mouth having to take a minute to process what went on. The thing that really gets me is at the end of an episode it will show you a screen letting you know how popular one of the main decisions were and if I am over 50% I am happy but in episode 3 I got one saying ""You and 31% of players did this.."" and I started thinking ""Opps, I did the wrong thing"" but the truth is there is no ""wrong thing"" I played the game the way I wanted to play it and the way I think I would have gone about things in that situation and you don't get to redo that stuff if it was for real so why should you redo it just to get the best possible ending. This is all based on Episodes 1-3 of Season 2 (the second game in The Walking Dead series) with Episodes 4-5 to be released in Summer 2014 but keeping in mind that's probably the American summer. This is another job well done to the guys over at Telltale studios and I applaud them for their outstanding work on such an amazing game and to this day I am yet to know of a game with a better story, or a show/movie I care about the characters more than the characters in The Walking Dead video game.

												Unable to stand up to walking dead season 1, but still good.Gameplay: Still the same as every other teltail games, the choices are still hard and difficult especially the very last part my god I didn't know what to do, I will avoid spoilers but there are a few hard choices to make and loose sleep over you monster.Story: Not as strong as season 1 Lee and Clem made a good match, in season 2 you are looking at the end of the world through a kids eyes and treated as such, which is jarring because you make all the decisions, Lee was considered a leader to his merry band where Clem is a child to be protected and kept innocent. The ending is still difficult but still not as heavy hitting as the brilliant end to season 1.Other stuff: Is still a fantastic view of the zombie apocalypse lots of gore and fantastic concepts to the world of the walking dead now we need a good action version of the walking dead universe. Maybe away from the established characters and story to give us the freedom.Overall score: 8/10			"

												This is a game I recommend if you don't expect the same emotional connections you build in the first, but it's still awesome. The gameplay is a lot more fluent and the quick time events are so smooth. I do miss being able to press 1,2,3, or 4 to choose dialogue or items, but I almost forget that. The graphics and sound are so beautiful yet gritty simultaneously. On that note, though, this is not Season 2. You will not cry as much and the character death are too soon and out of nowhere for me to care. The ending feels rushed, but you do have more choices than the original.

												Was a bit sceptical about playing as Clem before I started playing this game, having completed and loved the first Season as Lee. But once you get into it, it feels like a natural progression. All the hard work and effort you put into Lee is still with you, but both the player and Clem have lost him, so I think it helps the switching of view points. Loved the first Episode from start to finish really, and I won't spoil anything here, but if you're a fan of the Walking Dead, I think it stays true to the hype that the first game greated, and possibly looks set to become even better than it's predecessor.

I knew I was going to love this season but not as much as I ended up so in the end. I absolutely loved the game and cannot wait for season 3 even though this one is going to be based on Michone.

But in this one, there are much more intense moments, making you really think about what decisions to make. Something great about this is that if you own the first season, you can import your save from the last game to make the second season remember desicions you made in the first season. There are multiple endings to the game, making it worth while to play the game a second time.I recommend this game, especially on sale.			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 puts you in control of young girl Clemintine, introduced in Season 1, during the zombie apocalaypse. Along the way you'll meet new companions, fight for your life and make some of the hardest choices you can think of. Your morales will be tested, as you are forced to make decisions that will change the entire experience. Right from the word go you'll be sucked in to the story, feeling for all of the characters and by the end of it you'll wonder where all of your time went. The characters are immensely powerful and when you finally reach the rollercoaster of an ending, you will be left with (in my opinion) some of the toughest decisions in gaming.I would HIGHLY reccomend this game, it surpasses the first game and replaces it in the spot of my favourite game of all time. Definetely play the first game first (it's awesome), THEN play this one. It is spectacular. Telltale has delivered the two best games I have ever played, trust me, you don't want to miss out.			"

												If your like me you love zombie games. The story of The Walking Dead franchise is amazing! In this second instalment you play as the little girl in the first  game, Clementine. Im not going to spoil anything but some old faces come back and a lot of new people are met. The story is amazing in this game and it can change based on your decisions. Thats one drawback the first game had. The story always ended the same. Although there is one thing I dont love about this game. You have to pick sides of your favorite characters, thats one thing the first game didn't have that made it good. Either way though this game is really good and I recommend it to anybody who likes zombie or post-apoctoliptic games. The framerate is good also.			"

												Almost as amazing as the first one! The Walking Dead: Season 1 really tore at my heart strings, basically raising Clementine to be a fighter, yet still ensuring she held onto her humanity.This time around, you play as Clem, so it's a much different feel. While Season 1 will always hold a special place in my gaming heart, Season 2 brings you beyond simply caring for Clem and let's you take direct control of her actions!This season keeps you on your toes just as much as the first one does. The characters, like last season, really grow on you. The character development continues to amaze me, and there are plenty of twists, right up until the bitter end.If you played through Season 1, this game is a no brainer.

												Very good as usual from Telltale, good follow on from the first season, they certainly know what they're doing. If there was one criticism, it would be that although they are in episode form, it would be nice to have a release schedule for each episode, that way it would be a nice 'look forward to' the same way the tv show is.

												You either die a sweet little girl or live long enough to become a total badass.This is a great addition to this franchise.  If you loved the first season you owe it to yourself to get this one as well.  At the time of this review there are still two more episodes yet unreleased so I will update this review at the time I complete them but seriously this Telltale series is better than the TV show in my opinion.

												This game continues the tragic story of a young girl named Clementine. She is a little older, wiser and at . Great character development and story will keep you glued to the computer. Sometimes you loose the feeling of having any sort of choice as the writers seem to go through the numbers from scene to scene. Lots of twists and turns though as well as suprises. Some of the episodes may not be as engaging as season 1, however the game still manages to keep an emotional connection for the player. Hopefully news of season 3 will be comming soon.

												First of all, I did not watch the Walking Dead TV series or read the comic books. So I bought this game without any expectation. Once I completely finished the whole game, I was blown away. The story line was near perfect.However, I would like to add that the Point and Click genre of this game is a bit rudimentary. The reason being, most (not all) of the choices a player makes does not really change the whole story line. This brings up another question. I hate to say this but in our current computer programming technology, the Point and Click genre is at its infancy. Perhaps in 10 or 20 years time, this genre will evolve into maturity and the story lines of this genre will be near diverse in nature.Perhaps in the future, our children and grandchildren might laugh at this game for being too rudimentary by the choices a player makes in the game. We shall see but currently, considering the limitation of computer programming, this is a great game though. However try to buy it when it is on sale. I would give this game 8 out of 10.			"

												Second season kicks off with a bang! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you scream in anger, it will make you clench your teeth in suspense. An emotional roller-coaster like no other. Loved every second of it.Although the choices feel somewhat familiar at times, the storyline is far from boring. Action sequences will give you sweaty palms and the dialogue sequences will make you scratch your head. On occasion you will have to make split second decisions you'll most likely regret in some capacity (but in a good way).This game does a good job in plowing through your psyche and exposing your attitudes towards everything.An absolute must-play not only for the fans of adventure games. Or zombies.			"

Great music, story, characters, and the controls and gameplay feels great. Though with the large amount of blood gore and cursing I woulnt reccommend this for little kids.

												The follow up to the critically acclaimed Walking Dead season 1 game by Telltale, Season 2 keeps you incredibly invested in its story and characters.You can see my review of season 1 for the usual details, but essentially it's the same old Telltale gameplay. The game is more like an interactive story, focusing more on storytelling rather than moment-to-moment action. Thus, this game is not for you if you're looking for the next innovative, fast-paced, gameplay. If you're looking for a strong story that may or may not leave you emotionally devastated, this is for you.Like the first game, the gameplay is more of a classic ""point and click"" adventure style game. Throughout the game you'll be able to move around in a very limited area and investigate points of interest by highlighting them with the cursor and using a few different action keys. There are also plenty of quick time events, although unlike other games they feel...""right"" for the genre rather than out of place and annoying. The gameplay is nothing to be excited about - instead, it is a means of interaction, allowing you as a player to move the story along and make key decisions.Again however, the story is what you're here for. Season 2 picks up after the events of Season 1 and its small DLC, 400 Days. You have the option of importing decisions you made in the first game over to new games in Season 2, although this is not necessary (but I recommend it nonetheless of course). You play as Clementine this time, one of the primary characters from Season 1. The gameplay/story differs a bit because unlike last time, you are now a little girl in a zombie apocalypse. Characters amy underestimate you or treat you differently due to the large age difference, along with giving you as a player a fairly different perspective when it comes to making decisions and interacting with characters.Other minor details is the appreciated addition of a ""move faster"" button that you can hold down, so that plodding nature of your character doesn't slow things down too much. In addition, the artwork and graphics seems to have improved compared to Season 1, and there is a greater variety of environments and colours used.For those who played through Season 1, Season 2 is definitely worth getting. Aside from continuing the story and potentially crying some more, Season 2 doesn't feel any weaker and continues to hold up Telltale's golden storytelling standards.If you haven't played any of the Telltale Walking Dead games (or many of their other games for that matter, such as Wolf Among Us), I highly recommend this series if you're at all interested in good story and don't mind a much simpler gameplay.

												Ho...um, okay. So I had previously bought all the 1st season on xbox and intended to get S2 as well. I kept putting it off and off and off even when S2 finished and released on PC, it wasn't until the day I wrote this review that I bought both it AND S1. I've already completed S1 on xbox and I just played the first episode of S2. This game is something else let me tell you. There isn't any middle ground or any sort of ""oh you didn't really decided anything, don't worry, it'll happen anyway"". Every time you have to make a split second decision on this you feel the panic as if you were actually there and thats what truely captures that frightened, survivor feel. Without spoiling anything, imagine if you have to choose between going with one person and choosing another, its a panicked situation and you don't have time to plan out the decision so choose quickly and choose NOW. These make or break scenarios which are scattered both obviously and subtley are what makes this and any other similar telltale game a masterpiece. Its been beautiful watching Telltale become the powerhouse in game and story telling that they now are. I hope they keep making fantastic games.More important however, is that you buy this game, you will definetly not regret it.			"

												An interesting and exciting story as all set in the walking dead universe is.Though in the First game we were promised ""this game is changed and tailored to how you play"" and the amount of outcomes or ultimate changes were at MOST limited to non-existant.Thought it was a great game it wasn't tailored to how you play at all.Also this new Premise of ""you play as a little girl but people don't treat you like a little girl"" honestly doesn't seem clever but just extremely lazy writing, one of the characters has a daughter about 15 whilst Clementine is what 9 or 10? yet he cares for her but treats Clementine like she is dangerous. It simply does not seem realistic and whilst I can appreciate that stand-point someone not treating a little girl like a little girl should be a rare occurance, people are different and if we are supposed to believe everyone would just act like that I'm not buying it.Its simply another way of making a strong main character without taking too much of a time gap between where we saw Clementine and Lee so we know whats been happening yet not taking the time of writing it from a little girls perspective and how people would view her, every single person treating her like she's is a 30 year old male is just unrealistic and lazy.There has only been one episode of this game so far and buying a game and getting a small amount of playtime with months in-between the next episode is a bit of a joke, but I can't make a full review based on this one episode but if the characters start treating her a little more realisticly according to what she is (which isn't ment to be positive all the time just accurate) and they do infact give real story and end-game altering choices in this installment then I would say get the game but for now I can't make a solid judgement.

												What an amazing and incredible game! A master piece! Regardless of awful graphics and odd at times camera work. The story telling, the characters and their relations and choices that they make and most of all little Clementine make it more of a interactive movie than a game. No! Not a movie, an art! And of the best possible kind, one that makes you think, feel and most of all leaves a mark upon you.The first season was phenomenal, this one's no worse. Very different but not worse. In season two Clementine's no longer a little scarred girl one has to keep an eye on at all times. This time, even though it's only months later, she's been through so much and seen more than anyone should in one life time that she seems to be the only real voice of reason amongst all characters. Every choice that you take, every little decision is counter parted by the consequences - be it good or bad. Just fnished it and still have goose bumps and are sort of overhelmed by it all...10/10 Would most definitely like to see how it all wraps up in the end (if season three ever comes out).			"

I mean you’re playing as an 11 year old (if I’m not mistaken) but for some reason you seem to have a better understanding of complicated machinery than the adults in your group. That being said; the soundtrack is great and matches the atmosphere, I particularly enjoy the art for some reason xD. The voice acting is, in my experience not great, maybe it was just me but the voice and movement of the characters lips was out of sync for random lapses through the game. What i did really enjoy was how interactive they made running through hordes of zombies and how badass you feel when you take a walker out after taking out its knee and stabbing it through the head.

												Excellent expansion from season 1! One of the few games that makes me question my decisions in game and legitimately made me cry in the end! (One of the few games to have ever done that) Basically the game is an interactive story where you have to make tough decisions which often to lead to an either positive or negative effect...but sometimes it's not that black and white (just like real life)...Your decisions in game can affect the outcome of certain situations and how the other survivors see you. Game is depressing as ♥♥♥♥ but one of the few games to where I actually give a crap about the characters because you become invested in the hardships you go through and theres a ton of that since it's well the apocalypse and all that jazz...Anyways if you like story driven(interactive story) games not really focused around combat then this def worth buying...but like I said be prepared to get the tissues out unless you are a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I will try to keep this short and simple: do you want to be tested to see how well you can spot the morally correct choice? You do? Tough luck. There are no such choices. Keeping it spoiler free - all choices are good and bad, right and wrong. And after seeing once choice statistic being at 50% it just goes to show - you just never know. The game teaches you that at every corner. And if you do not get attached to any characters then you were playing the game wrong. I barely ever cry and this game almost brought me to tears (both season 1 and 2).So... You can also test your manlyness - you will either cry, or you will shed some tears. Or you will do neither, go ""Meh"" and will be forever rememberd as an inhuman ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The second season of The Walking Dead is a very enjoyable game with plenty of dramatic moments and heartbreaking decisions to make. In contrast to season 1 however, there is a lot less character development which makes for shorter episodes (took around 7-8 hours to complete season 2; around 12 hours to complete season 1) This does mean that you'll care a lot less for the band of survivors you're stuck with this time around. There are some inconsistencies in the story too.Still, Clementine is a very likable character and there's a great deal of scenes and quotes to dazzle you.TWD:S2 is a great game but falls short of what S1 achieved. I'd recommend getting this during a sale. "

												Play this game.The only people I can see not enjoying the Walking Dead: Season Two are those who fall into the following categories: people who didn't play the first one; people who don't like story-driven games; people who are turned off by graphic violence and/or overly affected by emotional storylines; people who are absolutely revolted by the concept of the zombie horror subgenre; and racists.  That last one was a joke, but seriously, if you're racist, stay away.  There are minorities everywhere.I finished Season Two about an hour ago, and I am reeling.  For fans of the first game who worried that the formula would be stale in the second one: fear not.  One or two plot points are easily predicted, but there are more than enough surprises here to keep the momentum going.  Even at its absolute dullest, the Walking Dead: Season Two is tense, dark and powerfully compelling.  At its best, the game is -- dare I say it? -- beautiful.Season Two wastes absolutely no time punching you in the balls (figuratively), and slowly builds to a brutal and haunting finale that will have you instantly asking, ""What's next?""  If you weren't hooked after the first one, you will be after this.Some reviewers and forum posters are careless about spoilers, so be very careful.  You won't need a walkthrough, so don't worry about anything like that.  Just play, and enjoy having your heart ripped out all over again.			"

												Among the most intense and gutwrenching experiences I've had in a video game.  As with the first season, the only complaint I can really raise is the lack of dynamic deaths-- losing and retaining survivors more frequently, and longer-term, based on one's own actions (or inactions).  Overall this builds on everything that made S1 great, further cementing Clementine as video gaming's most unsuspected badass.			"

They were more worried when she go slapped or when Sarah got slapped than when Clem gets shot. Aside from that, I honestly only saw a few small things here and there. All-in-all it's a great game, if you've played the first and have yet to play the second, I would urge you to do so.			"

This is a review-in-progress; only episodes 1-3 are available as of this reviewOverallThe Walking Dead: Season 2 game, like its predecessor, is story driven game that is able to create the same sense of mystery, suspense, and action.  Improving on a lot of the systems, you have chances to mend broken relationships and create all new connections with new and old characters as you continue your story through the eyes of Clementine.ReviewThe Walking Dead: Season 2 continues a few months after the events in season 1 bringing together a whole new cast of characters with characters from its predecessor where new connections, relationships, and decisions will be formed.  Along with the new characters is a new perspective, where you once playing as an adult who had the strength to deal with the walkers head-on, you now play as Clementine, a young girl who has to use her wits in order to survive.  As with the predecessor, you are in control of your life, making various decisions for good or for bad to help mold Clementine into the character that you want her to be seen as; I feel as though the decisions have been changed for the better as they still impact you, but will not create as drastic of changes as to how each character views Clementine.  Although your decisions can change certain outcomes to an extent, you are generally tied to the story and will be limited in what can actually be changed.  Although the changes may be limited, the story is still full of mystery, suspense, and action to lead the player to want to know what comes next.Pros+ Unique story+ Improved decisions system+Connect with characters+ Point and click styleCons- Decisions cause limited impact towards the world- Episodic, can take a month or two for the next episode			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a continuation of the previous game The Walking Dead by Telltale games. The story continues where the last left off and delivers the same if not better tense moments than the last. You are presented with a new set of characters, with some veteran characters returning, throughout the story. To sum it up, if you loved the previous Walking Dead title, you will love this one just as much if not more. The only question remains…. Will there be a Season 3? ;)			"

												I liked that this game goes off of the saves in the previous game and is action packed right off the bat. New gameplay features are introduced like new and easier way to interact with objects. I reccomen having about 2-3 GB of RAM to play because if you don't it lags and sometimes doesn't save your data. However, this game has a little bit of a weaker storyline than season one in my opinion, you still have the same connections with characters and surroundings. Overall, the game has beautiful scenery and background as well as an emotional story with detailed characters. I reccomend this game.			"

												The game felt rushed, and like many sequels to great games, can fall short on delivering the same level of entertainment without losing what made the game great in the first place. Beyond the first chapter, the game is TERRIBLY predictable and unentertaining. When you can't predict what is going to happen, it's because a character has made a clearly stupid mistake, and you have to either kill somebody or watch someone get killed. Not saying this wasn't true for the first season, but I have zero emotional investment in any of the characters in this season. ""Oh but what about CLEM and KENNY!?"" *semi spoiler alerts ahead!* Let me start with Kenny. He keeps on with his tough demeanor, but keeps having that special someone in his life that will eventually become brutally murdered. After he goes through his usual gun-toting tantrum, he becomes a psychopathic, gun-toting sissy who decides the smartest thing to do now is care for a helpless crying baby in this zombie apocolypse where he couldn't even protect two wives and a son that, honestly, lived longer than I expected during my play through in season 1. Sorry Duck, you're freaking zombie fodder. In the end, I'm tired of Kenny, and was hoping that Clem would have actually been able to keep him sane. This is where I'll move on to my rant on Clem...Clem is a little girl. SHOCKER, I know, but without a protector in the first season, she would have died quickly. It was expected that she would be useless for anything beyond sneaking through tight spaces in the first season, but in season 2, after she's gone through all the crap she did, I figured she would be a LOT more hardened and a LOT more tough. After she gets her 2 protectors murdered, she wanders into the forest and thinks it would be smart to play with a starving, wild dog. After she gets torn to shreds, and then thrown into a shed by strangers where she almost gets eaten by a zombie, I figured she would have been like ""People and dogs suck"" and after getting sewn up by the strangers and fed, she would have then been like ""Duces"". But NO. She sticks around with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters and gets into even more trouble. I wanted to be a total d-bag to everyone, but the game wouldn't let me. I hated every character in this game. That pregnant black chick was the worst of them all, and I didn't have an ounce of sympathy for her the entire game, even through the game kept trying to cram it down my throat. Oh she's tough. Oh no her husband got murdered right in front of her. Oh yay she's having a baby. Oh no she's dying. Oh YES I shot her in the zombie face.  If she hadn't banged the main antagonist (who is clearly the father of this baby, but nobody talks about it) then none of this crap would have happened to all these people I don't care about at all. I tried my best to play protector on Duck 2.0 (Sarah), but in the end, I left her sitting in a mobile home to get eaten by zombies. You can't baby someone that much, and Clem never pulled that crap on Lee. This game wreeked too much of ""Care about this empty character"" and ""Watch bad mistakes be made every 5 minutes"". I didn't even finish the last chapter, and I don't think I will, because it reminds me too much of the experience I had with watching the movie Zombeavers. Seriously, try to watch that movie in it's entirety, and if you can do that, tell me you aren't sad about the time you wasted. I never did finish the movie either, and even the most dramatic comeback couldn't have saved face. HARD PASS.			"

												*As a note before you read this, there may be some spoilers to the first game. If you are reading this with no prior knowledge to the game, please read a review for the first game. you have been warnedAh, The Walking Dead. A game which, although I haven't played in a while, I can still remember every detail of.The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a sequel from the game The Walking Dead (quite self explanatory really). You asume the role of Clementine, a young teenager (aging up from the previous game) who was left with a babysitter while her parents went to Savannah for a vacation. Little did they know that there vacation was to be cut short. As the name suggests, the dead become the undead and begin walking around and grunting in the usual zombie way, leaving Clementine in a world of death and torment. She leaves the safety of her home to travel with a man called Lee who does everything in his power to protect her. You are faced with many different characters and personalities, much like real life and are forced to make decisions based on the situation. The best part about it, you're in control of those choices.As I've given the story, I may as well review that element first.The story is the main element of this game and makes it into what it is. The choices that you make affect the story heavily and drive to connect with the characters that you have been presented with, be it that you feel like being a complete badass throughout the whole of the game, threatening to kill someone for trying to tickle you or being the friendly and conserved type. Lets be honest though. who plays nice in these games?The emotional connection that you get with some of the characters is absolutely phenomenal. When you start playing this, chances are you will probably end up caring for some people more than you care about some of your so-clled 'friends' that you swear that you have but always seem to be busy when you want to do something with them. Lets be real though. Who needs real-life friends when you've got all the people you could ever want to talk to here?Next up is the gameplay.The Walking Dead has a rather different style of play to most games. It's a break from the old FPS and MOBA genres which now appear to steal the show. However, the actual gameplay is very limited. Remember I said that the story is the main element? Yep, that's what this game is. The Walking dead has been from the first game 3 different modes of gameplay. A mode where everyone is calm and has no problem going on at that particular time and so you have all the time in the world. A mode where the previous mode requires you to make a fast decision and finally a mode where you mash buttons. The first and second mode play out like a game of detective. You move the mouse until you find what it is you're looking for to progress with the story. I guess you could say there are technically 4 if you include parts where there are 4 diffferent dialogue options for you to choose from. This is also usually timed but in some cases is not. In Season 2, there are quick-time events which require you to do things such as using the arrows to move left and right or pressing a specific key in order to do certain actions.As you can currently see, not much in terms of technicality. But that's the beauty of it. The simplicity really does make this game better as it focuses on the finer details of the game as opposed to games that rely on their complex mechanics to which the game-devs scratch their heads in confusion. The Walking Dead focuses in on the story, using the timer and the atmosphere to put the player at an emotional disadvantage and make them reall consider their choices in-game.The best part about this game is the way in which it is meant to be played over many times to get the different outcomes and to play in different ways to which the player gets to choose. Also, thank TellTale Games for placing 3 save slots so that you get to do a playthrough of to get the different endings, all ready for the next game to come out. If it does that is.The art style of this game is also very creative, using hand-drawn textures which suit the games style and mood. This also makes it much easier to run for those who don't have good PC's meaning that the game's experiences are to be shared with everyone.These are the overall Scores:-Story:- 9/10 - Very memorable and really hits the player hard. Draws emotional attachment out of the player. My only criticism is the way in which the majority of the choices have no bearing on what happens in the endGameplay:- 7/10 - I had a lot of fun playing through this game and even cried towards the end, but sequences eventually become easy and there is no difficulty in the completion. It is very rare you will fail. Also, trying to find what you need to do to progress can become annoying.Textures/Art-style:- 9/10 - A beautiful game with stunning scenes that make an impact on its own. The scenes in this game really show off the atmophere and feeling.Can't ask for much more than that.Replayability:- 10/10 - This is where this game really excels. The multiple choice element to this game makes you want to go back and redo the whole game again, leaving your mind with the 'What-if?' thought constantly after you make a decision.Overall:- 9/10 - Overall, this game is a must buy. It is one of the biggest emotional rollrcoasters you are likely to go on. Hell, I think I would have cried less if you had made me chop onions. If you locked me in a room with this game, I'd cry every time you put me through having to watch the closing scenes.I hope this gave you some insight as to whether you would want to buy this game (please do) and I hope it helps :)			"

												This season continues Clemintine's story from the first game.  The gameplay--answering questions based on the morality you want her to have, plus some QTEs--remains the same.  There is some gameplay polish in terms of how you interact with objects, which is a nice touch.Unfortunately, this season's storytelling arc suffers from a lack of focus.  Clemintine's decisions seem to get lost in the bickering of the--often hilariously incompetent or psychotic--adults around her.  The decisions you make in trying to keep the group together don't matter like they did in the first game, either.Overall, it's a dip from the first season's narrative strengths, but a decent enough game to pick up on sale.  7/10			"

												Before playing this you should go play The walking dead Season 1, if not most of the references and the phrases Clementine will say will not be tailored as you choosed.This game is exactly like the first season, the first few episodes are easy on the new players and are not as strong as the follow ups, but just like season 1, Episode 4 & 5 are the strongest ones and will make you do heart breaking desitions. This games takes you and cuddles you like a baby, then drops you on the ice cold ground when you least expect it, where people you seemed to trust, turns against you and where trust, is a big word. Its a rollercoaster of good moments and bad ones, where you as a child need to fight and try to reason adults who can be as stubborn then others.10/10 You guys done it again! Could win Game of the year awards at VGA just like Season 1 did.			"

												Although Season Two begins with a bit of a sour taste left in your mouth from the end of Season One, it really steps up its game as it progresses. The animation has improved visibly since the first installment, and the voice actors have all remained consistent while still showing a believable amount of maturation for their characters. The storyline is excellent, and the choices you make affect the outcome more than they did the first time around. The controls have become slightly more complex as well, adding another element to your gameplay. Worth the buy, but I would highly recommend using a controller.			"

												Mere words cannot express how much I love this game. This story, these characters, everything draws you in and immerses you into a dangerous world where you truly feel that all hope is lost. Some parts will make you laugh, or simply crack a smile, while others will send tears running down your eyes as you witness the death of yet another beloved character...yet another comrade taken by things far worst then zombies. If your a fan of season one then you should need no convincing! Season two is just as good or I dare say even better then the first, and this is coming from someone who is only on episode 2 of the second season, and already its been an emotional roller coaster. If your a fan of the show then I will just be blunt with you, in my honest opinion, this game is 10x better then the show is or most likely ever will be. It might just be a game, but the characters are just so much more interesting, you feel drawn to them and when one of them is forever silenced not only do you feel sadness, but a burning anger as well. Your choices mold the story, you decided who to befriend and at times who lives and who dies. The decisions are hard, the consequences even harder, but in the end it all comes down to survival of the fittest, and as you steer young Clementine through this dangerous world and watch her grow into a young women you'll start to look back on your past decisions with regret. The fact that once you make the choices their set in stone is what makes the game so fun, just like in realy life once you make a choice there is no going back.EDIT: After finally completing the game I must say that the ending was very satisfying indeed, you actually get to decide how it ends unlike the first one where what happens at the end of the game is set in stone. As a man, I'm not afraid to admit that tears were shed towards the end of this game, and the fact that a videogame can make me shed tears at all makes this one of the best games out there in my book.

The events that occured within the game, and the decision making were a lot more emotionally forced. This game may not be suitable for those who like to play action-filled games that keep their hands busy. It's more for those players that want to lay back, and enjoy the storyline of a game.

												This game picks right up from where season one left off, although not storywise entirely, so be ready for that. Let me be clear from the get go, season 2 is not as sentimental as the first one was. That may be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you feel about sentimental stuff and strong character building between two persons, but the overall feeling and the caring I had about the characters in season one I did not have in season two, or lets say it was a little bit different. However, make no mistake about it, the story is as strong if not stronger than that of season 1 and the twists and turns are right around every corner and the choices you make still somehow effect the whole game, so... that's great. Somehow although we are already familiar with the mechanics of the game, I still yurn for more of what I was just fed, just like human flesh for zombies. YUMMIE! ^^It's so cool to make actual decisions in the game and the narrative is based on the decisions that I make. Of course the decisions are a little like WWE. It's mostly smoke and not really real.By that, I mean, your decisions won't make or brake the fate of the characters, which kinda sucks, BUT, I am ok with it. In wrestling, although the fights are a great show, we know that everything has been scripted before hand and the winner is chosen long before the fight, it's a little the same feeling i get playing The walking dead series, but that doesn't stop me from ""believing"" and ohhhing and ahhhing for WWE or TWD, I still care and get psyched from both.And I can't wait for season three to get here, and oh, if you've read all the way up to this point, then by now you know what I am hinting at, so... GO GET... LIKE NOW, you won't be dissapointed if you liked anything of what the first season had to offer.			"

												From beginning to end, this is one thrill ride that nearly rivals the gut wrenching first season. If you have not managed to play the first game then stop reading, picking that episodic gem up on the cheap, beat it, then fly through this second season, as you won't regret it! My wife and I played through this together to weigh the various decisions and brainstorm ways to handle the more dramatic moments. All in all we found this a very fun / interactive way to play, as it gave room for a level of ""fun"" deliberation that was not always easy to pull off due to the time scenarious you're faced with. What you will get here is some of the best story telling gaming has had to offer in quite some time coupled with a unique design aesthetic that drives home the gameplay. You can't go wrong with this series; here's hoping that season 3 is just as good, if not better!			"

												The game felt rushed, and like many sequels to great games, can fall short on delivering the same level of entertainment without losing what made the game great in the first place. Beyond the first chapter, the game is TERRIBLY predictable and unentertaining. When you can't predict what is going to happen, it's because a character has made a clearly stupid mistake, and you have to either kill somebody or watch someone get killed. Not saying this wasn't true for the first season, but I have zero emotional investment in any of the characters in this season. ""Oh but what about CLEM and KENNY!?"" *semi spoiler alerts ahead!* Let me start with Kenny. He keeps on with his tough demeanor, but keeps having that special someone in his life that will eventually become brutally murdered. After he goes through his usual gun-toting tantrum, he becomes a psychopathic, gun-toting sissy who decides the smartest thing to do now is care for a helpless crying baby in this zombie apocolypse where he couldn't even protect two wives and a son that, honestly, lived longer than I expected during my play through in season 1. Sorry Duck, you're freaking zombie fodder. In the end, I'm tired of Kenny, and was hoping that Clem would have actually been able to keep him sane. This is where I'll move on to my rant on Clem...Clem is a little girl. SHOCKER, I know, but without a protector in the first season, she would have died quickly. It was expected that she would be useless for anything beyond sneaking through tight spaces in the first season, but in season 2, after she's gone through all the crap she did, I figured she would be a LOT more hardened and a LOT more tough. After she gets her 2 protectors murdered, she wanders into the forest and thinks it would be smart to play with a starving, wild dog. After she gets torn to shreds, and then thrown into a shed by strangers where she almost gets eaten by a zombie, I figured she would have been like ""People and dogs suck"" and after getting sewn up by the strangers and fed, she would have then been like ""Duces"". But NO. She sticks around with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters and gets into even more trouble. I wanted to be a total d-bag to everyone, but the game wouldn't let me. I hated every character in this game. That pregnant black chick was the worst of them all, and I didn't have an ounce of sympathy for her the entire game, even through the game kept trying to cram it down my throat. Oh she's tough. Oh no her husband got murdered right in front of her. Oh yay she's having a baby. Oh no she's dying. Oh YES I shot her in the zombie face.  If she hadn't banged the main antagonist (who is clearly the father of this baby, but nobody talks about it) then none of this crap would have happened to all these people I don't care about at all. I tried my best to play protector on Duck 2.0 (Sarah), but in the end, I left her sitting in a mobile home to get eaten by zombies. You can't baby someone that much, and Clem never pulled that crap on Lee. This game wreeked too much of ""Care about this empty character"" and ""Watch bad mistakes be made every 5 minutes"". I didn't even finish the last chapter, and I don't think I will, because it reminds me too much of the experience I had with watching the movie Zombeavers. Seriously, try to watch that movie in it's entirety, and if you can do that, tell me you aren't sad about the time you wasted. I never did finish the movie either, and even the most dramatic comeback couldn't have saved face. HARD PASS.			"

												[Regards to episode 1] The story and gameplay in season 2 is more intricate and intuitive than that of season 1. It's as though the developers has taken in all the feedback and improved the previous gameplay mechanics and story[telling].There are many more choices to be made and the game feels less straight-forward when it comes to decision making, changing a lot of the black and white decisions into a grey area; where there is no right or wrong, only what you feel you should do at the time. There's the ability to manipulate people through blackmail, or appealing to their humanity; or to completely ignore all contact and ""go it yourself."" Instead of interacting between one or two characters, or just simply finding about their backstory through dialogue, Clementine is able to eavesdrop on conversation to get an idea of what's going on, whilst also having the option to interact between half a dozen or so characters at once. Who you manipulate, help, ignore, the others will react. This part is the most interesting aspect of the game, as your options of who to interact with has been broadened in this season when compared to season 1.Clementine is the main character this time around and she has grown quite a lot since season 1. Her experiences in season 1 remains with her throughout season 2, and you'll notice that through the dialogue and reasoning behind some of the choices she makes. She's a tougher, colder and less empathetic on the outside, but through some dialogue you can still see some of the purity that's left within her.On top of the 'mash Q to do something' and 'click this zombie before it bites you' mechanic, the game has also introduced a quick time event where you'll press up, down, left, right, true to on screen prompts, in order to dodge and maneuver around during a quick-time sequence. It's quite fun and fast paced and really improves the flow of the game.A definite thumbs up; the only negative aspect of this game is the long agonising wait between episodes.			"

												So this season has finally come to an end. Now we can review the whole season as a game.It is amazing to see how Clementine grows and becomes from the little girl that we saw on the first season, to the strong woman that leaves us at the season 2 finale. Meeting new people she tries to survive but also save her friends. That means that we get to decide who will save and who will let die. There has been complaints about the player's relationship to the characters and i can confirm that it's not like season one. You don't have the time to make good friends and love the other characters. However, Telltale handled this problem very effectively on the last episode sticking only with the ones you truly liked. And for the first time, we see 5 different endings.I can recommend the game to every gamer that loved the first season and he should immediatly grab this one too. So until season 3, farewell Clementine!			"

												Great game that I highly recommend for those who enjoy story-based, character-focused games with solid injections of action and choices that affect the plot significantly.CAVEAT: Currently, you'll be paying the 24.99 for about 2 hours of play time. For whatever reason, Telltale has decided to release episodes slowly over the course of the year. While this builds anticipation, it's also quite frustrating. This strategy also risks people essentialy forgetting how much they ""care"" about the characters and what choices they made during the previous episode (and for what reasons).Love the game, but the rationing of the episodes is very frustrating. If I had it to all over again I would wait however long it takes for all the episodes to be released and then buy the game (probably for less than half price).			"

												Already in the first episode I’m blown away. This might just be the fan boy for the show, games, and comic books but I cannot recommend this game enough. The dialog is beyond amazing with your choices effecting the game is some way. You can’t help but become attached to the character all around you they have their ups and downs making juicy drama you can’t help but ask for more! I’d give this game an easy 10/10 due to how submerged you can become into the game with a new episode each month you’ll be sitting at the end of your chair drooling for more.			"

												I liked that this game goes off of the saves in the previous game and is action packed right off the bat. New gameplay features are introduced like new and easier way to interact with objects. I reccomen having about 2-3 GB of RAM to play because if you don't it lags and sometimes doesn't save your data. However, this game has a little bit of a weaker storyline than season one in my opinion, you still have the same connections with characters and surroundings. Overall, the game has beautiful scenery and background as well as an emotional story with detailed characters. I reccomend this game.			"

												The walkers keep on coming. Season 2 of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead would continue the breakthrough adventure gameplay of the original.Season Two continues the story that began in Season One. You are Clementine, a young survivor in a world gone to hell. The dead have risen to feast on the living, and the living cannot be trusted.The story you experience in The Walking Dead Season Two is driven by the choices that you make. Because of that, your story could be very different from someone else’s. If you played Season One and the DLC episode ‘400 Days’, the choices you made there will affect Season Two. You don’t have to have played Season One or 400 Days, however, to play through and experience The Walking Dead: Season Two.9/10			"

This game no wait this story is one of the best that I have ever spent money on and it was worth all of it. You will hate characters love characters no matter what choices you make. This story will test your humanity with every move you make. It will make you hate yourself and feel great when you do that one thing that makes things look better for everyone well being. It will toug the heart strings and sucker punch you before you know it. Ask anyone you know that has played this and if they don't say but it as soon as you ask then they are crazy. This whole story will keep you on the tip of your seat the entire time. Now for your sake and Clems sake buy this when you can and don't spoil it for yourself or anyone you know. 10/10 "

												A continuation of an already great game, Season 2 is a welcome edition to the series. Season 2 has been a bit of a mixed bag for a lot of people, and I can respect that, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Sure, it may not be as strong as the first season, and it fumbles a bit, especially around it's mid-point, but it's still a solid experience through and through, and the goods of this season still outweigh its badsFor me, it's a worthy successor to the first season, and while it may not hit as hard as the first season, it still packs one hell of a punch on it's own.

This is kinda the same, you can play the game with one hand and make random decisions when they pop up. I felt with this game that the decisions didnt matter as much as they did in season 1. That said, the major decisions here were much bigger ones.The story was a massive improvement in this one and was genuinely interesting. It covered a number of different arcs and really draws you in. It also has a much darker and bloodier side and doesnt hold back on a lot.The game takes around 12 hours to complete and I highly recommend it if it goes on sale.			"

												Most criticisms of this game revolve around the fact that this isn't necessarily a 'game'. My argument is so what? If you have emotions, an imagination, enjoy television with story or enjoy reading books, losing yourself in another world, then this is definitely for you. Only a moron cannot appreciate something of beauty and will criticise this because he isn't running around shooting like a maniac. Now that the biggest criticism is addressed I will write about why you should play this:What do you get if you buy this?Dozens of hours of intense emotional story telling which lets you interact in minor ways about how things play out. You MUST play season 1 if you intend on playing season 2. I quite literally cried at a few points in this game and that's a rare thing for a person like me to do, but you fall in love with the characters, their voice/acting is marvelous and you definitely get immersed in the story as it unfolds. I don't have anything left to say. Buy this game if you want to kill a dozen or so hours in a beautiful story and reignite your emotional side! There is no excuse to not purchasing this now that season 1 & 2 are on sale. You will get about 30 hours of 'story' from season 1 & 2 combined, and for the price of a cinema ticket. Value!			"

While the story itself does not take off until Episode 4 and new characters are not as good as the ones in the previous season, the game still finds a way to lock you on the seat till the end. And it's during the end that it will surprise you, Episode 5 is a masterpiece and the cutscene with Lee and Clem alone is worth the journey. Kenny confirms itself as the best character of the game and I can't wait to play with him again in the next season.			"

												For context, I just finished playing through chapter 5, I'd been playing about a chapter per week.My observation is that the graphics are good, and the writing is good, but the game elements were severely lacking, particularly in how ON-THE-RAILS the game was.Locations seemed to have the bare minimum of elements to inspect before moving on to the next setting. And non-combat operations, particularly the ones that are RMB + cursor, didn't have any sense of difficulty. Every so often, the game essentially pauses for you to perform some trivial action.It's kinda like the Telltale devs were given nice artwork, a good story, and decent dialog choices. Plugging the artwork, story and dialog together could be described as competent, but the gameplay related to non-combat operations was entirely lacking. The devs did not appear to understand how to implement fun gameplay elements.Walking Dead fans will enjoy the story, but it will be quite apparent how linear the game is. It's somewhat a disappointment that Telltale is able to sell an incomplete game on the strength of a story that was provided to them. Lazy. "

												If you’re going to play this, then I assume you enjoyed and understand how great season one was, so this will just focus on the differences/improvements. Extremely riveting (even more so than season one). Playing as Clementime adds a whole extra storytelling layer to the already well-established “peril” of the world of ‘The Walking Dead’. Tying into the above point; the writing is even more tight and powerful, with far fewer clichés and a bit more flexibility. The best part about it though, is the control (even with the limits that are obviously placed) you have over the emotional side of the ending. I can’t say more than that without possibly giving something away, but I was impressed. "

												Just as good as Season 1. Clementine is forced to determine the value of human life. Is one person worth risking your own life, or two lives, or three lives? At what point is a single person no longer worth the sacrifice of many? It's something she'll be forced to decide on as she uses everything taught to her, by Lee, by Christa, and by several others, in order to survive both the Walkers and social challenges. The Season 2 climax is hit or miss; you either love it or hate it. Personally, I loved it, and found it to be arguably the hardest choice in the series.			"

												The gameplay is the same as the last Season, but the UI has been changed a bit. Sometimes, it was hard for me to see selection indicators, which caused a few Game Overs and screwed me over in one of the big decisions toward the end. Story-wise, it progresses right where Season One left off, and does have characters from 400 Days, so it'd be worth going through that beforehand. The ending, though... Season One's ending was so powerful, and there is a powerful decision near the end of this game, but I just feel the impact of it was killed when the game didn't end there. I won't spoil it, because this is the kind of game you play for the story. The ending just left a slightly sour taste in my mouth after the emotionally powerful scene before it.I give it a 9/10. The selection indicators blending in too well in some areas and the very end of the story hold this back from being perfect, but it is DEFINITELY worth playing. Telltale Games knows what they're doing with this series, and I can't wait for more.EDIT: Ok, so my complaint with the end of the story just means I picked the wrong options. Unlike Season 1, there are branching endings, and the branch I picked is very underwhelming. Very curious as to what this means for any future seasons... Updated score: 9.5/10 Only thing keeping it from being perfect is the selection indicators, other than that, it's completely and utterly fantastic. Completely worth your time and money.			"

												Maybe the game that surprised me the most in my life. The Walking Dead is not just a video game, it is a psychological experience. You are put into dramatic situations (like two people going to die and you can save just one), and you have to choose very quickly. If you think about your choices through the story, you will learn a lot about yourself.It is a sequel, you should start with the first game before going into Season 2.			"

												The Walking Dead : Season 2? Where do I begin? Well first, I'd like to say that Telltale has once again handled the dark nature of the TWD universe successfully in this installment. The second season of the game in my opinion is another worthy entry of the ongoing franchise.Like the seasons of the TV show, Season 2 of the game stands out with a different tone and feel than the previous season. In Season 1, we played as Lee Everett, a man given a second chance in life during the zombie apocalypse after he just murdered someone. Season 1 of the game explored the idea of being a father figure to an orphaned young girl, Clementine and trying to raise a child in the beginning of what can be considered a terrible world.Season 2 evolves from that. In this game, you play as Clementine herself and the world in this state of the game doesn't give a damn if she's a child or not. She's a survivor. It's 16 months after the initial outbreak and other survivors living in the wilderness or broken cityscapes are more hardened and adapted than before. Many are untrustworthy and some are honest, good people. Season 2 brings the character of Clementine from an innocent child to a more mature 11 year old that can handle herself. This makes her feel underestimed by the adults she comes across. So basically, Season 2 is kind of about growing up early.About the story itself, well I'd say it's well-written for what it is. You get to know a lot about the new characters and older ones that reappear feel more fleshed out than before. You get allies that you may end up hating and encountering a villain that you can somewhat agree with. The only problem with the story is that the 5 episodes are shorter than the first season. But because the story of the second season is so engaging, it makes up for that. Now is it better than the first season? Yes and No. Unfortunately for the second season, there is a lack of puzzles that were present in the first season. The second season is mainly going through dialogue choices and picking up items to push the story forward. There is also a lot more main character deaths in Season 2 than the first. So if you get attached to one character, don't expect him or her to live long. But then again, this is the Walking Dead. Quick character deaths in all 3 mediums (Comic,TV show, game) are to be expected. However the second season shines in better voice acting, interesting new locations and well-acted villain by the name of William ""Bill"" Carver.  Oh and the combat against walkers are a little bit improved. And one more thing, the game has 5 different endings. 2 of them can lead you to entirely different locations. This makes me wonder how unique the first episode of the Third season can start.And is it a good entry to The Walking Dead franchise? Yes. I always felt the game has really been it's own thing. The comic book is about the story and journey of Rick Grimes. The TV show is simply an adaptation of the original comic but also puts it's own spin on various storylines. The game is about Clementine. Lee Everett may have been the original protagonist of the first season, but it's still about Clementine. If there's truly one great thing about TWD : Season 2, it's that it grabs you emotionally. It doesn't matter how imperfect the game is, Telltale cares enough to grab the audience's emotions...So yes, I recommend this game to all Walking Dead fans. "

												Dont get me wrong, I adore The Walking Dead Game franchise. I love the concept, the characters, and TellTale are great in what they did. I've got a HUGE emotional attatchment to each and every character.I played the first game (which is a MUST if you're planning on playing the second) and I loved it.Now, this is why I wont rate Season 2 as good as season 1- Season one took me 20 hours to complete. Season Two took me 8.This isnt because of lack of storyline, the actual story is the same length, and I have no problems with the story. This is because of the lack of the ability to talk and get to know characters.Season One. At the farm. You can go and talk to Katjaa, when shes with Clem. You can talk to Kenny. You can learn about their backstory, where they used to live, and so on. Season Two, without giving away any spoilers, you simply cant. You dont get to learn about the groups past, and a lot of them die off before you get a chance to ask. I'm the type of player who will spend time to talk to every person in between the action scenes. But in SSN2, you dont get the oppourtinity. It sucks, becasue I like finding out about characters. I like knowing about them. But they end up dying, and im left like ""So... What ever happened to them?""One more thing. The ending of SSN1 was powerful, and hit home for most players, because everyone loved Lee. I dont think there was ANYONE who didnt like him at the end. But in season two, without trying to give away the ending- as much as they tried to make a big ending, if you didnt like the characters at the end, the choice wasnt so difficult at all. Like I said, I love the game, and I would still reccomend it to people who want to follow Clementines story. But, I feel like it was rushed, and it could of been thought out a lot more thoroughly before release. If there was a mixed feelings button to post this review as, it would be that, but Im still going to rate it up- becasue at the end of the day- Clementine is great and I still like to know how shes going to follow her story.

												The Walking Dead Season 2 proved to be just as tough to bare the tough choices you make as the first season. You play Clementine this time and go through what would seem as a ""what would Lee do"" at times, but of course Clementines has her own character.After finishing chapter 5, I could not help but feel terrible of the choices I made, notiably the last couple before the credits rolled. Never have I felt more uncomfortable making a tough choice over close to 30 years of gaming. Telltale truly delivered in bringing me the dark world of The Walking Dead.The one thing that I do noticed which felt like a downgrade for season 2 was the fact that it felt less intereactive and adventurous compared to the diversity of the 1st season. Not only did I feel that the first 3 episodes went by quickly, but at times felt like there could of been more to it. Perhaps this was done to help with pacing and have the player feel more engaged.Overall, The Walking Dead Season 2 is A MUST play for those who enjoyed Season 1. For those who haven't so and are interested, play both seasons as that is the way its meant to be played, you will not regret it, except perhaps some of the choices you'll make in game.			"

Each ending of an Episode makes you want to sit until you finish all of them.

												This may contain spoilers, but I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible.Episode 1 This is how you start off a game. This was intense all the way to the end. And don't underestimate Clementine, she's one badass little girl.Episode 1 introduces a lot of new characters, which you'll get to know better later. I give it 10/10.Episode 2You start off right where you left in episode 1 and then you take it from there. Tell tale are still ceeping you on the edge of your seat.In episode 2 you get to know the characters some more and without spoiling too much, you get to meet some familiar ones too. I give it 9/10, cause it's dramatic as ♥♥♥♥.Episode 3 Now, this was an interesting one. Episode 3 brings back the characters from twd: 400 days (even though, we don't get to see them alot), but it does introduce some new characters. Lastly it felt to me that your actions had more to say in this episode. Like what you did actoually matters (unlike some previous episodes). So I would give it a 7.5/10 as it doesn't do too much for the story, but it does set up for episode 4.Episode 4Episode 4 starts just where you left in ep 3 and has you continue from there. Now, episode 4 is all about arguing. You try to please evryone, but it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥world, and no matter what you do, someone's going to get hurt.I give it 8/10 as it gives you a lot of choises (more than previously).Episode 5So I just played through ep 5.... I... It's a long(er) episode (big plus!) but evrything happens so fast. Winter's coming, you're low on food and meds, you have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥russians with guns, a crew that's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at each other and you have a baby on your hands, what do you do?Episode 5 continues the right where episode 4 ended and let's you go from there. There are lot's of stuf happening here and Clementine has a moment (which I expected). *I have only played through it once, so I have not experienced all the endings*The end is as dramatic as you get it. There's a massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm, and you're in the middle of it. The ending I had was heartbreaking. I shed several man tears and my face looked like the face you get the first time you're shot with a needle. The ending is all up to you. As far as I know, there is not an ending such as in twd s1, where you can wait it out and see what your clementin does. Or it might be, I'm not sure about that, but I am sure that the ending is gonna be sad, no matter what your choises are.Episode 5 gets 10/10, It's everything that I wanted and it made me cry (and I thaught I was all out of feels).So as a summary, The walking dead season 2 was a great secual in my opinion, and gets a 9/10. It had it's ups and downs but mostly ups, andin the end it was great (even though there was atleast 1 loose thread as I know of).			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2, is just as amazingly good as the first game, or possibly better. The events that occured within the game, and the decision making were a lot more emotionally forced. This game may not be suitable for those who like to play action-filled games that keep their hands busy. It's more for those players that want to lay back, and enjoy the storyline of a game.  Nevertheless, I absolutely love this game. 10/10, would recommend.			"

												Telltale have not let anyone down with the second installment to a brilliant game. This also has a really good narrative and also the character development through this season is very interesting and you have to play this if you have played the first especially as the choices you make in the first season can affect what happens in season 2. Also the new introduction of different characters it makes the game more interesting with different personalities and the voice acting again is outstanding. 10/10 would play again.			"

												This one is just as good as the first one, if not better, and well, The Walking Dead Season 1 was one of the best games of 2012, so I can call it one of the best games of 2014 without a doubt.The story, its characters, and their struggle in the zombie apocalypse is very well written. That's what Telltale Games do best. I hope this story continues as soon as possible.			"

												So the question is: The walking dead season 2 is as good as the first one?sadly the answer is no, for many reasons.SPOILERS AHEAD!First of all, Clementine even if she is a great character is not Lee, and I know it's not fair because trying to fill Lee's shoes is hard but again she is not Lee, a good character but not as interesting or good as Lee was.Second, the group that you are with is not as remote interesting as the one you had with Lee, most of them you know them for just a few days and then they die very quiclky, it's hard to made a bond with people that you just knew recently and they are being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you since the first second they met you... for example, Rebbecca is a ♥♥♥♥♥ at first but then you get to know her better and it's not like that but when she dies it doesnt affect you because didnt knew her at all in the first place...Same as Sarah, it's sad when she dies but meh, who was she?why should you care if she dies?you talked with her only very few times....The only characters that are a little interesting are luke, Mike (dies in a very stupid way for saving Sarah!!!) Kenny(and kenny is and old character) and Jane (she stays with you a fraction of a time)The other thing is the game is shorter than the previous one, the dlc didnt add anything to the game, all the characters are shown just for a few seconds except for the most boring and bland one that is Bonnie!Overall it's not a bad game but is not that masterpiece that the first one was :(PS: Telltale stop using the Lee's voice to do the intro of the chapters! IT freaking weird and sad!			"

A variety of new and old characters interact to make a really fun and enticing narrative with some unforgettable moments.

												The walkers keep on coming. Season 2 of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead would continue the breakthrough adventure gameplay of the original.Season Two continues the story that began in Season One. You are Clementine, a young survivor in a world gone to hell. The dead have risen to feast on the living, and the living cannot be trusted.The story you experience in The Walking Dead Season Two is driven by the choices that you make. Because of that, your story could be very different from someone else’s. If you played Season One and the DLC episode ‘400 Days’, the choices you made there will affect Season Two. You don’t have to have played Season One or 400 Days, however, to play through and experience The Walking Dead: Season Two.9/10			"

												A continuation of an already great game, Season 2 is a welcome edition to the series. Season 2 has been a bit of a mixed bag for a lot of people, and I can respect that, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Sure, it may not be as strong as the first season, and it fumbles a bit, especially around it's mid-point, but it's still a solid experience through and through, and the goods of this season still outweigh its badsFor me, it's a worthy successor to the first season, and while it may not hit as hard as the first season, it still packs one hell of a punch on it's own.

												If you buy any game as a avid player or as a bit here and a bit there player, you have to buy this game along with the first one. This game no wait this story is one of the best that I have ever spent money on and it was worth all of it. You will hate characters love characters no matter what choices you make. This story will test your humanity with every move you make. It will make you hate yourself and feel great when you do that one thing that makes things look better for everyone well being. It will toug the heart strings and sucker punch you before you know it. Ask anyone you know that has played this and if they don't say but it as soon as you ask then they are crazy.

												From the beginning it is a bit blodier than first season was,  I was shocked by it I must say(Really? Seving her own hand?!). But then it is perfect storytelling same as in first season. Although I didn't like some parts and wasn't happy about having to do some things, (Why did I have to kill Serita?) it was a great game after all. I wish some things wouldn't happened. (Like Bonnie turned out to be total b*tch and Jane stupid m*ron. But at lest Kenny forgave Clementine he shoot him. At least he died satisfied a bit. Maybe a bit proud of her.) But I am looking forward to next season. (And I am totally expecting to see Christa in it.). It was amazing experience. If you like this type of games, just play it. You won't regret it.( And you will see Lee again!).Edit: I just saw another ending....( I am just going to play last part again and not kill Kenny. He just didn't deserve it. He is broken, but he doesn't deserve it. "

												Not as impressive as the first game, but still a well written piece of fiction.The reason I don't believe this game is as good as Season 1 is simply because you learn from the game as it progresses. What I mean is, you really start to notice that this game doesn't really care what you decide to do, in the end it's not about if you made the right or wrong decision, it's all about just progressing. And that sort of alleviates the power of ""choice"". I've noticed this a lot in games, not just the Walking Dead. Games that give you the ""power of choice"" give you a lot of options, but not enough consequences. Like say, you find a man stuck between two cars (THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE GAME), zombies are coming after him, he has tormented your group for a long time now and has clearly established his evilness, what do you do?A) Save himB) Don't save him.Well, if you choose to not save him, he dies. End of that. But what if you choose option B? Well, he still dies. End of that. I've noticed way too much in just the first episode. Everything happens not because you let it happen, but because the developers just didn't want to go to the trouble and make additional cutscenes and dialogue. While this may seem like a bad thing it sort of brings in this theme of fragility and the illusion of choice. We can't always get what we want. Things happen, and we can't always help it, whether we like it or not. I'm not sure if the devs wanted this to be a ""theme"", but it's sort of tiring honestly. Which is why I'm saying this isn't as impressive as the first game, because it's like a magic trick; I know there's a card under the magician's sleeve, so I know how this whole trick is going to go down. However, when I first saw that little piece of illusion happen before my eyes, I was dazzled. Now this game has more smoke and mirrors than a strip club locker room. (Thanks Max Payne 3 for the great quote!)That's just not the only issue we have with the game, but it's also the main character this time around, Clementine. I loved Clementine as a supporting character, and as a symbol of innocence during the first game, and her symbolic image is even stronger in this game because of the fact that she's now a dying piece of purity, showing that♥♥♥♥♥♥is much more drastic than it ever was before. However, now that she's become the leading role, I honestly don't care much for Clem anymore. It's not the fact that she's just a little girl or anything of the sort, it's just the fact that Clementine is no longer an interesting character. Her main piece of interest in the last game was that she was innocent, and that she was someone to protect; an objective throughout the whole game. Now, what's the point anymore? I do love Clementine as a character, strong, mature, and level headed but still just a child, but I can't say I enjoyed playing AS Clementine. Clem should stay a secondary character, she just doesn't fit the role for this game.Speaking of which, the game doesn't feel as grand anymore. Which is strange to say, considering the last game took place in the motel 60% of the time, and this game has you somewhere completely different every single episode, but it's sort of falling for the ""quantity over quality"" thing. I wish it focused more on the objective, whatever that was. It was never really clear. At first it was just survival, then ""Wilmington"" then baby, then, ♥♥♥♥, just GO SOMEWHERE ALREADY! We were in so many places and under so many situations that there was no clear end game and made me sort of not care in the end. It also doesn't help that, because we went so many places and did so much, the cliffhangers sort of failed to grab my interest.Nevertheless, it was a fantasticly written piece, and I loved every character. The game had a LOT of tense moments, and despite me knowing smoke in mirrors trick, I still didn't know how exactly it was going to end. It still felt very heavy and very dangerous, and I loved the game. It's extremely short, so you can totally beat it in a day or two, maybe even three. Either way, it's still worth checking out.			"

												(This is a post-ep5 tribute. It won't make sense until you've finished the whole game.)One by one, the good people fell.The glue that held them together.They dissolved away, one by one.All that remained was a handful of irreconcilable people.What was a little girl to do...When good people become consumed by their bad deeds...She could only try to bring them together.Do what Lee would have wanted her to do.What she thinks he would have done.Alas, she saw him in her dreams,but the little girl knew far too much now.She knew everyone was going to die.She knew things were not going to be okay.She couldn't ask him to promise...Promise that he will always be there for her.She still remembered that moment like yesterday.He... couldn't be there for her anymore.All she could ask was for him to tell her that it will be okay,as if Lee said it, it might actually become okay.She woke up from that dream into the other one,but her friends were still consumed by madness.All who were left crossed that one last river and weren't going to come back.She did her best to do what Lee might have done,but soon she realised... (or maybe she was forced to realise,)That these people are truly irreconcilable.She shot her best friend.She had done it again.For his blind fury was about to strip away the last friend left to her.But as Clem found out, she wasn't so honourable either.She asked Clem to join her and walk away...Clem did not say a word.What was a little girl to say...---They went back to the Satanic Mill, moths to a flame.A storm had run through the flame,but it was still very much lit.And to that flame, more moths flocked.Her friend suggested driving them away.She in turn, invited them in.She's not sure why.She could only think of Lee.He told her everything was going to be okay.And in the end, that was the ultimate truth he told her.What was a little girl to do?She did her best.Time and time again, she did her best.And she kept doing her best even now.This was the best she could do.And she had no regrets.Everything, will be okay.

												Dont get me wrong, I adore The Walking Dead Game franchise. I love the concept, the characters, and TellTale are great in what they did. I've got a HUGE emotional attatchment to each and every character.I played the first game (which is a MUST if you're planning on playing the second) and I loved it.Now, this is why I wont rate Season 2 as good as season 1- Season one took me 20 hours to complete. Season Two took me 8.This isnt because of lack of storyline, the actual story is the same length, and I have no problems with the story. This is because of the lack of the ability to talk and get to know characters.Season One. At the farm. You can go and talk to Katjaa, when shes with Clem. You can talk to Kenny. You can learn about their backstory, where they used to live, and so on. Season Two, without giving away any spoilers, you simply cant. You dont get to learn about the groups past, and a lot of them die off before you get a chance to ask. I'm the type of player who will spend time to talk to every person in between the action scenes. But in SSN2, you dont get the oppourtinity. It sucks, becasue I like finding out about characters. I like knowing about them. But they end up dying, and im left like ""So... What ever happened to them?""One more thing. The ending of SSN1 was powerful, and hit home for most players, because everyone loved Lee. I dont think there was ANYONE who didnt like him at the end. But in season two, without trying to give away the ending- as much as they tried to make a big ending, if you didnt like the characters at the end, the choice wasnt so difficult at all. Like I said, I love the game, and I would still reccomend it to people who want to follow Clementines story. But, I feel like it was rushed, and it could of been thought out a lot more thoroughly before release. If there was a mixed feelings button to post this review as, it would be that, but Im still going to rate it up- becasue at the end of the day- Clementine is great and I still like to know how shes going to follow her story.

This game is intelligent enough to know that choices cannot be defined as 'good' or 'evil', and it is not most important that others learn to live with your decisions, only that you do.			"

												Most criticisms of this game revolve around the fact that this isn't necessarily a 'game'. My argument is so what? If you have emotions, an imagination, enjoy television with story or enjoy reading books, losing yourself in another world, then this is definitely for you. Only a moron cannot appreciate something of beauty and will criticise this because he isn't running around shooting like a maniac. Now that the biggest criticism is addressed I will write about why you should play this:What do you get if you buy this?Dozens of hours of intense emotional story telling which lets you interact in minor ways about how things play out. You MUST play season 1 if you intend on playing season 2. I quite literally cried at a few points in this game and that's a rare thing for a person like me to do, but you fall in love with the characters, their voice/acting is marvelous and you definitely get immersed in the story as it unfolds. I don't have anything left to say. Buy this game if you want to kill a dozen or so hours in a beautiful story and reignite your emotional side! There is no excuse to not purchasing this now that season 1 & 2 are on sale. You will get about 30 hours of 'story' from season 1 & 2 combined, and for the price of a cinema ticket. Value!			"

												One of the few games I've played that deserves a standing ovation. Here comes a game that is simple to learn but not easy to play - and not because it demands strategy or skill but because it's characters are interesting and lifelike.You will come to love and loathe them but more importantly: you will come to love and loathe yourself for how you choose to treat them. This game is intelligent enough to know that choices cannot be defined as 'good' or 'evil', and it is not most important that others learn to live with your decisions, only that you do.			"

												One of my personal favourite games I have ever had the pleasure to experience. It's gameplay doesn't require much learning, a classic point and click adventure where you feel the neccesity to listen and react to dialogue as though you are the character in the situation you find yourself in.Beautifully crafted narrative that lets you choose how to react and approach a situation. Although it feels that no matter what something's you choose doesn't affect an outcome it is always satisfying to have a say in the moment.10/10			"

												The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a continuation of the first season and follows a similar structure. However, there is one major difference: the player plays as Clementine, a young girl. This change from the first season, where the player was an able-bodied man, makes for an intriguing shift in play style. In general, this game is similar to the first season in graphics. In terms of story, it keeps you on your toes while delivering a fleshed-out plotline that doesn't dissapoint. I enjoyed the first season's story a little more, but the change in main character warrants the same rating for both games. For anyone who enjoyed the first season, I would recommend this game.Pros:-Excellent, immersive storyline that keeps you on your toes-Characters have realistic and interesting personalitiesCons:-Only lasts ~12 hours (although the many possible choices make it replayable)-Not as good graphics as most other modern single-player gamesMy overall rating: 85/100			"

												The Walking Dead : Season 2? Where do I begin? Well first, I'd like to say that Telltale has once again handled the dark nature of the TWD universe successfully in this installment. The second season of the game in my opinion is another worthy entry of the ongoing franchise.Like the seasons of the TV show, Season 2 of the game stands out with a different tone and feel than the previous season. In Season 1, we played as Lee Everett, a man given a second chance in life during the zombie apocalypse after he just murdered someone. Season 1 of the game explored the idea of being a father figure to an orphaned young girl, Clementine and trying to raise a child in the beginning of what can be considered a terrible world.Season 2 evolves from that. In this game, you play as Clementine herself and the world in this state of the game doesn't give a damn if she's a child or not. She's a survivor. It's 16 months after the initial outbreak and other survivors living in the wilderness or broken cityscapes are more hardened and adapted than before. Many are untrustworthy and some are honest, good people. Season 2 brings the character of Clementine from an innocent child to a more mature 11 year old that can handle herself. This makes her feel underestimed by the adults she comes across. So basically, Season 2 is kind of about growing up early.About the story itself, well I'd say it's well-written for what it is. You get to know a lot about the new characters and older ones that reappear feel more fleshed out than before. You get allies that you may end up hating and encountering a villain that you can somewhat agree with. The only problem with the story is that the 5 episodes are shorter than the first season. But because the story of the second season is so engaging, it makes up for that. Now is it better than the first season? Yes and No. Unfortunately for the second season, there is a lack of puzzles that were present in the first season. The second season is mainly going through dialogue choices and picking up items to push the story forward. There is also a lot more main character deaths in Season 2 than the first. So if you get attached to one character, don't expect him or her to live long. But then again, this is the Walking Dead. Quick character deaths in all 3 mediums (Comic,TV show, game) are to be expected. However the second season shines in better voice acting, interesting new locations and well-acted villain by the name of William ""Bill"" Carver.  Oh and the combat against walkers are a little bit improved. And one more thing, the game has 5 different endings. 2 of them can lead you to entirely different locations. This makes me wonder how unique the first episode of the Third season can start.And is it a good entry to The Walking Dead franchise? Yes. I always felt the game has really been it's own thing. The comic book is about the story and journey of Rick Grimes. The TV show is simply an adaptation of the original comic but also puts it's own spin on various storylines. The game is about Clementine. Lee Everett may have been the original protagonist of the first season, but it's still about Clementine. If there's truly one great thing about TWD : Season 2, it's that it grabs you emotionally. It doesn't matter how imperfect the game is, Telltale cares enough to grab the audience's emotions...So yes, I recommend this game to all Walking Dead fans. "

												If you  think that Game of Thrones and GRR Martin are cruel to their audience then you haven't experienced the Walking Dead. You will learn to love the characters and then you will lose them and the cruelest thing is that you feel responsible for it. I would also reccomend playing it at night			"

The game holds your hand a bit more but the choices you make have more of an impact emotionally and on the progression. A huge fan of the narrative driven game style and I would highly reccomend playing through all of season 1 and the 400 days dlc to ensure full immersion and attatchment to the story and characters.

After a strong opening with Episode I, subsequent ones feel disjointed as new characters are introduced and abandoned en masse. I also really don't like how this season limits player interactivity. There are much less scenes where you can walk around, explore, and do many optional activities that add the flavor. Interquel in a form of 400 days also feels pointless now and I bet if I didin't bother with it, I'd barely notice the diffrence. That said Season 2 still is a very good Telltale-esque adventure game. Foreboding atmosphere is still here, coupled with plenty action scenes and suprising amount of violence. I also liked how Clementine turned out to be. Always nice to see a strong female lead in a videogame. Overall Season 2 is definitely worth picking out, it is only a little bit worse than the original.			"

												Along with Walking Dead Season 1, this game is very good. Tear-jerker moments along with grisly parts...I admit I feel dizzy during one part in the very beginning, which makes me think I won't be a good surgery assistant. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this game, if only because unlike Mass Effect 1-3, the only other series where game choices carry over to the next game, Seasons 1 and 2 of the Walking Dead have endings that actually pertain to what choices you make. There is no one branching point for all the decisions for the endings like in ME3, but instead other choices branch, and then branch again.Also, other events that you forgot about in Season 1 or 2, deeming them inconsequential, make their appearance later on, proving that almost no choice is without consequences.

												This may contain spoilers, but I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible.Episode 1 This is how you start off a game. This was intense all the way to the end. And don't underestimate Clementine, she's one badass little girl.Episode 1 introduces a lot of new characters, which you'll get to know better later. I give it 10/10.Episode 2You start off right where you left in episode 1 and then you take it from there. Tell tale are still ceeping you on the edge of your seat.In episode 2 you get to know the characters some more and without spoiling too much, you get to meet some familiar ones too. I give it 9/10, cause it's dramatic as ♥♥♥♥.Episode 3 Now, this was an interesting one. Episode 3 brings back the characters from twd: 400 days (even though, we don't get to see them alot), but it does introduce some new characters. Lastly it felt to me that your actions had more to say in this episode. Like what you did actoually matters (unlike some previous episodes). So I would give it a 7.5/10 as it doesn't do too much for the story, but it does set up for episode 4.Episode 4Episode 4 starts just where you left in ep 3 and has you continue from there. Now, episode 4 is all about arguing. You try to please evryone, but it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥world, and no matter what you do, someone's going to get hurt.I give it 8/10 as it gives you a lot of choises (more than previously).Episode 5So I just played through ep 5.... I... It's a long(er) episode (big plus!) but evrything happens so fast. Winter's coming, you're low on food and meds, you have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥russians with guns, a crew that's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at each other and you have a baby on your hands, what do you do?Episode 5 continues the right where episode 4 ended and let's you go from there. There are lot's of stuf happening here and Clementine has a moment (which I expected). *I have only played through it once, so I have not experienced all the endings*The end is as dramatic as you get it. There's a massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm, and you're in the middle of it. The ending I had was heartbreaking. I shed several man tears and my face looked like the face you get the first time you're shot with a needle. The ending is all up to you. As far as I know, there is not an ending such as in twd s1, where you can wait it out and see what your clementin does. Or it might be, I'm not sure about that, but I am sure that the ending is gonna be sad, no matter what your choises are.Episode 5 gets 10/10, It's everything that I wanted and it made me cry (and I thaught I was all out of feels).So as a summary, The walking dead season 2 was a great secual in my opinion, and gets a 9/10. It had it's ups and downs but mostly ups, andin the end it was great (even though there was atleast 1 loose thread as I know of).			"

												Overall, it requires a fair lot less 'doing' than the first game.The point and click factor in itself may be fairly straight-forward, but Season 2 seems to be more like watching a cinematic reel, and so it isn't quite as immersive in regards to gameplay. But there are still copious chances for the player to have Clementine give verbal input (albeit with questionable importance and influence).The story is still pretty decent, even if some elements can be frustrating (i.e: the aforementioned watch-over-play feel), and a few stupid shenanigans started by the supporting cast, but all in all, if The Walking Dead Game was your cup of tea, this one is worth giving a shot. Even if it's just for story progression.			"

												This is a must buy if you played through season 1. First 3 episodes are fantastic. They are both engaging and enthralling. Also the aesthetic of each episode respectively is great. For some reason I wasn't too fond of episode 4. While it is an imporant part of the story, its a story arc i'm glad to see finished. Then episode 5 picks back up again and makes for an intense ending that I would say, gives season 1's ending a run for its money.I feel that the decisions you make in this season, as opposed to the first, have more durastic consequences.Anyways this game is more than worth paying full price for, but if you see it on sale JUMP on it.Can't wait for season 3.OVERALL: 10/10.

												The Walking Dead Season 2 proved to be just as tough to bare the tough choices you make as the first season. You play Clementine this time and go through what would seem as a ""what would Lee do"" at times, but of course Clementines has her own character.After finishing chapter 5, I could not help but feel terrible of the choices I made, notiably the last couple before the credits rolled. Never have I felt more uncomfortable making a tough choice over close to 30 years of gaming. Telltale truly delivered in bringing me the dark world of The Walking Dead.The one thing that I do noticed which felt like a downgrade for season 2 was the fact that it felt less intereactive and adventurous compared to the diversity of the 1st season. Not only did I feel that the first 3 episodes went by quickly, but at times felt like there could of been more to it. Perhaps this was done to help with pacing and have the player feel more engaged.Overall, The Walking Dead Season 2 is A MUST play for those who enjoyed Season 1. For those who haven't so and are interested, play both seasons as that is the way its meant to be played, you will not regret it, except perhaps some of the choices you'll make in game.			"

I will admit I cried 7 times, overall in season 1 and season 2. This game has probably the best storyline I have ever seen in my life. You connect to the characters like you have known them for your whole life. Even though the graphics could be worked on, I still love every bit. I miss Lee (i cri every tim) "

												Just as great as the first game, although the characters come and go more than they stay (like in the first one). If you haven't played the first game, please do before purchasing this because it won't make as much sense (and definitely get 400 Days as it ties to the storyline loosely). Very heartwrenching storyline - it made me cry - just like the first one :)			"

												If are a fan of the Walking Dead franchise, and if you enjoyed the first game, then I would definietly recommend that you play this game as well..... but before you do that, don't forget about the DLC for the first game either. I found the second season to be slightly shorter than the first, but that didn't really bother me. There were alot of new characters to meet, new areas to explore, and lots of decisions to make. I also liked the character development and how my choices from the first season seemed to have carried over.On top of that, Telltale also seemed to have improved on the graphics from the first game, but I am still not sure if like the new choice selection menu.Just like the previous game, I really liked how all of my choices seemed meaningful, and I like to think that they had some sort of a impact on the way the story progressed. At this point I don't just wanna start season 2 over, NO... I wanna go all the way back to season 1, and play it through once again, to see if the story could have progressed differently.			"

 Overview After the huge success that was season 1 I found myself wondering and worrying that season 2 would just never be able to match up.And I've never been happier to be proven wrong as season 2 manages to easily deliver an equally intense and emotional ride as season 1, also.... Kenny's alive and a large part of this game so that's a massive win as well.The story is once again well put together and certainly manages to catch you off guard with some really gutwrenching and tear-jerking moments.   That said, if you've played season 1 then that no doubt doesn't really come as a surprise and if you haven't.... then why the hell not?There are some minor negatives off course, mainly that some of the characters in this season are a bit more bland then the ones in season 1.Also everybody follow and obeying a little kid during the entire story is perhaps logically speaking not really all that realisitc, no matter how baddass that kid might be at times.Lastly, if you're not a fan of quicktime events stay far far away.... but then if you do, why are you even looking at a telltale games game in the first place? Pro's and con's  + Great story+ Plenty of emotional moments+ Clementine+ A good amount of different endings depending on your choices+ Cellshaded graphics - A few really bland characters- A bit too short for my liking Overall Score   9/10  "

Once again, teared up at the ending, really really damn good franchise, even though there isn't that much gameplay, and it's more like an interactive movie with descisions, I still loved ever bit of it, including season 1.

												The Walking Dead: Season 2.  Awesome game.  Awesome series.  The game can run off your Season 1 save file and ""read"" what your choices were in the other game.  If you don't have the save file, it'll just make a random game for you to go off from.  Just like any Telltale game, the story is amazing and the story develops according to what choices you make/do. I can go on about the positives about the game but they've been covered by the other reviewers so I'm going to just quickly tell about the problems I had with this instead.  Don't get me wrong, I like the game but just because I like it doesn't mean it has some faults with it.  First off, the ""problems"" that I'm going to picking on are mostly from the change from the first season to this season so bear that in mind. To interact with something that has multiple choices, you can either click on the option itself or click and drag into the direction the option is in.  Sometimes it doesn't register what I want to do and makes Clementine just walk and do nothing (using both ways of selecting an option).  In other scenes where you're suppose to press one of the WASD keys to avoid death.  The game will only register the key right after you can move.  So when the games tells you to press, you can't press it immediately.  I had to tap the key they tell me until I see Clementine move because it wouldn't register.There are also scenes where you have to click in the direction they're telling you to move in order to avoid death but I swear to god that I can not see them until it's too late.  It could be because I'm colorblind (red/green) but I don't know, I feel like they should've made the color white instead of red.  Blends in too well imo.The choices that you're given and the time given to select an option seems a bit too fast. (May not be for you!) Like I skim over the options and as soon as I finish skimming I have 1 second to move my mouse and choose.  Another 2 seconds or so in my opinion would be very helpful.  By the end of the game, I saw myself pressing the spacebar to pause and read the options to have unlimited time.edit; typos and grammar			"

												Already in the first episode I’m blown away. This might just be the fan boy for the show, games, and comic books but I cannot recommend this game enough. The dialog is beyond amazing with your choices effecting the game is some way. You can’t help but become attached to the character all around you they have their ups and downs making juicy drama you can’t help but ask for more! I’d give this game an easy 10/10 due to how submerged you can become into the game with a new episode each month you’ll be sitting at the end of your chair drooling for more.			"

												Great game that I highly recommend for those who enjoy story-based, character-focused games with solid injections of action and choices that affect the plot significantly.CAVEAT: Currently, you'll be paying the 24.99 for about 2 hours of play time. For whatever reason, Telltale has decided to release episodes slowly over the course of the year. While this builds anticipation, it's also quite frustrating. This strategy also risks people essentialy forgetting how much they ""care"" about the characters and what choices they made during the previous episode (and for what reasons).Love the game, but the rationing of the episodes is very frustrating. If I had it to all over again I would wait however long it takes for all the episodes to be released and then buy the game (probably for less than half price).			"

												This game picks right up from where season one left off, although not storywise entirely, so be ready for that. Let me be clear from the get go, season 2 is not as sentimental as the first one was. That may be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you feel about sentimental stuff and strong character building between two persons, but the overall feeling and the caring I had about the characters in season one I did not have in season two, or lets say it was a little bit different. However, make no mistake about it, the story is as strong if not stronger than that of season 1 and the twists and turns are right around every corner and the choices you make still somehow effect the whole game, so... that's great. Somehow although we are already familiar with the mechanics of the game, I still yurn for more of what I was just fed, just like human flesh for zombies. YUMMIE! ^^It's so cool to make actual decisions in the game and the narrative is based on the decisions that I make. Of course the decisions are a little like WWE. It's mostly smoke and not really real.By that, I mean, your decisions won't make or brake the fate of the characters, which kinda sucks, BUT, I am ok with it. In wrestling, although the fights are a great show, we know that everything has been scripted before hand and the winner is chosen long before the fight, it's a little the same feeling i get playing The walking dead series, but that doesn't stop me from ""believing"" and ohhhing and ahhhing for WWE or TWD, I still care and get psyched from both.And I can't wait for season three to get here, and oh, if you've read all the way up to this point, then by now you know what I am hinting at, so... GO GET... LIKE NOW, you won't be dissapointed if you liked anything of what the first season had to offer.			"

												From beginning to end, this is one thrill ride that nearly rivals the gut wrenching first season. If you have not managed to play the first game then stop reading, picking that episodic gem up on the cheap, beat it, then fly through this second season, as you won't regret it! My wife and I played through this together to weigh the various decisions and brainstorm ways to handle the more dramatic moments. All in all we found this a very fun / interactive way to play, as it gave room for a level of ""fun"" deliberation that was not always easy to pull off due to the time scenarious you're faced with. What you will get here is some of the best story telling gaming has had to offer in quite some time coupled with a unique design aesthetic that drives home the gameplay. You can't go wrong with this series; here's hoping that season 3 is just as good, if not better!			"

												The Second Season of ""God, I want to kill myself"" the Game is out. Just as gripping, with Clementine having learned the lessons Lee taught her. The story has nice depth, even if you can see things coming at times. Like Season One, you can't save everyone, no matter how hard you try, and some things that do not give you a choice make you feel dead inside.It's a good game, and highly recommended if you enjoyed the first one. The fact that Clem can just stand and glare at people and her gaze unnerves them, is a nice touch. She's less scared little girl and more hardened young survivor. Out of the groups you meet she's the toughest and the most sane out of all of them.			"

												Assuming you are aware that this is not a gameplay oriented game but a story driven, graphic adventure, click game, it's absolutely amazing. You should definitely play the first season before you start this one, obviously. The story is insanely good. It has a very emotional flashback/dream scene that on its own already captures the brilliance of the game. Furthermore, the entire while the game keeps you excited for what is about to happen, what insane plot twists are going to happen next. And it doesn't disappoint. Few moments in the game are predictable and you'll want to binge play all episodes in one go. Just buy. You won't regret it. It even has some form of replayability to it as you can go back and make entirely different choices although that never really charmed me.P.S.    -    Season 1 choices influence season 2 story and this season will likely influence season 3 story.

												Well, what can i say about this game ?...First of all, you should first buy The Walking Dead : Season 1 in order to understand what's going on, because even though there will be an intro in this game about what has happened so far, you may not get the whole picture, plus the fact that Season 1 is also a great game.This game is one of the few games that really get into you and you really look forward playing it. The way it makes you become part of it is amazing...Furthermore, it offers unique cinematic moments and you never get bored. In addition to that, it has many alternatives to the story. The only disadvantage is that these alternative choices you choose to go on with in the game, affect the gameplay/scenery only short-term. Long-term, the path is the same and the main story too. In my opinion this game and it's predecessor are a must-have, but i wouldn't pay 23 euros to buy this game, so i recommend you to buy it on the summer/winter sale , propably 5-10 euros, which is a very good price.

												So, I never thought I would write a review about this game, but I just have to after what I read from others...This game really took me by surprise. I came out of Season One thinking that there will never be a better one. And I was right... to a point. The game starts off soon after the ending of the first one. You are put into the shoes of Clementine, who is definitely a familiar character to anyone who played season one. This time you get to see what it's like to see the apocalypse from the eyes of an eleven year old girl. Telltale doesn't hesitate, and shows you its reality in the first ten minutes of the first episode. The mechanics of the game are also greatly improved giving the player an easier way to pick dialogue by finally giving us a mouse. This allows us to have more control and not accidentally pick the wrong answer like I did a couple of times in season one. The gameplay itself gets a lot more interactive and it isn't all about point and click anymore. There is a lot of mouse control and keyboard play but of course not a crazy whole amount because we have to remember; this is a story rich game which mainly includes dialogue. Just like Lee, Clementine is a character that we see change and develop through the game. Reactions and characteristics that make Clementine a character are always there, but clementine can be changed quite a lot. There are many moral choices you make that only have an affect on you in the end. Like choosing whether Clementine should smoke a cigarette or drink some alcohol. these choices won't affect the game, but it will make Clementine different in YOUR eyes. When it comes to other characters, I was once again taken by surprise at how much I cared about some of them, whereas at the same time, I absolutely hated other characters. There was a certain character that I hated in the beginning, but as I went through the game, my opinion changed. It was a pleasant change as Season One never really did. Sure there were times I thought a character I liked did the wrong thing, But I never changed opinions completely like I did here. As for the game's length, It was good. Exactly 10 hours to wrap the game up which is a bit longer than I should have finished, but I was delayed due to some very hard decisions, which I regretted straight away. Yes, I know it's basically cheating to go back and change my choices but I re-winded just a couple seconds after the picking my choice, mostly because I felt differently straight after I chose the answer. Take that however you want. The ending of the game, once again came to me as a big surprise. To a point where I had to close my eyes after choosing what to do. Then I just sat in my chair and stared at the screen waiting to see the heart-breaking consequences. Overall, Season is a masterpiece. Its story meets the level of the first season and it did not leave me disappointed. If anything, it left me empty... As if my life was over. And it made me want more, exactly like Season One did. So in the end... Season Two was not better than Season One, if that's what your looking for, then unfortunate you're doomed to replay season one again and again because you will never get such a good story with such great characters. But Season Two definitely meets the level of its predecessor. Especially with the how it concludes. Like it or not but no matter what your choices are through Season One, in the end you get the same ending. Whereas here, your choices take a big part when it comes to the end of the game. So like I did, choose wisely. Even if you need to rewind. As long as it doesn't ruin the game for you. The Walking Dead Season 2 is the definitely one of the best games I ever played and I would recommend it to anyone who completed the first one. - 10/10			"

												To be fair, I completed this one much faster than the first one because I now realize the story is built a certain way, and even though some decisions make the outcome unfair, you have to live with them regardless. Also, I actually played this more nonstop than the first, so I was more focused on it. At the very bottom of the review is a SPOILER ALERT, so be wary.I loved Season 2 more than the first Walking Dead Telltale game. Why? It felt much more emotional than the first, and there were way more quick-time events to keep me involved in the action as well as the storytelling. The biggest strongpoint of the first game was what happened at the end; in Season 2, that crap's happening a lot more often constantly. The characters weren't so much cookie cutter in this one as they were in the first: There were characters I started off despising, hoping they'd either get offed, or that Clementine would put them in their place, but I grew to understand them and care for them because the zombie apocalypse makes people do crazy things.The only complaint I had was how the decisions the game made me make shook my inner being because I felt like a jerk regardless of the choices I made.To summarize how I felt about the game in short: I'm preordering Season 3 when I get the chance. I think I owe it to the devs to actually pay full price for one of these games, instead of being the cheapskate I am and waiting till they're 75% off just so I can get the best bang for my buck. The game's fantastic, and outdoes the first one in my opinion with its action sequences and storytelling.***SPOILER ALERT*** ***DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING OF THE GAME*** ***THIS IS YOUR OFFICIAL SPOILER WARNING***Why the hell did I and only 10% of players go with Jane at the end? I mean, did 90% of players just ignore what was going on the entire game only because Kenny is a beloved first game character? They showed repeatedly that he was done being rational, and was in fact dangerous despite Clem's attempts at showing he can still make it. Granted, I did not at all like Jane's way of handling the situation, but she was right in the end. Let's face it also: Clementine with her gained skills would still not survive on her own, so you kinda have to go with Jane because realistically Clementine would've been killed by walkers at some point since no one's watching her back; plus, the baby. An eleven year old girl is hard-pressed to survive in a zombie apocalypse on her own.And as a sidenote on the ending, I KNEW THAT GUY WAS BAD. The way his hand was rested on his lower back, I was thinkin to myself: ""I bet he's got a gun, ready to shoot us if we let him in."" MMMMMHHHHMMMM.			"

Doesnt mean i like it better than the 1st one, (like them both the same) its because there are so many different ENDINGS. Which will impact on season 3, which is pretty damn cool. Cant wait to see how telltale does it. But yeah get this game and grab the tissues because there will be lots of tears (at the end).100000000/10 best game <3			"

												Gonna start with the negative things so here we go.The game it self isint really a game and the choices you make dont really matter cause for example if you decide to save a guy hes gonna die anyways in the next episode or in the next after it and then dont play any important role at the previous one...I also had some problems with the last 5th episode cause my save games for some reason werent detected by the game.Now the good things. Story is awesome , graphics are nice , most of the characters (not all) when die u miss them and wish they didnt get eaten , shot or something else fatal. Voice acting is also pretty good and the game has ZOMBIES.Finally I'll give the game 8,5/10 not as good as the first season of the game but not bad for a sequel. So if you want a great story and not much of a gameplay , this game is definitly worth few bucks. "

												Well, I finished the game a couple of days ago and now I have decided to finally write a review for this.  I have to say, I didn't know what to expect after the masterpiece that was season 1.  But now, I can glady say that season 2 isn't a sequel that lets it's fans down (Spiderman 3.)  In fact, you could say that season 2 surpassed season 1 in alot of ways.  Season 2 picks up right where season 1 left off and you're playing as Clementine this time around.  The way that TellTale has evolved Clementine from a tiny, defenseless girl to a hardened, rugged survivor in a horrible world is stunning.  Clementine is now a completely different type of character and you have to make hard choices that a little girl shouldn't have to make.  And that is what makes season 2 so great, the shock of having to go through terrible situations as a LITTLE girl.  It makes you feel like every choice counts and it makes you wish you could take Clementine away from all of that, but you can't.  Hopefully there will be a season 3 seeing as there are still some plotlines that are not tied up in the final episode.  In conclusion, buying this game is one of the best decisions you can make.  The game has memorable charcters, music, and story.  I'm glad to be able to say I have played TellTale's 2nd masterpiece.  (By the way, I do recommend playing season 1 if you haven't since the story won't make much sense and you won't be as connected to some charcters.)			"

												SO OK I just finished this game, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it this game was one hell of a rollercoaster with feels. I had alot of trouble actually feeling with any of the characters in this game, they didn't feel as good as Lee and Clementine did in the first. All the choices you did with Lee in the first game felt like it actually mattered, but here, it felt like everyone else was just talking around the choices you wanted to do. Now i really liked Clementine in the first game, she was the reason i kept on playing the game, and she was the reason i got this game aswell because i wanted to know what happened to her. The biggest feel in this game, was in the last episode when  Clementine got shot, and dreamt about Lee ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i couldn't hold my tears back at all. I missed Lee in this game.Altough it's a really good game, but the storytelling in the first game was better, i still recommend this game though.			"

												The game is all right, I mean, none of your choices matter. Even in the first season, you'd still get the same ending, but in this season, almost nothing changes based on your choices. The first season had you choose who can live and who can die in some situations, or you could prolong their death. In this season, however, there's only one moment where your choice actually affects something. In a game series that tries to make it seem like your choices matter, it rarely happens in this one. You could probably get the same experience from watching a Youtube video about the game rather than play it, at least the Youtube video is free.			"

												(CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ALL THE AVAILABLE EPISODES!!!) ( YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!)The Walking Dead: Season 2Its awesome that they came up with a season two, i were wondering if they would do it, and i hoped for it and its so awesome that it actually happened, after season one where i actually began to cry at the end ( the ppl that knows what happends at the end of season 1 had maybe the same feelings as i had)In season two you play as young 11 year old Clementine, a girl that has survived more then a year in the horrible world. she has to take chances and hard choices to survive. even though she probably must harm people. im waiting for the last episode: no going back"" to come out!in the first episode you get to meet new people: Nick, Luke, Pete, Rebecca, Alvin, Sarah and Carlos. they lock you in a shed near their camp/house because of that a dog bit you and they dont take any chances so they lock u in! im like THE HECK?! O<O ik its the right thing to do but SRSLY?! Locking up a child in a shed?!in the second episode you continue with either nick, or pete.If You Choose Pete:you get trapped in a car that delivers smoke, so you can choose to give Pete a cigarette or! if you didnt give water to the dying man at the stream that was in the woods with christa in episode one you can give your water to pete, if you want!If you choose nick:you get locked up in some sort of basement/shed/IDK!you move a wood panel and finds whisky on bottles.Nick takes one and after some drinking he offers you to drink with him, you can choose to do it or not. i chose to do it, idk why but i just wanted! XDwell nick got drunk and you can choose to let him stay in the darn place or convince him to go with youbut he is too drunk and ughh .. so he gets the deads attention, you can choose to just run or get to him. if you choose to get to him he pushes you away and shouts that you have to go and hell be fine( i think he said idontremember)SPOILERSPOILER!whatever person you choose to go with, pete dies. i was crying irl because i really liked him :""(third episode!:a strange guy that calls himself George comes to the cabin when you and sarah are the only one there because the other one is looking after pete and nick.you have a conversation with him, and he finds a picture with sarah on that you took or she took earlier in the episode. i was like WHY THE HECK DID U TAKE PICTURES?! YOU GOING TO MAKE A SCRAPBOOK OR SOMETHING BEFORE YOU DIE? WHATSTHEF***NG POINT?! IDONTGETIT!well after ""george"" leaves the others come back.the others gets to know who came to the cabin and the guys name is William Carver, that is described as a bad bad man so you have to leave the cabin and get to the road fast-in the next episode you reach a mountain lodge. everyone is tired after five days on the run from this bad bad man. Clementine uses her binoculars to spot the mountainlodge/skiresort and a bridge. (WHERE THE HECK DID SHE GET BINOCULARS?!)well when you reach up to the lodge, clementine climbs up to a point where she uses her damn binoculars to see if someone is following them. she spots flashlights that turns back in the forest. when clementine gets down the group is talking to someone. clementine gets trough the group as she spotts the one they are talking to, thats where the familiar face comes inSPOILERSPOILER!its KENNY!!!*^* * so happy irl*the best moment that episode.you get reunited with kenny and his friends, Walter and Sarita ( you have already met matthew but darn nick shot him -.-)WELL WE SKIp ABIT!Carver gets to the lodge and captures you, as you either gets a choice to save alvin from being shot by carver or letting him get shot because of you didnt get carvers attention of just sitting there :/well carver takes you and the remaining people to his campnext episodeYou get tied up and closed in a deliverycar/truck to ""Bill"" s camp. WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ DID HE GET THE NAME BILL? ITS FREAKIN WILLIAM CARVER! ITS NO BILL!! CAN I GET A FREAKIN EXPLANATION FOR THAT THEY CALL HIM BILL? ITS PISSIN ME OFF!well you get to meet new people.....well thats enough for this time, im getting tired of writing so ima stopWELL THIS GAME IS AWESOME I RECOMMEND IT! 100/10 "

												It shows some weakness in a few aspects of certain episodes and there's a certain lukewarm quality to a lot of the characters, but there are a great many intense dramatic moments that more than redeem them, and episode 5 delivered such a major impact on me and made for such awesome topic for in-depth discussion that it, alone, makes this a 5-star game in my book. It kept surprising me and blowing my god damn mind, and episode 5 takes that feeling to positively stellar levels.And this game gave me such major feelings and stimulation and enthusiasm that I am nothing but glad that this is the game that has turned out to be my 100th Steam review. Such a joy to play this with my sister, and I hope other people can have this sort of pleasure as well, even IF they might constitute the sort of scumbags/idiots like the majority of characters in this game, because it's just that good. If you like an engaging story, this is some gooooood stuff right here, y'all. And definitely play the first season first for the best effect.In short, it had a few weak spots here and there, but they are more than made up for in unforgettable moments, especially in the finale, and if you enjoyed the first season, you sure as  should play this.

There are a lot of new and interesting characters, they are dying or leaving the group, but i didn't care about them as much as i was in the previous season. On the other hand, they did a great job with the end, and its posibility for a few very diferent endings. Still, I can't wait for the third season!Pro mě ne tak výborné jako první sezóna. Je tu nový příběh, nové a zajímavé postavy, které skupinu opouštějí nebo umírají, ale nepřirostli mi k srdci a neprožíval jsem to tolik, jako v předchozí sezóně. Na druhou stranu, daleko lépe si poradily s několika rozdílnými možnostmi zakončení příběhu. Už se nemůžu dočkat sezóny třetí!			"

												pros: plenty of characters that are well voice acted, several choices to make & it is unpredictable on how it will affect things in the long run, pause function available, considers the choices you made on the first season (lets you select game save file from season 1) for story continuity, provides a good (if not better) twd experience than the TV showcons: does not have full screen windowed mode, tedious quick time events, will not allow you to skip credits at the end of each episode & makes you listen to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ song, achievements are practically redundant for this game, typical ""russian bad guys"" thrown in randomly into the story, provides only <9 hours of gameplay (less content than season 1)Overall, a solid narrative game with tedious quick time events. Standard price is not worth the few hours it has to offer, so I would recommend (and for all Telltale releases that you wait until all episodes are released) that you buy the game at a discounted price.The Walking Dead: Season Two has my recommendation, but pick it up on a sale.

												From start to finish, this game has been well worth the price of admission .  If anyone was thrown into a world of monsters both undead or not. Can you survive? can others survive WITH you? and most likely can they be trusted.  These are questions that you'll be asking as you guide Clementine, a young girl, using her wits to create her own path of survival. Every second counts......			"

												It shows some weakness in a few aspects of certain episodes and there's a certain lukewarm quality to a lot of the characters, but there are a great many intense dramatic moments that more than redeem them, and episode 5 delivered such a major impact on me and made for such awesome topic for in-depth discussion that it, alone, makes this a 5-star game in my book. It kept surprising me and blowing my god damn mind, and episode 5 takes that feeling to positively stellar levels.And this game gave me such major feelings and stimulation and enthusiasm that I am nothing but glad that this is the game that has turned out to be my 100th Steam review. Such a joy to play this with my sister, and I hope other people can have this sort of pleasure as well, even IF they might constitute the sort of scumbags/idiots like the majority of characters in this game, because it's just that good. If you like an engaging story, this is some gooooood stuff right here, y'all. And definitely play the first season first for the best effect.In short, it had a few weak spots here and there, but they are more than made up for in unforgettable moments, especially in the finale, and if you enjoyed the first season, you sure as  should play this.

												(CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ALL THE AVAILABLE EPISODES!!!) ( YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!)The Walking Dead: Season 2Its awesome that they came up with a season two, i were wondering if they would do it, and i hoped for it and its so awesome that it actually happened, after season one where i actually began to cry at the end ( the ppl that knows what happends at the end of season 1 had maybe the same feelings as i had)In season two you play as young 11 year old Clementine, a girl that has survived more then a year in the horrible world. she has to take chances and hard choices to survive. even though she probably must harm people. im waiting for the last episode: no going back"" to come out!in the first episode you get to meet new people: Nick, Luke, Pete, Rebecca, Alvin, Sarah and Carlos. they lock you in a shed near their camp/house because of that a dog bit you and they dont take any chances so they lock u in! im like THE HECK?! O<O ik its the right thing to do but SRSLY?! Locking up a child in a shed?!in the second episode you continue with either nick, or pete.If You Choose Pete:you get trapped in a car that delivers smoke, so you can choose to give Pete a cigarette or! if you didnt give water to the dying man at the stream that was in the woods with christa in episode one you can give your water to pete, if you want!If you choose nick:you get locked up in some sort of basement/shed/IDK!you move a wood panel and finds whisky on bottles.Nick takes one and after some drinking he offers you to drink with him, you can choose to do it or not. i chose to do it, idk why but i just wanted! XDwell nick got drunk and you can choose to let him stay in the darn place or convince him to go with youbut he is too drunk and ughh .. so he gets the deads attention, you can choose to just run or get to him. if you choose to get to him he pushes you away and shouts that you have to go and hell be fine( i think he said idontremember)SPOILERSPOILER!whatever person you choose to go with, pete dies. i was crying irl because i really liked him :""(third episode!:a strange guy that calls himself George comes to the cabin when you and sarah are the only one there because the other one is looking after pete and nick.you have a conversation with him, and he finds a picture with sarah on that you took or she took earlier in the episode. i was like WHY THE HECK DID U TAKE PICTURES?! YOU GOING TO MAKE A SCRAPBOOK OR SOMETHING BEFORE YOU DIE? WHATSTHEF***NG POINT?! IDONTGETIT!well after ""george"" leaves the others come back.the others gets to know who came to the cabin and the guys name is William Carver, that is described as a bad bad man so you have to leave the cabin and get to the road fast-in the next episode you reach a mountain lodge. everyone is tired after five days on the run from this bad bad man. Clementine uses her binoculars to spot the mountainlodge/skiresort and a bridge. (WHERE THE HECK DID SHE GET BINOCULARS?!)well when you reach up to the lodge, clementine climbs up to a point where she uses her damn binoculars to see if someone is following them. she spots flashlights that turns back in the forest. when clementine gets down the group is talking to someone. clementine gets trough the group as she spotts the one they are talking to, thats where the familiar face comes inSPOILERSPOILER!its KENNY!!!*^* * so happy irl*the best moment that episode.you get reunited with kenny and his friends, Walter and Sarita ( you have already met matthew but darn nick shot him -.-)WELL WE SKIp ABIT!Carver gets to the lodge and captures you, as you either gets a choice to save alvin from being shot by carver or letting him get shot because of you didnt get carvers attention of just sitting there :/well carver takes you and the remaining people to his campnext episodeYou get tied up and closed in a deliverycar/truck to ""Bill"" s camp. WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ DID HE GET THE NAME BILL? ITS FREAKIN WILLIAM CARVER! ITS NO BILL!! CAN I GET A FREAKIN EXPLANATION FOR THAT THEY CALL HIM BILL?

												The second game of the walking dead is in my opinion inferior to the first one. I also found it inferior to the fables series but that maybe because i like that world more. It still has all the classic moments from the first game and in general telltale's story telling but it lacks the impact of either aforementioned series. I still enjoyed the game and its not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Still they can and should do better. It felt a very safe approach to the game for me. Doesn't help that i pretty much disliked almost every single character except for Clementine. Also Telltale should stop pretending choices actually matter in their games, since in every game you end up pretty much with on the same path. I still will recommend the game for fans of the genre though.			"

												I am surprised. I knew this game wouldn´t be as good as the first one. However, it was pretty good. The choices are still difficult to make and have an impact on the game. The action is still very intense. I however had 2 main flaws with the game. The game uses cheap and unreal excuses to make Clementine do things. Why does she have to escort someone when there is an adult in perfect condition to do it? The other main flaw is the group she is in. I just couldn´t feel sympathy for most of them. They weren´t as well crafted and real as the ones in the first game. But that is my opinion. Overall, the game is good but not outstanding like it´s predecessor. I give it a 7/10.			"

												My favorite Telltale game so far and one of my personal favorite PC games, the second season of Telltale's The Walking Dead is amazing. While playing this game requires you to complete the first season for the optimal experience, doing so is worth it just for the amazingly good second season. I really enjoyed the story, the evniorment, the design, the different decisions and outcomes, the voice-acting and pretty much anything else about this game. I recommend everyone to give The Walking Dead a chance, even if you're anot a fan of the TV show and the comics (except from the fact that the game takes place in the same world as the comics, it tells a different story than the one told in the comics and in the TV show, which I personally think is much better).

												This didn't move me as much as the 1st season. In part, because the novelty factor wore off, but also because this time you don't experience as many situations in which you have to decide who lives or dies. Also, in an ironic way, Clementine is a less fragile main character than Lee ever was. She's only 11 years-old, but she can be as wise and as tough as any other adult. And, for most of the time, you don't believe that something really bad is going to happen to her. These things make this title less tense and heartbreaking than its predecessor.Even so, this still beats the TV show and it's a worthwhile ride. But I really miss the older Telltale games, with the puzzles; the ""Sam and Max"" titles still are unbeatable.			"

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- Rich story which is even stronger than the first season.- In fact, this is the best telltale game I have ever played to date.- This game takes you places, the story is so imaginative and the decisions you make are so vast in consequences, often costing the lives of others.- Multiple endings, I loved this so much that I had to find out the other endings, some of which depending on how you play are so touching.- I was thinking about this game for days after completion, reflecting on my decisions as if they would effect my life.- The characters are so strong which you expect with a telltale game except this time you feel as if you meet so many more over your journey.- The return of a long lost friend.- Clementine, I thought id miss Lee but quite frankly I didn't, I loved playing as Clem and with one touching scene from the first season you can really see how this girl has grown and its feels incredible that you've taken her right through it all.- Carry over your save from Season 1, with references to your decisions at various times.- All the bugs from the first season have been ironed out.CONS:- I cannot think of a single one..except, wheres Season 3?VERDICT? Incredible game which is absolutely unmissable.			"

												Season Two is the slow rise and almost certain descent of Clementine. She’s still a child, but she’s no longer innocent, and she knows what she has to do to see another day. It’s heart-breaking in a way to see how time has changed her, to hear the new edge to her voice, to see the new hardness in her eyes and to release in horror the path ahead of her, and what it pertains to. She’s no longer the moral compass, she’s no longer the little girl you try to be a better person around so she can learn from you – she is the culmination of your efforts, and now it’s your job to keep her alive, to keep her safe.Full Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12145/pc/the-walking-dead-season-21-all-that-remains/review.html "

												Episode 1 Review: A great start to Season Two!  I really enjoyed playing Clementine as a more assertive character after her instruction from Lee.  Several very nerve-wracking scenes, and a fascinating setup for the inevitable cliffhanger at the end of the episode.(I was unable to continue my previous game progress as I had Ep1 / 400 Days outside of Steam, so not sure how much carries over.  The random choices upon starting a new game were close enough to what I'd chosen in my Ep1 playthrough to work with.)			"

												First of all, if you've never played a Telltale game before, they are excellent games that everyone should try. Season 1 of the Walking Dead game constantly goes on sale so you can pick it up really cheap on Steam or Steam trading sites.If you liked Season 1 of the Walking Dead game, you'll definitely enjoy this one as well. Not much has changed art or gameplay wise, just a few tweaks of the UI; the storytelling is still top notch. While Minimal UI was not included in The Wolf Among Us for god knows why, it is thankfully included in this game. You play as Clementine in this one, after a year and a half time skip. Highly recommended if you enjoy Telltale games.			"

												""All That Remains"" picks up nicely after Season 1's ""No Time Left"", it still gives you a great story and gameplay that makes this game a repeat of the first Season in terms of ""Game of the Year"", I highly recommend this game, prepare yourself for a FEEL trip.			"
