												A very atmospheric, dark-fantasy/steampunk Action-RPG.I wasn't sure about buying it, as ARPGs aren't my favourite (though i really enjoyed Diablo 2), but i didn't regret it.Actually, it's pretty well done.You play the son of the famous Van Helsing, accompanied by the ghost of Lady Katarina, which will aid you in your battle against werewolves, robots and all sorts of other monsters.The world is dark and with lots of steampunk elements in it, very detailed and atmospheric.As you progress, you also hear some nice dialogues between the two main characters, which are pretty humorous sometimes. The game is also filled with some pop-culture-references (Lord of the Rings, The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy, as to name only 2).Though it has some minor flaws and might not be as polished as bigger productions, it's a nice and well done game, which i would recommend to anyone who likes ARPGs.

												Excellent voice acting, original atmospheric music , 15+ hour storyline and great attention to detail easily matches full price releases. Very underrated and together with path of exile the best in their genre (with PoE being the more hardcore/advanced option).The class dlc is somewhat scummy but seeing as how the base game is so cheap its pretty bearable (plus the 'new' classes are just very specialized variants on the base class but still completely new in terms of trees and skills)Minor critiques is that the gem slot system barely makes an impact but that wont ruin your enjoyment and fairly long load times on zone transitions (but barely slowdown once properly loaded)Warning: game seems to use a consistent 1,5K-2,5K ram depending on settings			"

												How to begin...The first impression of the game wasn't that great. A rather generic forest area with expectable enemies didn't get my hopes up too high, but after around an hour the game gained a lot in both presentation and interesting content. For around 7-8 hours afterwards you are in for a great ride with excellent graphics, music and quests. Your companion really adds to game and lifts it above most Diablo clones. Sadly at a certain point the game turns into a pure grind fest and the content runs thin, very thin. The final battle is over the top hard and while it's certainly finishable, nothing in the game prepares you for it.A lot of great ideas and lovely designed areas will keep you entertained for a few hours and if you can forgive the game a rather rushed/forced ending, I'd say it's a really good hack 'n slash RPG.Pro:- Great design- Atmospheric music- Interesting skill system- Sarcastic and entertaining companionCon:- Too short and yet it still feels lengthy in the last 1/4 of the game- Crashes occasionally			"

 “Be a hunter, they said. Kill monsters, they said! No one ever mentioned something about picking flowers!” The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing represents a solid action role-playing game, based on Bram Stoker’s legendary vampire slayer. It has a charming atmosphere in combination with an interesting storyline and lovely characters, set in a gothic–noir universe resembling the 19th century Eastern Europe, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology. The protagonist and his delightful ghostly companion have a wry sense of humor and contribute to the game’s atmosphere with many snappy dialogues. Especially the details in form of allusions to certain films, comics and the original book by Bram Stoker will keep you entertained.The only shortcoming of this game is the rather stiff combat system, which would have needed more attention to establish a more fluent hack & slash feeling.

Nice but short gameVan Helsing is a typical hack'n'slay with skill tree, mana, cooldowns and so on.I took me about 18 hours to complete the game with one character (caster aka Thaumaturge), this include finishing all sidequests and expose every single area. Compared with other games like torchlight this is a bit short.One variety was a tower defence part and the possibility to power up the generator for the traps. Unfortunately there were only 2 events were you have to defeat the secret lab. After I finished the game I also tried the Scneario mode which contain higher difficulties starting from 31 (current cap level for the player is 30). In this mode you could gain glory points instead of xp. Normally you should find better items on this single map scenarios but compared with the items I already had the weren't better. But this depends on kind of luck you have (like in other games).So I created new characters to test the other classes, but after a short time it doesn't makes fun playing the same story again.At last I tried the ""Neverending Story"" mode which was described as ""The monster will keep getting stronger while your only way to improve is to play even better. See how far you can get!"".Well it was really hard and the main thing I did was casting my spells and run away till all was dead. For stronger monsters that means run in a circle arround them casting again and again and don't stop to drink healt potions. And the bad thing was, this tooks a lot of time and after a while it gets boring. Short game summary- Level cap: 30- Skill and ability  points could be assigned- Skill and ability points could be assigned to your aide (Lady Katarina)- Perks: by finishing quest and killing enemies you gain reputation. There are 10 levels of reputation and on each of them you could choose one perk to activate e.g Unstoppable (Immunity to all movement impedding effects)   - Glory: after reching max level you could gain glory points in scenario mode. And with these points you could increase stats like attack rate, fire damage or cooldown reduction- game modes:-- Story-- Scenario-- Neverending Story- classes:-- Hunter (blades, firearms) -- Thaumaturge (caster)-- Arcane Mechanic (expulsion cannon)- difficulties:-- casual-- normal-- hard-- heroic-- hardcore character as special option (like in other games ""death is final"") - multiplayer modePositive:- good hack'n'slay: I played it through in 18 hours on two days caused of pickup loot and leveling up - chest were you could share items with other characters- single skills from the skill tree of player and aide could be removed by paying gold (same for abilities)- multiplayerNegative:- too short- difficulty could only be choosen on character creation time and not be changed after that - difficulty varies to much: normal game could be played through no problem but the ""Neverending Story"" mode was too hard.Conclusion:It's a nice game which facinates me from the beginning till the end. Even if it's a short game I would definitely suggest this game.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a third person hack and slash game very similar to the Diablo / Torchlight series. If you’ve played any of those, you should be able to drop right into Van Helsing with a good idea of how to play. The game seems pretty demanding hardware wise, and it heats up my computer, which is unusual for a top down isometric game.You play the title character Van Helsing, a monster hunter on a mission to the country of Borgovia to answer a distress letter. It seems some unspecified evil is causing trouble for the people there. In the game’s world, monsters seem pretty commonplace, and you are actually accompanied on your quest by a snarky ghost named Lady Katarina. Gameplay-wise Lady Katarina is the equivalent of the “pet” in Torchlight, or a “merc” in Diablo 2, except that she talks to you all the time as part of the story. She has her own gear/stats/skills and can go back to town to sell loot for you, just like the pet in Torchlight. In combat she can hold her own for a while, but dies pretty quickly later on in the game.The game is broken up into 2 city hubs like Diablo 2 Acts, each with its own main town, NPC shops, and quests. The game is filled with little hidden quests that you may not find in 1 playthrough, even though the maps are not randomly generated.  I’ve finished 2 characters and the maps were exactly the same both times. There is an option in the main menu to have enemies respawn each time you leave and re-enter a game (like Diablo 2), and you can turn this on or off whenever you want. Like Diablo 2, you can’t see what level the enemies are, but if you’re having a hard time, you should probably go back and level up a little more.  This isn’t possible if the enemies don’t respawn. In my experience if you don’t grind at least a few levels, you’ll end the game around level 27 (max level is 30).The game has an extensive loot system similar to Diablo/Torchlight with normal/rare/set/epic item types as well as “+magic find%” attributes that can be found on gear to boost your chances of getting rarer items. There is also a way to upgrade particular items with “essence” which is kind of like gems in Diablo, or ember in Torchlight. I haven’t used the system much since every time I find a better weapon I just sell the old one, and don’t bother breaking it down for all the essences that I’ve put into it. The game’s stat system should be familiar to people who play dungeon crawler games. Body (hp / melee damage), Dexterity (dodge chance / range damage), Willpower (magic damage/ mana), and Luck (critical damage / magic find) are your four stats and you get 5 per level up to distribute as you please.  The skill system is more complicated because you don’t just choose skills (which can cost more than 1 skill point), you can also choose the “power ups” that can be used with the skills. These power ups are activated before you cast the skill, and use a “rage” meter which is separate from your mana bar.  You build rage by killing monsters while mana just regenerates by itself. So an example would be activating a damage boost power up right before casting a lightning bolt spell. The power up drains some of your rage bar and the spell drains some of your mana bar with the result being a lightning bolt with increased damage.  You can toggle an auto-activate to your power ups if you don’t want to deal with pressing the button every time.  You’ll probably run out of rage really quickly though.Another thing to note about the skill system is that your skills are broken up into several categories, though they all take skill points to level up. There are your main Skills, Auras, and Tricks. Auras are passive boosts that you have on permanently, though you can only have 2 auras active at any time. An example would be the Rampage aura which boosts your critical hit damage. Tricks are just another set of skills and personally I don’t see why they were separated from the other skills, except that they don’t use mana. An example would be Arcane Healing, which is an area affecting heal spell. Tricks have a cool down to prevent you from constantly spamming them. Pros:+Decent story set in a medieval fantasy world.+Gameplay is mostly intuitive though some things really could benefit from further explanation. For example there is no explanation of the skill system. I went about 5 – 6 levels before I put points into any skills because I was afraid I might be wasting points on weak skills. Turns out you can re-spec them later, so go wild.+Pretty simple multi player co-op system. I’m able to join my brother’s game pretty quickly and easily with an average ping of 80 ms. One thing I noticed is that the game’s multiplayer server browser doesn’t tell you if a person’s game has a password until you’ve tried connecting to it. That’s kind of dumb. A bunch of people constantly try connecting to my brother and my games and disconnecting because they don’t know the password.Cons:-There is very little information online for beginners. In most games of this type, you can find a wiki or strategy website where people share their character builds. I found one site like this, but a lot of the info is outdated. In RPG games I hate feeling like I missed out on something cool.If you got this game from the Humble Jumbo 2 bundle, you should have the “Complete Pack” which includes the Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLCs. These DLCs are 2 new character classes along with a few class specific quests. That means you can see a few areas in the game that you can’t get into unless you’re one of these 2 new classes. The Thaumaturge is a pure spell caster and is probably the most enjoyable class, but easily killed. The Arcane Mechanic is a ranged attacker who shoots slow moving grenades and can summon support units. The base class Hunter is a little bit of everything, but really best as a melee tank with some back up spells.I’ve heard people say that the game is pretty short, but personally I’m happy with a 12 hour game, especially one in the $1 tier of a humble bundle.  I'm actually glad it doesn't have an end game grind like Diablo, where you just play over and over looking for better gear after you've finished the main storyline. Van Helsing also has a hardcore mode for people who want that extra element of risk (death is permanent). I never have and probably never will create a hardcore character since I die all the time in games like this. Overall I give the game a thumbs up if you enjoy hack and slash dungeon crawlers. You’ll find the graphics comparable with Path of Exile, and the loot finding should keep you occupied for a while. "

												Beside the Torchlight franchise, Titan Quest and the free Path of Exile NeocoreGames' Van Helsing represents another alternative for those finding the latest Diablo entry a bit too casual. What's more is that while Van Helsing is shorter than aforementioned hack 'n' slash games it still offers a decent story and a lot of content. Due to the additional game modes (scenario and neverending story) it has a high replayability value, as well.The game follows a quest of Van Helsing and his companion, the ghost Katharina, who try to get to Borgovia to stop a mad scientist. Along the way you encounter dozens of different enemies throughout numerous different environments. Some of these locales look stunningly beautiful: you traverse through a muddy forest fighting hideous monsters and evil spirits and also join the resistance in a town to fight the soldier-machines. These machines add the steampunk part of the game - with all the traps and contraptions you find they make the game even more diverse.One of the things I liked about Van Helsing was its atmosphere. Sound effects and the score are excellent and I liked the sarcastic conversations between Helsing and Katharina. One-liners are common from them as well as from enemies and there are numerous references to other video games and films throughout the game. In order to find all of them it's worth hovering the cursor over all objects in every environment - Van Helsing might collect a quest item or just make a funny comment.There are many sidemissions, of course, as it is common in this genre and there's even one that takes you throughout the game. You just need to carefully look everywhere and open all chests, containers, destroy all barrels and boxes as you might find the next piece of the puzzle. It's worth mentioning, though, that not all items are related to a quest, still, they will be part of the corresponding tab in your inventory.Normally, Van Helsing wields two swords and two pistols. You can decide which way to go from there in terms of customisation. Beside these two tabs there is also one called Tricks (active spells) and Auras (passive skills). Every level-up grants you ability points (the good-old attributes we are talking about here), skill points and occasionally reputation points, but the latter is not related to quest but more to the annihilation of strong beasts. Your reputation can then yields you perks - the list is gradually increasing and you can pick more and more of them along the way.Katharina, the ghost companion is a bit similar to the pet we have in Torchlight. She can do the shopping on behalf of us and can also pick up loot by category. Her behaviour is completely modifiable. Of course, she has many skills and also attributes - her skills either make her stronger or support Van Helsing in combat. While there are no other companions in the game the abovementioned customisation I described for Van Helsing is the Hunter class only. With the added DLCs you can play as a Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic. I hear they are pretty fun and diverse, too, so this is all the more in favour of the longevity of this game.Van Helsing is pretty cool game considering it is a relatively low-budget hack 'n' slash. It is filled with content and there's high replayability due to the 3 different classes, more difficulty levels, hardcore mode, online cooperative mode in the game. I look forward to playing with its sequel. In the meantime, if you are the fan of the genre Van Helsing should be in your library. Word of advice: buckle up as the game can be pretty challenging even on normal difficulty setting!			"

												If you're looking for a quick ARPG fix you can't really go wrong with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  In my opinion it's a better experience in comparison to Diablo 3.  There's a fun variety of loot with some really cool unique weapons that you can find early in the game which is exciting.  There's also a endless story mode where creatures get more and more difficult at ""end game"" max level being 30.  There are also scenarios that can be played at level 30 that offer even more challenges with unique bosses and objectives.  Def a recommended game if you're into this sort of thing.			"

												Most of the negative reviews are related to multiplayer. I'm a hermit in real life and in gaming, so that didn't phase me. Without reading tutorials and by taking my time and enjoying the game on normal, I beat the game in about 15 hours. I didn't notice any glitches. With the summer sale, I went ahead and bought the DLC, so I can try the other classes next weekend. If you're buying the game, and you're buying it for the 1p experience, save a few bucks by buying the game+dlc pack.			"

												I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.Story:I was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a mad human scientist instead of a demon-monster-creature was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old ""hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)"", but there's nothing wrong with that.Gameplay:If you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice  touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.Graphics:The graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.Music:While playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.The voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the ""Mantis Bug Tracker"" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.But all in all, a really good game.

Action RPG taken to perfectionThe first game in what would become a series a three, was released by Neocore Games in May 2013. At first sight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing doesn't seem to offer much new or original to a well-established gaming genre: the fast-paced action rpg, played from an isometric point of view. After all, we had the Diablo and Torchlight series, which did a pretty good job at delivering extremely enjoyable games.From my first impressions with this game, it was clear that Neocore Games knows its classics: they stayed true to the core of this particular genre, which is the combination of the fast-paced hack 'n slash (or shoot 'n bewitch) gameplay with the development of your character and the endless craving for loot. After all, what's more rewarding than mowing down horde after horde of enemies, in order to find dozens of lootable items, among which there might be just that one special items? Or breaking hundreds of barrels, hoping to stumble upon a golden ring belonging to a named set?Actually, Van Helsing goes several steps further than most other action rpg when it comes to loot, objects and what you can accomplish with them. I've played through the entire game twice (first as a gun-oriented hunter, than as a melee character), and both times I found myself busy with objects for a fair amount of time. There's not only an incredible number of weapons, armour, rings, boots, gloves, hats, capes and trophees, there's also the possibility to enchant and even enhance them with small magical pieces, ""essences"". The best items come with a slot for one or more essences, and it's great fun to upgrade one's armour or items in this way. The game gives you a huge amount of customization options over your character (although you can only play as Van Helsing himself, obviously) too: upon levelling up, you can spend 5 ability points (to build your character's strenghts) and 3 skill points (spent in a very extensive skill & spell tree). Part of the immense fun this game provides, lies in building a well-balanced, skilled character that's up to the task and to the items he can wield. There are ""perks"" too, which offer a general or more specific buff and which unlock after meeting certain requirements.But Neocore Games went even one step further by introducing a companion to Van Helsing: a female ghost, who can help you defeating the enemies in several ways (melee, range or simply by enhancing your capabilities). Even better: Katharina also gains experience and can be upgraded, can learn skill and can be equipped with weapons, rings and armour. All of which can be upgraded and enchanted, of course. So if you like that sort of finetuning a character, Van Helsing offers a fantastic experience. And Katharina even helps to solve to everlasting problem of having too much loot but too little inventory space: you can send her off to town to sell some items for cash, or for potions.Compared to such an extensive character building & enhancing system, the actual gameplay is a little more bland, although it's still pretty solid and enjoyable. With the aid of good weaponry, skills, spells and aura's it is great fun to mow down entire legions of enemies, which the game keeps throwing at you. But towards the latter part of the game it becomes clear which skills are best suited to your style of playing, and the gameplay starts to show some repetition. The story itself is decent enough - nothing special, but it does the job of keeping the game going, and Katherina is a humorous sidekick in many situations. The user interfaces (and the extremely important inventory screens) are a marvel of lay-out and offer whatever you want at a mouse-click. This game offers the perfect example of how developers can make life easy and enjoyable, even in the most complex of situations.And if all of this were not enough, Van Helsing offers perfect integration with Steam through leaderboards, co-op multiplayer, and nearly one hundred achievements which offer an extra challenge and a great fun to hunt after. The three main dlc's are pretty useful too: they offer two new sets of skills & spells so that you can play either as a magic character or as an ""arcane mechanic"" (have to try that one out sometime). The third dlc offers a new set of skills for your female companion.Highly recommend, and an essential purchase for everyone who loves a good action rpg. "

												I finished my 1st playthrough of Van Helsing the other day. It was pretty good, the graphics were fine (nothing great), the story was very average (the usual save the world from the bad-guy & his minions), & the gameplay was similar to Torchlight/Diablo ARPG's.I ended up with 73/95 Achievements, & that's ok with me. To get them all you would need to do multiple playthrough's, & i wasn't impressed enough to want to replay it, maybe in another year or so.All in all, it was a good game. I used a controller, & it worked fine. If you like ARPG's, i'd say give it a try, but don't expect an involved storyline. It's more loot collecting & monster killing, so if you like that sort of game, you'll like this.Enjoy   :) "

												I'm going to be honest - I love Diablo 3.Why? Well, I loved Diablo 2...but I grew up, got as job, got responsibilities, lost all my free time and any gaming is done briefly. To put it simply - I need bang for my buck. Don't get me wrong: I'd love to be able to lose myself in Paths of Exiles skill trees, or spend ages on new builds in Torchlight but these don't matter when I have an hour to sit down and, dammit, I wanna see monsters explode and organs fly across the screen while I whirlwind across the screen.And that's why I recommend Van Helsing - it looks good, feels good, sounds good and doesn't require massive amounts of time and commitment - the skill trees are basic, items work well and you feel more or less done once you've played through once.Pick it up in a sale (I think it's worth full price), drop 20ish hours into, reminisce about how terrified you were twenty (!) years ago the first time you heard ""Ah, fresh meat!"", and appreciate the fun that is Van Helsing.

												This game is as its name implies: ""INCREDIBLE""!I have played Diablo, Diablo 2, Torchlight, Torchlight 2, and not one of them was as pure fun as this.The main characters, Van Helsing and Katharina are what makes the game great. They're incredibly funny to listen to. Great dialogue, with very nice voiceovers which seem almost impossibly good for such a small game. The references to other games, books and movies are great and fit the tone, which is always one of (mostly) lighthearted fun. The game is set in a sort of dark steampunk/clockwork setting, but it always aims to amuse and not to drag you down. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is rare in games like this.It is a solid ARPG, and the mechanics are simple and still have depth and it's really fun and rewarding trying out different approaches. You can play your Van Helsing as a gun-toting Monsterhunter or as a sword-fighting Slayer. You can even play him as a Mage. Each class plays very different and you can also adjust your companion similarly, which is a great idea.As I said, I got more fun out of this than Torchlight 2, for example (the story here and the graphics fit my tastes better), so it is a definitve must buy for any ARPG fan, especially if it's on sale.

												Genre - Steampunk/Supernatural Action RPGI am a massive fan of the Diablo games and enjoy Path of Exile. I got this game on sale and randomly chose to give it a try. I have been through the whole game on normal using one character (I had the DLC to expand the choice). The game is enjoyable and a decent length. I spent 15 hours re-visitng some sections and fully exploring most maps. The humour is good and the dialogue with your ghostly companion keeps the story flowing. There is a hardcore mode if you are that way inclined and different difficulty settings. At a couple of points in the game it allows you to do tower defence, which can break up the game a bit. I have found out you can also take your level 30 character (max level) into the next game. So I will definately be getting that at some point.			"

												An extremely addicting and visually stunning ARPG. Solid graphics and an extremely well designed world with a steampunk-noir feel. If you're a fan of Torchlight, PoE, Diablo (especially if you were left less than satisfied with Diablo 3) then this should be right up your alley. The character development is pretty unique, in a very good way. Each skill offers various ""powerups"" which you can use during fights to better suit whatever challenge you face. This makes for a very fun combat system that I would love to see more of in the future. Besides skills, you also have the ability to use XP to purchase auras, tricks, and perks. Your companion, Katarina, has her own attributes as well as unique skills which you can select as she levels with you. This all combines to make for one of the most customizable games I've played in a while. For this quality and the playtime which it offers this game is well worth the purchase, especially if you factor in the replay value which the DLC's bring with their addictional classes. This game seems to go on sale fairly frequently, so if you can manage to catch it during one of those times you'll be getting more than your moneys worth.			"

												Gorgeous looking Hack N' Slash, (Diablo, Torchlight, Etc.), with that lovely Van Helsing vibe.  Lovely monster design, great looking levels, and an overall good atmosphere.  Character development is two fold, yourself and your companion can both be upgraded through leveling up and adding not only Ability Points for stats, but Skill points for Skills,(Spells,Attacks, Auras, Tricks, etc.), which opens up the play style for all three classes to your own interuptation quite well. Finished it in around 20hrs, with a few more discovering all the extra the game has to offer after completion, which is a scenario mode for a challenge and chance at some better drops.  Also Neverending Story, which is like a New Game+ mode, where you continue on, but this time, because you'll probably be maxed at level 30, you start to gain Glory, and each level of that, lets you further strengthen and build your character.  Overall I had a great time playing, only had a few bugs here and there, which I've read are being constantly worked on and fixed, and didn't have any trouble running the game, minus extended load times, and an occasion stutter on certain levels due to the sheer amount of plantlife and monsters I suppose. In Closing: Worth Picking up if you love Hack N' Slash.  It's not going to be a game changer, but it's a great 20 hours+ depending on your love for the game.  Which should be quite great!			"

												Played the game on hard mode.The previous reviews pretty much summarized the good sides of this game:- Well designed world.- Some really nice background music (definitely getting game OST if there is one). - Attractive graphics.- Highly customizable settings (could play this game on my laptop).- Some interesting references to pop culture (really liked Baggins dude!).- Good voice acting.- Decent storyline.But all in all I would advise you to avoid this game. Here is why:- If you do not buy DLCs then there is only one character class you can 'choose' from. The character can do both melee and range attacks, however, due to horrible difficulty balance I had to specialize only on one attack type. The result is there is not a lot of variation in the action. - Except very rare short conversations, the sidekick ghost lady is useless. She dies really fast and eats up all the health potions. I have ended up keeping her in a ghost form all the time. The result is the game would not change much if she was removed completely.- The game gives you impression of customization, but it actuallly punishes you for doint it. After mid point of the game, customization becomes really expensive and you can end up spending all the gold and still not getting what you want.- The essense system (aka gems and gem slots) is useless. Items where you can put gems are rare. If one is found then usually it does not have enough essense capacity to put useful essense. You can use an essense to increase the capacity but during my 27 hours of gameplay I had collected only 3 capacity increasing essense. Finally, there is not a lot of variation in essense types. I had collected only 20 or so different essense types during the entire game!- The fighting becomes really repetitive quite fast. There are many enemies that look different, but really just a skin deep difference. All off them can be categorized into melee enemies that charge in mass, melee enemies with hooks and ranged enemies. There is no interesting behavior from AI. More challenging enemies have simply 1) more HP and higher defense points, 2) just attack in bigger numbers, or 3) have more HP and defense and attack in higher numbers. It is not possible to use interesting tactics. Most of my gameplay consisted of repeating two things: have a short skirmish and then running away to use potion before having another short skirmish. Bullet spongy enemies just killed all the fun for me in this game. Most annoying are the enemies with hooks. It is not possible to predict or avoid hooks using your skills. The hook animation is instantaneous. The problem is, at least on higher difficulty, if you get hooked then you are basically dead.- Horrible camera angles. It is not possible to control the camera. Did I tell you about enemies with hooks? Well many times I was hooked by enemies I could not even see. I am not even talking about number of times I was shot at by enemies outside of the screen.- Bad character controls. There is no keyboard-based movement control. Mouse is used to click on a place where you want to move your character. Sounds good enough right? Well not. Combined with horrible camera angles and enemies swarming everywhere you will end up in many situation where you cannot find a free space to click on and move your character. I ended up more than dozen times dead because my character refused to move. The complexity of the surrounding world makes the situation even worse because it is not immediately obvious where you can and cannot click.If you are looking for a good ARPG then go for Path of Exile. PoE is superior to this game in everyway. Plus, PoE is free, and there is no DLC nonsense.			"

 The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing – REVIEW    Graphics (Environment 9/10, Models 7/10) 8/10   Animations 7/10   Sound 6/10   Music 8/10   Story 6.5/10   Gameplay 6.5/10   Inovation 7/10   TOTAL SCORE 7  GraphicsOn all max settings this game looked very nice. Environments and most models of the enemy creatures were designed pretty well, but sadly the characters of people felt 'just' boring. AnimationsThe animated events that happened while playing were nicely done, but that can't be said for animations of your character, Katarina and other enemies, which felt too repetitious, harsh and halting, that definitely spoiled the feeling of a smoother and more efficient gameplay. Sound & MusicThe voice acting and other sounds in this game were mostly bad and disappointing, but the soundtrack was good and enjoyable. StoryEven the Blizzard's Diablo, with its all magnificence in every aspect, sometimes fell short in the story, so there's not much to say about the story of Van Helsing. I completed the first chapter which seemed really short with a main story that wasn't any special (with a few side quests). Second chapter put me in exploring of a steampunk city called Borgova, which I personally found a little better. But because of bad gameplay mechanics and other repetitive elements were 13 hours spent in the game just enough for me to get an overall impression and write a review. GameplayMany players complained about the difficulty of this game, which is really hard even on normal settings! But the problem isn't just in some ridiculously 'strong' enemies, but in the hordes that attack you all at once. That's when the game of a cat and mouse begin, which really spoils the charm of your gameplay and feels totally unbalanced.If you have ever played Dota 2 or (to be more fair and precise) Diablo III or some other quality hack'n'slash rpgs and truly experienced (mastered?) their gameplay, than you should know how far superior are their gameplay mechanics to the game like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. It definitely tries and has some new cards in its hands, but it doesn't come really close. ConslusionThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing has some new ideas and approaches in this genre and some of its parts are done pretty well, but on the other hand lacks of some vital and more polished details that would make this game a truly unique gaming experience ...Replay value: This game was built for it, but in my opinion: NO.Recommended: Yes, but ONLY ON SALE!  by Garret A.M.

												The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing is a decent action RPG experience. I've seen games that were a lot worse in the last couple of months. Van Helsing brings nothing new to the table but is enjoyable nevertheless. If you ever played Diablo or Torchlight, or any other aRPG, you know exactly what to expect. Lots of killing, upgrading, sidequests to complete and loot to collect. This game has tons of loot, by the way. Maybe not all useful, but enough to let you choose your own equipment, creating a character based on your preferences. Same goes for the skills and perks. Plenty of choice here.The game is pretty challenging, but it's not because of its carefully placed (groups of) enemies, but because of the fact that enemies are on every corner of the road, never alone and always in groups. It feels like the developer just spammed enemies on the map, not knowing it would result in difficulty spikes. These enemies frequently get mixed up with a bunch of elites/uniques as well, making the game even harder than it probably should be.Please note that I do like a challenge, as long as it's fair.Graphically it looks pretty and it runs reasonably well, despite its framerate issues. The voice acting is mediocre, but I guess it gets the job done. There isn't a lot of acting anyway, so it's alright.Van Helsing doesn't do anything particularly wrong except for the enemy placement, and what's there is mostly good fun so if you'd like to have a cheap but lenghty aRPG give this one a spin.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												Van Helsing is a game similar to Path of Exile&thelike in terms of how the combat plays out. Except there are a few twists that make Van Helsing worth picking up.+The story is filled with entertaining humor.+You get a game-long companion in the form of a ghost named katarina, similar to the companion in Torchlight. Every one of her lines are witty and help the humor and flavor of the game.+There is a large set of skill trees to customize your character AND katarina with. While you cannot max it out, I enjoy how it forced me to assign certain roles to myself and Katarina.+There is functioning co-op. Further being able to assign roles with friends and their katarinas really helped make the game fun. And there are plenty of modes you can play with your friends.+PLENTY OF LOOT. Which I understand is a big thing in these kinds of games.+Graphics are great! The art design really helps create an atmosphere in which you can get immersed into this game.-There's a SINGLE broken quest in this game. They are never going to fix it. It's a side quest so it's not game-breaking. But do know you will NEVER be able to finish every quest in this game.+A very innovative and interesting tower-defense 'minigame' is in this. It seems to be a bit glitchy in coop mode but it's a lot of fun and inspired the game ""Deathtrap"".Overall I really liked this game. It's nothing special though. Just another ARPG, this one making its mark with its tower defense mechanic and its witty writing. If those don't turn you on however, then it's just an average ARPG like PoE, Diablo, and Torchlight- with nothing setting it apart other than that.I give it an 8/10. Was a whole lot of fun and I do recommened picking this up. But do note my negative points, some persons I know, may find them critical.			"

												Having just finished the heroic hardcore mode, these are my thoughts of the game, spoiler free!Even though i failed a few times, i still think the game is pretty easy. My fails were mostly because i got pulled in the middle of a mob all of a sudden, and couldn't get out. Even though i had good defense, they were still too much to handle eventually. So there was bad luck, and that's why my playing hours are what they are. My game usually ended near the end, so hours clocked in when i started again.Game is fun, my only ARPG experience is D2 and Torchlight really but i liked this as well. Dialoque has it's moments that made me laugh. The world is interesting, though the ink dungeons got a bit tiring. But the some of the areas were really detailed and i was genuinely interested in exploring them.Now to the part why i think this game is easy. As i said, i finished it on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath on. There's lots of builds that are just plain OP. Those times that i was in the middle of the mobs, it took time to kill me, except once when there was 2,5 mobs on me :D Then it was over pretty quick. No game breaking bugs encountered, only some minor ones like gargoyles staying stuck high in the sky, or some enemies teleporting outside a bridge etc. This is  fun game, funny dialoque interesting and diverse world, good came to kill time for a while (again, don't look at my playing hours :D).

												Van Helsing is a game with a lot of promise: a fresh take on the action rpg dungeon crawler genre that has been rather stale in recent years.  It has some great successes, and some great failures in this goal.  After almost finishing the game, I have to say I'm not feeling as good about it as when I started.The game follows the structure you'd expect: you run around, kill monsters, do quests, get loot.  Combat is mediocre, not having much feedback and pretty poor animations and sound, though the graphical effects are nice.  The game likes to throw massive hordes of enemies at you though so that does liven things up a bit.The skill system is interesting an unique, though I don't think it's been balanced very well.  You have a set of skills in 2 trees encompassing melee, ranged, and magic attacks as well as a few passive skills.  Each skill unlocks powerup abilities when you put enough points in which you have to activate manually by consuming rage (which you gain from killing monsters.)  It's a nice system that keeps you focused on what you're doing, though I wish there was a bit more flexibility and variety in it.The quests are well done for the most part.  There are a few choices to be made, and the quests that feel rather bland your ghost companion will make snarky comments about.  I feel safe saying she's the best character in the game and she does a pretty good job livening things up.The graphics are very good, though unfortunately the loading times are very high due to this.  The engine is fairly scalable and it runs decently on older computers though not as well as I'd like.  It does its job well and is surprisingly stable considering how buggy other aspects of the game are.I've run into a lot of situations where clicking to walk up a staircase makes me run down the staircase to try to get underneath it, or trying to hit an enemy with a spell shoots it straight into the ground.  Enemy selection boxes always seem to be the wrong size, feeling extremely large when you need to move so all you can do is attack, and extremely small when you're trying to hit them so you only seem to be able to move.  I don't know why these games have so much trouble with selection boxes these days, Diablo 3 had plenty of problems with this as well.  Multiplayer has done really strange things to save games (though I believe the devs have fixed most of this,) only saving progress on the host's save and even replacing your gear with completely random items.  Somehow my character was missing an NPC in the second hub town so I didn't have a shop available for a long time due to these bugs.Now the game's greatest failing is balance.  The early game is very easy, and ramps up very suddenly later in the game.  Certain enemies do tons of damage and come in massive hordes, all but guaranteeing your death unless you play a melee tank.  In fact, melee tank seems to be the only real choice as it does the most damage as well as being the only survivable build.  What really put the nail in the coffin for me playing a magic user, however, was reaching the final boss and finding him impossible to beat.  So much for that.So while being initially excited and quite enjoying the game, after reaching the end I have to say, wait for Grim Dawn.  Maybe it can breathe life back into this genre like no other games seem to be able to.  If you can't wait, give Marvel Heroes a try.			"

												This is a hard one to judge.I purchased this on the release day with the sole purpose of playing coop with a friend, but that failed miserably as the net-code of the game was severely broken and it was unplayable @ multiplayer.So, I forgot about this game for half a year and just now realised that I've haven't played it yet, so I gave it a try.This is a classic hack-n-slash, let's break it down to points a little bit.pros:-Good setting, steampunk, mad scientists, vampires, monsters. All that good stuff.-Gameplay feels solid. UI is good, mechanics are there and do not fall apart.-Katarina =)cons:-Out of 3 classes of heroes - 2 are locked away in DLC. That's just a♥♥♥♥♥♥move really.-Simplicity of it's core. Zero build diversity, while you have to appoint attributes and skills - it's pretty much useless, you might as well had them auto-allocated. Action is not as good and diverse as in Diablo 3, systems behind the game are not as deep and complex as in Path of Exile.I will definitely finish the game, because it grabbed me in some way, but I really couldn't recommend to buy this game, as it seems like a easily skippable one.

												Generally, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing appears to me as a fun production, but a little misguided. At times it is extended like a big hack & slash in which we play for weeks or even months - but it is not. It's pleasant, climatic, well-sounding and truly impressive-looking action game, little sophisticated, but without much problem, able to keep it with you for several hours. I can't stop thinking how cool it could be if it hadn't devoted as much time and resources on masking her and dressing in robes ""game similar to Diablo"" ... which wasn't needed because its main strength lies elsewhere and it had to focus on. If instead of extensive character development, loot system and crafting they had been devoted to improving combat mechanics and creating more decent plot, Van Helsing could be a really good game. But it is not, unfortunately. I admit it with pain, because I liked it for the ambience and Katarinas jokes. It is simply bearable. However, spending 15 euros (5 while discount) on it, isn't the worst idea, especially if u are fed up with more or less infantile fantasy, which offers us ARPG games. Well, also if one would like to play in a slightly different scenery - just because the authors managed to create it gloriously.			"

This game is a real challenge if you overlook this deficiencies and try hardcore mode, there you gotta be very careful and the game starts to demand more use of your skills in strategy. 6/10			"

												6/10: Really bad execution with exploring the world of the game and controls, but a good experience once a guide is used and controls are modified.I need to be as clear as possible when I say the default settings and controls make this game a 3/10, where it's practically impossible to play on Hardcore, let alone the highest difficulty due to enemies having large hit boxes and no easy way to move without using the mouse. The arrow keys can be used, but considering the game requires the use of a mouse for targeting, as well as the number keys and QWERTY, the range of motion for play is too frantic for a realistic level of fun while playing. Immediately change the game to use WASD to move and play the game like that when fighting enemies or it'll be a hassle during tough fights.The next negative that is important to mention is the bulk of quests have no method to learn what to do, let alone not mess it up since they can't be repeated to get it done correctly. It practically requires using a guide because the game doesn't do anything useful to hint at what to do, or even warn if the quest leads to a boss fight you can't run away from.I'm still giving it a positive review because those problems can be solved outside of the game, but I will give it a massive deduction in score because of that. The voice acting and dialogue are well done, the atmosphere is something I greatly enjoy and overall, it's worth it if you pay about $5. As of right now, it's not worth $15 because the game has too many issues that should have been solved in development and are obvious how easy they are to fix once the player experiences the bad decisions.

												A memorable hack-n'-slash ARPG. The gameplay is not necessarily unique, but the game manages to stand out in its own way with its 'magic vs machine' theme. It also has quite a bit of technical flaws, but the art style and the steampunk atmosphere manages to make up for it. (I have not tried co-op mode yet, so do not expect it to be included in this review)Pros: Immersive steampunk setting and soundtrack Amazing voice acting, one of the best I've heard so far Flavorful dialogues, that does not make you want to skip them (some even have references) I personally liked the character design and personality of Katarina, your companion, as she really feels like a living (lol) partner you actually share your adventure with Character designs of the mobs/monsters are also interesting and original Tons of loot A handful of quests are fun and creative Lots of options to customize your character build, from skills, to spells, to auras and tricks, etc.Cons: Gameplay is entirely similar to that of Torchlight II and Diablo III, pretty much same formula While Katarina has an interesting character, her function has been reduced to that of Torchlight II's pet (she can go to town and buy potions/sell stuff on her inventory, etc) which seems out of character for her Too much mobs in one area with the same AI, so that they can easily crowd you ^ Because of this, combat feels too repetitive and bland at late-game Limited variation of mobs, as the same mobs appear in different areas and levels of the game I'm not sure if this was only me, but unique items in the game seemed too easy to acquire (I ended up with lots of uniques even though I never went out of my way to acquire them or whatever) Loading screens take longer as you progress further into the story. And whenever you die, you are brought back to a loading screen unless you spend gold to resurrect yourself on the spot Game also freezes for no reason in the middle of combatOverall Rating:7.5/10Edit 05/10/16: Just corrected a few in-game terms I have used "

												I wasn't expecting much from this, seeing the low metacritic (72), but it turned out to be better than its score implied, especially considering the low price point.The high points are solid ARPG gameplay, graphics, and atmosphere.The atmosphere features Eastern European (""gothic-noir"") influences not often seen in the genre (and steampunk elements very often seen in the genre lately).Mechanically, it's a mix of other recent ARPG titles - most closely resembling Torchlight (with at least one overt reference to it during the game). It also has odd Tower Defense sequences thrown in at the end (think Sanctum, but with ARPG instead of FPS mechanics).The itemization is solid, albeit relatively unimaginative. Apart from well balanced base rolls and selection of basic, magic, rare, set, and unique items, you can further enhance your gear by adding a stat (Enchant) to any item for cost, and some items can hold ""essences"" (a sort of socketing system, minus the sockets) for even more customization. There is also gambling and a limited form of crafting (item rerolls/recycling via Artifact Forge).For those of you wondering - you can respec individual skill and stat points at (relatively low) cost (or all points at once for Katarina), so there is freedom to experiment and no need to grind out multiple characters to experience the entire skill tree.Especially notable is your companion ghost, Lady Katarina, who serves as both a wose-cracking companion to make your single player adventure less lonely, and an able fighter in her own right, with her own equipment slots, inventory, skill trees, and behavior settings. She can also go shopping for you.The most disappointing aspect is the prevalence of bugs, which have been getting fixed over time, but are still apparent as of writing. This includes some game breaking bugs that make it impossible or difficult (via a workaround) to progress with the main quest.The low metacritic can largely be explained by the shortcomings of the original release, which have since been amended via updates and DLC. The updates include additional endgame content (high level ""scenarios"", Glory System (perks for completing scenarios), and a new game+ mode).DLC adds two character classes (previously there was just one, with a melee, ranged, and magic path), a passive skill tree for Katarina, and more endgame content (high level ""scenarios"", and a new game+ mode). Not having played the DLC classes yet, I can't comment on whether they are worth it. Blue Blood basically makes Katarina substantially more powerful, which is certainly eyebrow raising, but that DLC could be skipped with limited gameplay consequences.Overall, I would recommend the game as an enjoyable diversion for any fan of ARPGs, especially for anyone looking for an atmospherically unusual ARPG or fans of the source material, but keep in mind that my own experience was limited to single player.

												You liked D2:LoD? GET THIS GAME! Detailed review is below. (Sorry for English, not my native)A short ""what is it all about?"" - hack'n'slash with great and complex character development, decent number of items (magic, uniques, sets, legendaries are included), great crafting system for improving gear. Good interface and interesting monsters to slay (available in great quantities). Replayable and good for multiplayer.This is one of the best aRPG games I've ever played. And my gaming 'career' is long and glorious - started aRPG genre with original Diablo, carved my way throught D2:LoD [and kept carving it until 2012], tried my luck in Sacred series, Titan Quest and lots of other titles. Except D2:LoD, none managed to kept my attention - sure, I played them, finished them but always returned to good'ol.What I have to say it that this game for me is second to D2:LoD only - with a chances to even surpasses it, never forget that this is only one third of full game. What made me put an unfinished game over, for instance D3 or PoE? Regarding D3 - Van Helsing is what D3 should have been. Regarding PoE - it's a close match, but i prefer graphics, interface and overall feeling to a more complex and somewhat confusing skill system. Don't get me wrong, I've played fair share of both, regretting deeply what D3 could become and seeing potential in PoE.Game itself is fun to play, even repeatedly over and over. Price is fine, and you don't REALLY need paid DLCs (except 1.5EUR ""Blue Blood"") - the basic game brings more builds and customization of character than whole D3 - and I stand firmly behind this claim. Interface is excellent, any D2 veteran will find himself at home. So is the monster density and constant action (but with good measure!). Character progression is good, there is a 'respec' option (I don't like it personally, but it seems like a trend nowadays), but some choices are permanent, as it should be.Voice casting is excellent, and dialogues between main character and ghost sidekick (which can be customized almost as much as main character, making a deadly duo in fight, and source of fun inbetween - again, clever dialogues doesn't make it boring).I was with the game since release, and developer team knows what they are doing - many additions/changes were always for the better - I've returned to the game after few months hiatus and got surprised by amount of small, but important quality oflife improvements. And bug/exploit fixes. And new feeling and better endgame.Pros: - High technical quality (graphics, sound, voice-acting)- Various builds for each character- Complex companion development, something unseen in aRPG before- Intriguing (and unfinished) storyline- A unique game settings: alternate history with slavic mythology mixed with steampunk, working PERFECTLY- Storytelling is very good- Game lore is excellent, and so are little details who mean much - names of the people, equipment etc - all very atmospheric- Character progression is complex, depending on several separated systems - dwarfing D3, keeping in line with PoE (on a different level, though) and succeeding D2:LoD rapidlyCons:- Non-random maps and moster type/positions- Lack of random events and quest- Scripted story - not really a problem, but little more open game with randomization and wide range of optional quests appearing randomly - would add more replayability. There is a replayability value, don't get me wrong, but more never hurts- Bugs in multiplayer - once plagued the game, now mostly fixed - and this 'mostly' is why I mention this. Won't destroy your days of playing, but you'll maybe need to repeat quest, for instance. Big deal.Finishing thoughts:I understand that now there is a demo. At least try it. As of myself, I've bought several copies as a gifts to my friends. DLCs add multiplayer value - you can have dedicated melee/ranged/caster characters (and companions with different builds!) with regular game, and it's way better than parties in D3, but DLCs add more.If you like D2:LoD, you'll probably like Van Helsing - it is true spiritual successor of a legendary game. If you think that D3 is what aRPG should be, you probably should try anyway - just to see a different side of a coin, how modern game functions with different mechanics. It's just 17% of what you paid for D3.			"

												Rating - 84/100Recommendation - There's something for everyone. Even non-ARPG-fans.It is a travesty how far under the radar this game has flown. Even rather diehard ARPG fans have overlooked it, which is not only a sin, but should also be a crime. This game is GREAT.All the hallmarks of a modern ARPG are here: Hordes and hordes of enemies, quick level-ups, copious perks and skill points, gigantic boss monsters, and a minion you can outfit who levels up alongside you. There are 3 acts, waypoints, hidden quests, socketables, stashes, etc. Don't go thinking this game is just like every other ARPG, however. There are a number of ways Van Helsing differs from its siblings.The main surprise for me was how Lady Katarina (Van Helsing's companion) feels like a fully-fledged player character. Her skills can be absurdly powerful, and you can build her to either be completely passive and only provide boosts to Van Helsing, or as a hell-raising destruction machine (with Van Helsing providing boosts to her if wanted). She has a full set of skills, mildly-programmable AI, and nearly the same amount of equipment options as Van Helsing himself. While minions in other games really feel like nothing more than pets, Katarina felt more like a full co-op partner.Another part that surprised me was the skill system. When you level up, you earn points that you can use to unlock skills and skill upgrades. In battle, you can use your mana to unleash special attacks, and use so-called rage points (you have a rage meter that charges up as you use regular attacks) to add modifiers to your skills. For example, you can use a lightning strike that sends 3 small electric tendrils snaking out along the ground, and you can use your rage points to add additional tendrils, increase the damage, or add a stun effect. Each modifier can be stacked up to 3 times, and the effects can be devastatingly powerful. Rage charges up rather slowly, though, so it's best to save them up for any one of the brutally-difficult boss fights.Speaking of difficulty, this game skates the same tough-but-doable line that other recent ARPGs (other than Diablo 3) have. It's also worth mentioning that playing in co-op increases the difficulty drastically. I found it much easier when I played in single player, so bring a friend who knows what they're doing.Overall, I have nothing that I can complain about with this game. The graphics are great, the voice acting is well-done and often hilarious, the multiplayer is stable, the combat is visceral and entertaining, the skill system is unique and robust, the difficulty is even and fair, the story is interesting, the game length is just right, and the whole affair is filled with the mindless slaughtering of countless enemies that you've come to know and love. There are riddles, cultural references, ethereal ""rift"" sections, and even a few little tower defense distractions.If you are at all a fan of ARPGs, I honestly cannot recommend it enough. Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, this one does just enough things differently that you will likely find something to enjoy. If not, well, at least it's cheap.-DrB			"

The only serious, well-made RPG game I started and finished was DragonAge. And then came Van Helsing.I have never thought I would encounter a game that will mix up steampunk, monster killing and the legend on Van Helsing in such a perfect manner.The game is just amazing. I only played the hunter class, but I just can't wait to start it again as a mechanic or a thaumaturge. Well-balanced, fun to play, and Lady Katarina's character is just brilliant.It's worth every penny.			"

												I heard of this game by accident and, after playing Torchlight I & II, I decided to give it a try since it seemed so dark and atmospheric.  And it seams I wasn't wrong. The first thing I noticed was that, unlike other similar games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a game with a distinct ""personality"" (assuming this can be said about a video game). The action takes place in the dark and mysterious world of Borgovia, a world where magic and science(and of course mad scientists) can coexist. The world is beautifully designed and it seems the designers paid a lot of attention to details. The atmosphere somehow reminded me of London as imagined by Conan Doyle as well as Transylvania as portrayed by Bram Stocker in ""Dracula"". The soundtrack is great and it fits perfectly with the dark foggy streets full of strange creatures hiding in the shadows. It's really hard to tell how much it adds to the game feeling but it's obviously, once you start playing, that the game wouldn't be the same with a different soundtrack. The game features 3 classes, The Hunter, The Thaumaturge and The Arcane Mechanic, the last 2 being sold separately as 2 DLCs. Each class has a very complex skill system, with multiple skill trees as well as many abilities that can be both, passive or active. While this can be frustrating for those who don't like to replay the game, due to the fact that it's quite impossible to complete a skill tree in a single playthrough, unless you wonder around and kill monsters just for fun, this makes more sense if you plan on playing the sequel, since you can import everything and continue from where you left. The main character, Van Helsing, also has his own companion, Lady Katerina, the ghost of a noble lady. Just like Van Helsing, Lady Katarina has her own skill system with a few active and passive skills as well as different combat modes (melee, ranged). You can also set her to attack those who attack you, those you are attacking or anyone around or you can tell her to stay out of battle. She can be very useful when you're overwhelmed and she can also go grab loot for you and sell/buy items. Voice acting and dialog is great and you can actually see the chemistry between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina. The game also has a lot of pop culture references to movies/games like The Witcher and Lord Of The Rings. Unfortunately, for those who are used to games like Diablo and Torchlight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, is a hard game and sometimes it can be very frustrating and cheap. There are moments when you will be overwhelmed by creatures 2+ levels ahead of you, in confined spaces and if their huge health given by the higher level won't be a problem for you, the huge number will eventually make it impossible for you to move so you'll just have to wait for your inevitable death and respawn. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a great game that will please many Diablo/Torchlight fans. 8.5/10			"

												In a cliched world of action RPGs involving medieval/fantasy type settings, it’s refreshing to discover Neocore’s 19th century steampunk gothic-noir type game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. The game’s ambience of nighttime villages and murky swamps accompanied by a greatly appropriate soundtrack will keep you playing until your index finger gets numb. Character class and selection is so varied the game will probably warrant more than a single playthrough to flesh out all of its possibilities. Upon seeing the blank skill tree when first starting out it’s almost mind blowing to wonder where you’re going to put all of the skills, perks and auras the game allows you to. It’s not quite the endless skill tree as Path of Exile, but it’s deep enough you’ll feel your character grow as you play. Enemies come in waves, overwhelmingly so. I played a range character and being able to kite the enemies helped somewhat. If you decide to play as a melee class I think you’ll have your work cut out for you. Neocore is a small publisher out of Hungary, and big publishers could take some lessons from these guys. I’ve never had the desire to play an RPG through more than once until I played this. Despite the trappings, however, all is not perfect. There was no game manual included in the download, and for the developers to instruct players to read online forums and watch online videos to learn simple instructions about the game bears little in the way of professionalism. Once I learned how “rage” (the energy required to do super attacks, acquired through killing NPCs) worked I was able to accomplish much more. Some creatures in the game had an attribute called Abomination. I never did find out exactly what that was. And the final boss fight involved a lot of lag for me. I died many times because I simply lagged out. Definitely not a deal breaker, but it made that final fight more difficult than it had any right to be. This may or may not be an issue affecting anybody else. I have a state of the art rig, and I was surprised the lag even occured.Still, I’m glad I found this game. I look forward to playing through it again, experimenting with another class. And then I’ll look forward to tackling Neocore’s sophomore effort, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II. "

												This game is fine if you're a big fan of hack-and-slash action RPGs, otherwise I would not recommend it. I like the setting, and there's a lot of easter eggs in this game. But you get only one class with the game itself and 2 more as DLCs. You can differently build that single class, but there isn't much skills to chose from anyway. Surroundings are dull and gameplay quickly becomes too repetitive - just throw AoE attacks at huge and stupid crowds of enemies again and again. I haven't tried multiplayer, though - maybe that's where all the fun is hiding.			"

												☺ Everything an ARPG needs.☺ Great environments.☺ Nice soundtrack.☹ Repetitive encounters.An entertaining and enjoyable hack and slash, filled with loot, humour and atmosphere.If you're not a fan of Action Roleplaying Games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing isn't going to be the game that changes your mind. However, if you're new to the genre or a fan of hack and slash loot fests, you're in luck! Van Helsing manages to provide an entertaining experience throughout its ten or so hour campaign (more so if you're an explorer like myself who likes to uncover all of the map).You take on the role of the famous Van Helsing (well one of them, his son to be exact) as he and his companion the ghostly Lady Katarina attempt to save the day as monsters and science collide to bring about death and destruction upon Borgovia. You empower the great monster hunter and snappy ghost with a variety of skills from melee to ranged attacks and can even increase your attack power or versatility mid combat by powering up said abilities. Although an interesting attempt at creating options in combat, I will admit I hardly ever used said system myself, as I created a character who got his benefits from not using Rage, the resource that powers the stronger attacks.The world itself is really well created with a lot of detail, creating a great mood as you hack and slash through groups of monsters. The encounters themselves are well balanced, but grow repetitive as you encounter the same groups of enemies again and again, a bit more variation in group makeup would have been welcome, but it's a slight issue rather than a deal breaker. Of course, the most important element for a game like this...the loot, is frequent and diverse. I was often switching over to newly acquired items or optimising my build.I must admit, I really enjoyed playing the game. The grim world is lightened with a sprinkling of humour, especially the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina throughout the game, which is well acted and entertaining. The game itself is also littered with cultural references, if something is clickable, its likely Van Helsing has something to say about it that'll bring a smile to your face. I also found myself really enjoying the music, while not overly diverse, it's rather lovely and fits the world well.Listed under 'Main Features' is a section on building and developing traps to defend your lair. It's worth mentioning this is more of a brief distraction and isn't very deep. Those looking for a bit of tower defence in their ARPG might be a bit disappointed, despite the developers best intentions.I really do recommend the game to fans of action roleplaying games or for someone that fancies a simple, yet entertaining story with a touch of humour and a great deal of sparkly objects bursting out of everything you touch.

												I...really tried and yearned to love this game, as I do with every indie project that shows some semblance of original thought.I ended up...liking, if at times only TOLERATING, a lot of things about Van Helsing.Why do I say such a thing? because it got pretty bad at parts, but I also don't shy away from games totally unafraid to make me feel like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥like they did 15 years ago. This game succeeds on that front unquestionably.Ideally for 2-4 players, I actually just finished the entire game solo. Be forewarned, if you're not an ARPG guy, you're even in for a rough time on easy difficulty, which I all but mandate in your first playthrough. This game will swarm your♥♥♥♥♥like Starship troopers with things that do not, I repeat NOT, die in 1, 2, even 5 hits. It's rough, and it works for the setting and the game.Now at this point the average Joe has some idea of what they're in for, so maybe you ARPG die hards are now asking: ""What's in it for me?"" Well I'll tell you!Great music: I had to talk about this here. It's a standard we all have with games of substance, especially a good APRG. This game delivers EXCESSIVELY. The entire score features soft harps and pianos, things you would expect to hear in this alternative dark fantasy Transylvanian tale. Hit up youtube and hear some of it for yourself. This is one of few games that I actually left on while I wrote the review because of how great an atmosphere the menu theme provided. Story: One thing I found funny about a game as goofy as Torchlight 2 is that it took its Story as seriously as Diablo did. This flip flops- very believable, gritty, down to earth graphics, sounds, and atmopshere, totally slapstick everything else. The characters engage in light heartened banter while picking up quests, interacting with objects, and more.♥♥♥♥♥♥ there's even a message board in town at the beginning that is for nothing beyond ""click for great pop culture reference."" It's a true joy to experience.Gameplay: Not much not already said here, You are in for a challenge, no way around that. A fun challenge with friends, but a challenge. Bring your A game, this game's ""easy"" is NOT TL2's.Fresh and new ideas: Ever think how badass it'd be to properly have your own hideout/camp, or even gather resources and build♥♥♥♥♥♥in a game like an ARPG? well VH almost delivers. I can't say there's any proper crafting, but midway your township where your vendors reside can actually get attacked, and you play a metagame of tower defense to protect it. Very innovative IMHO, and successful.Overall, if forcibly shoehorned into rating it on a 1-10 scale, which I like to refrain from, I would call this game a 7 without question. Flawed, buggy still, but the devs care about the latter and are working on it, it's an all out riot most of the time, and most important of all- it's fricken $10 until the 2nd. Consider snagging it if you're a fan of the genre, or even a new guy looking for a semi hardcore trial by fire.			"

(Who DOESN'T love a good H and S?) The developers are also VERY active (from what I've seen) on the forums and bug fixing, which is a huge plus in my book. The Story is pretty linear, not a lot of ""open world"" adventuring, but it's unique story kept me coming back for more. It's a trilogy game set, so keep in mind this isn't the end. Has this interesting power-up system that allows you be both melee or ranged. You can even equip both weapons.			"

												This game is a real mixed bag.On one hand - its fun. It's well designed, has interesting character aspects (skills, perks, etc), a companion , nice graphics, good gameplay. On the other hand - its hard to enjoy it when the game is riddled with bugs. Some of which were litterally game stopping (eg Industrial Port / Palace quest bug - only recently (12/10/13) patched. There are also other numerous bugs (now with fixes via the /FixQuest command) - and MP hasn't worked for many (perhaps patched today as well) and warning of data loss for MP characters.For some, having your game not progress unexpectedly, requiring you to search the web for solutions, isn't enjoyable or expected from Steam games. Perhaps now, the game is bug free. Perhaps not.I would say this game is not one i'd reccomend due to how many issues there have been that are substantial (MP, game stopping bugs) - unless you can get it for a massive Steam discount (80% off). Then the risk would be worth the reward. Paying full price now - without time showing if all the bugs are fully worked out - is not something recommended.			"

												Initial positive impression, as soon as I got into chapter 3 things went sour. Overall, not touching it again. TLDR on the bottom.+ Decent storytelling, somewhat involved.+ Comments from Lady Katarina are pretty amusing.+ Good pacing, good attribute system, fairly decent itemization (by comparison, MILES ahead of Diablo 3).- Little enemy variety, weird incoming damage at times.- Skill variety on the Hunter class is extremely poor. A handful of reskinned shots, didn't really feel progression or much weight from using differerent skills. Same deal goes for the melee tree.- BUGS. Oh the bugs. One of my hunter tricks crashed multiplayer games when I hosted, had to respec / avoid using skill to keep playing. The ""slow time"" skill on the Thaumaturge often bugged entire maps, lasting forever and then on a second cast engaging turbo mode. Random client crashes every 20-30 minutes.TLDR: The game is not entirely bad, but does not warrant a positive review. If you want the hack and slash experience and don't mind restarting the game every 30 minutes or so, go ahead. It's built on a solid foundation, but lacks the necessary polish to be a true contender in this genre.			"

If you call any isometric hack and slash RPG a Diablo rip-off, then yes, this is it.However, it puts its own spin on the genre and taking a lot from what Diablo did well, and added some things it maybe could have used.You play as Van Helsing, of the Monster Hunter lore, as one of three classes: Hunter, Thaumaturge, and Arcane Mechanic; each with it's own set of skills and abilities. The monsters and creatures you face are the ever-familiar brand you'd find in any fantasy setting, such as Rat-men, undead zombies, giant behemoths, acid-spitting breeders, and even automatons. From what I can tell, the story is pretty straightforward and can be completed in about 15 hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth your time.The inventory system is top-notch, taking much from Diablo where you have to arrange your items according to their size and shape in a grid fashion. You are provided with a storage that you can access through the town areas and depending on your choice of perk, you can store more than just a single page.Your companion through the game is Lady Katarina, a ghost of someone who knows the Van Helsing line quite well. She can be customized to be completely support (no fighting), ranged, melee, defense, attack, etc. She can even be configured to grab items from the battlefield according to their type or value. She can be sent to the store (like a town portal) to sell loot she's carrying and even buy potions if needed.They kept with the waypoint system of using an ""ink gate"" which allows you to teleport to the various areas you've discovered, as well as use a town portal for yourself.There's plenty of side-quests and the various tasks to keep you busy (as mundane as they can be sometimes), the rewards are quite worth it.Each character has a skill tree that can be traversed as you gain levels by investing skill points. There are class-specific skills (main attacks and passive abilities), tricks (which are like sub-skills), and auras (which are passive bonuses). There's also a perk system that allows you to choose various character bonuses as you gain reputation (how well you're known around the land -- kill lots of stuff).The HUD and interface are very easy to navigate, it's very hot-key friendly, and the music/controls are top-notch.The game also supports multiplayer as well, so you can team up with friends to take on the monsters of Borgovia.It's not the most revolutionary game out there, but I think anyone who's a fan of the lore and liked Diablo (maybe even those who didn't) will enjoy this game.

												Sleeper hit of 2013. It is a gem of a game with incredible voice acting, 2-3 times longer than Diablo 3's content. Best of all, Van Helsing is a trilogy and the 2nd installment arrives early 2014 and your character from the first game will import directly into the second. Found this to be much more enjoyable than Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.			"

												I've always been a fan of ARPG's, since the very start of the first Diablo, so began my journey of endless clicking and replacing one pair of apparel with another due to a minor stat change! If you've played several ARPG's already, you'll know how they basically all share the same concept and pretty much are one in the same, perhaps the only difference would be the actual story, and even then it can become quite monotonous and you don't actually end up following it.Surprisingly, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is nothing like that! Sure it may be a hack 'n slash clickfest, but within its core lies a beautiful system unlike any other! The fast paced combat, the synergy with abilities and auras/tricks as well as the ability to craft (transmute) and enhance your items by adding and combining ""essences"" combined with a rather interesting story that one cannot help but follow (as there isn't many side quests to get lost on) makes for one hell of a good time in the beautiful world of Borgovia!I can however say from experience having played several ARPG's that this is by far the more challenging of the lot I've actually come across, and I mean that in a really good way. Though I did play on Hard it felt more like Hell of Diablo II right from the get go, and loot certainly wasn't overpowering (I was playing the newly released Thaumaturge class and it seems there isn't much unique loot as compared to the original Hunter class which every second unique I got was for it).The gameplay is really well polished, and so too are the graphics, which is surprising for an Indie release! I honestly cannot find any faults with the game itself, perhaps only that it was rather short (30 odd hours exploring EVERYTHING) but it strikes the perfect balance and somehow doesn't take you on a grindfest to actually progress and unlock everything you need or want! So all in all this is definitely a game I would recommend to any ARPG fans who loved Diablo or Torchlight!			"

												I found The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing to be a fun Diablo-esc game.  I did not purchase the DLC, as I got this game on sale at a much earlier point in time and only played it recently.  I did play the game on a normal difficulty setting, single player only.  If you are looking for a review of DLC or Multiplayer content, this is not for you.Van Helsing is filled with hand crafted art and textures, fair story writing, and the occassional surprising content.  There are quite a few references to what I imagine are their influences in game and story design.  On the flip side, I felt like the gameplay was lacking.  I also felt like the story was developing into something exciting, and quickly sputtered off like they lost the inspiration to keep going.I spent the first half of the game excited and drawn in.  The second half I felt like the gameplay had devolved into holding down the right mouse button waiting for my skills to kill ever increasing numbers of the same types of enemies.  It took me about 20 hours to finish based on my play time.  I felt like the skill trees had some fun possibilities, but nothing inspired me to branch out from what worked in the first hours of the game.  It was worth finishing the game to me, but I did feel this sense of, ""Was that it?"" -- I don't know that I could recommend this game to everyone.  I felt like it was worth the sale price I paid for it, and the 20 hours I invested in finishing it.  If it matters to those reading this I do not feel like its worth a replay, and I am not interested in DLC for it.  If I was to attach an arbitrary number to the game in regards to a ""score"", I would probably say a 60%.  It doesn't fail to create a fun game to play, but it did lack some kind of wow factor.			"

												This is pretty good. I am long since tired of Diablo clones, but I liked this one. It is worth a playthrough, somewhere on the order of 10 hours of play. It does not try to stretch that to 40 with fake longevity or 400 by asking you to keep re-running the same maps. It's not flawless, and I wouldn't recommend it without a sale (I got it in a Humble Bundle), but it does its job of being entertaining and engrossing.			"

												I was expecting something visceral and hard-hitting, and although the scenery is nice, as well as the number of enemies which can come rushing into you - Nothing you throw at them feels strong, nor does it feel satisfying when you use a strong ability.The animations are very lacking, as well, and the fact that you have to purchase DLC materials to get more than one character is the final nail in the coffin for me.Better stick to Diablo, even if everyone hates it.

I was very excited to play this game as it has everything i look for, but hours of searching on forums for a fix, I've come to the conclusion that this is money lost. The developers responses on all of the forums shows a lack of urgency to fix a glaring issue as hundreds of users have the same problem.			"

Also this is the first of three I believe so once your done you still have something to look forward to with your character in the future. Also there are game types that allow you to get loot after you beat the story so you can prepare for whats coming. Was very impressed and this game is a good little surprise.			"

												A more than passable, fun game that manages to pick and choose the best elements from many other ARPGs and fit them all into a nice tidy package (with the inclusion of the DLC).  Pros:-No suicide bomber enemies.-3 playable classes with their own class specific items/sets/uniques.-A versatile companion npc with her own skill tree and equipment slots .  She can be your magic finder, help with your survivability, give offensive support, or a combination thereof.-Well done character banter.Cons:-Some of the unmarked quests, especially the one that spans the entire game are very easy to miss.-Multiplayer got off on a shaky start and never fully recovered.-Some quests teleport you without much warning to prepare.Overall it is a great game and well worth the price of admission.

												I didn't enjoyed The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing more than any of Diablo games. But for some reason, it was more fun than Torchlight series. Why? Not sure. Maybe because it looks a little more dark and I really loved atmosphere in this game. Having a lovely companion also made me enjoy this game really much and the way you could spend her skill points in whatever way you want was a good idea - you can build her so she will be a real support for the way you will be playing, not some kind of obstacle. Maybe because I was focused on hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I really had hard times - every new area ended for me the same way, with more deads than I could count. Not that I hated it, maybe it was also my fault, but I enjoyed it. This way I had more fun than just running and killing everyone with 1 hit. Also, the boss fights are great.Graphics looks nice, music fits really well. I could only complaing about how game ends, and while the story isn't the best but not that it really matter, at least I look for something different in hack and slash games. If you are fan of those, if you look for something interesting in this genre - you should try The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. Maybe it's no use comparing it to other games like that but for sure it's worth playing. It's game that grabbed my attention for few hours and the time I spend playing it was truly fun.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is solid Diabloesque RPG on pc that plays well with a gamepad. That was my main draw point as got into the game. What I did not know is that it is actually very light-hearted and silly (in a positive way) RPG experience that really ended up enjoying.All the core mechanics work, the game play is solid, the story is there (perhaps not the best but certainly entertaining) and the game can be quite challenging at times. The questing is always about killing someone which ofc can be expected from this type of game and it might smother the enthusiast of some hard core RPG fans but aside from that it’s a very solid title.Crafting and enchanting provide plenty of variety; some interesting tower defence experiments were a fun idea as well. Graphics are nice as well but nothing amazing.An entertaining and fun RPG game that does not take itself seriously at all and provides just some solid entertainment.7.5/10PS: probably one of the best gamepad supported pc RPG games currently "

												I recently purchased The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Franchise pack and it's exactly the kind of game I've been looking for. Over-the-top monsters, decent world building and (for me) much more fun than Diablo 3. I wanted something that dealt with the supernatural and I wanted to kill a lot of monsters and this game gave me just that. I was already a big fan of the character's history and mythos (even though it's his son in this instance) I was very satisfied to step into the shoes of the world famous monster hunter. On the gameplay side of things, because I'm building strictly for ranged combat I like being able to set the behaviours of my companion Katarina and build her toward being a melee tank complimenting my own playstyle. The controls took a bit of getting used to, but they're quite cleverly implemented in that per shot you can decide which type of special round you'd like to load up into the gun. I'm still only very early into the game, but one of my favourite implementations that they've brought to the genre that I haven't seen anywhere else is that when you find a legendary item to gain it's full benefits you need to use the weapon to get kills in specific ways which unlock the item's abilities. It's one of those neat minor additions that helps keep the game interesting. Overall it has been a solid experience and I hope that this franchise can manage to keep going on strong.			"

The classes and skill tree and ability points are also well done and the companion ghost that you have with you throughout the game also levels up and gets skills and ability points and you can equip her with certain armor and weapons.To sum it up this is a really great & fun game that has good replayability and it also has a hardcore mode. The co-op is excellent!			"

												I'm not a big fan of top-down RPG's, but Van Helsing is a surprisingly good game. Although, I still believe it would've been better as ARPG. It has a pretty interesting story and nice character design. With tons of secrets, far-stretching maps and numerous missions it has hours of fun to offer.PROS:- Interesting story- Detailed and beautiful environment with atmosphere that involves both steampunk and gothic elements- Impeccable level design (a rarity these days)- Companion that comes in handy when facing hordes of enemies (Lady Caterina – available through DLC); she has her own skill tree and stats and can carry extra items, too- Convenient interface (compared to older games in RPG genre)- Contrary to other RPGs, the player is not tormented with endless choices between items, which are slightly better than the previous item in one aspect and slightly worse in another- Automatic equipment feature (allows to auto-equip best items)- Versatile skill tree- Relatively easy achievements (although, some might consider it a bad thing)CONS:- It's very demanding in terms of processing power. I experienced occasional freezes and lags on some maps (playing on high or very high settings). Some say it's because of bad optimisation and I tend to agree, as those lags occur in specific areas only.- IMO, towards the end, enemy spawn is a bit unbalanced; it's literally armies of enemies rushing towards you and, if you retreat in the wrong directions, it means another army. At times, you're just surrounded by countless enemies in a small circle and doomed to die. These hordes also make the game lag.- Level cap of 30 (not even enough to cover 20% of the skill tree)- Some missions use the previous maps and you have to reveal the whole territory again, even if you had explored it all before- This game does not launch on all systems without problems. In order to play the IAVH, I had to edit the registry valuesMy overall rating: 9/10			"

												What Van Helsing may lack in overall polish and length, especially for a hack and slash game of this type when some of its contemporaries seem to march on forever, it certainly makes up for with particular East European flavor and largely successful attempts at humor. If Van Helsing has one thing going for itself it's the fact it happens to have a very well defined atmosphere as well as some tangential gameplay additions you would not necessarily expect, mainly in the form of tower defense game and some separate scenarios unlocked towards the end.That's not to say the negatives don't rear their ugly head; from a single playable class, unless you buy the remaining two in the form of DLC/complete version, wonky and unclear itemization which will make you return to old RPG territory and simply look for basic attribute bonuses, and sometimes outright weirdly paced difficulty. Latter could be the failing of my own poor character building skills, but somewhere around The Old Town area difficulty seems to ramp up for no real reason other than perhaps the introduction of particularly annoying new enemy types. Ending is also an obvious cliffhanger, which may or may not annoy you depending on your take on the final boss.You will be in familiar waters if you have any experience with the genre in general, although your patience may be tested at certain parts as you struggle with camera spazzing out and somewhat obtuse quest directions leading you astray. Still worth checking out, though. "

												Van Helsing is a Diablo like action RPG developed by the Hungarian studio NeoCore Games known for their King Arthur series. Van Helsing combines a lot of the quality-of-life tweaks developers have been adding onto the genre ever since Diablo 2 became bigger than sliced bread. Some of these include the companion and pet system, the ability to respec your character without ever having to be afraid of gimping them, and the ability to disenchant and unsocket weapons without destroying either weapon or gem. However, the game is plagued by tons of bugs and performance issues and its multiplayer component should not even be considered playable.Issues in co-op:- The questline is not saved unless you are the host. Either play through the game entirely with a party or play it solo.- The tower defense portion and all the Secret Lair upgrades are inaccessible to anyone who is not the host.- Constant crashing when transitioning between areas.If you're opting for a single player only experience, then you'll get an average game that never takes off or goes anywhere. Remember, this is part 1 of an unfinished trilogy. Van Helsing lacks replay value as well. The level cap is 30 and there is no real endgame content. While the combat is genuinely fun despite adding nothing new to the genre, the customization options are very weak due to limited skill trees. NeoCore have rushed out an average game then proceeded to sell extra content for it without fixing longstanding issues. Both extra character classes, and the 2nd skill tree for Katarina, were sold for real money which is absolutely deplorable for an action RPG. Let’s not forget that people who pre-ordered this game got an exclusive permanent boost to their magic find. If you plan on buying the 2nd game, you can probably expect the same treatment. Buy a buggy game for $15, then pay $10 for additional content. These 3 games and all their content combined will end up costing you more money than a new game in the long run. Unless you've experienced every action RPG on the market right and starving for more, then there is no way I can recommend this title.My full video review is available at:

												When I saw this, I thought this looks fun.  I was not wrong!  Besides the initial issue I had with DirectX (had to install DirectX 9 again), I had no problems or obvious bugs so far.  The game has performed well on my i7, 12GB memory, with SSD, and a GTX670 graphics card.Some users I noticed on the Steam forum have been having problems with the game not starting.  My wife and eldest son both play the game, and both had no problems.  But be aware that this seems to be happening with some people.  There is a dev that is on the forums at least trying to help now and then.Takes a short while to figure out the Rage, powerup settings and tricks, but once that is done, the rest of the game is easy to understand and grasp.  Pretty linear, just follow the quest markers.  Keep the tutorial on so you can easily get the initialy help you likely will need to better userstand the game.  Even then, you may need to play around a bit to fully understand the rage and powerup settings.  You can reset your abilitys, so don't worry about it being set in stone forever... just costs gold.Graphics and audio is great.  The audio is enjoyable and fits the action adventure gameplay.Some pointers:1. Take note that you can only have 10 perks during your 30 levels.  Many better perks don't show up initially in the game, so you may need to hold out before selecting.  Otherwise, find a resource online somewhere that provides all the perks and wait for the ones you want once you have seen them all.  Unlike your abilities and skills, you can't reset your perks.2. There is no save option, so you will always return to the waypoint (or ""ink"" point) of a certain area after you exit.  There is a setting in options that allows you stop the monsters from respawning if you exit.  Respawning after death costs money.  Once you get to your lair, you will be able to return to your lair for no cost.  Then you just run back to where ever you were when you died.  In general, the run back is not long for any place, so not a problem if you are a money scrooge.3. If you play all the quests, including most side quests, there is no need to grind for loot and leveling . Once you get further into the game, you can obtain a lot of loot by repeatedly killing certain mobs, bosses or champs, though in general there is no need to do this unless you want epic loot for all pieces of armour... and even more gold.  Gold is NOT difficult to come by.4. Your ghost, Lady Katarina, can be setup to pick up items for you.  Any items like potions and gold will be picked up on YOUR behalf.  So you will auto receive the items she gets.  She just saves you the inconvenience of going to collect them at times.  If you want her to actually use healing potions herself, you must specifically give them to her, and they will go in her potion's inventory tab.  On the other hand, the armour and weapons she picks up will go into her inventory.Overall, the game is fun, with some humour thrown in.  Make sure you get the DLC as it will give even more replayability.			"

												A great ARPG. Does everything we want from an ARPG title, and a bit more. Does have some flaw, but not a deal breaker. The first series of a trilogy. Review based on GOTY version as the based version might have other flaws as mentioned by other review.Pro Memorable companion. The ghost companion makes me feel like I'm not just going out to kill monster randomly. I’m out for an adventure. She’s a playful character and does make all those little things interesting by her quirky remarks. Quest system. The main quest system doesn’t differ much from any other ARPG, but the side quest is where it gets interesting. The game doesn’t use the standard exclamation-mark-quest-here for all quest. The quest might be out there hidden in the nearby area by interactable items. Once you get the item, read what the item tells you and look for any related items in the surrounding area. Tower defence mini game. The game manages to incorporate a tower defence game without slipping away from its main genre. You can’t fully rely on the traps provided thus you should deploy the trap tactically and let you yourself be the main defence. Unfortunately, there are not much chance to play this mini game and only playable depending on the storyline. The skill systems are well made. You have lots of build choice you can make. With the skill refund, you can change your playstyle midgame. The build might not be well balanced, but it might be just me, not good at creating a build.Con  Artificial difficulty. As other mention, the game uses artificial difficulty by employing a sheer number of enemies. I’m not saying the enemies design are bad, but you always need to fight with a sheer number of them, and by that I mean, a buttload of them up to the point that you can’t move due to being surrounded by them. It is not undefeatable though. Some skills are pure useless. The skill itself aren’t bad, but due to the artificial difficulty, some skills, especially single target skills are worthless. You’ll only use AOE skills or you won’t make it to kill each of the enemies one by one. The game feels pretty short. Granted that this is only the first part of a trilogy, but it does feels a bit short. Nevertheless, it makes you want to continue with the second instalment. Probably it’s not really a con point.  Some bug and glitches can still be seen. For example, the Mana per second for Ray of Destruction skill are listed as Skill.Common.ManaCostPerSecond. "

												One word: Katarina.  An amazing, funny and epically voiced companion who will add a lot of fun to your wondrous journey through Borgovia. More than once she made me smile with her smirky comments.There is abundance of references to other games and movies that are well placed and funny. The story is interesting and pulls you in more and more as you play, the combat on higher difficulty is actually challenging and you will find yourself dying more than once before you figure out a way to beat your enemy. As a first game in the series there are a few things that were a bit disappointing and some of them were even fixed later on in the second game:The traps are obsolete when you defending your lair on high difficulty; your own minions (if you chose to play this way) will trigger some of them; werewolf traps do not differentiate between you and the enemy and in most cases will get you killed.Once chosen, the difficulty cannot be changed.If you want to play with someone, you will have to invite a friend, because the multiplayer lobby is empty.You are given a very limited amount of skill points as you level up, placing the vast majority of perks and skills out of your reach so you will never have a chance to use them. I found myself using the same 3-4 skills/perks the entire game.That said, I enjoyed the game tremendously and maybe you will too...			"

												When I first played this game it had a sizeable number of bugsand a punishing difficulty, even on normal. But it was fun.Four playthroughs later, after using all three character classes; the game is a mix of Torchlight II in terms of mechanics and a steampunk-ish Dark Souls, with its keyboard-bashing AI swarmtactics and overpowered monsters thrown at the player.The game has its sizeable number of bugs trimmed down to'manageable' number of bugs with its patch history, but bugsremain. Some of the achievements do not unlock even whenall the prerequisites have been cleared, only to be unlocked in a separate playthrough with another character or when a level is loading between map screens.The writing in the game is, well; incredible. The introductorysequence alone leaves you wanting more with the variouslocations shown, but the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina doesn't feel out-of-place in the grimly rendered, industrial-gothic-overtoned world.With design elements from other great games and its own combination of witty black humor and quirkiness, theIncredible Adventures of Van Helsing stands out well, morethan the sum of its parts. Recommended, but due to the bugs, proceed with caution.			"

												I want to like this game. The writing is decent and enjoyable, the ambiance is interesting, and it has a pet system similar to Torchlight, but with more customization and leveling options.However, ultimately, in my experience, it devolves into a tedius grind at higher levels, where virtually every fight wound up being 'aggro group of enemies, kite for an unforgivably long time until all dead, run to next group of enemies', and I really can't overlook that. Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't been playing on Hard difficulty, but the lack of variation in enemy AI and length of time every enemy took to kill really wore on me.Go download some mods for Torchlight II if you want to reinvigorate your Diablo-like experience.

												The Incredible Lag of Van HelsingGenerally I don't write bad reviews about games, but this time I have to.The main reason why I give this game negative score is because the technical aspect of this game is on the same level as that garbage of this game's steampunk scenery:1. It is badly optimized2. Quests get bugged all the time3. Ability sets don't get saved4. The game tends to crash after minimizing itTo eleborate:1. You will need better hardware you think for this game to be playable, the recommended settings I can consider to be lies. Even if you tinker the settings to get FPS up, the game still suffers from annoying stuttering and screen-tearing. V-sync will dump your performance even more.2. Scripts, gate openings, cutscene launches after booses - such quest related things routinely fail to execute, but hey - the devs got a ""solution"", open chat and type ""/FixQuest"" then space and a number, which quest needs fixing... it is better than nothing but such cheap solution is an insult to paying users - why the hell wasn't the game released in a proper condition in the first place?3. Similar to other hack and slash games, you can switch between saved skill combinations, the thing is, they are resetting to basic attacks after each loading screen. I have asked about this, the support quickly replied and said they will look into this, kudos to them, but that problem actually happening was just another drop to my already aggravated patience.4. Oh, another quest bugged? Just Google, which quest number should be entered now for the command, you minimize the game and it crashes...Even apart from technical problems, there are other things:1. The fights in this game get extremely overwhelming, you are attacked by a lot of enemies at once who charge at you from large distances, in some areas the enemies simply keep respawning indefinitely after you've killed a wave...2. Abilities feel they have low impact. Nothing you throw makes a lot of difference, in most of the game you'll be orb-dancing and spamming ranged attacks, constantly drinking potions and waiting for Katarina to respawn.3. Katarina doesn't understand the concept of tactical retreat. You can adjust her combat behaviour but it doesn't make any noticable difference.Now positive qualities:1. Humour. There are funny situations and interesting dialogues between the main character and Katarina - the ghost companion.2. Visuals.The game does look good, despite unreasonably high actual system requirements.Note that if the technical part of this game would be fine, I would give this game positive rating, there certainly are some interesting ideas and nice sceneries, however - in the condition how it is now I just cannot recommend anyone to pay for this.I am glad I bought this on sale, not for full price! And speaking of money - you can play only ONE class in this game, you are asked to buy DLC if you want other classes...It is NOT worth the money!			"

												I bought this game to play multiplayer with my girlfriend, after we beat Diablo 3. Honestly, it was some of the most frustrating gaming I've ever experienced, and if it wasn't for the fact that not many other games of this genre exist, I would've uninstalled it ages ago.Pros:- nice atmosphere and art- interesting character builds- decent story and voice acting- the game looks great and runs pretty well - no sudden slowdowns or anything like thatCons:- frequent crashing/locking up when doing scene transitions, to the point where we were lucky to play 2h at a time- frequent bugs that interrupt the gameplay (ie you are dead and can't respawn, or you respawn in your home-base but are dead and need resurrecting *in the base*)- bugs that break missions (had en entire level bug out with no enemies spawning over multiple visits/session, broke the final boss quest 3 or 4 times)- ridiculous difficulty. maybe we were playing it wrong after Diablo but dying constantly on Casual difficulty was not fun- as a spellcaster, I had frequent lock-ups where a spell would remain stuck casting, so I couldn't cast any other spells and could not move - had to just wait to die and respawnNot sure how that stacks up in single-player since I was not interested in that aspect, so if you're never intending to play multiplayer read some other reviews. However, if you want to play multiplayer, I hope you have endless patience.			"

Due to the simple, unremarkable gameplay and graphics, you'll either like this game or not. It has a very complex character building system that will take exploration, reading, trial and error, and Googling to master. Despite getting stuck on multiple occasions, it kept me coming back until I beat it.Bear in mind I am not a hardcore commited player of this game who's spend hundreds of hours and is on a quest to beat it on the hardest difficulty. I enjoyed it, but the one-track gameplay of this game and others like it is just something I and I think a lot of casual gamers find it hard to get into.			"

												Solid entry in the ARPG genre.  If you've played Diablo, Torchlight, etc then you won't see too much that is new.  Random items, set/unique items, packs of champion monsters, fetch quests, enchanter NPCs, imbuing socketed items with various items, and so on.  My first time through, I played it on the harder difficulty so I got about 20 hours of game play out of it using the Hunter class.  There are additional modes like New Game+ (which they call neverending story) and Scenario where you have to complete maps with a timelimit while also achieving another task (never dropping below 50% health, looting all the corpses, or other things like that).Things I liked that may or may not appeal to veterans of the genre: When you disenchant something, you only remove the custom enchantment that was placed on it.  The item's base enchantments are not affected.  You can only enchant items once, so this is a nice balance.When you hover over an item, it tells you *exactly* how much better or worse it is compared to what you currently have.  It will show you impacts to spellpower, DPS, protection, Mana, HP, etc.If you put an essence in an item (the equivalent of a gem, element, etc that adds effects to your stuff), you can later pay to remove it without destroying the item or the essence.The only restrictions on item use are class and level.  So that thing that happens in other ARPGs where you're using the stat bonus on one item to allow you to use another item causing your stuff to become unwearable if you remove things in the wrong order doesn't happen.Respec'ing or reassigning ability points isn't an all or nothing process - there is standard cost to take back points or skills and you can play around with options on what you'll unlock before you are asked to confirm or cancel out.For a steam-punk/fantasy themed ARPG, Torchlight 1 and 2 are better, but if you can pick this one up on a sale like I did, you'll have some fun.

												This is a fun little ARPG. Without DLC there are effectively two options - swordy type or shooty type, and you can switch between them basically at will. Your ghostly companion can be set up as either range or melee as well. The combination is pretty cool.  I've had some success levelling my ghost up as a tank, and sitting back at range and using my guns to finish off opponents which are targeting her. There's also some limited magic which you can use for basic AoE attacks.Environments are nice. Maps tend to be pretty big, and the sort-of-steampunk atmosphere is a nice change.The voice acting is a bit hit-and-miss. The main characters are fine, but you'll bump into some real howlers early on who I suspect were voiced by the game's programmers.The game is a bit more story-driven than, for example, Diablo III seems to be. You get quests popping up all over the place, and finishing them isn't too much of a stretch. You do have to do a lot of kiting. More than I'm particularly comfortable with. You either get mobbed by a *LOT* of enemies, with no real way to damage more than one at a time... or you'll get one mob which takes a long time to kill, even though it's not particularly challenging.   This is a bit of a flaw, but it's not a major one, all things considered.I got this on special for $4, and it's well worth that. This holds up nicely, even given the fact that ARPGs aren't really all that hard to come by.It could do with more character/attack customisation (without DLC) and the loot system is a bit 'meh', but it seems to be a pretty solid, enjoyable game.

												Diablo like game, I started multiplayer so I guess I didn't have any tutorial which made it more diffcult...Obviously it's not all like diablo, so I am happy because there is a really nice experience.I will definitely update this review when I keep progressing the game.UPDATE 04.03.2016 part 1-------------------------------I got stuck yesterday. I didn't see half of NPC in Secret Lair. Tried everything...Had to do Old town once again, thanks god it was multiplayer so the other person had proper save...USEFUL INFO 04.03.2016--------------------------------------- The game doesn't have ""I want to play once again"" experience.Maybe with DLC, but... probably nah.MUSIC-----------So far music is really nice and calming.But repeative and does not make any athmosphere.ISSUES-------------My game sometimes freezes while I'm playing and I need to wait till it will pass.Music and everything is fine, just have 1 frame per 6 seconds...MORE INFO AND SPOILERS...------------------------------------------------I wish there could be more essence adding gemstones...And more possibilities to mix essences.And also more powerful weapons... Fighting those monsters take ages with weapon 20-35 dmg...I've got 6 different green set items, each and every one from a different set.And I can mix 3 items into 1 item, but I got nothing good anyway.You have companion that acts like pet from Torchlight.You have sets like in Diablo.-------------------------------------------------Update 04.03.2016 Part 2---------------------------------------------There are some problems with the game.Firstly it's freezeing for no reason sometimes...Secondly it's repeative.When I mean repeative...I mean really... annoyingly repeative.The futher You go, the more it feels like grinding.Not hack and slash. I didn't get any better weapon since good 10 lvls...And the drop isn't good either.From some quests both players get the same items with same stats...When you do quest twice.. Happend to me, because of the invisible NPC bug...You get the same thing, same stats from the same quests...It is trully a one time game...I will update.Update 06-03-2016------------------------------Yesterday I finished the game. And I was very unhappy that I couldn't lvl up more than 30 lvl.That nothing really good dropped, and   the last boss was too easy All that grinding for this? Well... Still 7/10. But probably wouldn't play again.So far 7/10			"

												I've been playing Diablo 3 a lot lately, and I got a tad bored with it, so I decided to finally fire up Van Helsing. At first I didn't like it, but it gets progressively better the more you play. It has a few unique twists and mechanics to the whole ARPG formula that I really like. It's not quite a fluid and fast paced as Diablo, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. Anyway, if you like ARPG's, then this is a no brainer.			"

												Van Helsing is an aRPG set in the mythical land of Borgovia. If you've played Grim Dawn, Diablo or Torchlight you'll be familiar with the gameplay. The game does have a unique ability system though, as you fight you gain rage which can be spent to powerup your abilities. For example lets say you're using a lightning spell, powering it up may cause enemies to be shocked, or it may increase the number of enemies hit. A powered up spell only has one charge and can be activated with the spacebar, although this becomes tedious very fast and I'd wager 99.9% of people have this set to auto cast whenever available. The game allows you to set up powerup presets so you can very much set it and forget it and the game will automatically boost the chosen ability(s) whenever you have sufficient rage. Apart from that it's your usual aRPG fare, you have a standard talent tree with forks and paths, passive abilities and stat points which allow you to customise your character further. When you create your character you have the choice of three classes, the Arcane Mechanic who is an engineer archetype, the Thaumaturge who is a mage and finally the Hunter who is the iconic poster child for the series. All classes can have two different weapon sets which can be swapped on the fly, and the Hunter can also specialise in either melee or range attacks.Throughout the game you're accompanied by your ghostly companion, Katarina. She works very much like the Torchlight pet, she can pick up items, fight for you and even be sent back to town to sell and buy which saves you the bother! She also has her own stats and talent tree, you can either build her to become stronger herself, or build her as a complete buff bot which will give you lots of powerful auras. Usefulness aside she's actually a big part of the game, and the banter between you and her is often really enjoyable, the voice acting for both Van Helsing and Katarina is top notch (the same can't be said for all the characters though!).The story will take around 15 hours to complete which is decent, but beyond that there's not much reason to continuing playing at max level. You do unlock scenarios which are basically dungeons with over levelled mobs which makes for a stiffer challenge and supposed higher rewards (I didn't get anything of worth) but there's no real point as the loot is lacking, which is a pretty big deal in an aRPG and why I didn't score the game higher. During my playthrough I saw a total of three legendary items and barely upgraded my gear at all, plus the items are all very generic and frankly boring. There was no excitement when an item dropped. You're also able to gamble for items with gold, but once again I never got anything of worth. I will say that this has been improved in the second game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II which I started after finishing the first game so I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed this massive flaw.Technically the game is fine, most quests have voice acting which isn't always a given for this genre, especially from the smaller studios, and while not perfect it is pretty funny at times and there are plenty of references to other games and TV shows which I enjoyed. Graphically the game is OK, it's a couple of years old and wouldn't have been anything to rave about back then, but it's fine, and it performs well, I was able to maintain 60fps on ultra without dips (as you'd expect from an older game on a GTX 970). The audio is decent and the voice acting is good for the main characters and acceptable for the supporting cast, the game doesn't take itself too seriously in this department and you will find yourself smiling throughout the game at the silly things that are said.Overall it's a decent aRPG with some major flaws that prevent it from being more than decent but if you can grab it at 75% off in a Steam sale I would say go ahead and buy it, you'll get your monies worth at that price and while it's not perfect, it is an enjoyable experience. The devs are also still supporting the game two years later, and plan to bring out a ""Final Cut"" of all three games with new features and a more streamlined experience, this will be free if you own all three games already. If you're interested in the series it may be smart to wait until September to play it as the Final Cut will be released then.6/10			"

												Recommend?  Just barely.Pros- Great environment- Good music- Decent voice acting- Defending your lair against waves of enemies- DLC - Lady Katarina and Thaumaturge class- Cool monsters to interact with - rat men, werewolves, and necrosCons- Story is a bit muddled.  Individual pieces make sense, but the overall theme gets lost.- Display issues.  Played on an older system with Nvidia GTX 560ti and it was almost unplayable with everything cranked down.  Upgraded to basically new everything and ran great with everything cranked to max though I would still login and have to restart my computer sometimes due to graphic bugs.- Level cap?!  So weird, they give you the option to have monsters respawn in areas you've cleared, etc. Got to end of the game and my level is capped, perks are capped, and I'm assuming Lady Katarina was capped too.  Lame.  Really killed replayability with that character on the different modes.- Crafting was needlessly complex for a top down RPG.  Let me combine A and B and get C.  Not A, B, C, with D to regulate this variable with E controlling something else.  I went straight to enchanting - pay a fee for a particular stat increase			"

												With GrimDawn, TorchLight 2 and TitanQuest Anniversary, its really hard to recommend this game.The fighting... feels sluggish and most of the time punishing. Commonly facing over 10 Werewolves or enemies at the same time which kill you as fast as looking at them, in normal difficulty, is not fun and the animation for executing skills are all slow and a bit sluggish.You will have to tweak the sounds properties since Music tends to opaque the sounds and voices.The age of this game... well I would not blame the age but the execution. Animations are sluggish but the killing time is freaking high when the monster attack you.Torchlight 1, the first game(2009), feels a lot better as a Diablo clone that this product(2013).			"

The game has a unique gothic atmosphere, a well designed character development system, dynamic combat, storyline with decisions to make and some tower defense elements.

												Exactly what it wants to be. Completely aware of what it is. A smoothly produced, atmospheric and thoroughly entertaining ARPG emphasising singleplayer, enjoyable quests and characters, and a focused experience. A single character and his ghostly partner (playing the role of a pet or minion, albeit with a strong personality and her own inventory, abilities and progression) romp across a neo-Transylvanian setting combing classic Gothic horror, Shelley's Frankenstein and Teslapunk/Steampunk aesthetics.I've not enjoyed any other traditional ARPG as much as this one - more challenging than Path of Exile, more varied and consistently entertaining than Diablo II, richer and far better presented than Titan Quest, and more involving than Torchlight.If you want some story, good writing and something a little more lively than the conventional grind in an exceedingly well made and satisfying ARPG, jump in. If you want to level mindlessly and play the game repeatedly in multiplayer, play something else.This crew deserve your money. - Jack			"

The mechanics aren't very original, and neither is the story - but it doesn't strive to be; the game clearly aims for enjoyment, and dry humour with multiple hidden (or not ;)) references to other games proves to be fun.I sincerely recommend this game if you like the genre, but also if you seek for an enjoyable experience :)			"

												Van Helsing was, to me, one of those games that was only pleasureful to play in c-op. I've started out playing it alone, but quickly grew tired of it. There isn't much holding this title up in terms of story or novel game mechanics. This is a classic, if a little simplistic RPG through and through. In co-op, however, I had the chance to play polar opposite builds with my gaming buddy which made for a more interesting, strategy-driven experience. Without this additional challenge, I wouldn't have found the incentive to ever finish this game. Your ghostly companion has a very enticing voice, though. All in all, I don't recommend it.			"

When you click on them your character starts running in opposite direction. There are lots of forum posts about this but no one has fixed it yet. "

There are also new gameplay mechanics makes it stand out from epic ARPGs like Diablo2. I recommend it to players who like Diablo but feeling like there are something wrong in Torchlight XD.			"

												Solid Hack&Slash, one of the better games of its kind that I've played. There's a lot of character advancement options, the writing is witty and fun, and the theme is pretty unique (a mixture of steampunk, gothic fiction and folklore undertones). Some slight innovations and experiments give the mechanics of this game a fresh and instantly recognizable feel.Despite many shortcomings and a general lack of polish in most places, fans of the genre should really check this one out. Keep in mind, however, that after finishing the campaign (which ends around the time you hit the level cap, which isn't too high at 30) there's not much left to do other than start a new character. A definite ending is a nice throwback to the original Diablo and personally, I enjoyed the fact that I can actually complete this game and it will acknowledge that, but I know that this may be an issue for many die-hard fans of the genre.

Katarina is pure awesomeness, loved her character!For me the game lacks a bit in info/hints/helps. It should at least teach you the basics enchancing/essences, although it is pretty easy to get the hang of it, i didn't have a problem with it but it's not friendly for new players into ARPG's.Also i didn't like the ending and i expected it to be more difficult.Might update this when i try the 2 modes that unlocked!

												Action RPG, Diablo-like game.Quite fun, environment is beautiful. Quite a lot of stuff you can customize as well.As of now there are 3 different classes, each with 2 different ability/skill paths.Hunter: Name defines the class, melee cool sword abilities, ranged revolver or shotgun battles, pretty cool effetcs and abilities.(the only class ive played), the other two are a battle mage, and a ranged specialist. All classes also has a set of Auras, and a set of ""Tricks"", special abilities rather said. Each ability can be infused with ""rage"" which you get form killing monsters and enemies. With the rage you make an ability stronger by choosing between three different powerups. SUch as 50% more dmg, or 5% heal per enemy hit, or mroe targets hit. the Artifical intelligence is quite something, works much better than in D3 and Torchlight 2, give it special acessories and upgade its abilities, which you choose yourself, talking about your companion, is it wasnt clear enough.Nice Features:Gem cutting, enhancing, upgrading.Armor forging, combine for chance to get better item(Artifact forge).Inktravel (basicly teleport).Enchanting, disenchanting.up to 4 player MP online OR local.Nice storyline, as well as great humor thrown in here and there.Companion called katarina, has her own abilities and passives, has 3 different ""modes"", defend, guard, and caster.Great environment, clothes could have been more detailed but still fits into the game perfectly.Spell details are also quite nice, but could have had more work, compared to the detaield environment and enemy-models.You get to play as the legendary monster hunter Van Helsing.I really recommend this game, very fun and entertaining, tons of quests and items with a large variety of ""stats"".9/10 for its astonishing humor, environment, customizing capability and storyline.

If you dig Diablo and the world of Van Helsing then check this game out. It's a shorter romp, but well-worth the playthrough!			"

												Action RPG, Diablo-like game.Quite fun, environment is beautiful. Quite a lot of stuff you can customize as well.As of now there are 3 different classes, each with 2 different ability/skill paths.Hunter: Name defines the class, melee cool sword abilities, ranged revolver or shotgun battles, pretty cool effetcs and abilities.(the only class ive played), the other two are a battle mage, and a ranged specialist. All classes also has a set of Auras, and a set of ""Tricks"", special abilities rather said. Each ability can be infused with ""rage"" which you get form killing monsters and enemies. With the rage you make an ability stronger by choosing between three different powerups. SUch as 50% more dmg, or 5% heal per enemy hit, or mroe targets hit. the Artifical intelligence is quite something, works much better than in D3 and Torchlight 2, give it special acessories and upgade its abilities, which you choose yourself, talking about your companion, is it wasnt clear enough.Nice Features:Gem cutting, enhancing, upgrading.Armor forging, combine for chance to get better item(Artifact forge).Inktravel (basicly teleport).Enchanting, disenchanting.up to 4 player MP online OR local.Nice storyline, as well as great humor thrown in here and there.Companion called katarina, has her own abilities and passives, has 3 different ""modes"", defend, guard, and caster.Great environment, clothes could have been more detailed but still fits into the game perfectly.Spell details are also quite nice, but could have had more work, compared to the detaield environment and enemy-models.You get to play as the legendary monster hunter Van Helsing.I really recommend this game, very fun and entertaining, tons of quests and items with a large variety of ""stats"".9/10 for its astonishing humor, environment, customizing capability and storyline.

												Welcome Hunter!Lets start off with this, do you want another boring Diablo clone made by some crappy developer trying to make a quick buck? If so, you are in the wrong place my friend. Van Helsing takes Diablo and injects it with steroids. Action in every frame, loot in every crack, and death behind every corner. Van Helsing has the ability to blow Diablo out of the water, if it weren't for one thing: the Skill Tree. Cluttered, unmatching, and downright horrid. Yes, Ice + Water = Fire. Logic. If you can get past this little error, you will have an amazing journey collecting loot, fighting monsters, and laughing that hairy bum of yours off.Well, what are ya' waiting for!? Buy the damn game!			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by Van Helsing.  At it's core it is a typical action RPG, kill waves of varying enemies as you fight towards a boss all while collecting loot and skill points.  Although it does have a few unique features that make it stand out in certain ways, such as a lair defense game which has you defending your secret base from waves of enemies with traps you can upgrade and strategically place about.  The story is great it kept me interested up until the end.  The AI companion is actually incredibly useful, she has a ton of useful skill points and a ton of options for adjusting her behaviour.  This game is not as complex as other Action RPG's, Path of Exile for example.  In my opinion it doesn't have a lot of replay value after you complete the story, there's a neverending mode where you can farm for high level items and multiplayer for playing with friends for those that do want to keep going though.  Definately worth picking up, it's a great game that pretty much anybody should be able to enjoy.			"

												First time I heard about this game I thought it was a cheap Hack n Slash similiar to Frater or Space Hack (which weren't really any good). The promo trailer shows a character being put in a bullet hell, but with monsters instead of bullets. This seemed like a good idea to me, but still I was thinking this only happens in special areas/zones, or during some in-game events.Couldn't be more wrong as this game is as intense as it should be. You can fight a lot of monsters and develop your skills in a way that expands your gameplay. Even though the plot and characters aren't really ""the best"" this is still a very good, plain hack'n'slash game. It offers a lot for the price of 3,73€. You should really try it. I'm a Diablo fan and even though I wouldn't play this over Diablo, I would totally play it over games like Torchlight. This game just gives you this feeling of fighting evil at it's finest.♥♥♥♥.			"

												i  I recenly bought the game and i started palying it !! I have already play the Torchlight 2 and the Path of Exile , and i was kinda familiar for this game kind.. Well the game is really cool, it has a nice story , but i think it could be a bit deaper than it is now, but i guess that it will happen in The Sequel of the game that it comes.. The basic hero (hunder ) is ok , with some spells/skills be more powerfull than others , the melle is ok , but i prefered to play it on max range with guns... The good thing withthe game is that you can play it the way toy want it , it offers a great variety of gaming styes to chose what you really want.. I replayed as thaumaturge but this clas seemed a bit morre powerfull than the hunter....i dont know if this is my idea or not, but i finished the quest faster than the 1st time... Now i chosed the neverending story to find more chalenge in the game , which seems cool to me,, the ghost companion is a very good made implement in the game , and i ant to learn more about the lady..its on the high ights of thi game..the thing tha i dint like a lot is that i was 25-30 lvl and non of the items that i loot was good for me... i was with the same items from lvl 23 or so i think ,, which made the looot a very stupid thing... the only good thing bou t it in high levels is that you could selll them in high prises.. this continues in Neverending story.. i m still with the same item from before enter he mode, which is kinda stupid and boring..the replayability of the game  is pretty high and to be honnest is the first time in this kind of games tha i want to keep playing it .. also the achievments are kinda adictive i have to say, and i want to collect them alll.. the game ofc is not in the same level as Diablo 3 or POE but it is a great single play game that you hav to try if you are fan of those games!! Also the low prise helps in that, especially in dicount sales it costs 3-5 euro which is pretty cool if you thing the enjoyment that it will offer you...SO GUYS YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS GAME, IT WORTHS THE TIME AND THE MONEY			"

												A ton of fun. If you liked Titan Quest, this feels like a spiritual successor. It's not very long, guessing around 20 hours. I got it for less than $7 though, and that's a great value. I'll probably replay it at some point as well. I'd say it's easily worth the price at full price too. It feels more engaging than your typical isometric arpg, especially playing at higher difficulties. They made most of the abilities have combinations, so you're constantly doing things. Unless you're playing the game on an easier difficulty, it shouldn't be a matter of spamming a single ability over and over (which is nice compared to a majority of these style games).The leveling system feels nice. It's usually exciting to get a new level. There's also a reputation system, where you get to choose a new strong buff after gaining enough reputation. The reputation system felt a bit slow, though. I'm nearly at the end of the game and I've gotten around 6 levels in reputation. The loot system felt on-par with other games in this genre. I got the feeling that there weren't many ""set"" items, but that actually was a positive thing given the length of the game and it's focus on a single player experience. I was able to complete 2 sets in my playthrough. I usually don't like forced companions in these types of games, but I enjoyed the companion in this one. She had a lot of dialog, and actually felt helpful. She also buffs you as you level her up. There are side quests that give you unique items for the main Hunter class, but you can equip them on your companion if you're not a hunter.Overall, I had a ton of fun with this game, and I highly recommend it if it's on a sale or even if it's not. Just keep in mind isometric arpgs are not everyone's cup of tea.I did not try the multiplayer, so I cannot comment on that.			"

Bonus points for unbearably sassy lady ghost companion. I think she didn't say a single sarcasm-free sentence in game. Oh, and all these hidden (or not so much) references are nice touch.Recommended with some caution.			"

												This game is an action packed, button mashing, Werewolf horde of excitement. If you plan on getting this game make sure you have a good keyboard. It might be controller compatible, but it gets quite tedious and hard (you end up teleporting a lot when you don't mean to), so i suggest using a keyboard and setting all 92390280938902 key binds to things you will easily remember (even though I still don't know where everything is). There is a lot going on in this game, especially when trying to figure out what to do, what skills and spells to use, what to keep for your character and setting up your companion followers stuff too. This is a game you can't just jump right into and rule the world, it's confusing for new players, but don't give up on it because of the confusement, stick around, bash some buttons and eventually you will get the hang of it because it's a pretty cool game.Edit: Cool until you hit a bunch of bugged quests and can't go any further...

												Proof that Indie can be every bit as good as the best offerings from any AAA studio.  Great voice acting, great graphics, varied and interesting environments.Sit back for a glorious, monster-filled romp through Borgivia.  Yes, the game has a lot in common with Diablo and Titan Quest - but that's a good thing:  Obliterating hoards of monsters and bagging a ton of loot is fun!  The story isn't anything special, but is solid enough.  The skill tree allows you to develop some interesting character builds - swordsman, gunslinger, magic user, or anything in-between.  Mid-way through the game, you're able to re-spec your character or Katerina at will, which gives you a chance to experiment with the various skills & builds.  Aside from the occasional obscured camera, I didn't experience any bugs or performance issues (I'm running Win 8.0), although I have seen a few complaints from others.			"

												Decent ARPG. It can get pretty in depth with all the skills and stats which seems like it's geared more towards the experienced players in the genre. Game can be pretty fun but there are some difficulty spikes to over come at the beginning and then at the end. I didn't grind my character so that might have accounted for some difficulty. Did encounter some pretty significant bugs like getting stuck in an area, a map exit not working, and untextured enemies which is unfortunate this late after release, but hey a Sequel is coming out...

												I initially resisted buying this game because I thought it might be a lame movie tie-in game. However I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a very good arpg game. The game features standard arpg gameplay, well-adapted for using a controller. With dlc there are a few different classes, and different ways to build your character within those classes. The writing is good, with lots of clever banter between Van Helsing, his ghost companion, and sometimes the different characters you meet while adventuring. There are a few offbeat quests and amusing easter eggs to find. These touches help the game to stand out from the average hack n slash arpg. The action is top-notch. Mobs can be huge and overwhelming sometimes. The game definitely keeps you moving while in areas populated by enemies. This, combined with the large variety of monster types definitely keeps the game from getting repetitive. Monster respawn every time you leave an area. Fortunately the respawning can be turned off, and then can be turned on again if you feel you need to grind more xp before progressing further in the game. Overall I'd give the entire series an 8.5/10. This and its sequel are first class modern arpgs, just as good as Diablo III or Torchlight II.			"

Story seems to be decent at this point. The only complaint I have is the skill usage. I am playing the regular character and skills do not seem very dynamic so far. Also boosting  the skills with your rage is 50/50 for me. I can not decide if I like it yet. But I would give this game a 9/10 for its price. Get it and have fun.			"

												A great start to a new franchise and one of the funnest, and funniest dungeon crawler RPG's I have ever played. Van Helsing and Katarina have great chemistry and quip with eachother the entire game and there is also plenty of humor and jokes hidden throughout. There are a few issues with the game that do hurt my rating of it, though. First, for a dungeon crawler it is pretty short, but it was meant to be a trilogy. Second, the game is very, VERY unbalanced. When the game begins it's simple enough and fun to play, but once you are a couple of hours in the difficulty ramps up out of nowhere and you are constantly dieing and respawning every few minutes and this lasts the rest of the game. Enemies seem to do ungodly amounts of damage and your stats or equipment don't seem to make any difference in how much damage you take or deal. It makes for a very frustrating experience in an otherwise top-notch RPG. I highly recommend it for the cheap going price.			"

Many of the games that have great ranking are simply awful. the ones that get between 70%  and 80 usually find me at least liking them. It turns out after many years of casual gaming I dont like most of the games that are highly rated. This game is charming, fun, doesnt take itself to seriously, and has in my opinion very good characters and gameplay. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 72% I think, I give it a 9.5. its a fun game! like games should be.....good guys and bad guys, none of this always bad against worse guy.			"

I generally prefer to play any game with K+M but tried this with a controller and I must say I like it. The game itself is a bit buggy and preformance a bit iffy, but it's fun to play. It even got me to play some side quests and i only do that in games I truly enjoy. The graphics are decent, gameplay get's a bit repetitive toward the end and banter between Katalina and Van Helsing is truly delightful. All in all, i think it's worth a playtrough.			"

												Since some folks may look into puchasing these games individually as opposed to in the ""Final Cut"" edition which includes all 3 games, I'm going to also post a review of the individual games, taken from my Final Cut review with very slight modifications. I'm going to call this one Van Helsing I (while the sequels will be II and III, of course).Van Helsing I's content was great. I expected a garbage Diablo clone with a ghost following me around that wouldn't say anything and would be useless in regard to gameplay; just serving as a stand-in for a co-op partner because the game's balancing wasn't made for single player. Boy, was I wrong. That ghost companion is my favorite thing about all three games. Her name is Katarina, she's wonderfully voice-acted, is the best character in all three games, and she is snarky, funny, and great to have around for gameplay purposes, as she has three separate skill trees and levels up on her own. You can boost everything from boosting your hero's critical hit chance, to your Magic Find (item drop quality), to her own damage output, to her own HP, etc. She takes scenes that would be boring in any other game and injects personality and humor into them which make them either enjoyable or less unenjoyable than they would be without her. I cannot properly express how much I like Katarina. If I were given heaps of video game characters to pick from and could choose her, I dare say she would be in my overall top 10 favorite video game characters list.With Katarina out of the way, the environments in the first segment of Van Helsing I are all outdoors, looking nice with rocks, grass, snow, swampland, trees, etc. It wasn't horribly exciting, but the sheer competence of the combat for a ""Diablo clone"" took me by surprise. The maps were huge with plenty of monsters to fight, loot to pick up, hidden treasure and a fair number of side quests. By the time I finished the first big leg of Van Helsing I, I was getting a little tired of the outdoor areas. So what does the game do? It goes full-on steampunk. The guns and a few clockwork-soldier-looking-dudes in the wilderness had that vibes, sure, but I never expected a steampunk city with Van Helsing as the hero, but a ghost sidekick, monster allies, and scientist villains. It was cheesy and the vampire ally is practically a cartoon character, but it was all so lovable and fun. There were a significant number of references to movies, film, games, etc., but they never felt like ""too much"" to me, and added some levity to the game. The third act was more steampunk city, but the classier end of town, so it felt fresh.The final boss to Van Helsing I was pretty easy, but I'd rather have easy than insufferably hard, because I'm here to have fun, rather than prove something to myself or others. The ending is a to-be-continued sort of thing, but not a cliff-hanger by any means. I thoroughly enjoyed Van Helsing I's original release, and the version you can find in the Final Cut version of the game appealed a bit more to me, thanks to the new skill trees, though that's a matter of taste which could vary from player to player. I cannot speak of the co-op in the original version as I have not tried it, but if it is functional, then I would imagine it's quite fun as it was in the Final Cut version. This is a very good game, though depending on the price, you may wish to grab the Final Cut, even if only to play through the Van Helsing I segment and then quit the game without continuing due to the dip in quality from the sequels.

												Well, I have found that after choosing many games by the good reviews that reviewers tend to be a very picky lot. Many of the games that have great ranking are simply awful. the ones that get between 70%  and 80 usually find me at least liking them. It turns out after many years of casual gaming I dont like most of the games that are highly rated. This game is charming, fun, doesnt take itself to seriously, and has in my opinion very good characters and gameplay. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 72% I think, I give it a 9.5. its a fun game! like games should be.....good guys and bad guys, none of this always bad against worse guy.			"

												This game. Buy it. It's worth the full asking price - and that's high praise coming from me. The story is fantastic, drawing you in and making you want to play more just to find out what comes next. The music is soulful, and haunting; the graphics quite good. The game itself plays like Diablo and Torchlight, so if you've played either, you shouldn't have any problems with the controls and skill trees. The references to memes, other games, and popular culture are wide spread in this game. Everything from Ghostbusters to Portal and many more are alluded to here. The only gripe that I have about the game is that the end boss was too easy to beat. I had more difficulty beating a lower level boss than I did the final one. But then, I did play single player and on easy difficulty, which probably affected things a bit. My next play through will be multiplayer and on a higher difficulty setting, so it should be a bit more challenging the next time through. Again, this game is highly recommended.			"

So I never played same view games since I was toddle.2. I saw this game's trailer and the game third episode a really fair discount.3. I said ""All right, we live once"" so I bought first episode and started to play.4. I set game difficult hard because my diablo history and experience... and I felt the same feeling.5. Really good:- history and story line- skill tree- perks-the weapons and any of your equipment have not got durability like diablo-variable monsters-good graphic...etc.6. Bad:-to expensive healing potion :D-I am not experienced else mistake or bug.Summary:It worth it, you can BUY IT ANY TIME!!! :) AND HAVE FUN!			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of a number of games released in the last few years that succesfully tackles a popular but well-worn genre, and manages to be both faithful to the genre style, whilst streamlining the experience, leaving it feeling both new and deeply nostalgic at the same time. This game is one of the more fun isometric RPGs I've played, and I'd call myself a harsh critic of the genre. This and Torchlight 2 are probably my favourites, and share a lot in common in terms of updating and streamlining the experience. TIAVH is generally a well-made game, and despite some issues with player-character pathfinding, I can't really fault the production quality. It has wonderfully schlocky voice acting, humourous dialogue, lovely visuals, a deep, deep skill tree that you'll never completely discover in one playthorough, a streamlined inventory, tonnes of enemy types, plenty of wonderful locations, and LOTS of loot. The game also rewards you regularly with achievements, which keeps you pushing forward. With that being said, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that some of the clunkier core mechanics of the isometric RPG classics remain intact. Expect repetition, a relentless onslaught of enemies, lots of useless loot, and sharp, frustrating spikes in difficulty, particularly towards the last 25% of the game.While this does stick to a classic (and some might say tired) formula, the depth of the skill trees, the frequent validation by achievements, and the sheer personality of the characters and the world keep me playing onwards. Even with any gripes I have towards genre, I'd recommend this for full price, as the sheer depth of content will surely leave you feeling satisfied with your purchase. I hear that the sequel is even better, and I can't wait to play it!			"

												It's a fun game by itself but once you start comparing it to other ARPGs, Van Helsing doesn't quite match up.  The single player can be fun and monsters challenging but there are only so many play styles that will work.  With online co-op mode you might be able to specialize, but that is if you can even get online to work. Co-op frequently disconnected even after configuring everything.  If your looking for more diversity from a cookie-cutter dungeon style ARPG, look else where.  The limited abilities/spells also takes away from what this game could be.  For the price it's hard not to compare it to Path of Exile, and come up wanting with Van Helsing.tldr; Buy it for the single player, not the co-op, but don't spend more than $5.			"

												This game is a decent time killer and worth a sale price of about $5, but not really more than that. I'm gonna mark it as ""Not Recommended"" only because even though it is fun, has some decent comedy, and has very good intentions, there are just too many little issues to recommend someone buy this:1. The game has a massive bug with newer operating systems that causes it to crash every 15 mins of gameplay. There are workarounds (which I used) to avoid the crashes but it involves editing Windows Services. So if you are not comfortable with that avoid the game entirely.2. Some bugs remain even nearly 4 years after release date. It's sad because the developers seem active in the community, but are either unwilling or unable to fix glaring issues in the game. Nothing game-breaking, but definitely frustrating.3. The loot system is not very well balanced. It just tosses GOBS of loot at you constantly and you have to figure out which piece is good for your build. It's not perticularly hard to get anything you need ... in fact you'll probably find 12 copies of what you are looking for in any given outing. The ""Go Shopping"" option for your companion also doesn't help matters cause it means, unlike other ARPGs, you don't even have to prioritize what you pick up and what you leave behind. Just grab EVERYTHING and send your companion to sell what you don't want for you when you are full.4. For all the options they give you in character building the actual process of creating a survivable character is pretty linear. You could try and mix up the abilities but in the end you have some key things you will need and not enough points in an average playthrough to get that AND the other stuff that might be fun.5. Repetitive. Not much more to say here. ARPGs in general are repetitive, but I found this one even more so. Act 3 has some great base defense stuff added in, but it takes too long to get to that point and most people will be bored before that.Overall it is still a fun game and if you like ARPGs, have played all the better ones already, and are just looking for a new one ... then this is a good game for you. The caveat is, expect minor issues and get it on sale.			"

												There is so much incomplete stuff in this game. It's really pity. Nice maps, nice style, lots of monsters. But there are a lots of bugs, poor animation and empty scenario. The first part of the game was really promising. But it's so boring in the second half. Pointless tower-defence minigame, absolutely the same fights with new models of monsters, bad jokes and story about nothing. Critical bugs which make game unplayable. (To be honest developers are constantly fixing game, but even now there are errors.)I was playing for Arcane class, i think it was a mistake. It's DLC class and it's not truly integrated in game. Most items from quests was given for the hunter class, for example.But i don't feel be interested to replay this game with hunter or to open last skills in the arcane skill tree. There was couple funny easter eggs in game but that's all. And you can spend some hours killing monsters and waiting for a new bug, but game isn't so solid as Torchlight 2 or of course Diablo 3.			"

												Totally awesome action RPG. Without revealing too much of the story, you are the son of Van Helsing and aided by your ghostly companion Katarina, you travel to the distant land of Borgovia to rid the evil there. Gameplay reminds me a lot of Torchlight but the level of customization is a bit higher and the skill tree provides some nice upgrades. There is also a perk system which greatly enhances gameplay imo (depending on which perks you choose). Controls can be daunting at first, but as you go along and experiment with different skill sets, you will find the best option  that works for you. As previously mentioned, other classes are only available as a separate DLC, hence you should only buy this game as a full bundle (when it is on sale of course). The other DLCs add some much needed upgrades and modifications to an already cool game. Plus, when you've beaten this game you can import your character into The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 and continue the adventure! :D			"

												The incredible Adventures of Van Helsing ( an all dlc version review )This game offers you a choice of 3 different classes, each with a very solid selection of skills, first being a hunter which can actually be built in 3 different ways entirely on its own, or hybridized to your hearts content, having melee, ranged ( pistols and rifles ) and occult ( magic ) skills at his disposal.The second class is the Thaumaturge who is a pure spellcaster with plethora of skills at his disposal both offensive and control/support, all having their specific use, and the final class is a unique Arcane mechanic, having mine and grenade skills at his disposal, as well as gadgets and turrets.It is a very well done, unique and incredibly refreshing setting that this game is taking place in, there are no dwarves, no elfs, no typical fantasy arpg of which there is 16874 on the market and all look the same in the end.The game is set in a beautiful gothic noir setting with mythical, as well as mechanical creatures to be fought, and with exciting places to explore.Speaking about the monsters -They are designed well and look unique, there is swarms of them, so there is always alot of action, and thus, there is also tons of actually good loot, what more could you wish for, right?Speaking of loot, the itemization in this game is very well done. There is very typical item system of normal, magic, rare ( thus far the exact same as diablo II, including colors ) and finally epic and set items, which all have functionality like stat comparison to your equipped item, comparison to your followers equipped items ( more on that in a bit ) etc, a bit of a downside perhaps could be  that later on in the game, you may start getting lost in the constant stat comparations, because in this game it is fairly usual to be swapping items for new ones often.And what deserves a mention as well is that the devs were not afraid to actually let you drop or be rewarded with the epic items, one of my dislikes about other recent Arpg's is that you basically never get to see any of the highest tier items unless you farm for them for ages or play advanced game modes.This brings me to quest rewards, and money, since they go hand in hand.This is another area this game excels at. You get very, very good rewards even for sidequests you'd think were meaningless or not worth to bother with, being used to that from other, maybe even most rpg's.But in here, you are always rewarded with a rare item, sometimes in fact a unique ( epic ) one, with skill or stat points ( sometimes for you, sometimes for your follower ), and a decent sum of money, which are useful for quite alot of things as well.The experience reward for quests could I thought be higher, but then again, I reached the max level just playing the game normally, so there was no need for it then.And regarding money, another often overlooked area in other games, in here, you can then spend them upgrading your weapons, reseting your stat or skill points ( no other limits  for that then your money, awesome! ), gambling for items, and later on even improving the hideout where your character interacts with friendly npc's.Remember the mention of a follower? You indeed have one, bound to you by the storyline, and when I saw this, I was not happy about that, having experiences from most other games where followers are just constantly dead and useless.Not so in here, your follower, a ghost woman called Katarina has her own level progression with attribute points and 2 skill trees, one of which improves you by her actions/simply being with you, and the other purely improving her alone.This leaves incredible versatility and usefulness to her because you are completely free to make her an uberpowerful tank if you need it, and if it so happens she'd die, you can actually enable her to explode on death, usually clearing the whole mob of enemies that was attacking her.If you are melee, you are in turn completely free to make her your ranged support, or even if you so wish, to leave her out of the battle and just give you a permanent 10% dmg reduction.Furthermore, you could also tell her which items she would pick up ( if any ) and in which way should she attack your enemies, I wouldnt ask for more.Along Katarinas level up progression, and yours, which of course also lets you assign the typical attribute and skill points, there is more for your character than that. Much more.Along the regular skill tree ( or trees, for the Hunter class ), you also get an entire additional passive skill tree, which is in part unique and partially shared to/by all the classes, where you could choose from a number of passive skills two that you want to have active at all times.Want dmg reduction? Its there, want to heal Katarina with your attacks? Sure, and so much more.And thats still not all. There is an additional skill tree called ""tricks"" which you can also invest skill points, which are very useful active abilities like stopping the time, making 2 more katarinas temporarily to help you, or my spellcasters favourite, being able to burn all your mana for a massive explosion around him.Since the Thaumaturgist's spells are mainly focused on damage over time ( DoT ), this is a great tool to have for burst damage.Thought thats all? Nope, still not yet, because there are additionally perks too..You get those for killing big bosses and in general unusual monsters like veterans and champions, and they furthermore permanently improve your character to the point where you can choose to be impossible to be stopped in your tracks, or to not die when killed, and merely become incorporeal for several seconds.Now thats what I call a character progression, and to my best knowledge, I can honestly say it is unparalleled by any other single player Arpg's out there.The game as it is at the moment is imo a truly great experience free of any glitches or bugs, after being patched multiple times, which is incredibly impressive for a game studio so small that the final credits only rolled for about 1 single minute, no exaggeration.The game has very professional voice acting, as well as enjoyable music which deserves a mention, and the game is also full of very funny references to all kinds of things, including other games, of the same genre or otherwise, sometimes fairly hidden, sometimes very obvious.Some games may try to make jokes which dont fit in it, or some games just go full ""funny"" all the way, but what is impressive  about this game is that it manages to have an interesting, serious, believable world and atmosphere, and yet, effortlessly manages to include funny references in it that just make you smile..The games lenght is very solid 18 hours for one playthrough which is great, considering there are scenario mode and a game+ mode available as well, so replayability is great.Sumarry: An amazing action rpg game that has been a ton of pure fun thanks to its for a single player rpg unrivaled character development options, unique setting, fluent game mechanics that are clear and work exactly as youd expect at all times, and thanks to the constant rewards the game gives you which will never make you leave it for long until youve seen it all.And that would take at least a while.Highly recommended to get, the developers really deserve to be rewarded for a game this polished and with this many gameplay features.Rating: 89/100Pros:Unique settingCharacter developmentUseful followerItem types, customization optionsNpc functionalitiesGame's lasting appealSmart, funny referencesMade by a very small team, yet feeling as an AAA title forCons:Recycling of enemies in some levelsSometimes can become messy with swarms of enemies aroundStat comparing may feel a bit confusing "

I miss that about the new titles on the market... they are simply too easy ... here at least i have somewhat of a choice... but where are the times when you would spend hours and much thinking to pass a boss (.e.g. passing the Arrart Hill High Council in D2 was quite a thing for assassin, so was the Kurast for magician...). Keep the good work up.. and do keep the challange for those old timers  that do like to have a bit of hard time in game ;-)			"

												Its a dungeon crawler with the lore of Van Helsing, meaing werewolves, sience abominations, vampires, and kobolds. The lore and atmospheric setting of the game is excellent in my opinion. It reminds me of Diablo 2, without rune crafting, which is good since Diablo 2 was an amazing game. The combat sometimes lacks hit effects, meaning if you strike an enemy with just your sword there is a lack of hit effect/animation, however all-in-all the combat feels solid, and many of the spells have awesome animations. If you enjoy dungeon crawlers such as Diablo, Diablo 2 (Diablo 3 is crap), and Path of Exile then you will definitely enjoy this game. For those that do not know about dungeon crawlers, than I still recommend this game as it is very fun and may just be the game that gets you into this genre.			"

												Maybe I haven't played enough of it, but I haven't been all that impressed by it. It's well executed for what it is, but it feels a bit like someone took Diablo and slapped a steampunk skin on it. Since I've never actually been a fan of Diablo-style RPGs, it's not my cup of tea. Of course, since Diablo isn't my thing, either, this may well be a better execution of that style, I just don't know. Since it's not my taste, I don't think it's fair to give it a negative review.  It's very pretty, and the monsters and worldbuilding are very good, I just can't get into it.Edit 5/27/2015:I went and tried it out again, hoping that some time and different perspective would change my opinion. It didn't. I just can't get into it. A whole lot of it feels grimdark for the sake of grimdark, and there seems to be very little story other than ""genocide as many monsters as you can.""Overall, I'm just not impressed. Story is too shallow, too one-sided, and too focused on grimdark. It could stand to be a lot better. The mythology of Transylvania, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus is a lot deeper setting than this, and deserves a more thorough plot than ""kill everything that moves.""Also, why isn't there a female character option? Surely the progeny of the original Van Helsing could be either male or female and still kick plenty of monster butt.Also, I'm probably drunk while writing this edit. I feel that's just making me not pull any punches, but your mileage may vary.			"

												In the world of top down RPG's, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing adds some very interesting gameplay mechanics to the traditional Diablo, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege style gameplay. Set in the lore of Van Helsing this game provides fans of the fiction a interactive world that they can journey through with friends. While this is just the first part of the trilogy, it holds it's own against games like Diablo III and Path of Exile as a enjoyable adventure. I highly recommend this title to any fan of Action RPG's.Check out our Streams of Epic Adventure Episode 20 for a full look at this wonderful title.

												I had a lot of fun with this. It's somewhat derivative, but what isn't these days. That said, if you've played Torchlight II, then you shouldn't have any trouble with this one. There are some definite improvements, however. The voice acting is a constant source of amusement, while the puzzles were enough to keep me playing. I'd certainly recommend this one.Edit: While I have the Final Cut version as well, I think I'd still recommend playing each episode, individually. There were some changes made for Final Cut that, in my opinion, were not necessarily improvements.			"

												There's not a lot to say about Van Helsing, either good or bad. Despite the pleasing graphics, witty banter and good voice acting, Van Helsing tends to meander on a bit. That said, it's not an especially long game, and the time-tested ARPG system of challenging combat balanced out with a need for loot that works for your given playstyle, makes Van Helsing reasonably addicting anyhow. A good game for its price, held back by its own mediocrity, lack of skill variety, and short length. Still a must play for ARPG fans who want something new.			"

												This game is a ridiculous amount of fun. The graphics are nice, the soundtrack is really good, there is a lot of scope for customising your character with abilities and skills and there is some hysterical dialouge between characters. There are a few down-points; it can feel rather 'samey' with all the 'hack and slash' - though experimenting with the abilities can remedy this, and there are a few bugs, the most noticable one for me was when werewolf corpses kept following me around one particular map.Overall though this is a really charming game. Would definitely recommend.			"

												It is a decent game, Diablo fans are sure to like this one. Maps are nicely polished, controls are smooth and there is a Casual option to learn on. It is a little to detailed for me, but that does not mean it deserves a thumbs down. I will play this overtime and build a better understanding of the development system, but i am impressed with the detail put into the game. If you have a slower system, you may have to lower some settings a bit. I do wish the in game text was a bit bigger but there's probably an option for that somewhere i haven't messed around with yet.			"

												Being a sucker for top-down action-rpgs, i HAD to have this game on release, and I don't regret it one bit, even if it did take me forever to beat it. This game is a diablo style ARPG complete with tiered loot drops, character stat allocation, skill upgrades, and gems (essences) to put into slotted gear. There is even somewhat of a pet system. It is similar to Torchlight's, except your pet is your female busty-sidekick-follower. She has skills and stat points that you can upgrade, as well as limited gear allocation. There are only 3 Acts, which took me a total of 26 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty. And DAMN was it challenging at times. I experimented with various builds (its easy to respec your character stats AND skills) until I found the right one to deal with huge hoards of mobs. You are going to be dealing with a screen full of enemies for most of this game, and they're going to want to kill you. Combat ended up being me running in to nuke a hoard of enemies, using potions, and kiting back until potion cooldowns were up. Rinse and repeat. It sounds bad, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. IT was only this difficult because I was playing on the hardest difficulty. I prefer games of this genre to be challenging as hell.The story isn't anything spectacular, but the dialogue between the main character and his follower always made me smile. There is plenty humor in their banter, as well as the occaisional referential humor with quests.  I didn't try the multiplayer because I heard it was buggy. The graphics are ok and the music suits the game's style. TLDR: Great game. I recommend it to every fan of the Diablo genre.			"

												In a market filled with many games focused in loot and quests it may be hard for some games to get the recognition they deserve and with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I can honestly say that it was such a pleasant surprise that I hope it’s not something to go under your radar. As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing. The Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again. With the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you. It’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.  "

												Well worth the purchase for the somewhat meagar price tag.  Although I believe that comes with the fact that this game will be episodic, so take that with a grain of salt.  All in all a single playthrough offers closer to a dozen hours of gameplay.  Fans of the Torchlight series should feel right at home here with the pet mechanics, gambling, enchanting, and various secrets (and sometimes surprisingly deep) secrets scattered across the level.  If you can look past some of the early bugs, I'd highly recommend checking this one out. P.S. Thanks steagle.			"

However it has a better storyline, allows multiple builds of the main character, has cool defense missions, and all these elements combine to make a wonderful game that is a steal at $15.  It has co-op also in case you only play action RPGs in groups and is overall one of the best games I played in 2013.			"

The Vampire slayer Van Helsing is the most badass dude, and like me i am a big fan. I would recommened this game to anyone. I enjoyed playing it to the end and was sad to see it finished, will definatly play the second one and enjoy it as much as this and will buy the DLC's to even open up more for me to play the story again with a diffrent class XD, and also the art and terain and the scenary is amazing, if u are into that type of style which ever century it is from.

												A pretty darn good ARPG similar to that of Torchlight 2 in many facets, but in a different atmosphere.  The combat and abilities seem unique but vaguely similar to most other ARPG games.  The skill trees work a slight bit different than most and are somewhat akin to Path of Exile's.  I recommend this game for the entertaining and fun romp that it is.			"

												This is by far my favorite game I have EVER played on the PC!!  It has a very funny story, but still has depth to it. It is an action hack and slash. It is pure awesomeness. If you don't own this game, you should get it ASAP before the II comes out in April 2014. Buy this game now, don't think about it, just do it. NOW!!!!!!			"

												I was surprised by this title. It is reasonably well put together and enjoyable with great quips from the characters as you meander through the world. The quests are reasonable, although standard and they have a few scattered in the world as well. It is a bit more static than other games of this nature (At least up to the point I played) and I don't find the classes particularly gripping. The melee combat oriented Hunter, particularly, seems wildly unbalanced compared to the fellow wandering around with a flamethrower and his eyes closed and the purple outfit of the mage class just makes it something I want to put away.  It is worth a play, but only really if you're a Van Helsing fan or a regular ARPG type fanatic. "

												This is a solid Diablo-esque hack'n'slash game. Well worth the budget price. My only complaint is it falls victim to the Portal reference plague in the too late for a Portal reference world we live in. It's very misable so I'm not holding it against it too harshly. Surprisingly good humor otherwise going on in this one.			"

												Finished the story in around 10 hours on Normal with the Tathurmage and also tried to play with the other classes a little bit.Gameplay is a hit and miss. Point is you have to just kill the enemies before they get close, doesn't get any deeper than that. Some skills are OP, some are completely useless. Katarina can't tank because I do all the aggro. Lack of enemy variety. Skills don't feel that they have much impact (read=no flashy visual effect). etc etcThe atmosphere overall is good, though. I like the dialogue, music, and the environment, although don't expect anything close to AAA games' assets, but it's entertaining enough.I guess it's an okay game if you get it on a sale for around 2 dollariroos.Not a fan of ARPGs?

												In a market filled with many games focused in loot and quests it may be hard for some games to get the recognition they deserve and with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I can honestly say that it was such a pleasant surprise that I hope it’s not something to go under your radar. As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing. The Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again. With the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you. It’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.  "

												If you like Titan Quest and Dungeon Siege then this is for you! I will not really compare to D2 as it has no random maps. It is a more static world like Titan Quest. It is a nice game but with a lack of characters. Just 1 in fact unless you buy dlc's but even then you have a total of 3 and that's a little shy... I had fun playing it but it will take a while before i will again. The fact that your character stops leveling at level 30 hurted and leaves no room for advancement even if you play the game again with that caracter. Compared to a Titan Quest having 9 characters that can be combined in many ways kills this one.One thing that is really amazing is Katarina the ghost that fights along your side and is the same compared to the pets in Torchlight. She is so funny, I love the humor they have put in this game and is welcome to see more like these in future.Overall it's a good game with still bugs to fix and things to add like playable characters and much more Unique items or sets. Gameplay and graphics are great and hope they keep it for Van Helsing 2 (and perhaps 3,4 and 5 as announced)But compared to a game like Titan Quest it still lacks many things6/10 "

												Excellent action/adventure game in the spirit of Diablo II. Solid story, very fun NPC interaction, interesting monsters.  Skill tree is intuitive and combat has lots of options without requiring a massive amount of complexity.  The DLC as not been to my preference, but you should check that out on your own to decide.  The multiplayer really reminds me a great deal of Diablo II.Very playful, fun and very entertaining.  It took about 20 minutes to come up to speed, then 15 minutes to adapt the controls and options to my preferences, and then I was off to the races.  The skill trees are varied enough to allow for multiple character ""classes"" and then the 2 DLC options are also available.  The equipment has a wide range of randomized enchantments, with an additional enchant and ""gem slots"" available.Well designed, the gameplay is fluid and easy without being dull.  The story is strong and compelling, but leaves a bunch of exploration options so it does not feel railroaded.I recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy action games.			"

												Van Helsing is a very enjoyable hack and slash RPG. It may not offer endless replay value but you are almost certain to enjoy your first / second playthrough. So it offers 15-30 hours of fun at a very low price.PS. I do advise to buy the katarina DLC. It helps to keep her alive and thereby make the game more fun to play.+ good pace & difficulty level, lovely world with plenty of humor. Truly excellent item system offering just the right amount of loot to keep you playing just a little bit longer, if the Diablo III loot 2.0 is a bit like this, everybody will have a blast. - The graphics itself are rather decent, but the spell effects are not that impressive. Some games in the genre offer nearly endless replay value, in Van Helsing that is less the case. After 1 playtrough you have the feeling you have seen it all. The only reason to keep playing is the loot.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Complete Pack is a beautiful, isometric action-rpg that provides a challenging experience which has a sense of humor, an interesting companion system, satisfying combat, very buggy controller support, and some noteworthy differences from the base version.There's a lot of quirky referential humor in the game that I do not want to spoil here. Just make sure to explore everywhere and talk to everyone and... everything, especially in the first town. The world is not grim dark; it has a joke or two up its sleeve.Katarina, Van Helsing's companion, is very helpful and has very interesting ways to alter her behavior to fit your play style. She will level up with you and has her own set of skills, two with the DLC. You can also choose three different states for her which include ghost (peaceful), melee, and ranged. You can alter how aggressive she is with enemies. She can also pick up different items of varying rarities automatically according to player desires. I had her pick up all the gold, ignore the white items, pick up the magic items, and fight enemies in melee form. It is a neat feature that is greatly appreciated and should be present in more games with companions/followers.The combat requires you to pay attention and engage its systems if success interests you. The game has a combo system that alters how a skill can be used. For example, Earthquake, a spell that deals damage in a line, has three different power-ups that can be used in a combo: Brutal Stomp which adds 1.5 meters to the skill's width, Intense Shockwave which adds 30% more damage, and Scorching Fumes which burns everything hit for 10% of Van Helsing's Spellpower. You can spend skill points on the ones you want and organize them in whatever order. You stack up to three combos with the a, s, and d keys resulting in a very powerful skill waiting to be used. I went with 90% additional damage for Earthquake with a high critical chance build to great effect. I could have gone with 1.5 meters to width and 60% additional damage. Other skills have different power-ups available for experimentation. You will be working with Katarina to dispose of monsters while using tricks to change the flow of battle. I often used the one that freezes time to give myself a chance to observe the situation and line up Earthquake perfectly, especially when fighting extremely large groups.This game will test the average player's abilities, but the systems it has in place makes it forgiving and approachable. Despite dying a good dozen or so times during my time with the game, I only had to pay a bit of gold to resurrect and continue the battle against evil. There are also special npcs in towns that can refund skill points for both the player and Katarina should you want to try a different build or made a mistake in your allocations.Do not use a controller with this game. Playing this game with a controller resulted in a frustrating battle with the user interface. Looking at the skill power-ups wouldn't work for skills at the bottom of the page and laying down certain traps did not turn out very well. The combat experience works well enough, but the UI problems are severe enough to just stick with mouse and keyboard. The UI for mouse and keyboard results in faster interactions for everything and lets you properly look at all the information available. I spent fifteen hours with this game using the controller until I finally decided to stop torturing myself. The last four hours were blissful.Finally, the complete pack comes with three different pieces of DLC which includes an additional skill tree for Katarina known as Blue Blood and two more classes, Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic. The Blue Blood tree has some really powerful abilities that drastically change Katarina's performance. She could rival me in power and I do not know what I would have done without her. Blue Blood allows for major damage, health, and defense increases. It also gives her different passive spells that she can activate based on chance or even death for one of them (big explosion). It even adds an often used Trick called Ghostly Mirage which allows for two Katarina illusions that can deal damage. The two extra classes, basically a mage and a scientist/engineer, have one main skill tree and a heavily modified Tricks tree allowing for a different experience from the Hunter who wields swords and/or pistols with some magic. If the classes do not interest you, I still heavily recommend Blue Blood unless you want an extra challenging experience.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good action-rpg that should entertain those familiar with the genre. Again, I am heavily recommending to not use a controller with this game.			"

												There's not a lot to say about Van Helsing, either good or bad. Despite the pleasing graphics, witty banter and good voice acting, Van Helsing tends to meander on a bit. That said, it's not an especially long game, and the time-tested ARPG system of challenging combat balanced out with a need for loot that works for your given playstyle, makes Van Helsing reasonably addicting anyhow. A good game for its price, held back by its own mediocrity, lack of skill variety, and short length. Still a must play for ARPG fans who want something new.			"

												I really enjoyed ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.""  There's a lot to like: the atmosphere is great, Katerina is a wonderful snarky companion  (and she picks up my loot!) and the storyline is nice as well.  The game is rather short but bodes well for replay value.  The thing that bothered me the most was the constant freezing - this game would freeze a lot (read: almost every time) during heavy combat.  Quite, quite annoying.  Regardless, I still enjoyed the game enough to buy part II.			"

												Those who loved Diablo and Torchlight series this is the game to pick up. Though it has some faults in customisation area it delivers a solid ARPG gameplay and decent storyline. Graphics aren't bad either. Though bare in mind some stuff is locked behind DLC paywall and if you can't deal with that, go play Path of Exile. It has a large player base, better customisation and overall much superior game not to mention it's free.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this. It's somewhat derivative, but what isn't these days. That said, if you've played Torchlight II, then you shouldn't have any trouble with this one. There are some definite improvements, however. The voice acting is a constant source of amusement, while the puzzles were enough to keep me playing. I'd certainly recommend this one.Edit: While I have the Final Cut version as well, I think I'd still recommend playing each episode, individually. There were some changes made for Final Cut that, in my opinion, were not necessarily improvements.			"

												Its a dungeon crawler with the lore of Van Helsing, meaing werewolves, sience abominations, vampires, and kobolds. The lore and atmospheric setting of the game is excellent in my opinion. It reminds me of Diablo 2, without rune crafting, which is good since Diablo 2 was an amazing game. The combat sometimes lacks hit effects, meaning if you strike an enemy with just your sword there is a lack of hit effect/animation, however all-in-all the combat feels solid, and many of the spells have awesome animations. If you enjoy dungeon crawlers such as Diablo, Diablo 2 (Diablo 3 is crap), and Path of Exile then you will definitely enjoy this game. For those that do not know about dungeon crawlers, than I still recommend this game as it is very fun and may just be the game that gets you into this genre.			"

												In the world of top down RPG's, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing adds some very interesting gameplay mechanics to the traditional Diablo, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege style gameplay. Set in the lore of Van Helsing this game provides fans of the fiction a interactive world that they can journey through with friends. While this is just the first part of the trilogy, it holds it's own against games like Diablo III and Path of Exile as a enjoyable adventure. I highly recommend this title to any fan of Action RPG's.Check out our Streams of Epic Adventure Episode 20 for a full look at this wonderful title.

												This game is a ridiculous amount of fun. The graphics are nice, the soundtrack is really good, there is a lot of scope for customising your character with abilities and skills and there is some hysterical dialouge between characters. There are a few down-points; it can feel rather 'samey' with all the 'hack and slash' - though experimenting with the abilities can remedy this, and there are a few bugs, the most noticable one for me was when werewolf corpses kept following me around one particular map.Overall though this is a really charming game. Would definitely recommend.			"

												It is a decent game, Diablo fans are sure to like this one. Maps are nicely polished, controls are smooth and there is a Casual option to learn on. It is a little to detailed for me, but that does not mean it deserves a thumbs down. I will play this overtime and build a better understanding of the development system, but i am impressed with the detail put into the game. If you have a slower system, you may have to lower some settings a bit. I do wish the in game text was a bit bigger but there's probably an option for that somewhere i haven't messed around with yet.			"

												Van Helsing seemed like a pretty unoriginal but promising Diablo clone, but late in to the game tremendous technical issues caused constant CTDs (these are known issues - check the Steam discussions for proof of how common they are) and these literally prevented me from finishing the game. I couldn't have even if I'd wanted to. What's worse is that these are not new issues. These are known problems that the developer acknowledged but never bothered to fix.I will never buy another Neocore product again, not even on sale (which is how I purchased Van Helsing), and I do not wish their studio well.

But I can't recommend because if you want to dominate you have to play with a set of skills that honestly suck bawls, if your melee class you have to put all your points on body because eventually your gonna get destroyed by the damage the enemies dish out for defence etc.. and so and so forth with other builds.

												Tikrai vertas dėmesio žaidimas ARPG fanams. Tuo labiau žinant, kad jų šiais laikais labai nedaug ir išeina... Platus veikėjo tobulinimas: pačiam galima keisti statsus, kažkas panašaus į ""skill tree"", kuris susideda iš melee, ranged (šautuvai) ir magijos, visokie papildomi active/passive skillai ir beabėjo kalnai skirtingų itemų. Patiko kartais net juokingi dialogai su kitais NPC ar savo kompanjone, kuri yra išties naudinga (taip pat turi savo stat point'us, skill tree). Pirmą kartą įsijungęs nusprendžiau žaist ant HARD, tai galiu pasakyt, kad buvo tikrai nelengva iš pradžių kol pripratau... Na ir dabar nelengva. :D Žaidimas naudoja kiek kitokia skill sistemą nei įprasta QWER ar 1234, bet ją jau pamatysit patys (daug aiškint ir dar aišku nesuprasit nepamatę). :DŽodžiu, šitą rekomenduoju visiem fanam.

												If you want more from your regular hack-n-slash RPG than just... well, hack and slash monsters and demons; that is, if you also want some good story, beautiful looking landscapes, and a dense and unique atmosphere, then this one could be for you, since it possesses all these properties. But... who knows for sure? Maybe you want even more than that these days to be convinced, something new from an old genre. Let's see...Well...- How about a good - and we mean GOOD - soundtrack, that perfectly - and we mean PERFECTLY - matches with that said unique atmosphere? Yes?Check.- How about some really nice voice acting (most of the time, at least), with European accent and all? Ok? You know van Helsing's environment is Europe, right? You remember Bram Stocker? Without google, that is. I hope so.Ok, then, check.- How about some little puzzles with ancient, sacred pagan objects in the middle of some frightening bog, infested with demonic beasts trying to tear your hat - and your head inside it - mercilessly apart? How about fighting some blood-thirsty, hellish fiends that jump over you out of the blue, cause you're trying to retrieve some legendary, holy, long hidden relic? How about answering some riddles - yes, we said riddles - from enigmatic NPC's, to which a wrong answer could mean a quick, but no less painful death?Check those.- How about some funny moments that will put a smile on your foolish face: funny references to famous games, books, movies, and characters every now and then?Check this too.You want all that, don't you? Man, then this game is definitely for you! Just grab it now, cause it have it all, you fool!""Then it is perfect?"" you could ask. You know, no game is perfect.""So what's wrong with this one?"" Well... hum... let's see... Ah, yes! Some skills, mainly the melee ones, aren't flashy enough. Yes. That's it. They could be more flashy. Why not? Well, they are useful, they enhance your survivability, and they are fun to use and kill stuff with, but... not enough colourful lights onto the melee skills. The ranged skills are somewhat flashy, but the melee, not so much...Well...If that's not enough to keep you away from the game, then...But, to be fair, there's actually one more issue. Some people who played on easy or normal difficulty and rushed the main quest complained that the game is too short. They say 15 hours or so is too short. But... what game on easy or normal is not too short nowadays. After all, one one-shots almost anything stupid enough to cross one's way on those ""difficulties"". Our answer: stop playing on normal, you brainless cowards, and play games as they are supposed to be played! Your idiotic utterances do nothing but spread misinformation over the world of gaming!Just play The Incredible Adventures of van Helsing in no other difficulty than Heroic, which is the highest one, and you're on for a fantastic and rewarding adventure that will keep you busy for a good while.One more thing. Incredibly, this is an indie game, developed by some little known, small Hungarian group, and it's supposed to be the first part of a trilogy. So, give them your support for their making of this brilliant gem, if you like the game, and show them your interest in the subsequent ones.			"

												Van Helsing is an arpg fantasy game set in the not too distant past. You play as the son of Van Helsing and, like your father, you have a variety of spells, ranged weapons, and blade weapons at your disposal. The story isn’t great, but it’s also no worse than the stories in other arpgs. Van Helsing, the ghostly companion, and a few other notable characters have decent voice work, but the rest of the cast is plagued by lines likely composed by the programmers themselves. Most of the locations are graphically pleasing, but some appear slightly blurry (idk why???). The-game play is smooth and responsive; the enemies vary in aesthetics and behavior; and the progression system is elaborate and rewarding. Overall, the game at its core is great, but bugs, glitches, and oversights (see comment section) compound to drastically ravage the overall experience.

												This game is good. I really enjoyed it. I did not come across any bugs or things that i don't like in general. Not everybody likes this type of game (I personaly don't), but i wanted to give this one a spin, because it look a bit better than Diablo 3 and other games of this genre. It has that strange authentic feel between fantasy and history, which in my opinion make it somewhat more likable. I have heard and read, that the multiplayer sucks, but that isn' t that important for me. I think it gives a nice experience when you play singleplayer. I found some parts that were pretty challenging. For instance, when there is this huge group of monsters charging at you. Now THAT is scary! (and hard to deal with)The graphics are not the best, but they surely are nice. The lighting effects are really nice and give you a good feeling when you are in the wilderness.Overall i give this game a 8/10. If you like this type of games, DO NOT miss out on this one.+ it's nice to blow monsters up into litlle pieces of meat. :3			"

I've had plenty of fun with the game, especially once the online was fixed and I picked up the Thaumaturge. The DLC classes are a bit pricey, especially since they add a bit of much-needed diversity to the game, but the base content is by no means bad. Just a bit limited in your character options, especially for more than 2-3 people.The atmosphere and tone of the game is dark, but at the same time it's not. The dialouge is surprisingly entertaining, but not all that great. The back and forth with Katarina and the hunter is especially amusing. There are a few other humorous characters (like the priest in the village), but no one really THAT memorable.The combat is pretty standard fare for the genre, but it's not bad, or even bland. I'm not a Diablo 2 veteran or anything, so I can't really say for sure how ""done-to-death"" this whole system is, but I enjoyed it.IT""S a good game. If you like ARPGs, or want to try them, it's not a bad one to pick up. Especially if it's on sale. Like it is right now.			"

												Shockkingly good Diablo-esque action-RPG. This game came out of nowhere. I picked it up in some bundle. It's an action-RPG with some really excellent character and graphics design and tight gameplay with a variety of weaponry and loot. The twist this time is that you have an AI companion (with good AI, don't worry) that's a ghost that accompanies you, along with clever dialogue. The horror/supernatural/early modern setting is also a bit different. Good dialogue, good story, good game.If you like Diablo-style games, buy now.			"

												The game Diablo III should be. I´ve played round about 30 hours by now and there where many dialogues where i had to laugh and it will be fun as well to play some hours more.If you love ARPG with a good atmosphere, many ways to play and even funny dialogues, Van Helsing is the game of your choice!

												Slice up werewolves, then shoot the faces off frog demons. Fun. Appropriately challenging on normal difficulty. Don't try to start on hard (like this guy)! If you seek a challenging experience, start with normal and you'll find challenging enemies soon.It's well written. The voice acting feels right. Characters are interesting. Katarina, your ghostly battle-buddy, chimes in with witty comments or advice at the right times, and these feel welcome (no Navi syndrome here). There's plenty of humor to be found in NPCs. There are plenty of nods to folklore and even historical figures (e.g., Elizabeth Bathory).Graphics and animations look satisfying enough, as of Summer, 2014 standards. Really, nobody should expect triple A visuals from an indie title. It does come pretty close.This hack 'n slash dungeon crawler takes some old elements of the genre: health/mana potions, stat points and skill trees, hordes of enemies, ect., and adds a few new elements. Not too many, though. This is still a dungeon crawler lootfest. Fans of the genre will be pleased. As for shortcomings, I have thus far found minor ones. Few bugs. Pathfinding is a minor issue at times. There is only one class in the default game (2 more with DLCs). Granted, this one class has plenty of customization; you can build Van Helsing mostly how you'd like. You can also customize Katarina's skills and stats, allowing her to cover weaknesses in your build, or to prop up your strengths even further. However, there is no significant tutorial system except a handful of control blurbs. As for how to build your character, you have to figure that out. Thankfully, there are plenty of respeccing opportunities; just pay an NPC some gold.			"

												This game is good. I really enjoyed it. I did not come across any bugs or things that i don't like in general. Not everybody likes this type of game (I personaly don't), but i wanted to give this one a spin, because it look a bit better than Diablo 3 and other games of this genre. It has that strange authentic feel between fantasy and history, which in my opinion make it somewhat more likable. I have heard and read, that the multiplayer sucks, but that isn' t that important for me. I think it gives a nice experience when you play singleplayer. I found some parts that were pretty challenging. For instance, when there is this huge group of monsters charging at you. Now THAT is scary! (and hard to deal with)The graphics are not the best, but they surely are nice. The lighting effects are really nice and give you a good feeling when you are in the wilderness.Overall i give this game a 8/10. If you like this type of games, DO NOT miss out on this one.+ it's nice to blow monsters up into litlle pieces of meat. :3			"

												I picked this up a few weeks ago on sale and so far, have greatly enjoyed it.  It's an action rpg with surprisingly good character chemsitry and voice acting.  The interactions between the protagonist and his ghostly companion are well acted and entertaining.  The companion helps in combat, either through a ranged form, melee form, or passive form that grants you 10% damage resistance.The skill system (for the primary Hunter character) is divided into 4 parts.  Melee, Ranged, Tricks, and Auras.  Melee and Ranged are self-explanatory.  Tricks give you spells that don't require mana but have a timer, that range from healing, to cloning your ghost, to ramming through your enemies.  Auras grant you passive improvements to your character.  One aspect I really enjoy of the skill system is the ability to upgrade your ghostly companion.  You can spec her to have skills that passively benefit you (such as increased magic find or defense) or enhance her damage and survivabilty. Combat is a bit diferent in that you can enhance your skills with adrenaline.  Each skill offers 3 different side-grades that you can enhance your attack with all at once (e.g., +30% damage, +10% damage resistance, +10% length) or dump all of your adrenaline into one for maximum effect (e.g, +90% damage).  The combinations are interesting and even the early skills remain viable throughout the game.  Combat can be irratating because you are constantly being swarmed by gangs of monsters, so the focus tends to be more on crowd control than anything else.  As you progress through the story, some monsters are downright brutal and can kill you very quickly if you are not careful.  The story is on par for the genre and the setting, while appropriately grim, isn't anything spectacular.  There are a few bugs here and there, so be forewarned.  At times, the game will hang, which can be really annoying.  Generally it clears up but I have had to force-quit on at least one occassion.With the vanilla pack, there is only the Hunter class.  While you can spec Van Helsing with all sorts of skills, if you want a pure magic based or technology based character, you will have to pay for them in separate DLC. Bottom line:  If you like action RPGS, you will like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  It's not perfect, but I think it has enough charm to help it stand out in the crowd.			"

You'll get lost in the great storyline, and the relationships that Van Helsing creates and already has, plus the Ink realms are a hoot. Yeah, some hack and slash grinding, and you'll always be able to re-spec your layout, which I found myself doing a couple times until I was comfortable with my build.The music can get a little boring, the graphics are nice, and Spoiler-Free: your ghostly companion is a hoot.Recommended if on sale and/or looking for a fun Top-Down Diablo II Clone!

												THIS GAME IMO:-incredible graphics. (For notebook or low spec pc, dont worry ! It can switch to dx9 or dx 11, and has very flexible graphics settings raging from very low to very high)-Voice acting feels like a movie.-Many, many geeky jokes. (you gotta find them by talking to some npcs, reading some stuff, or passing by some areas)-Katarina is funny as hell. (She is your companion)-You are a descendant from the Legendary Van hellsing the Monster Hunter.-The game has many hidden secret, side quests, voice acting, and lore to find.-You will feel badass progressing through the game and feel more powerful. (not like some other games i've played)-Quests aren't boring and most of them are fun/challeging)-the game is easy as hell on normal and easy settings, becomes normal on hard, and challenging on heroic(which is the one i recommend).-The lore of this game is addictive and hell creative.-Has some steam-punk features which is very well made and adapted to this game.-It is a little repetitive but no exausting.-Quest have multiple ending, so the outcome might be different based on your choice.Conclusion i would give this game a 9/10.The gameplay is very good, nice, smooth and envolving music, good voice acting, great quests, and satisfactory lore(excellent beggining and ending).

												Played this game a bit now, got it on sale, but honestly it would have been worth it even if it wasn't. The game maps are expansive, detailed, and fun to run through. There is a good mix of character types and abilities, so you can certainly play to a specific style you prefer.There were some issues, one in particular, is a blank loading screen that occurs when setting the game is set to windowed mode (black screen would load and game would be unplayable). However, the fix to this was simple enough, load the game from its binary (/steamapps/common/<gameloc>) and set back to full screen, and everything was back up and running.Another issue was being unable to change camera angles, being unable to do so, was a bit off-putting but certainly not enough to keep me from enjoying the rest of the gameplay.As it stands I do highly recommend this game, as it is highly enjoyable and by and large well designed – overall, it was certainly an enjoyable experience.

												Its odd, the first thing i felt when i started it was a feeling of diablo, the way youre just running around gathering mobs, just to turn around and spam a AoE button :) There is not too many flaws in this game. BUT they could have made the tips a little better :) I found my self looking for how to activate my abilities, and I just coulndt.. theres a number system right above your abilities, and so far of what ive learned thats how many times you stack it. TO get the stack ability you need rage, and how do you get rage you ask? well you use youre normal attack, be it use of sword or rifle.The game is really adictive to a certain point. it highly lacks of replayability, as once you killed a creature, it stays killed forever. Some might find it better and more fitting to the story and stuff. but say if you needed cash, or a little exp to survive in the next area, *buzz wrong sound* youre wrong.... The only way to proceed in certain scenarios like that, is trial and error, respec, try and die, respec, try and win. Thats one of the few flaws this game has. but overall really good looking, awesome single player aspects (Havent played online, so wont review that part)Overall rating for this game would be a 7/10			"

												This game has its ups and downs, but all in all, it was a good ride.The atmosphere is well-presented, and it goes well with the musical score (which is even better). If you're an older gamer, or a movie aficionado, you're gonna love the ""one-liners"" and references made throughout the game.Now, let's focus on the negative sides of this little hack'n'slash treat. Even though it's been more than 2 years since its release, there are still quests that don't work, the camera is still a bit wonky, and the character pathfinding gets a bit confused from time to time.Oh, and the ending is a bit sudden. :D			"

												I adore this style of gaming and the fantasy theme calls to something within me. So when the game on sale I quickly clicked 'buy' and began my quest as a Van Helsing. So, what did I think (and still do as I have by no means completed it)?I FREAKING LOVE this game! The theme and back-drop to the game is spot on as you wade through hordes of all varieties of mythical monstrosities.  Graphically, the game delivers well and is pleasing to the eye. The voice acting for Van Helsing and Katarina (DLC) is superb. Really well done! The banter between them adds depth to their characters and is a real treat to hear. The musical score/sound effects are brilliant too and again adds to the immersion.Character customisation is varied and gives much choice to the three classes to choose from. Each gives a different way of combating the horrors that await.Loot... oh the loot. Much is to be gathered and acquired as one would expect from a game such as this. The game is fun to play, even more so with friends (or my dad in my case) but beware, the game (for me) can get addictive. I always feel I need to keep playing just to get that next item that will boost my DPS or to see what new enemies are lurking around the corner.For all its pros there are unfortunately some cons. Certain shrines cannot be activated, instead once clicked causes your character to wander trying to find it even though it's right in front of them, denying you an XP/DMG boost. With the Arcane Mechanic class (which I play and love burning monsters with) when I click over an enemy to attack, he wonders off, not knowing where it is. A pathing issue with this and the shrines I'm thinking.The worst issue (for me) is no matter how long I play for, be it five minutes or five hours, upon exiting the game my PC shows a CPU temperature warning. My PC is not old and boasts some high-end hardware so I was quite surprised when the message popped up. Never before have I seen such a message other than playing Skyrim (with mods and graphical enhancements) for almost an entire day straight, which is justified. These issues I have are not enough for me to stop playing, but it would be nice if they were resolved.9/10			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing from developer NeocoreGames is a action role-playing game, in the vein of the Diablo series. While the title's price would suggest it might be a bargain bin title, the actual truth is far different as the game contains an extensive amount of content that is polished and entertaining. While the game's scope might not be as large as other titles in the genre, the content easily consumes hours upon hours of time as gaining new loot and slaying monsters of all sorts is an addictive experience.The game's narrative has players partaking on a journey as the son of famous monster slayer Van Helsing along with a ghost companion named Lady Katarina.  Together you will explore  various locales in the gothic and magic-infused kingdom of Borgovia. Settings range from forests crawling with werewolves to dark city streets controlled by mechanized armies of soldiers. Each chapter provides the player with a hub base or town to buy and sell supplies as well as plenty of quests that require the aid of a monster slayer. While some quests incorporate puzzles and even tower defense elements, the majority of objectives have players slaying endless amounts of monsters.Much of the narrative's enjoyment can be contributed to the great dialogue exchanges between Helsing and Lady Katarina. One-liners and an assortment of sarcastic comments from each make both of them lovable characters throughout the game's narrative. It's not often in action role-playing games such as Diablo or Torchlight that the player's character has much of a personality other than their style in battle. It's a refreshing change that not just the main characters have great personalities in the game, but also much of the characters that players meet in the game's world.Veterans of the genre will immediately feel at home as standard mechanics for the genre are all in place. As you would expect players earn experience from slaying enemies and completing quests for use in upgrading their character's assortment of skills. The skill system is split into melee combat, ranged combat, and magical abilities, each of which contain both active and passive skills that can be leveled. Lady Katarina also contains her own assortment of skills that not only strengthen her combat and defense, but also abilities that aid Helsing both inside and outside of battles.Aside from completing a near endless amount of quests, players can spend their time crafting better weapons and equipment as well as upgrading their base's defenses in the game's later stages. As Helsing's role is a monster slayer, he is skilled in both melee and ranged combat enabling him to switch instantly between a sword and rifle or pistols.As with most action role-playing games, the major draw of battling enemies and completing quests is the drive to acquire more loot. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing delivers up to a degree as the game contains a wide assortment of weapons and gear to loot from fallen monsters. The one lacking area with the loot system is limited customization of the protagonist's appearance as most armor and clothing items differ only slightly from each other. The game doesn't disappoint with its visuals as all of the elements ranging from environments to monsters are both highly-detailed and polished. The variety of monsters remain satisfying through the narrative's course with players confronting enemies from werewolves to magical-based, mechanized soldiers. While the sound effects from exploding enemies to the howls of werewolves aren't anything special, the game's soundtrack sets the tone perfectly with an assortment of memorable tracks. The soundtrack works especially well with various environments in the game's world, which results in the perfect atmosphere for slaying monsters and collecting loot.It's not often that games are released containing such an extensive amount of content in addition to being highly-polished for such a low price. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing offers players both a satisfying and addictive experience over the course of its lengthy adventure. . The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a must-buy for fans of slaying monsters and acquiring masses of loot.			"

												I'd say if you don't care too much about lore, skip this first part of the van helsing series and go straight to part two to avoid a ton of headache. Multiplayer has a ton of compability issues with windows 10 among other major bugs. There is workarounds in the web but who wants to go through them just to get this game working?Other than that it's much like Van helsing 2 and I did enjoy playing van helsing 2 for about 40 hours until it ran completely out of content and loot.

												Diablo-style isometric games seem to be enjoying a rennaissance since Torchlight and in spite (or maybe because) of how abysmally shallow Diablo 3 was. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is another entrant in this category, but one that smartly does a few things differently than its contemporaries. I won't go as far as to say that it's necessarily better than my current fave, Torchlight 2, but it's DIFFERENT. And it does it well. If you've never played one of these, Torchlight (1 or 2) might be a better introduction, but for the money they're asking Van Helsing will do fine.Since I already made the Torchlight 2 comparison, I should stick with it. Gameplay is largely similar, but Van Helsing amps the utility of the companion character. This is a sharp-tongued ghost whose banter with Van Helsing brings in a smattering of levity in sometimes not so appropriate circumstances. While she has a bit less depth than the player character she brings her own skill trees, stats and gear to taylor her to your needs. Which is to say, for my heavy hitting ranged attacker I've specced her to be a 'tank', but she can set up for added damage or support as well. On top of that, Van Helsing has a set of aura skills which further refine the relationship between the two characters. This alone allows for a number of gameplay variety. Add to this a tower defense style subgame for even more fun and two DLC character classes for even more variety and you have a game that seldomly feels boring.But the real star to me is the setting of Van Helsing. Taking cues from the Hugh Jackman movie of the same name and not being afraid to reach deeply into a cliché vault, the game presents a turn of the century world full of fairy tale monsters, mythical beasts and mad scientists replete with clockwork soldiers and mutant troopers. As hinted at above the game often doesn't take itself too seriously and that is ultimately what makes the mixture work. While not as thought through as the backdrop of, say, Dishonored, it's a nice departure from the generic fantasy tropes you get in most any form of RPG to this day.The game is far from perfect, still plagued by bugs and balance issues and the way scenery fades out so as to not obstruct your view (or pops back in) can be pretty jarring. But for the price it's being sold at I find that perfectly acceptable. It's not like it's the 3rd part in an acclaimed series from a purported top studio that is a dumbed down version of its predecessor, it doesn't force you to be always online, has no attached con artistry like a cash auction house... you probably get the idea. For what it is, it's a rocking game.			"

												Personal Rating: 7.5 of 10Hack and Slash RPG game. Gameplay and mechanics is identical to Diablo and it comes with decent graphics and soundtrack. The developer has come a long way to patch and fix the game since its release but it still has tonnes of bugs. However, developers are still pretty much active to resolve them. The only drawback of the game is that the maps are not randomly generated hence reducing the replayability greatly.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing from developer NeocoreGames is a action role-playing game, in the vein of the Diablo series. While the title's price would suggest it might be a bargain bin title, the actual truth is far different as the game contains an extensive amount of content that is polished and entertaining. While the game's scope might not be as large as other titles in the genre, the content easily consumes hours upon hours of time as gaining new loot and slaying monsters of all sorts is an addictive experience.The game's narrative has players partaking on a journey as the son of famous monster slayer Van Helsing along with a ghost companion named Lady Katarina.  Together you will explore  various locales in the gothic and magic-infused kingdom of Borgovia. Settings range from forests crawling with werewolves to dark city streets controlled by mechanized armies of soldiers. Each chapter provides the player with a hub base or town to buy and sell supplies as well as plenty of quests that require the aid of a monster slayer. While some quests incorporate puzzles and even tower defense elements, the majority of objectives have players slaying endless amounts of monsters.Much of the narrative's enjoyment can be contributed to the great dialogue exchanges between Helsing and Lady Katarina. One-liners and an assortment of sarcastic comments from each make both of them lovable characters throughout the game's narrative. It's not often in action role-playing games such as Diablo or Torchlight that the player's character has much of a personality other than their style in battle. It's a refreshing change that not just the main characters have great personalities in the game, but also much of the characters that players meet in the game's world.Veterans of the genre will immediately feel at home as standard mechanics for the genre are all in place.

												I really love ARPGs and the way they play, that said I absolutely despise this game.I'm reccomending it because despite its major flaws it's still playable and has a great atmosphere, although you're very likely to get fed up with it and uninstall.I'll start this off by saying that all of its problems are caused by too many enemies at once, this game goes completely overboard in that department.Area of effect damage is a requirement, anything that does single target is next to useless here. The further you go into the game the larger the mob of enemies it constantly throws at you becomes, you can't even pick them off from a distance because chances are that the entire mob is going to react and come after you, and another thing to note is that your ranged attacks do not go over enemies which means all those high damage ranged enemies are safe behind the giant wall in your face. And on top of that some of them can heal other enemies, so you HAVE to kill them first.There is a perk that makes you atheral when your health runs out, you're going to find yourself getting a lot of useage out of that one. Along with that you're going to find yourself needing to heal constantly, so cooldown reduction is an absolute must so you can use heal often.I cannot even fathom playing the game class due the fact that there are enemies who drain your mana beyond faster than you can regenerate it even with mana potions, and this doesn't stop being a pain if with other classes, because all of your skills cost mana to use except your default skills.

												Well what can I say about this game. It's fun, it's not that long thankfully because the game can get redundant pretty quickly, especially if you have Unlimited Spawn selected like I did the first time I tried and gave up. It was only after a couple of years I learnd about that option (didn't see it the first time in the options) so I went back to play it and I actually enjoyed it much better.This is what I would call a low impact game. For me, something to play to relax and not worry about multiplayer chaos like CS-GO. If you like Neverwinter Nights, it's something like the same style of gameplay. There is a lot to learn about the game but unfortunately I didn't encourage myself to learn the spells and tricks that the player can use in the game. I played straight up, in your face combat. The only thing that I found that was a bit out of character of Van Helsing is that you are not fighting many werewolves. There are not vampires and classic monsters that we all know and love, though the story is based on mechanical monsters aspect. The beginning of the game does give you that vampire hunter feeling, but it doesn't last long. Still, if you are looking for a game to pass the time, this would be good for you.As always, I recommend on buying it on a discount. $5 on a Winter sale I think I got it.			"

												I struggled with my rating on this game. It's at once terrible and kind of addicting. The dialog straddles the line between downright bad and intentionally campy. It's tough to tell for sure whether they meant for it to be as bad as it was.As far as gameplay goes, it's a reasonable clone of Diablo mixed with some Torchlight. The lack of polish on the game was the deciding factor in giving it a Nay instead of Yay. Having the game simply end with no recognition that you've completed anything is tough to overlook. Add to that the MP crashing bugs and wonky key bindings and you have a take it/leave it game.			"

												Okey guys. If you like RPG's (Diablo, Neverwinternights, Torchlight, Dragon Age...etc) this game is jsut for you. It has cool story line full of different interesting quests and jokes. And jokes are really funny. + amazing sound + amazing details + cool upgrade system and, of course its gameplay. I did this game on nightmare(or whatever last lvl says), and i got tonn of pleasure. It wasn't so easy to make some quests,but that is all the point - hard game means emotional game. For example one achievement about killing Igor's (don't worry,not a  spoiler) worth a lot. You are trying to kill another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,while Igors try to kill you, that's unforgetable. Last time i was so happy after game'd ended - Dragon age 1-st (also nightmare). _______To summ up: buy it,feel it, listen to it. enjoy it			"

												A bit torn on reviewing this badly because while I played through the whole game and thought it was fun. It is an episodic A-rpg which I find really really lame. basically a good game if your just dipping your feet in action-rpg's but ultimately there are better choices in the genre. action-rpgs aren't games that you should complete then want to drop forever. If you want to play through the whole thing then your going to start shelling out tons of cash for something that should have been ONE complete game.overall, if your thinking about buying this. i would just do yourself a favor and pick up Grim Dawn or Torchlight 2 instead. even Diablo 3, which i don't like to support, would be a better choice.

												IAVH is a fun, solid game with a few problems that keeps it from rising above a 8/10.The Good:Now with 3 character classes, you are no longer stuck with one guy that does everything half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Classes are still rather plain being the melee, magic and ranged stereotypes. The skills the classes feature are mostly unique, with a small selection of them being repeats of skills other classes have.The perk system is fun and adds a unique feel to your character. Katarina the ghost WAS a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor addition. With all the patches and full dlc I feel she is actually worth putting into combat now. Having her tank damage and aggro for me has been rather effective, rather than before when she was dying in 5 hits while being built tanky. Loot drop rate is still really high, but the loot is much better and I find myself playing just to find the next drop. I've not used the glory system yet but it looks like a decent way to keep higher levels interested in their build.The Bad:Multiplayer community is tiny. You will rarely see more than 25 games during peak time, and as little as none during others. Rarely will the games be hosted in the US region. What this means is basically if you're in the US, you need friends to play this game with. Relying on random people from the internet is merely not enough. If you can get past the glaring lag, there's still many more issues that need to be addressed. As such, I can only recommend that if you pickup IAVH for the multiplayer, get your friends to do so as well, or don't get it at all. There are also technical problems with the graphical engine. Running IAVH on full settings produces BSOD extremely often. Although entirely capable of running the game maxed, I can't because of blue screens. Games released both before and after have no problem being maxed without technical problems. This is something that can be fixed, but there's no guarantee that it will be.Ultimately, I enjoy the game and I think you would too. If you must have multiplayer, but do not have any PC gaming buddies to play with, I'd pass over this one, random internet denizens will just not be enough.			"

												This game is a real bitter sweet one. It is both amazingly creative and the most lazy game ever.So lets play the sweet and bitter game. For everything good there is almost something equally bad about this game.This game has some REALLY cool monsters. If you have never seen Teslapunk before you are in for a fun suprise, however it is overshadowed by the excessive use of them and constant combat. I played on the middle difficulty and towards the end there are enemys that just take forever to put down, and they arnt even the ones that do good damage either so you end up kiting one enemy for almost a full minute even if you killed everything else.The Enviroments look amazing. Statues, monuments, temples and even the sewer level look very nice. However the plot makes it so you have to go back and do parts of the map over again to progress the story so you start to sigh as you do a level over again.The voice acting is very well done. The problem are the constant meme, references and pop culture get rather tiring cause you have heard them all before in something with a far better plot. Speaking of the plot the game starts out really interesting then kind of tapers off and then crashes and burns towards the end. I think the best way to describe this is the final boss.When you encounter him you have your confrontations something like this:""We finally have you! Why did you do all this?"" ""Why? Because I am evil! This is what I do. Your the good guy I am the bad guy."" Granted there are tons of 007 references and many other tropy things but that just sort of killed the illusion there had been a plot for me.Overall this game really has no replay value and I cant really say I would reccomend buying it because its just another Diablo style clone.

												The Complete Pack is not complete, they didn't include the Pre-order DLCs, instead they expect us to buy it directly from them.so that is already a big minus, because it can already be called as a fraud.Pro :- Graphics are good enough.- 360 controller are supported (for those that love to use gamepad)Con :- Can't easily switch between gamepad and K+M- Combat are not fluid enough- Poor Optimization.- The game somehow doesn't want to recognize the DLCs that i got from complete pack.- Story is crap- Complete pack is a fraud because not all DLCs are included.- Gameplay felt like a chore- Max Level is only 30, for an ARPG that is a big fail (i'm guessing they want to do Borderland style of level cap, but the game failed to take off).- There is still a lot of bugs (ex : i often had my lady katarina stuck a lot of time, and she can't seem to free herself).Conclusion :If you like chores, then this game is for you, otherwise stay away, but if you really dying to play an ARPG, then this game is decent enough.Overall i gave this game : 5.7 out of 10Reason : some of the cons can be fixed, if the dev willing to do it, but since it seems the Dev have started making the sequel,  chances are high that they are gonna abandon this game.@Dev : if you make a complete pack, include all DLCs, the ""Complete Pack"" = all DLCs included, and why not sell those preorder DLC in steam store too ? why hold it back ? this game is decent, but its nothing special.

												This game was fun for the first few levels. Then it turned into just another buton masher that does nothing but throw endless hordes of monsters at you with little story line to keep you interested. I paid  $5 for this game and felt like i wasted my time. I just finished half of the game and ended up uninstalling from my computer.			"

												I usaully dont reviews games, but this one caught my attention:1.Voice actng is average2. story is decant3. Gemplay elements are ok4. Side missions are creative, but broken5. Everything can one shoot you6. Some zones you cant leave you are forced to use town portal7. 60 potions will only last you for about a min8. The mobs have over 5 buffs and mini boses's have over 12... and that was all in the first area... later on they became so fast and area so narrow you cant even kite themDo i recommend this game; yes if you are bored and  got nothing better to dooh and if you think diablo 1 was hard, I recommend you trying this one out It will change your mind.I was playing on casual with a friend( who happened  to wrote his review right bellow me) and the scaling was on hard , and when we tried hard it was heroic... the expirence of hardcore is basicly right click delte save game file, because you will die on first incounter....if you are playing this for the sake of story save yourself time and patience and go watch a playtrough (if  anyone actualyl lasted for 70+h )DONT LISTEN TO THE GUY BELLOW ME  OR EVEN ME PLAY THIS GAME AND EXPEREINCE  THIS AMAZING ADVENTURE OF GLITCHINES!

												This is a very mediocre ""Diablo"" like game.  It borrows mechanics from many games and does them all poorly.  Leveling up isn't very interesting because all your skills ramp down so quickly.  For example, skill point 1 gets you +5% damage (meh).  Point 2 brings it to 7.5%, point 3 bring it to 8.5%, etc...  All skills work like this, so by the time you are level 20 or so, you have all the skills you want and leveling up just seems pointless.The combat isn't interesing either.  You can buff your powers by spending ""rage"" which you generate while fighting. Yet the same thing applies and the effects arn't worth the effort.  There are better games out there.   Titian Quest Gold,  Torchlight 1 and 2, and most certainly Diablo 3.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing played like any other hack and slash game on the market.  Really nothing new about it.  The game play and progression trees are both just fine.  The story was fairly interesting but again nothing really remarkable.  I enjoyed my first few hours of gameplay but became somewhat bored with the game and set it aside for awhile.  Recently I returned to the game in the hopes of finishing the story and being able to get a full impression of it.  Alas, it was not to be...This game quickly shows it's true colors if you visit the forums for the game.  Many of the quests are broken and need to be reset using console commands to complete them.  This is just lazy on the part of the Dev. team who created a sequel and couldn't be bothered to fix the first one.  You'll also find many people have had problems getting the game to even launch...anyway from my personal experience the game will no longer resume story when I click ""resume story"" just a wonderful crash to desktop.  After spending a few hours verifying the game cache on steam and even going as far as reinstalling the game and following all steps mentioned on the forums to fix the game.  I discovered that my save file was corrupted.  I can start a new character but at this point I'm far to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and dissapointed in the developer for not fixing all the bugs to the original game before making a sequel that will probably be just as bug ridden.Bottom Line__________________ AVOID THIS GAME.  There are numerous hack & slash games on the market that are far better so don't bother with this game it will just dissapoint and frustrate you.  It's quite unfortunate because I really wanted to like this game and was even planning on getting the sequel after finishing the first.  I doubt that will happen now.			"

												I always loved the Diablo type of games but it's actually pretty hard to play any other of them after trying Van Helsing because the interface, controls and general comfort of this game are just so good that you'll always want to go back to Van Helsing when you play any similar Action RPG. Be aware 'tho, that it's a pretty much a single player game since the multiplayer part is very buggy. If you don't mind and just want to have some solo fun definitely pick it up when it's on sale! The dev is working on Van Helsing 2 which will let you import your Character from the first game and by then the multiplayer will hopefully work as well ;)			"

												Enjoyable action RPG with many of the same features you would find in Diablo style games.  If you're looking for a good single player story, character customization options, and all around monster slaughtering goodness then this won't disappoint.I suggest getting the full pack that includes all of the DLC as it opens up a number of new classes, features for all of the classes, some new quests/areas, and equipment.  If you've enjoyed Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, or any of the other similar ARPG's this is a good one for you!Note, this is not a strong multiplayer game or something you can expect to invest a lot of time into.  You'll enjoy the story, level a character or two, and then be done with it forever.			"

												A rock solid Action RPG which borrows the right elements from its competitors and mixes it into something unique.The fighting switches fluently from ranged to close combat complete with different skill sets with the press of a button and can be quite taxing at times - even on normal - with hordes of canon fodder, champions and unique monster all with different and often synergizing abilities. To easen it up a little we have a battling companion at our side who doubles as a packmule (best known from Torchlight).Character development is fairly shallow with a handful of active and passive skills in the melee and ranged trees, some spells and some auras to choose from. While each skill has a couple of passive and activated power-ups, it's still nothing too dazzling and hard hitting combinations are obvious. Our ghost companion meanwhile just provides a couple of passive buffs like higher damage or resistance.The world is handmade and thoughtfully designed, offering beatifuly scenaries packed with interactions and secrets which invite you to explore the world off the main path and rewards you for it. The downside is, that it has very little replay value and infact after you're done with the story, you can either play a couple of challenges to find new loot and get some passive boni upon completion or start a New Game+ with your character against leveling monsters whereas you're left at the level cap.There are a few things to be wary of, though:Multiplayer seems still broken, some people experience plot stopping bugs (which thankfully are addressed very quickly and can be fixed ingame) and the game is badly optimized. Even with the recommended speccs, you'll experience input lag and frame rate drops which will ruin the experience at times.			"

At the beginning it might look ok, but once you get into it you are suprised at each corner, each mission and each fight, futhermore what makes this game even more beautiful is the glourious killing spree and the blood mess you do after each battle; wavws of never ending enemies, challenging boss fightes and intriguing stories and to not forget you beautiful and at the same time killer companion who will give you a good time.To conclude this is a game that I personaly advices you to try, come on there' s even a demo what coud you ask more, but seriously just play it and you will be suprised how much you will love this game.

												A supriseingly good action RPG with a setting distinct from most fantasy games with steampunk mixed with mythology barrowed from Universal monster movies and eastern Europe. Fast pace with huge groups of well animinated and imagiative monsters. Somewhat like Diablo 2 in it's loot system. Character building is deep and flexable though not every ability feels equally useful. The addition of a follower that can sell unneeded items for you and buy healing potions is nice without being new, though the flexbility offered by the ghostly companion is nice. Tower-defense like sections break things up nicely and don't overstay their welcome.			"

												Van Helsing is definately not a game without flaws, but for the most part they all seem to have counterpoints.  The lack of meaningful character customization is off-set by the tightly focused story-driven nature of the game.  The static maps kill replayability a bit, but also allow for better designed set pieces. The skill system is a shallow ocean- giving the illusion of depth but in order to be viable you really need to pick a set of a couple skills and pour all your points into them. I can't speak for the ranged tree as I primarily played melee, your choices are somewhat limited given the crazy mob density that this game throws at you- which, don't get me wrong, was definately a positive- but it means that you need abilities that will kill a lot of guys at once in order to keep from being overwhelmed or whittling guys down at a choke point one at a time for hours on end. Then, while you're doing that you realize you could just be Earthquaking all the guys in a row and be done 10 times quicker.In short, Van Helsing is worth the price of admission, especially if you can catch it on sale.  It's a fun, short romp that does what it advertises, just don't expect a Diablo/Torchlight/Path of Exile killer.			"

At the beginning it might look ok, but once you get into it you are suprised at each corner, each mission and each fight, futhermore what makes this game even more beautiful is the glourious killing spree and the blood mess you do after each battle; wavws of never ending enemies, challenging boss fightes and intriguing stories and to not forget you beautiful and at the same time killer companion who will give you a good time.To conclude this is a game that I personaly advices you to try, come on there' s even a demo what coud you ask more, but seriously just play it and you will be suprised how much you will love this game. Trust me...			"

												A supriseingly good action RPG with a setting distinct from most fantasy games with steampunk mixed with mythology barrowed from Universal monster movies and eastern Europe. Fast pace with huge groups of well animinated and imagiative monsters. Somewhat like Diablo 2 in it's loot system. Character building is deep and flexable though not every ability feels equally useful. The addition of a follower that can sell unneeded items for you and buy healing potions is nice without being new, though the flexbility offered by the ghostly companion is nice. Tower-defense like sections break things up nicely and don't overstay their welcome.			"

												Van Helsing is definately not a game without flaws, but for the most part they all seem to have counterpoints.  The lack of meaningful character customization is off-set by the tightly focused story-driven nature of the game.  The static maps kill replayability a bit, but also allow for better designed set pieces. The skill system is a shallow ocean- giving the illusion of depth but in order to be viable you really need to pick a set of a couple skills and pour all your points into them. I can't speak for the ranged tree as I primarily played melee, your choices are somewhat limited given the crazy mob density that this game throws at you- which, don't get me wrong, was definately a positive- but it means that you need abilities that will kill a lot of guys at once in order to keep from being overwhelmed or whittling guys down at a choke point one at a time for hours on end. Then, while you're doing that you realize you could just be Earthquaking all the guys in a row and be done 10 times quicker.In short, Van Helsing is worth the price of admission, especially if you can catch it on sale.  It's a fun, short romp that does what it advertises, just don't expect a Diablo/Torchlight/Path of Exile killer.			"

												After finishing Torchlight 2 I wanted to play something that looks alike. Finally, I got this game at sale with some friends of mine. At first sight everything seemed to be great: lots of skills and branches, very helpful assistant Catherine that can also level-up and has different builds. The first negative impression came on the first location after the town. My friend couldn’t load. After several changes of lobby leader and re-launching the game, the problem was solved. Ok, sh*t happens, nevermind. After a few hours one of  the characters reached 12 lvl and 99% and then stopped gaining any experience. After re-launching the game its level was 12 and 50%. Okaaay, let’s go forward. We all were 13 lvl, killed a boss on the quest location and…a miracle! Two characters stayed lvl 13 and the third one became lvl 5! He got 21 skill point and was unable to put on any clothes above his 5th lvl. This time re-launching didn’t help us at all, so after this I’ve lost any wish to continue playing this “fascinating” masterpiece. We’ll see what developers got at The incredible adventures of Van Helsing Final Cut.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a Hack 'N' Slay RPG.You are Van Helsing, a monster hunter.On your site is a hot evil ghost called Katarina.You traveled into a region called Borgova.Something evil is happening there and you have to find out what it is.Your way leads you through cities, forests, caves and many more things just to find the person who is responsible for everything.The gameplay is nice. Its like other Hack 'N' Slays like Diablo or Torchlight but it has a dark steampunk touch.I really like the whole design of the game, beats Diablo and Torchlight in my opinion.There is an incredible amount of weapons and accessoires.The game has a typical level up system which gives you skillpoints everytime you level up.Some items are also only usable when having a certain level.Furthermore there are bonuses for finishing certain quests like killing 100 werewolves or whatever.You can choose some bonuses from time to time.Nearly everything is also supported by Katarina.The enemy varity is pretty much actually. There are several groups of enemies and those have always different levels.Masters are the most dangerous. There are also veterans and others.Also there are some bosses ingame.People in the world might give you quests from time to time, nothing special but gives you a lot of loot.Loot is the best about this game anyway. Its addicting collecting loot.The difficult is higher than usual I think, at least I died several times even with using healing mage and a lot of potions.I played on Normal. I personally skilled myself on far fight. Isnt easy though because the monster approach you very fast.The Graphics are good for a game of that sort, nothing special though.But I really liked the whole design especially of the forest.It will also run on older PCs.I also have to say that the music of the game is really nice.I read that there is a soundtrack avaiable, but only for the second game.Should include the music from the first game too, I read.The game also has some sort of Multiplayer, didnt looked into it until now though.It has Coop which is nice, I will probably try it sometime.I have to say that I didnt awaited a lot of this game but I really started to love it.Its addicting and has a interesting story and design.Definitely a good game for Hack 'N' Slay fans.I will probably buy the second game earlier or later.I will give the game 8/10 points.

												Having finished Van Helsing in Heroic Hardcore with melee orientated setup, I can only say that it has been a worthy and enjoyable fill to my Diablo 2 addiction. The Blue Blood DLC helped a lot to clear up later levels which previously I found too hard (completed it by only reaching lvl28). Single playthrough took about 35 hours completing about 75% of achievements (could have been higher but gave up on achievements after aiming for the ""But they are so cute! one by not killing any Igors at all, until the very end when one died by accident having forgotten to switch Katarina to ethereal). Enjoyed the good graphics, very funny dialogue and a lot of action. My only disapointment was the let down felt once completed, with only a 30sec cinematic ending the game. TL;DR: I would highly recommend ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"" to anyone that is a fan of Diablo 2 type of games or anyone looking for an action/ hack and slash rpg adventure. "

												Pros: - cheap- simple- sometimes looks okay- setting not entirely cloned from Diablo seriesCons:- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting- 20GB for barely anything- you can lag as the host- crashes sometimes- items seem hardly relevant, skills are 99% of the damage- characters' looks hardly ever change by more than just tiny bits- terrible pathfinding and level design from hell- large portions of the game (2/3 classes...) only in a DLC- no difficulty scaling. You can play on casual and still get onehits throughout the game, but most of the time you just hold RMB and wait til it's over.It's an okay-ish game in its price range that would have needed some polishing. It looks mostly budget or dated, but still takes a lot more performance than what you get for in return. Could have been more.			"

The Incredible Adventures of Van HelsingRating: 7 / 10Fun Action-RPG in a nice and detailed steam-punk world. Maps are a bit big and pre-filled which makes the pace a bit slow as you cannot 'run' though these levels. Lots of interesting loot, lots of upgrade options for skills and abilities. Halfway an interesting twist as you have to defend and expand your hideout in a tower-defence like way. Shops could be better and the gameplay is a bit too linear for my taste. Still a big thumbs up for giving me a great time. (Not finished yet)			"

												TL:DR : go play Diablo, Sacred, Marvel heroes, Titan Quest or PoE instead...Like others bad HnS games, they try too hard to be like Diablo, but different than Diablo, which generally means that they fail at both. Van Helsing makes no exception. It feels like a bad gimmick made by people who don't understand the basic gameplay features of an HnS game :- stupid ""skill power up"" system that makes you feel like you're using the two same skills over and over.- incredibly bad balancing. I tried to continue my first game ( normal mode ) near the end of the story after not playing for months and just got killed again and again by a pack of werewolves, just outside the exit of the lair... Thought I wasn't used to the game anymore so I started a new character in casual, and the mobs are either a pice of cake and don't do any damage, or they are ultra resistants and kill me and Katarina in seconds...- fighting mechanics suck. It's either hold down the click until everyone is dead, or move, attack, move, attack, move, attack ad nauseam to avoid damage.- loot suck. Why is there blue and gold items if they are always worst than white ? Also most of the time I find items several levels over me and I can't use them, so they just clutter my inventory or I sell them, and then I'm undergeared.- we can find loot for DLC classes that we don't even have bought...- inventory is ridiculously small for a game with so much loot ( fortunately you can send Katarina to sell stuff, but having to fill her inventory every 5 min and then wait for her return is boring ).- the town portal brings you back to the city but you can't go back to where you came from... what's the point ? Those guys don't even know what a town portal is made for...- armor design is bland and barely noticeable anyway.- NOT ENOUGH RAGE ! ( due to the stupid ""auto power up"" option... who the hell got this idea ? )- the game randomly changes my resolution when I start.- Vsync either doesn't work or is deactivated after alt-tabbing.- the character gets stuck in invisible walls, and can't move when there are too many mobs on the screen. Thanksfully we can move with WASD, but even that sometimes doesn't help.- Katarina is completely useless even as a tank with all points in body/melee.- 99% of the mobs attack in close combat, so you get ganked if you play melee, and if you play ranged once Kat is out of combat...- the game made my PC totally freeze, had to hard reboot.- SPOILER : the final boss is lame and you don't even kill him, he just flees... all this for nothing.- and then you unlock the ""neverending"" mode, where mobs are big HP bags, you get one shot several times in a row by mobs that pull you toward them and stun you, you kinda don't get much XP and there is no reason to suffer through the whole game a second time anyway. Loot is still crap by the way.On the positive side :- the character moves fast enough- graphics and music are nice ( characters are ugly though )- lots of mobs- eastern Europe folklore- i like Katarina's sassy dialogue and the duo works well, even if Van Helsing doesn't have much personality for a hero... would be totally bland without Kat.

												With the plethora of options available to the modern ARPG connoisseur, Van Helsing finds itself an average product on a shelf packed with fantastic games at extremely reasonable prices. It's unfortunate, because I'm sure this game would've been considered great in 2004-2008. With Torchlight 2, Diablo 3, and Path of Exile easily available - all superior options, and all unique from each other - the generic and mediocre Van Helsing cannot be recommended in good conscience.

												Let me start by saying I haven't beaten this game yet, but at level 26, I'm far enough in to give a review. I'm going to list pros and cons and then expand upon them down below. I'm not really going to touch upon the story all that much.Pros:Story is alright (nothing special, but it's better than most of what you'll find these days)Nice level designGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Katarina is a pretty cool character Varied enemiesCons:Framerate tanks to below 30 in some areas if you can believe thatAI partner is uselessGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Very lame skilltree as a mageVoice acting is pretty lame (Van Helsing isn't too bad, Katarina is hit or miss and the rest of the NPC's are pretty bad)Combat is boringTo start off, you play as Van Helsing's son (yea, THE Van Helsing). Something is wrong in this city that your father cleared out years ago and you must save the day. You are accompanied by Katarina, a ghost who is bound to serve your family. She is your partner in combat and can either be a melee or ranged specialist. She also levels up and has her own skill tree.This game does a few things right. Level design is something you will notice upon loading up a new area. The areas you prod around in are generally large and look pretty good. So far I've been through a small village, forested areas, a mine, a sewer, secret laboratories, The Ink (kind of a take on The Fade from Dragon Age) and a big city. Each location has impressed me thus far. Also a plus is Katarina herself. Trudging around the game by yourself would get pretty boring. Her presence, combined with the banter she has with Van Helsing is decent enough to where the game doesn't feel so grindy. Also a plus are the various types of enemies with different abilities. The game groups up different enemies constantly, and some of the battles can be very tough.Unfortunately, for every thing this game does right, there's two things it does wrong. Firstly, the game tanks to below 30 FPS in certain areas. This is on a 4770k with 2x 7870 Myst Editions. It's happened in two areas so far. It's not in one little spot on the map, either. The framerate keeps tanking throughout the whole area. If I leave the area, I start getting great frames again. As soon as I go back in, it tanks again. I guess those areas were just very poorly optimized. Next, combat is weak at best. I am playing as a mage, and combat doesn't feel good at all. None of the spells you can unlock feel good/forceful, and some of them require you to keep clicking your mouse button to charge up a spell, draw a line on the screen for a wall of fire, etc. This wouldn't be such a problem if you weren't fighting 20+ enemies at a time, and if your AI partner was competent. Katarina is utterly useless. I thought setting her up as a melee specialist would let her tank damage and draw enemy aggro as I hit them from range with my spells. Not quite. Enemies run right by her as if she's not even there and book it straight at me. This leads to every battle turning into a StraCraft-esque kite-fest, which gets old, fast. To make matters worse, you cannot command Katarina to attack a target. You can setup behaviors for her where she'll attack your target, the weakest target, the most vulnerable target, or the target that is attacking you (which is all of them), but you can't click on a target for her to attack. This means you have to aggro the enemies yourself. Not a problem if you're playing a sword-wielding badass, but as a mage it's terrible.As I mentioned the game provides a challenge. Some of that is due to good enemy design, but most of it is artificial. Katarina being terrible and enemies running straight for you are the two biggest culprits of that artificial difficulty. Also contributing to this are some of the enemy groups you will run into. For instance, there is a part in a laboratory where you run into 6-7 Champion versions (the enemies have different tiers, Champion being the toughest) of this one enemy that has the ability to raise undead, trap you temporarily, form a temporary barrier, lay down an AOE poison spell, and an AOE spell that just drains your health as soon as you step into it. The fight went something like this. Step into area, trigger aggro on the 6-7 enemies, they cast raise undead to the 50+ rat-like corpses on the ground, use barrier so I can't go anywhere, use trap to hold me in place, cast poison or the other AOE spell on me while the rat things beat on me and I'm dead in seconds. I died 10+ times in that one place, due solely to how cheap the enemies were. This type of nonsense happens every now and again.When it comes down to it, I can't recommend this game. If only the combat matched the pretty visuals...			"

												I'd like to say in advance, I LOVE Steampunk games, I LOVE Hack 'n Slash, but most of all, I LOVE Van Helsing. This game is, in many ways, a fantastic one. The behavioral settings on Lady Katarina are interesting and helpful, the loot system is ok, the music and environment are great, and the voice acting is one of the best in Indie gaming history. The Drawback, however, is in the actual ""Hack 'n Slash"" part. This games Combat is HORRIBLE. and the reasons are that, one, you hold still and sit there everytime you attack which is annoying for ranged players and downright punishing for melee players. The other problem with combat is the fact that the game attacks your targets for you, meaning I, a ranged player, cannot chose which guy I'm gunna shoot at. Instead the game is gunna make me shoot the wolf instead of the wolf handler, or the boss. So I don't get to chose my targets which hurt melee players even more, because, unless they are lucky, can't Dps the highest damage monster and are forced to sit there and take hits from all the guys while they are stuck hit that Fricking wolf that deals no damage whatsoever. So those are the problems with combat. Other problems include the lack of tutorial on how the inventory and level ups and as well as specail attacks work. It wasn't a glaring problem since I am a Dark Souls player and don't need my hand held, but it took me a frustrating 10 Mins to figure out how to equip better gear. My final qualm is this. Why do I need to set what percentage of health Katarina needs to be at before she is allowed to drink a health potion? Just... why? At first I didn't know what it was so I set it to the max and then gave Katarina some health potions. We get into a fight and she downed all five health potions like they were tick-tacks. She then was complaining about her lack of Health potions and i replied ""Sweetheart, you drank those last five health potions at the speed of light. I'm not gunna give you anymore."" So that sums up why a am not going to recommend this game. As much is I like it and had fun, the glaringly painful combat ruined what could have been a really great tribute to Steampunk Hack 'n Slashes.			"

												Let me start by saying I haven't beaten this game yet, but at level 26, I'm far enough in to give a review. I'm going to list pros and cons and then expand upon them down below. I'm not really going to touch upon the story all that much.Pros:Story is alright (nothing special, but it's better than most of what you'll find these days)Nice level designGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Katarina is a pretty cool character Varied enemiesCons:Framerate tanks to below 30 in some areas if you can believe thatAI partner is uselessGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Very lame skilltree as a mageVoice acting is pretty lame (Van Helsing isn't too bad, Katarina is hit or miss and the rest of the NPC's are pretty bad)Combat is boringTo start off, you play as Van Helsing's son (yea, THE Van Helsing). Something is wrong in this city that your father cleared out years ago and you must save the day. You are accompanied by Katarina, a ghost who is bound to serve your family. She is your partner in combat and can either be a melee or ranged specialist. She also levels up and has her own skill tree.This game does a few things right. Level design is something you will notice upon loading up a new area. The areas you prod around in are generally large and look pretty good. So far I've been through a small village, forested areas, a mine, a sewer, secret laboratories, The Ink (kind of a take on The Fade from Dragon Age) and a big city. Each location has impressed me thus far. Also a plus is Katarina herself. Trudging around the game by yourself would get pretty boring. Her presence, combined with the banter she has with Van Helsing is decent enough to where the game doesn't feel so grindy. Also a plus are the various types of enemies with different abilities. The game groups up different enemies constantly, and some of the battles can be very tough.Unfortunately, for every thing this game does right, there's two things it does wrong. Firstly, the game tanks to below 30 FPS in certain areas. This is on a 4770k with 2x 7870 Myst Editions. It's happened in two areas so far. It's not in one little spot on the map, either. The framerate keeps tanking throughout the whole area. If I leave the area, I start getting great frames again. As soon as I go back in, it tanks again. I guess those areas were just very poorly optimized. Next, combat is weak at best. I am playing as a mage, and combat doesn't feel good at all. None of the spells you can unlock feel good/forceful, and some of them require you to keep clicking your mouse button to charge up a spell, draw a line on the screen for a wall of fire, etc. This wouldn't be such a problem if you weren't fighting 20+ enemies at a time, and if your AI partner was competent. Katarina is utterly useless. I thought setting her up as a melee specialist would let her tank damage and draw enemy aggro as I hit them from range with my spells. Not quite. Enemies run right by her as if she's not even there and book it straight at me. This leads to every battle turning into a StraCraft-esque kite-fest, which gets old, fast.

												The game is fun, but not that much of a challenge in normal mode. I topped the Max level of 30 before I reached the end scene. There is a ""crafting"" system letting you upgrade weapons and armours with powerful attributes.The environments (maps) are beautiful but not seamless. You use portals to enter/exit each map.I kept my weapons and armour updated and maxed out my primary weapon skills as early as possible and played it through in 20 hours. The campaign wasn't that much of a challenge and the supposed anti climax when defeating the last boss was more like ""what, was this all?""However, after playing the full campaign, a new mode is unlocked that gives more hardcore gaming.Overall, it gave me 20 hours of game play and after the campaign, you get bigger challenges.

												Van Helsing gets a couple of things right: the atmosphere is great, the graphics look pretty good and remind me of Diablo 2. Having a companion who is always cracking jokes, usually at your expense is also entertaining, I thought the voice acting was done quite well.As an ARPG though, this game is a disapointment. The main campain is rather short, you can easily finish it in 10 hours. Unlike other ARPG's, there is no grinding for better items or skills since there are no areas where enemies respawn and you will have visited almost every part of every area once you finish the game the first time. There is no reason to revisit it since there is no new game+ either.The one aspect of the game that really interested me was the tower defense element. Unfortunately this is also a disappointment as it does not fit into the story well and seems more tacked on, not only that but there are only two short tower defense parts in the whole game and no way to do any optional missions at all.Multiplayer doesn't work well, I've read many reports of people experiencing bugs and I also had a couple of problems when I tried it, quests getting stuck and similar problems. Another problem is that when a person in your party starts a bug you are forced to join after 5 seconds, even if you are in a dialogue with an NPC.			"

												If you really enjoyed Diablo or those type of games, it's worth checking this game out. The developers obviously cared about their finished product.If you're on the fence or you do not enjoy those games, do not try this. The first half of the game is pretty enjoyable, but after a while you either get so specialized and good with your skills that you are ripping stuff apart or it just feels downright repetitive, although that may just be a hallmark of this type of game's combat system.It's about 15 hours long, give or take a few hours depending on how quickly you move through it and how thorough you are. I played the entire game single player, so perhaps multiplayer is a completely different experience. If you plan on playing this alone though, unless you're really in love with this type of game, do not purchase it.			"

												To preface this, I won this on steamgifts.com.It took me about 16 hours to play through the entire game, I found it to be a decent ARPG. The story was very blah, simple. It had a ton of action though, and plenty of different ways I could have built my character. I decided to take a brawn approach with my character (side note... I have been doing that a lot recently... my most recent Skyrim character has been brute force kinda guy and my couple newest DnD characters have been Barbarians). This maybe where I struggled a bit, as I tried to max/min the character to a bit but still tried to get as many achievements as I could. This could have definitely tainted my experience with the game.Overall, I think the game controlled great, never cheated me or anything of that nature, and definitely had a fluid nature. I absolutely adored the fact that I could send my ghost back to town and she would just sell all my crap loot without the need to stop play. I think that is something more ARPGs could handle better, is the amount of loot you attain. But with that being said, I never had that ah ha moment where I just felt like a badass that could slay anything in my path or that I really accomplished anything in general. That with its perceived that it had a shallow system of progression melee or range with a few different types of kickers with the perk system. That's why I would give it a 3/5 stars, but if you are looking for some loot grabbing, enemy smashing, you could go much worse than Van Helsing here. "

												SNAPSHOTAn uninspired Diablo clone that does more wrong than it does right. I wish I had more to say here.OVERALL - 4.5 / 10PROS+ art is actually pretty goodCONS- extremely clunky movement / combat- ability point buy / upgrade system is extremely boring and lackluster- story and dialogue are cringe-worthy- lots of loading- $4 DLC single talent treesDETAILSWhile I really wanted to like this game, overall it just falls flat in all regards. From the beginning, Van Helsing has been fraught with bugs and a lack of anything going right. To start, multiplayer was completely inaccessible for the first 6-7 months after release, and many quests were bugged such that they could not be completed. Releasing an extremely buggy game: strike #1.Supposedly a lot of bugs have been fixed in the past 6 months, but this game was purchased specifically to play multiplayer at release and months went by with other (seemingly less important) bugs being fixed, and multiplayer is still not one of them. I have seen multiple instances of it being marked ""fixed"" in patch notes, only to find it is still as buggy as ever. Even without multiplayer, there are still a LOT of bugs that are easily found that stick out like sore thumbs. On top of this fact, DLC was apparently being worked on for the game starting after it was released, using vital manpower that should have been used to fix bugs to instead leave people that bought the game out in the cold. Focusing on future profits instead of fixing buggy products for current customers: strike #2.Turns out that all of the DLC (at this writing) just adds single talent trees to Van Helsing or the companion, Katarina, for a ""measly"" price of $4. Not only that, but items in the game drop that require the DLC, WITHOUT HAVING PURCHASED THE DLC. Thinking your customers are chumps with bags of money lying around: strike #3.Ranting aside, I can get past my personal issues with the motives of developers if the game is good, but I have to rack my brain for a while to just think of something nice to say. For a Diablo clone, it has about 1/10th of the content and customization of other games: there are no classes to choose from, the default talent trees (all 2 of them, one is a melee tree, the other is a ranged tree) are not viable to split putting points into unless you're playing on Easy difficulty, and each talent tree only has 8 abilities, of which you'll actually only use 3 or 4. There is no real diversity in any of the trees, either, especially since most of the abilities and upgrades are just terrible. The overall impression is that someone put way too much time and effort into making sure no single ability was powerful, even with upgrades, causing the entire combat experience to be extremely diluded. Given that Diablo clones are all about fun combat mechanics and getting loot, that should be enough to stay far away from this game. If that's your thing, though, feel free to keep reading.The gameplay of fighting enemies is in itself a chore: any ability that has any real power to it has a long cooldown, meaning that you'll spend most of your time using a basic attack that has no real flair to it. Combine that with the fact that Van Helsing's movements cause him to spend way too much time standing still when actually fighting and you have a game reminiscent of the time when ATARI made consoles and not just games. What's worse is that the clunkiness could potentially be overlooked if the abilities the player used actually looked good when fighting, but for the most part combat VFX are almost non-existent. Player abilities don’t really stand out from the rest of the world, and are so short lived that the player might wonder if they cast an ability at all. There are very few noticeable VFX from enemies, as well, and if they didn't actually have physical attack animations then I wouldn't even be sure they were attacking. A lot of times the player just seems to take damage when enemies are around, but because you fight almost everything in the game you just know to expect it.Although gameplay isn't everything, Van Helsing doesn't have much more to stand on. The dialogue between Van Helsing and his companion Katarina are terribly hokey and feels forced at all points. The art in the game is actually pretty good, but for the most part it’s all just static environments and doesn’t really engage the player at all, making it loses a lot of the potential it had at really being a “wow” moment. Because of this, some of the environments are actually very distracting and can be annoying to try and find things in, especially if there are quest-related objectives. Sound is never really my thing in games, and Van Helsing does nothing to change that. It is mostly just… there, although the constant dialogue / noises from friends and foes alike detract from whatever potential it had.I think that covers everything, hopefully it gives people a good look at what this game is actually all about. I, for one, will hopefully not be making the same mistake twice with this company, the lackluster game and their focus on money over content has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.			"

												okay here is the deal. Van helsing is proberly the worst of the diablo games that are out atm. The late game is very broken since mobs do huge amount of dmg and you can only use range weapens for that reason. The last few hours of this already short game, is a grind where nothing new really happends and where you just go around kiting all the time. My advice? Go buy Torchlight 2 or even Diablo 3 Reaper of souls, they are both much better and have many times more play time in them. (Btw your companion Katarina... she is really just more of a totem most of the game since she dies so quickly to anything past the 2nd act.Dont buy it, there are so many better dungeon crawlers out there.

												At this point, the game, while fun while it runs, is badly bugged with multiple quests not completing without workarounds. Presently I am stuck and unable to continue due to a well known and not fixed ""Defend the Lair"" bug. I can not recommend the game at this time. It's a shame, because the core mechanics are enjoyable. It's also incomprehensively large at 22 GB as a download for a ARPG.			"

												Just aweful! One of the worst games I have played. Story is great for putting you to sleep. The gamepay is just ""Mob them"" no strategy involved at all. I actually had a group of baddies that mobbed me and I kept respawning in the same spot so it was more of an annoyance than anything to respawn 100 times whilst I wasted wave after wave of baddies. Loot drops are nearly useless, I think every 150-200 drops I got something that might be useful on another character type. Speaking of character types, you only get one unless you buy the dlc... why on earth would you want to have more of this crappy game IDK! If you are allergic to money or just like mindless clicking this game would be great for you, if not don't waste the money.			"

												A standard top down RPG with some things different here and there.From what I've played of it, the normal difficulty is more like ""very hard"" and the easy is more like ""here, take this fancy loot and one shot these bad guys"".And thats just within the first hour of gameplay (between the two respective difficulty levels).  I don't mind a challenge.  On most games I go out of my way to pick the harder difficulty so that I don't fly through them.  But with this game, I've no choice.  The standard difficulty is so damn hard that I find it unplayable (and yes, unplayable within the first 30 mins!).People have had a lot of good to say about this game, so I won't judge just yet.  But the difficulty settings so far have me yearning for something in between a normal setting that rips you appart for not playing like a pro, and an easy difficulty that treats you as a fool.So far from what I've gathered, I'd rather spend my time playing Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.

												there is exactly one thing in this game that is incredible. no, it is not the adventures, it is the persistence with which the game tries to destroy your computer. my computer is pretty decent and allows me to run multiple high-end games simultaneously without any problems, but then this game came along and topped everything i have ever seen. this game not only manages to overheat my cpu, no, in addition to the cpu it also overheats the gpu and even the ♥♥♥♥ing motherboard. i am not sure how it accomplishes this amazing deed, considering that the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥- even if you turn the graphics down to lego levels, it still manages to incinerate your computer in less than 30 minutes. my extremely clever workaround for this is to quit the game after 20 minutes of playing, wait a minute for the components to cool down and then start the game again for another solid 20 minutes of i-am-not-even-sure-what-it-is-since-it-is-not-actually-fun. and don't you dare watch a twitch stream while playing, van helsing will be displeased by your disrespectfulness.

Achievement hunters will take varying amounts of time depending on what difficulty they choose at the start and whether or not they select hardcore mode, but should be aware that several achievements involve a great deal of grinding.  I took around 30 hours to get all of the achievements besides those related to hardcore mode and difficulty and those involving the greatest amount of grinding.SCORE:5 out of 10I happened to start playing this after an update that broke a few aspects of the game.  It took too long for the developers to address these issues and, even when they did, some remained.  For example, the Thaumaturge's blizzard skill is supposed to do a certain amount of damage in a small visible area on the screen, but instead causes massive (fatal) damage to all enemies within 2 screens of the player.  This can easily be abused to make every area and boss a joke.  I also found myself unable to complete a main quest because of a bug that prevents a quest item spawn, yet the only fix available is to actually type a command into the game.  The game has been out since May 2013 and the developers have gone on to make Van Helsing II, Van Helsing III, and a spin-off of the tower defense element of the game.  At this point, there is no excuse for persistent bugs and lazy fixes.Still, if these bugs were my only problem with the game, I would recommend it.  The trouble is that it's not particularly fun.  Gameplay consists of running from one mob of enemies to the next, using the same two or three skills again and again.  The game does feature a unique mechanic called Fury, which is gained by attacking enemies and spent to give skills unique buffs if the player has spent skill points on those buffs.  For example:  if the player uses skill points to unlock the flamethrower skill and additional skill points to unlock one of its 3-5 buffs, flamethrower might do 50% more damage or cause persistent fire damage to enemies if the buff is invoked.  However, the buff is also spent upon activation, meaning fury must be used to ready it again for any subsequent attack.  I found the system rather awkward to use because of all of the key presses involved, but others might enjoy it, so I list it neither as a pro nor a con.  In any case, it didn't change the nature or feel of the gameplay for me.The three unique bosses (one for the end of each act) offer something different, but only because the player has to first run around activating towers, completing a tower defense section, or destroying spawners first to have a good chance of killing them.  The developers apparently thought that the tower defense section of the second act was good enough to turn into a stand-alone game (Death Trap), but to me it seemed to drag on for too long.  It is like Orcs Must Die! (one of my favorite games) in the sense that the player places traps on tiles and is free to assist his traps in killing enemies, who can also target him.  However, the player must gather materials to place traps and also has a limit on how many can be placed.  The trap variety is decent, at least for what amounts to a mini-game, but in the interest of achievement hunting, I followed others' advice and used just one kind of trap:  the werewolf cage.  Perhaps the experience would have been more enjoyable if I had been more adventurous, but I doubt it.  The length of this section and the constant micromanagement with the player character, which I enjoyed in Orcs Must Die! but disliked here, just sapped any fun out of it.  And then I had to do it again for another quest.The story is arguably the biggest disappointment, as it merely amounts to a hunt for a one-dimensional villain who is out to hurt people.  There is no depth, minimal world-building, and no incentive to play apart from an interest in getting better weapons and putting points into skills, neither of which conveyed much of a sense of progression.  The player only gets enough points to max out a handful of skills, most of which both look and feel unimpressive, and the weapons all handle about the same way, with minimal boosts to damage as the player progresses.The cooperative aspect of the game was the biggest draw for me since I have a wife who occasionally likes to play.  Our first problem was getting the game to work:  even though her computer surpasses the minimum requirements and mine surpasses the recommended, we both got stuck on an endless initial loading screen.  Eventually I got it working, but it wasn't long before the next problem.  When we reached the second large map (Gallowsbog), the game lagged too much even on the lowest settings for her to be able to do anything at all.  I was forced to play the rest of the game on my own, without company to distract me from the game's other failures.After finishing the game, I had little interest in buying the next in the series.  After reading some of the reviews and glitch reports for both sequels, I lost what little interest I had left.For the tedious gameplay, poor optimization, unimpressive skills, and bugs that remain unfixed to this day, I give this game a 5 out of 10.

												If you are someone who plays games on a MAC, do not even bother buying this game. It should not be advertised as a MAC compatible game! Neocore has known about the problems concerning this game for years yet they refuse to fix them. The game looks terrible and is prone to frequent crashing. When changing the settings it is near impossible to see the change. The game will constantly be pixelated regardless of how you change the settings. Along with the blurry images which can be dealt with, the text size is so tiny that it is required for the player to either squint to make out what is being said or turn down the resolution, and even then the situation is barely improved.If you are looking for a new game to play on MAC, you are better off buying diablo, which is ported at a much better quality. The lack of support and seeming care of the development team is obvious. This game is not worth the money and time. I really wanted to enjoy this game but the blantent lack of care has lead me to have a distaste for this game. Van Helsing 2 also suffers from this lack of support, adopting all the problems from this game.Save your money.Don't buy this game.			"

												Good for hours of playtime, but not much else.  The storyline is forgettable, the voice-acting is okay, and the visuals are pretty decent for this style of game.  However, you will die multiple times even on normal, due to the fact that most enemies will simply swarm your character.  Even after lowering the graphics settings, my computer would lag to the point where it simply wouldn't register button presses, hence my character wouldn't use a crucial potion and died.  And died.  After beating the campaign you have the option to complete scenarios (aka, recycled levels from the game) to level up or start a new game with the same character.  I tried the latter and made it a short way into the story before giving up, as the difficulty is much greater on the new game plus.			"

												It is a generic version of Diablo 3, but fun, although a bit repetative. Great graphics, but the sound is oddly low. Great music. The problem is that unlike the other 105 games I have installed, it heats up my system big time, making the fan on my gpu go nuts after about an hour of play. Hotter than even a huge multiplayer game in BF4. And it's a GTX680, so that should never happen. I chalk it up to poor programming and it is no surprise since this game is very obviously not a AAA game.It is a very fun game, but only in short bursts. It gets very, very repetative quickly. Do not expect much when buying games that are cheap, do not expect much from this. However it is not a bad game and I have fun with it from time to time.6.5/10			"

												It's not as deep as Path of Exile, Diablo, or Titan Quest. The essence modification of gear can be interesting, but the builds mainly revolve around using two abilities. Thus, there's not really a lot of interesting decisions to be made. You basically just up your numbers and if you're on a harder difficulty, hope you can come up with a good build. All Hack and Slash ARPGs are pretty repetitive, but the good ones mask it well. Van Helsing masks it well for a while but not long enough.That said, Katarina is awesome. The interactions between her and Van Helsing kept me playing past the game's natural lifespan.			"

												I'm on the fence about recommending this game, as it does have its fun points.  If the game wasn't so riddled with bugs it would be a fun enough, controller driven, Diablo light.A decent game that is severely marred by bugs, and one of the worst inventory management schemes I think I've ever had to use.If you like ARPGs, you may still enjoy this game if you can get it cheap enough.  Being able to play an ARPG on the PC with a controller is the big draw to this game, at least for me.Be warned, there are some potentially game stopping bugs in the critical path.  There do seem to be various work arounds for many of these, but it's a bit of a crap shoot.			"

												Well, this is going to be a very opinionated review. It may be due to the fact that i am not a very big fan of this type of game, but i did not find this game very satisfying. Even buying it when it was 70% off still leaves me wishing i had my six dollars back. Upon entry into the game i instantly began comparing it to Diablo III because i absolutely enjoyed that game to the fullest, and upon a dissappointing few first moments, i decided to give it a try none the less. After playing for a couple of hours, gaining quite a few levels, it became unbearable. Again, taking into account I don't usually play this type of game, it was just bland. Yes it offered lots of hack and slash action but it seems like too much of a rip off of Diablo, except with less depth. The game offers very little customization, and seemingly similar talents, which in the end, just leaves you with a boring grind for gear to defeat the final boss... not very impressed. 3/10 in my eyes			"

												Surprisingly motivating, considering it's just a hack&shoot. Maybe it's the actual existence of a somewhat interesting story, maybe the tons of achievements.The character customization is interesting, too, though.You can choose whether to have respawning mobs or not for single player story.There are weapons that grow more powerful with use and stuff is sharable between your chars.There is some interesting variety in gameplay to shake up the relatively dull hack&shoot a bit.I play it on easy and it's still enjoyable.I got the game in a bundle though, not because I deliberately wanted to have it. Since Valve doesn't allow neutral reviews and I'm focusing on a certain downside that might be of interest to some people, I'll give this a negative one. (Really can't decide.)The amount of loot that drops in this game borders on trolling. There's too damn much loot, and the stats compare is a pain, not only because you have to do it for two characters, but because it's confusing and unreliable. A lot of the gametime tends to be about sorting out items.I think I'm only managing to keep playing it because of the achievements.(The game has a demo, so the rest you can derive from that.)- Terrain scrolling is far from being smooth. Considering the visual quality and my system, it's a bit sad. Fog even causes extreme framerate drops. This engine seems unoptimized.- Fakenook, Twitter and Youtube links on the main screen, hurting immersion. This is about as annoying as Youtubers saying ""like, comment, favorite and subscribe"" all the time.- And now the big issue right at the beginning:Rarely does a game bombard a personal firewall as much as this. It tries to connect to api.parse.com and amazonaws.com and oftentimes every half a second to mail.neocoregames.com (even after startup - it basically bombards your firewall permanently) and if you don't allow this stuff, then the game will freeze for several minutes before you even see the main menu.This is with a set block rule, mind you. And turning off my network is not an option since it's a Steam game. Unless you are willing to not care about the motivational factor of achievements. (Not sure whether they register in offline mode though. The game does have its own achievement UI.)First time it didn't switch to the resolution I selected, and since it can't switch it in-game, I had to wait yet another couple of minutes. I thought that would fix the ugly text, but it seems the game uses a web font without hinting, so even in native resolution text in the menus still looked ugly.Oh and if I alt-tab out of the game while it pauses with futile connection attempts, it might default to 640x480, requiring me to launch it yet again.And don't say ""Just let it connect."". I pay attention to what the software on my PC tries to do, since it's necessary these days.Most games with internet connectivity get the message and don't spam firewall logs like that and stop doing anything. Especially since I already have set a block rule.(Another game that has this kind of issue (even worse) is Super Meat Boy, although there the problem might have resolved itself somehow.)P.S.: The game is a real space waster. Its videos (intro, cutscene, outro) are present in ten different languages, and the difference is really just the audio track and the subtitles. Extremely clumsy way to do that. 149 MB English videos and 912 MB other-language versions. They could have used that space to provide lossless sounds instead of OGG for example.And the map files are present as separate huge versions for low, medium and high detail. Model files too. And both sometimes are of exactly the same size. (Otherwise it would probably be necessary data.)Then again, since this game has all files separately, if you need the space and only play on high detail, you can delete 6.42 GB of terrain data alone. This plus the video thing taken care of and the game has now 11.8 GB instead of 19.1 GB.			"

												It's a good action RPG.Combats are dynamic, many have an epic feel to them.However, that's the entire game - good smasher with no depth or much thought put into it: run around, kill, loot, level up (rediculous max out at Level 25).  (Try Dragon Age: Origins for comparison or Divinity II, to feel what a good RPG should be).More research into and respect toward Slavic Lore, Culture, Tradition, Mythology, and Folklore would make this game seem like it was made by serious and dedicated people, and not like it was made by teenagers whipped by the publisher to get your money.By Kiddies for Kiddies.  Half-baked and anticlimatic.			"

												The Incredible Adventures берет другим — подачей и оформлением. Охотник за нечистью очень приятно и литературно выражается, идеально сохраняя образ; его подруга каждые 15 минут выдает остроты; окружающие персонажи продуманы и прописаны настолько, чтобы каждая из отведенных им фраз звучала свежо и интересно. В этом смысле игру хочется сравнить, наверное, с Magicka — все не настолько абсурдно, но настолько же талантливо.Отличные диалоги накладываются на постоянное обновление места действия — каждые пару часов стиль игры радикально преображается. Просторные полянки сменяются многоуровневыми улочками, классические злые вороны вытесняются изощренными франкенштейнами, а сопровождается это обновлением цветовой гаммы и музыкальной темы. Саундтрек вообще хочется выделить отдельно — очень уж он приятен для малобюджетного проекта.			"

												Actually i wasn't expecting much from this game. I learned about it existence only four days ago. Read some preview and wasn't impressed. But i've learened to never trust someones opinion before trying something myself.Probably because i didn't expect much i really like the game now. I was surprised with the price on it. The game seemed like a solid project and they aren't usually cost as much :D I like visual style of the game. I'm pretty tired of ""childish"" colors in other games. Probably i'm not creating an uber build, but i like the fact that the game always keeps me focused otherwise it'll take only a few seconds to die. And one thing i like the most about the game is the story. I have no idea how it was intended to be told, but sometimes i just can't stop laughing. And that's i guess the main thing among many more that pushes me to go ahead, I can't wait for Van Helsing and Katarina to start talking with each other or someone else again. So far i gained from Van Helsing more fun that from Titan Quest, D3 and TL2 all together. I can't remember a single sentence said by anyone in those games, but i'm sure some phrases from Van Helsing will stay with me forever.			"

												Van Helsing trys to be serious with its pretty dark and grey steampunk citys. On the other hand you find a lot of humor in the characters. This works very well and gives you a good feeling while playing the game. The length of the campaign is okay with 10-12 hours. I finished the game twice, because the other character you can choose from ( if you own the dlcs) looked pretty interesting to me. Not a WOW game, but recommendable for everyone with a budget, since the game is very cheap. Personal rating 7 / 10			"

The character configuration screen is illegible and unusable, missing images and with text and mouseovers all over the place.That alone wouldn't make me sad; I like supporting indy developers and understand there may be some debugging involved. But then I tried to join their forums to report the problem, and the enrollment didn't work. When I eventually mailed them (with screenshots, diagnostics, etc.) I got one answer telling me to update my drivers, and then they went dark. Not cool.I guess I'll be reclaiming some much-needed hard drive space.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing looks like a great game. I was very excited to try this, and when it came up in the recent holiday sale, I nabbed it. Before buying, I verified that the game supports Mac and controllers. These top down games are some of my favorites, and I prefer the game controller to mouse and keyboard for them. Unfortunately, it seems that Mac is supported and controller is supported, but the two together are not supported. So I have not been able to play. I gave them almost four months to patch this issue, but, while other updates have been coming out, no fix for controllers on Macs has been seen. I won't buy another NeoCore game. I find their practices deceptive.			"

												BIG WARNING! I hate to write this review. The game itself looks great. The atmosphere and especially the ghost girl Katrina and her antics are soo cute. But what put me off and ask Steam for a refund within 30 minutes of gameplay is severe fps drops and comstant lag in single player mode itself.I am playing on ASUS ROG machine which runs almost any game at high/ultra settings but this 'normal' ARPG is causing pain in the butt. Obviously, the game isn't optimized at all with respect to performance. Even the graphics, its bit strange they look absoultely great when it comes to details but there is something missing feeling. It might have to do with washed out look and fuzzyness. Many times i have to wide open my eyes to read a text or see an item clearly. You won't be surprised to loose focus on your character when he is surronded by hoards of enemies. The shades are so washed out that everthing gets mixedup quite often.If you think the game suits you, buy it by all means and be prepared to ask for a refund incase your pc also has the same problems running this.

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

The character have personality that are very memorable and their designs matches their personality. Also the enemy are well design and well put in the enviroment.  the game play is good without belive and there are three classes to pick from and the campaign story is worth it.  The power up are beautiful and so powerful that i can not stop killing enemy in this game. this is the game to buy for the story and the replayability.			"

												Pros: 1) Interesting story, but it leaves you with the story unfinished, makeing you to buy the second game to see how the story develops.Personal oppinion: it's like diablo 1. You finish the game, but are not satisfied with what you did there...2) Good music.3) Easy to finish the game, here and there it's a little bit hard, but the entire game is quite easy. Cons: 1) Few good spells, imo. I haven't bought the DLCs, perhaps they added something cool there.2) Money is a big problem in this game, from my perspective. Because i could not make my ultimate gear withought farming like a noob.3) Useless legendaryis, from my perspective. You get some legendarys that help you to a certain level, but when you go NG+ the same legendary drops but with the same stats in you first game.			"

This game type is so much more fun with the use of my controller which i never thought it could be and having a ghost friend to come along on your adventures make's things so much easier to deal with the more frustraiting parts about the genre. (having her collect the gold and potions for you, sending her to the shops, i.e. Torchlight 2) great game and glad i own it... to be honest i think i like it even better then Torchlight games.			"

												If I had to pick an ""underrated game of 2013"" this is it. Beautiful animations, a compelling setting, an interesting AI companion, and an adequate story already set this game apart from its competitors in the ARPG market - and that's to say nothing of character development and the combat mechanics system. A lot of criticisms of this game target the lack of build diversity, since the vanilla version only has one character ""class"" with two build paths, melee and ranged. However, these concerns are ameliorated by the DLC classes, a mage and a trap-setting ranged fighter, which are worth getting if you like the base game. I love the setting, which is somewhere between Mary Shelley / Bram Stoker Gothic and Stephen Hunt steampunk. Katarina, the ghost companion of the player, is well-written and feels useful in combat (but not TOO useful, so van Helsing still feels like the star.)Combat is simple enough to be accessible, but complex enough to reward careful character building. 4 primary stats - essentially Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Critical - govern around 10 secondary stats, all of which are easy to understand. The skill tree is fairly simple but has enough depth that the same class could be built effectively in a few different ways. There is a neat mechanic about managing a resource called Rage, used to enhance attacks with sub-skills called Powerups; so far these seem interesting, but not necessary to play the game if you don't want to worry about them.I got this game on sale for $7, and at that price it's a no-brainer. At the full price ($15 + $5 DLC) it's still worthwhile, but there are better titles on Steam at that price point if you're not an action-RPG fan. In comparison to Torchlight 2, it is a bit less accessible to genre newcomers, but with a more interesting setting and a darker, more visceral tone. TOTAL 8.5/10+ Art style and setting+ Animations and voice acting+ Combat system (Power-ups/rage, balance of skills, diversity of skills and gear)+ Endgame play modes (Scenario and Neverending Story allow players to continue after finishing the game)- Feels limited by production cost (Short story, only a few monster models and terrain palettes)- Some technical problems (occasional, minor bugs that do not crash the game, but get irritating)			"

												This is a hard game to review. On the one hand they do a lot of right things and on the other a lot of wrong things. The graphics are very nice and the sounds are good. The music is awful and I had to mute it. The music loops and its not very good.  The lore behind the game is original and the quests are fun for the most part.  The things I didnt like is the game is a lot harder then it should be. On Normal your going to be running for your life a lot of the time or least I was. I would say on normal for this game would be like hard or higher on Diablo 3. Mostly its because of the lack of regen on the armor stuff.The casual mode is ok but a little to easy. I wouldnt mind something in between. The skill tree is still in my opinion is all over the place and messy to look at. I would like something like torchlight 2 or Diablo 3 more streamlined. You have auros, tricks, skill sets for melee or shooting and then you have subset skills  whithin the skills that you can activate via rage by fighting things. If that sounds confusing well it is. A lot more then it should. The Co Op seems to work fine for the person hosting more so then the joiner. I had a gambler inside my base the person who joined couldnt talk to him. A fun game but can be frusterating in a lot of small ways.  After playing this for a while I would give it a 7/10 some good ideas hampered by small issues. Just beat the game in Co-Op its a little buggy and there was some lag,  even on a lan? Go Figure.			"

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

This game type is so much more fun with the use of my controller which i never thought it could be and having a ghost friend to come along on your adventures make's things so much easier to deal with the more frustraiting parts about the genre. (having her collect the gold and potions for you, sending her to the shops, i.e. Torchlight 2) great game and glad i own it... to be honest i think i like it even better then Torchlight games.			"

												I got this as a gift, and even though I'm not a fan of ARPG's, I found this game to be pretty fun. One warning though: last time I tried to play multiplayer it was completely broken, with frequent desyncs. Make sure you check out if it has been fixed before buying if your are buying it for coop. It works fine in single player.			"

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

												While it's fun to hear the dialogue between the ghost lady and your character on certain events, the slaying monster game play is quite boring. Most of the skill tree are auras or passives. There are very few interesting skills, which you can already tell by simply looking at the icon of the skill, the icons are copied and changed a bit for the next ones in the tree. The terrain is buggy on certain place, you're running but not moving. The environment looks nice and fresh however.Exploring the map once was interesting but it isn't worth revisiting after. The two game modes after completing the game are mostly grinding.The combat is definitely the weakest part of this game.If it's on sales and you like RPG get it, play once then forget about it. Otherwise, games like TL2, PoE and D3 are far more superior.			"

												A quality aRPG that is sure to have gone under the radar of many. A unique story with a follower that levels alongside you, and many of the modern streamlining conveniences similar to Torchlight 2 that have their own added intricacies. Having only one class with others behind DLC is a bit bothersome, but the standard class is versatile on its own and the campaign is a good length. Postgame goes beyond the standard new game+ and adds especially hard challenge missions to the mix.  Overall, a must for the aRPG fan.			"

												i will only rate this game 6/10.mechanics and atmosphere is very similar to torchlight rather than diablo which contains more lore.  but this defionitely have better ""artstyle"" than torchlight.i just find it little too simple. unidentified loot does not need an identifying scroll or potion or whatever, you just have to right-click on it and voila it's identified. for me that doesnt make sense. lol. also town portal does not require whatever. it's just readily available there..your companion is pretty boring who despite having leveling feature does not have an interesting skill tree for offense. all of her skills are passive, graphically-invisible buffs for van helsing.the story is not something will hold you into wanting to know more, it's very generic and unexciting.for van helsing character, the highest skill you can get is at level 14. after level 14, all you have to spend your skill points to are for improving your chosen skills, for me this killed the excitement of leveling up more. i only played van helsing character and i must say the developers should've made his skills a bit more eyecandy just for the sense of ""being powerful"". im not expecting ""fire-storm-like effect"" but maybe you could learn from some mmorpgs' melee characters... van helsing's skill tree is too bland.and most of all, bugs.... i lost count at how many times my game crashed and those feckin shrines dont work.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an average Action-RPG that is clearly outshone by other games in the genre. There are fair sized skill and talent trees that are hindered by limited hotkeys and level requirements. These trees allow for a multitude of ways to spend skill points and while it would imply replayability to neutralise the fact that there are only three classes, builds are far too restricted by the lack of available skill points and level restrictions. The three available classes are not very flexible in playstyle apart from the Hunter, but even that only has the choice to switch between melee and ranged. The combat has a focus on area-of-effect skills as the game can easily swarm you with monsters at ambiguous and undefined spawn points that can even be on top of you without warning. Loot drops occur too often and has uninteresting basic stat upgrades which taints the experience of obtaining new and better equipment. The plot is uninteresting and written poorly, the voice acting is subpar as they do not portray their characters' intent appropriately. The environments, despite varied, are cliche and does not compensate for the lack of world building that the plot, characters and ambience do not provide. Cooperative play is available but seems tacked on and is the same experience as the singleplayer, but with added players and monster difficulty.			"

It's amazing that I overlooked this game for so long.Gameplay is a little repetitive, but in a good way. You have two sets of weapons, ranged and melee, but I find most of my time is spent kiting and using the ranged abilities on all but adds.If you are a fan of Diablo or Path of Exile, you will like this game.

												A LOT better than I originally thought it would be. When it was first released I was not at all interested, it looked cheap, generic, dull and just another fan fiction game with no substance. Damn, was I wrong. The base version only comes with one playable class(?) but with the DLC you can then choose from two more, the Thaumaturge which is basically your mage and the Arcane Mechanic wich is an engineer with cool gadgets. Very different from most birds eye view RPG's I've played, different gearing and gemming mechanics and styles but it does not lack what only some can offer: a fun, changing, new, challenging, mass killing, awesome adventure. The skill system works the same as most other games like this would, as you level up (killing monsteres, completeing quests, etc.) you gain skill poins, later on though you gain more per level but in turn your higher level abilities require more and one skill point (1, 2 and some 3). You have your main ability skills, (mostly activated and damaging abilities, some passive) Your Tricks ability page (special abilities that change or enhance game play [Thaumaturge can slow time for every thing around him, Arcane Mechanic can summon turrets, and other fun abilities]). And last are your Aura skills, you can have 2 auras on at a time that increase mana regen, critical damage boost, elemental damage increase, etc. The game play, design, UI lay out and the game mechanics are very user friendly. One thing that most games lack is undoing skill point allocation. In this game you can remove points from skills one point at a time (for a fee, of course) so you don't totally throw you build out the window, you can instead make samll tweaks to it, which I love. You can do the same for you Ability points: Body(STR equiv) Dexterity(AGI euiv) Willpower (INT equiv) and Luck (magic item find, crit chance, dodge change modifier). Your follower, Katarina, is a sassy spectre that helps out in battle but also adds a sense of humor to a seemingly bleak dark world. She has her own seperate Skillys and Abilities and you can change how she attacks and behave (Melee, Ranged, Passive while adding boosts to you). You can have her pick up items, and gold if you want, send her to town to do your shopping and she will back talk you the entire time. Different and weird at first, but she is a valuable asset to your goal of evil eradication. There's a lot to say about this game, but you will just have to play it for your self to experience the fun and actually quite enjoyable graphics. There are some zones that feel laggy and I did have to tweak my video settings for it to be a little less glitchy at times (Running with two GTX 670 vid cards, i7 3.4Ghz, 16Gb RAM, 1 TB HD with a 240Gb SSD) my computer is more than capable of running any game at max graphics setting but I still experienced lag at times. Like any game, there are glitches and bugs that can some times even progression imparing, check the forums, the game has a built in repair function if a quest stops working or something similar, nothing major but it can be frustrating at times.My over all verdict 8/10. Worth buying? Yes. Better with friends? Yes. I'ts a fun game and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it.			"

												I used to be just like you... a poor soul who didn't recognize how AWESOME the INCREDIBLE Adventures of Van Helsing truly is. Now I know. And I hope one day you can too.This game is a pretty classic realtime RPG, complete with a box inventory section. It's got four levels of difficulty, complete with a permadeath option. I made the mistake of enabling permadeath my first game around, and sent the world into an everlasting oblivion. There are different classes for different playstyles, and items that, frustratingly, can only be used by a particular class. The sense of humor built into this game is priceless.Can money buy happiness? Now it can.			"

												I have to say I really enjoyed my first play  through of this little gem of an ARPG. Honestly my only gripe was the somewhat forced linear progression of some areas and a lack of mob respawning mechanics or procedurally generated side quests dungeons to create a deeper more replayable experience for even a single character. This combined with a fairly short playthrough time left me feeling honestly abit annoyed considering Torchlight 2 when onsale as it so frequently goes and its huge workshop mod community makes it such a modern titant among ARPGs that should be considered by others developing in the genre.The fact you have to pay for various classes as DLC vs again TR2s active modder community and free classes to explore need to be kept in mind by would be rivals. Still I honestly didnt mind grabbing the DLC for this game as it did show enough potential I wanted to try and show all the support I could.The vibes this game gives off are honestly the best of the ARPGs Ive seen for a while. The voice acting, banter from your ghostly lady companion, the story over all has a fun factor I have to admit captured my steam punkish goth nature very solidly.To me the real hidden treasure is the eventual base you get to set up and the handful of defense events you get to enjoy. IMO these needed to be more frequent or something, the system though alot of fun to watch the creatures die in the traps  and think it would of been great to see there be a way to have endless invasion options at the end to add to extending the life of a given play through.Over all if you enjoy the various related genres, the ARPG genre, and enjoy a shorter playthrough game to see the end I totally encourage this game for a easy dif with hardcore on one and done play approach for each class currently out.

												It's like a Diablo clone, but without proper Blizzard's polish.Quests are quite monotonous and all the same, doing all the side quests is dead boring. Storyline is hard to follow, you just run and slay hordes of enemies for almost no reason.And resource consumption is totally unoptimized. I've been playing every other game on medium or high settings without any problem and lag, but this game not only runs slow on low-medium settings but makes my monoblock PC trumpet like a plane taking off.

												This is a very fun ARPG. The play mechanics are excellent, the maps are huge, the quests are fun, and, for a lower budget game, the voice acting is quite nice. There are two DLCs thus far and for those who have the game, the dev has offered a unique item and an aura as a thank you. Diablo, Torchlight, Grim Dawn, and other ARPG players will feel right at home with this game. There is a LOT of loot, a nice skill tree for your main character plus your ghost companion - she is a blast BTW with her snide and condescending remarks to Van Helsing. But, unlike the annoying companion in Legend: Hand of God, THIS companion is also a potentially gruesome, merciless killing machine. The DLC offers more replayability, but, even without it, you can play through the game again and specialize in different kinds of attacks - the same goes for your companion.This game LOVES to swarm you and enemies will attack in all directions - it's absolutely glorious and at times, loot drops can be almost as crazy as Torchlight II.I hope that Neocore will consider making a sequel. The game would easily compete with the best triple A ARPGs out there. A random map function would really round the game out. Props to the devs who have been VERY responsive and have kept this jewel up to date. I am an ARPG fanatic and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of the most fun I am still playing.			"

												I picked this up as part of a Humble Bundle and had a couple of false starts at getting into it, primarily due to my lack of familiarity with the character set-up possibilities. I am very glad I had another crack as this is good fun. The mechanics are fairly standard but have plenty of customisation options (although there is the occasional problem with not being able to move when surrounded - best avoided by not allowing yourself to get surrounded!) but it's the very nicely rendered and varied environments and tongue-in-cheek humour that make the game. It's clearly been developed by people that love the genre (both of the game and its source material) and there is a lot of detail applied to enhance the gamer's experience. There are loads of easter eggs, jokes and achievements as well (some very much more obscure than others). Definitely worth a go if you enjoy horror B-movies and/or hacking/blowing up hordes of baddies.			"

												What's with all them people recommending abysmal, amateur games lately? Stop feeding me this pig grub and making me spend money on trash titles that only waste my time.Van Helsing is basically a shovelware title made only to generate income for the least possible costs possible. It's your standard, soulless, mediocre-but-annoyingly-bad-at-the-end hack'n'slash. Everything in this game screams with lack of creativity, the lack of any ultimate point of this title being even made besides ""people will buy anything at steam sales"" logic.Yeah, let's take an interesting theme and turn it into another uninspired shovelware. I fiddled around a little with characters, progressed a little into the story but the fundamentals of the gameplay, controls and the balance (that ranged class was a total afterthought, it's so underpowered and limited compared to the hunter) turned out to be terribly implemented and got me ultimately bored on hard difficulty. There's literally nothing of interest in this game, everything was done before and better. But the worst part is that killing enemies is fiddly (targeting is a chore, especially with the ranged character) and absolutely unrewarding, which means it's unsatysfying. Even putting down boss enemies turns into running in circles taking that HP bloat down for some crappy loot worse than anything you get from a vendor. Oh, yeah, how about tying difficulty level with number of enemies? That can't go wrong, can it? Yeah, it can and it did, because the only thing it changes is forcing the player into doing more circles kiting enemies until they all go down. How about♥♥♥♥♥♥voice actors on the top of that? Apparently some people liked them generic characters with terrible va - and terrible dialogue lines in this game are being described as ""humorous"". What? Straightforward terrible references and unfunny lines are ""humorous"" now? Seriously?Hard to see a good h'n's lately. Just get Torchlight 2 which is better in everything from Van Helsing. Even if it has arguably worse esthetics.			"

												20 GB to download. Binds forcefully to my 360 controller and requires me to disable controller support and restart the game if I want to use mouse control. Equipment wheel is a nice idea that unfortunately happens to be completely unresponsive to half of the equipment categories so I can't equip any ranged weapons, among other things. Very first skill I unlock bugs the game and renders me unable to attack altogether.Holy mother♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Average Diablo-like marred by terrible business practices. Complete pack is regularly discounted while DLC is not, effectively punishing early adopters who supported them by paying full price. Never pay full price for any release by NeocoreGames.			"

												Played it for a few hours and just quit because the game could not hold me. It is an OK game and it is obvious that developers put in a lot of effort in to it but there is very little visual feedback about that you are doing, number of enemies is just overwhelming to the point that you simply do not see anything and cannot distinguish anything that is going on in the game.  Because of that it is simply not enjoyable to play.			"

												If you've played Torchlight 2, you'll know what to expect.  The common root is Diablo, but The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing *is* Torchlight 2, to the extent that it feels like a rather underdone mod rather than a game in its own right.That's fine, of course - inbreeding and cheeky rip-offs have always been rampant in the games industry.  It doesn't matter if a game resembles another, what matters is what it brings to the table.  Van Helsing comes up very short, sadly, and the best that can be said about it is that it'll remind you of better games from time to time.Functionally it has everything you'd want from a game of this type, although it is a little buggy and nowhere near as configurable as it should be, but it feels like the work of people who got their game engine roughly working without any passion for the game they'd make with it.   It kind of pulls the right moves, but nothing really clicks.  Enemies are never exciting challenges, they're just pests who are either overpowered or underpowered, and combat is a constant annoyance.  A *constant* annoyance, as it never lets up - outside of safe town areas, fresh waves of enemies will always flood at you, which means that attempting to navigate the unnecessarily fussy character sheets, or even your inventory, will often result in death.You will die often, but it'll rarely be the result of something you have or haven't done.  Sometimes it will be down to the nice but confusing art style that makes your character impossible to find on the screen, but generally it's down to this game having absolutely nothing to do at any turn other than a weak sigh and 'eh, throw more enemies in there?'It's porridge floating in bathwater.  It's a game designed by people who don't understand games.  It's like eating a roll of wallpaper.  It is - and I don't say this lightly - perhaps the most tedious game I've ever played.  I go back to the Spectrum era, so I've seen some stinkers.  There's nothing here for anyone other than boredom. "

Rare loot and a bunch of revival spells - it's not what the hack'n'loot RPG should be. And ye, in a good bloodbath there're really almost no way to stay alive longer than revival abilities cooldown time. All what's good in game are h'n'l cliches.

												I'm not gonna spend much time on this review, mainly because I didn't like almost anything about this game. If you compare this to other genre like games, this one lacks a lot behind. If you're looking for a Diablo like game, well, it's kind of like it in some ways, but it doesn't get even close to the Diablo gaming experience. Not in game mechanics, not in graphics, not in sound or voice acting, I don't know about story telling becasue I din't bother to keep playing it. So, if you wanna judge for yourself, get it on sale, like for $5 or less if possible, not worth more than that.			"

Not only have the dev's not released a patch to fix probs over 2 years old !  They then expect everyone with broken quests to send their saves to them for a fix ! Not at all good enough ! These quest line probs should have been addressed with a patch ages ago ! So has turned me off this game for good will be asking for a refund !First time i have !  Will not be getting the other games in this series as i hear there are similar probs with them too !Fix your game Neocore !!!!

												Pretty much the same thing everyone else has been saying. The game has terrible mechanics, bad skills and customization, monsters don't level along with you so they're WAY too hard and OHKO you. It's a grind-fest with bad voice acting and honestly just terrible. If you like any other ARPG like Diablo, Torchlight, PoE, anything else... this game is NOTHING like it. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't. My recommendation? Go get Victor Vran. It's everything this game should have been.			"

												Well it can be fun to play and the writing isn't terrible the game can be somewhat unstable, may just be certain setups that run into instability but it can get rather annoying, as it has a demo available I heavily advise running the demo for at least a few hours before considering buying.The defaulting to gamepad if one is plugged in may annoy some as might the kb/m UI which is all over the place, the gamepad UI is slightly off no matter what on my 16:10 setup so I thought a bar in a cetain mission was full when it had a bit left.I personally have had several instances where it stopped registering my gamepad as plugged in and would't accept any input requring alt-f4-ing (luckily it saves frequently), when reforging items I've ran into a lot of crashes.Outside all the bugs/crashes and other issues the gameplay is decent for a diablo-like or whatever that subgenre is called, the voice acting isn't terrible and the story works.You spend most of the game running around murdering hordes of enemies in search of ever slightly better gear with that minor stat increase you need to kill them that bit faster.If you've played diablo or any of the games like it you know what to expect from the gameplay more or less and it's not anywhere near the worst of its type.So yeah, it's a fine game if you're lucky enough that it isn't completely unstable for you.

												I grew up on a diet of late night monster movies and bad scifi flicks and if there's one thing I retained from those days, it's the knowledge that Van Helsing is the most bad♥♥♥♥♥monster hunter there is.  Well...some of the Van Helsing's are.  You see, in history, there's like 912 different Van Helsing's out there.   I think they're all related too, but I'm not 100% on that.  Some are kick♥♥♥♥♥ some are not.  The Van Helsing in this game though is clsoer to the kick♥♥♥♥♥end of the scale. Even though I'm 40, I stil dream of being a monster slayer when I grow up.  It's probably never going to happen though, so having a monster slayer simulator is pretty nice.  This Van Helsing game pits you against large waves of monsters and let's you feel like Peter Cushing in a Hammer flick as you go to town with your dual swords, blood flying left and right and monsters falling like chumps.  (Two swords are always cooler than one sword, or a rifle you amateur)  As far as Action RPG's go, Van Helsing's a weird hybrd sandwiched between the buns of Diablo II and Torchlight II.  You get some min-maxing of stats on items, but not enough to feel like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥lord, plus a limited amount of skills that make you actually think before you plunk your points down so that you don't wind up with a Van Helsing with a limp sword arm.  Plus, the environments are pretty nice and gothic with a creepy atomsphere, again like a Hammer flick so it plays well to horror nerds, such as myself. The game can be pretty tough, you're going drink potions like an addict and you're going to swear at your monitor a lot, but making up swear words is a fun part of being a gamer.   it still feels rewarding to be able to come up with a combination of wepons strenth and skill points to be able to kick the snot out of that werewolf that's been having it's way with your hind parts.   There's two downfall's to Van Helsing, one being that it's a one and done playthrough, meaning you're not going to play through it obsessively seven times to become the prettiest princess with the shiniest breast plate, but it's pretty fun for that one play through.   The other is that one of the things I enjoy in ARPG's the playing dress up with your toon to be the prettiest princess, finding the coolest looking.  Van Helsing's getup isn't going to change a whole lot throughout the game, but he still looks pretty cool to start.  He looks cooler than Hugh Jackman did as Van Helsing at the very lest.			"

												My Bite Sized Review - The Incredible Adventures of Van HelsingThe Good:+New game in the world of Van Helsing+Controller Enabled+Start the game with a companion that talks and can be used in combat+A good amount of different playstyles+Story through campanion banter is done wellThe Bad:-Graphics are very outdated-Combat is very standard (melee, magic, or guns)-Unlike Diablo 3 once you spend points into a build, you are stuck with it unless you pay gold to respec-Enviroments are not that different (All kind of run together)-Zombie AI (aka just run at character)-Elite Mobs kill you quick, but themselves are just bullet sponges with average combat tactics-In the late game, you are forced to just keep popping healing potions and mana to stay alive-Quests are forgetable and not that interestingThe Verdict:I will say I DO recommend this game if it is heavily discounted. Other than that though, this game is a very average diablo style role playing game. The combat and graphics show their age and mid to late game there is a boost in difficulty that I feel is very un-necessary. Like in Diablo 3 I understand that on Hell Difficulty it would be really hard, but here in this game mid way through enemies just start taking chunks out of you even though you have decent equipment. All in all a very average game that might not get recommended before some other games in the genre (For Example Titan Quest or Torchlight).			"

												I am very disapointed in this game as a vampire lover van helsing is not all good in this game. The game mechanic is terrible and so is the graphic making all charcter cartoonish while the lands some what better. I'm sorry to critize on the hard work but it pisses me off that i waste money on game like this to be surrounded by werewolf in a heart beat not even allowing me to attack from any range. So I highly recomened not buying this game if your not into bad mechanic games.			"

												I Don't know, I felt extremely bored when I was playing this, it just lacks some fun... so many pointless skills, instead you could have fewer but actually useful skills. I played the ranged guy with a big gun in his hands, haven't tried other 2, don't plan to. Also there was a bug where my character simply stuck at a place and could do nothing at all, only solution was death... And it happened more than a few times. Seriously it's 2017 such simple bugs shouldn't even exist... Don't recommend this at all, if you're looking for a good arpg, go for Diablo, or Divine Divinity, Bard's Tale etc. etc. but stay away from this.			"

												I tried a couple of times but I couldn't get into this game... the graphics aren't bad at all but somehow they are still very unattractive. The starting classes are somewhat different to the classic rpg rogue, warrior, mage choices, but still they aren't really interesting. On the character creation screen, you pretty much gotta choose between the guy in the hat, the masked old man and the bald guy, no customization whatsoever. The game is boring on the lower difficulties and unforgivingly difficult in the highest difficulties. The gameplay is bad, when hitting enemies either by basic attacks or skills, it doesn't feel like you are actually hitting anything.Overall this game is dull, boring and not worth playing. I love the genre but I have to thumb this one down.			"

												Would have loved to play this game but despite my machine exceeding the listed OSX requirements, it would not play. I tried several methods others had reported working to get it to load (including renaming a file) but to no avail. I did not disable SIP as I do not feel a game is worth disabling system security protections so if you feel otherwise maybe you have other options that would work. Until the devs get it working for OSX, it should be removed as an OSX game. I can't recommend it specifically because it does not play for users who meet listed requirements.			"

Posted: October 6, 2014
												Before I get started with this review, I'll go ahead and point out that I'm not an expert. No really, loot-based action-rpgs aren't really my forte. Sure I've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours on titles like Diablo 2 and its ilk, but I couldn't tell you a dang thing about any of them. Go ahead and ask me about Diablo 2, all I recall is Tristram run after Blood run after Baal run after run after run after...bleah. I fried my brain on the genre years ago so I have just a little understanding for ""strategy"", ""proper-builds"", and the inner-workings and mechanics of what makes this genre function. I still play them though because they're addictive as hell. Now then, what can I say about Van Helsing? Well, for starters the characters are a bit more amusing than most. This is one of the benefits of having a game where the main-characters stay the same no matter the class. Despite his appearance, Helsing is a good-humored dude, and isn't always deadly serious about his job. His ghostly partner Katarina always has a cutting remark ready for the vampire hunter. As a duo they're far more memorable than most loot-clicker casts. I went with ranged-build, mostly relying on the spread-shot for crowd-control. Kat was built to violently explode upon ""death"" for great damage. It worked out well enough I suppose. I played on hard difficulty and didn't run into many problems (didn't beat the game, more on that later).Van Helsing plays out much the same as any other loot-clicker. You have your equipment, your rares, your skills, and your build. Either through happenstance or a guide you find your build, you choose the right skills for it, allocate the appropriate stats, then just kill stuff for appropriate weapon upgrades. For some gamers, that's compelling enough on its own, but it's preferable to hunt for something more. Where Van Helsing falters is mostly in the map-design. Each area is largely uninteresting. Some areas (like the ink realm) are visually inventive, but that's about it. The maps in this game are largely just a lot of space filled with packs of enemies. Nothing really changes as you progress. In the forest you'll run into packs of wolves, somewhere else there will be packs of soldiers, or packs of demons, and so on. When monsters are grouped together like that the game becomes stagnant. After you've found your build you're not likely to use more than the same or 2 or 3 skills at all times. Variety isn't just fighting different monsters, it's fighting monsters that approach in different ways. Some should ambush, others call for help, hell maybe they're just wandering around. In this game, they just wait around in organized groups for a vampire hunter to come fight them. One particular area is also aggravating because it is split into two sections, which leads to several minutes (slight exaggeration) of wandering back to square one if you go the wrong way. I will give credit to one area in that portions of it are separated by chasms, so enemies can take pot-shots at you as you try to cross. Sure it's headache-inducing, but at least it's inducing a feeling of something more and not just ""oh look. All these monsters are standing around for the thousandeth time"" mediocrity....But I didn't quit the game yet.A real frustrating aspect of this game involves the hit mechanics. More precisely, when enemies attack, what constitutes a hit? When I see an enemy wind-up to attack -- pull their fist back, hold an axe over their head, etc. -- I should be able to move out of the way to dodge it. Loot-Clickers..no...Action-RPGs in general have dozens of stats, even a dodge rating. All the same, there should be an incentive for players to avoid attacks through direct-input, not just their number > the enemy's number. Van Helsing flicks a toothpick at that idea, and it is a consistent source of annoyance for me. Even when I'm clear out of the way of an attack I'll still take damage. But that's not why I quit the game.After a certain point Van Helsing is given control of a resistance base, and he can outfit it as he sees fit. This is basically the tower defense portion of the game and THANKFULLY it's largely optional. I put the emphasis on THANKFULLY because I hated it that much. I'm going to change subjects ever so slightly and talk about a PS2 game called Shining Force Exa. In this game there is a fortress that is regularly attacked. While one character is questing, the other holds down the fort (so to speak). When you strip enough elements away from tower-defense you're left with nothing but ""protect this thing"". However if the core of the game is entertaining enough, that doesn't really matter. I actually enjoyed these battles in Exa because they focused on the core. A lot of monsters were thrown at the player and that was the extent of it. Van Helsing has this whole set-up where you can buy traps and place them all over this corridor-abundant dungeon. The waves of enemies are too frequent, come from too many angles, and due to the way the dungeon is constructed you'll never reach them in time. You have to approach these battles almost entirely with a tower-defense mindset. This isn't what I signed up for when I started playing Van Helsing. To be fair, tower-defense was a hardly a thing when Exa came out, but really who wants to play that crap when they pick up an action-RPG?...But I didn't quit the game at that point. After all the tower-defense stuff is largely optional.No I didn't actually quit Van Helsing until I was maybe one or two dungeons away from the final boss. When Katarina had reached her level-cap, and Helsing was maybe one or two levels away from his, I quit. Yes, of all the things to quit a game over it's due to hitting a level-cap. Or maybe the real reason is because it dawned on me that this is only part one of Van Helsing's incredible adventures. I'm sure if I picked up the second game I'd get to continue leveling, to continue fighting in seemingly endless repetitive encounters, using the same skills I mastered hours ago, dealing with the crappy mechanics, and there'd probably be even more tower-defense garbage. I didn't think myself capable of stomaching another 15-20 hours of a sequel to this game, so I quit.I'll give credit where it's due, Van Helsing managed just enough in getting the basics down to keep me playing. I'm an exceptional case though, I play a lot of loot-clickers regardless of quality, so maybe my judgment isn't always sound. If I see yellows, purples, and golds dropping at a decent enough rate there's no telling what games I could be tricked into playing. It's only when the end of the road is in sight do I realize that maybe this game isn't for me and move on. This is where Van Helsing lies. It's not particularly bad, but it gave me reason enough to quit as soon as I shook out of its icy grip.			"

I've ran other games comparable to this one (e.g. Darksiders, NFSP Hot Pursuit, even Strider runs on this machine at very low fram rates, but it didn't crash). The best thing I can say for this experience is that I didn't pay full price; however, I should never have bought this game. It seems broken.			"

												Hideous controls playing it on PC with movement and 2 main attack spells being on mouse buttons so you probably need gamepad. Also thought perk/talent/skill system is unnecessary complicated. After each level up you have to put silly amount of skill/spell/perk etc points to urself and ur companion.Spell choices themselves seemed kinda awkward and a lot of them felt like offering to choose the visual instead of different playstyle.Liked that every quest is voice acted and the relationship between main character and his companion was also pretty entertaining.

												The game is kind of a mixed bag. The npc dialogs really great and funny. There is a LOT of easter egg references to other games and movies in the game wich i find great. Graphics are avarage, nothing too facy but it does its job. But the asthetics are way above avarage, the game has a certain uniqe style wich i find really great. Where the game really lacks is in the core gameplay mechanics. The fights are really booring and simple. You just left click and wait to the enemy health bar slowly disappear or just kite the enemies to defeat them wich is lame. There are not many skills or abilites wich can put you off from the combat wich by reaching toward the end will be sickenly boring.  Many times i found graphical gliches and camera bugs where i only can saw the roof uncovering my charater in combat. Overall its an OK game, not bad but not good either.Personally i dont recommend this game. But! It was discounted soo many times by now for dirt cheap it can really worth a shot for the dialogs and easter eggs alone. /killer rabbit best rabbit :) /			"

PlotFelt that the plot wasn't too pronounced during the entire gameplay experience, was quite confused at the end. It felt more like no-brainer progression. Adding onto that, the ending was quite abrupt and unexpected as I expected more but it's continued on on part II in which I haven't tried yet (and I don't really plan to due to its negative reviews)GameplayMovementGameplay was very smooth in general, felt that movement is rather odd if you were to move with a mouse as you can't really move and shoot at the same time, which makes attacking + defending quite choppy.CombatHowever, to make up for that, I appreciate the over the top swarms of monsters that can be slain through 1 single AOE attack which makes the experience quite satisfying.CompanionQuite liked the companion option as it allows you to stay behind a tank if you're planning on a ranged character (I played range). Adding onto that, companions allows you to sell items (almost) anywhere in the battlefield with the drawback that you give up her presence for 60 secondsInventoryFelt that the inventory management was pretty dang good considering it automatically optimizes inventory space as you collect more items, it even has a manual sort button there just in case. Your companion also helps in clearing up your inventory space by having a separate inventory space of her own (in which you can send her to sell items too)SkillsFelt that skills were a bit lackluster as compared to games nowadays, felt that they could expand more on the skill tree but I think it is just barely enough for completing the gameEnchantments/UpgradesSimilarly, quite lackluster, the enchantments and upgrades were... not too appealling, it's mostly basic upgrades like HP+, HP Drain, MP Drain, Elemental Damage etc. It doesn't really explore into more experimental elements that a hack & slash game could go with, but as I've said, the basic enchantments/upgrades should suffice for a basic game like this.BalanceContext: I played on Casual which is the defaultThe game scales to ridiculous difficulty amounts at further levels (found that after level 20 it becomes annoyingly hard to progress). Though there's a mode for you to farm equipments on with respawning monsters, you can only access it at levels higher than 27 (I believe). Kind of a bit too far away from the point where you'd normally get really frustrated.One example would be a monster that shoots a bomb, as a ranger, you'd expect yourself to have very little health if you weren't expecting these monsters; it deals immense damage, close to 80% of my health as a ranger and it basically OHKO's you at higher levels if you don't have (very) good armor and health.Well if you're a ranger can't you just shoot him down at long range?No, the problem is that, the area that the game lets you hit the monster is exactly the range of the monster, so you'd have to shoot and run. With the sloppy movement I find it really hard and annoying to kill these monsters, and I don't really even want to go into dealing 2 of these at the same time.Camera AngleOne of my biggest issues would be the camera angle.First of, the game doesn't allow you to rotate the camera at all, so you're kinda stuck with this 45 degree camera view all the time. The biggest problem is that there will be enemies coming at you from the bottom of the camera (in which is a blind spot), you wouldn't know what's hitting you until you go really close to them or you take a detour. As a ranger, it was a horrific experience most of the time.AudioVoice ActingVoices were on point, think it is better than that of most games even. The contents of the dialogue were well balanced in comedic value and seriousness, not too much of any in which I feel is a good composition.Sound EffectsComparing to games nowadays, sound effects here are subpar, if you're very picky in audio, you might find these a bit of a nuisance, but I managed to get over them.MusicMusic was decent, felt that there were some mastering errors here and there (some tracks felt quite muffled for some reason) but it is okay in potraying the mood at their respective positionsConclusion/TL;DRThough The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing has its better days in the past, it doesn't have the better perks of other similar games that are out right now.Think Torchlight II or Path of Exile would be a significantly better choice than this right now, Path of Exile is even freeAs of now, wouldn't really recommend it			"

												Becomes too boring after one Playtrough, also especially if you want get all Achievements its boring and there are not enough Enemy to kill, thats why i spend 177 Hours with this Crap to finally reach the 500'000 Kills.Because i was really bored already, i used a Wrench on the Controller to hold the Button down, positioned the Character to kill endless respawning Monsters in Front, for almost 24 Hours to reach the 500'000 Kills also because the Game became slower and slower because the Bodys was not removed, i was forced to use an Attack that desintegrate them, Boring, Boring, Boring!So i can only recommend it partially for one Playtrough, but there is no Replayvalue other than boring Grinds for the boring Achievements probably made only to artificially lengthen the Completion - BORING!Did i already mention this Game is Boring?Also the most Boring Thing is limited Storage, its only 4x your Inventory Space(with Perk), so you will spend alot of Time with boring sorting out good stuff to replace it with a little better stuff.I can't recommend it because i can't stand limited Storage in Games where Loot is a Core-Component.I hardly managed to put all my Epics i got into the Storage and there was no Duplicates, so Storage is defintely too small. Period.And Games with limited Storage like this, will get an automatically ""Not Recommended"" by me, from now one. Period.Also there is another Thing that made it even more boring, there was a Sort of Badass-Points Thing like in Borderlands, where you was able to spend Points in and those Buffs would then be for all Characters - a Thing that would mean some Replayvalue after all, but, but ... but they removed it in an older Update, so it doesn't worked anymore by the Time i got the Game, and so there is also no Replayvalue anymore. Period.Also there are Bugs, it says full Controller Support, but this isn't true!Some Skills, Auras and Stuff can only be set with Mouse and this means you have to unplug the Controller and restart the Game to set the Skills, Auras and Stuff and then plug back the Controller and restart the Game again - soooo Boring!!!It should really be called: The Incredible Boring Adventures of Van HelsingAnd because i also got both of them in a Pack, i have to finish the other too, hope it's less Boring to finish it else it's the last Game from Neocore i bought for sure.

												Kinda fun ARPG Diablo clone. Not bad, like it better than Torchlight II a bit. They got rid of the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like TP and Identity scrolls, potion levels, and destroying stuff while crafting / enchanting.However, difficulty levels have the same nonsense. Anything harder than Normal is basically just a grindfest so you have an excuse to enjoy every single mob, drown yourself in potions, and make your game time last three times longer.Respecing comes early and is relatively cheap, so that ends up being the main use for gold.Go ahead, play it. No need to devote several months of free time to squeeze what you might want out of it.			"

												This game should be called The Incredible Adventures of DLC Hell-sing. The first thing you come across when creating your first character are three classes - two of which are, of course, disabled unless you have bought the additional DLC. Fine, you select your hunter (as if you had ever wanted to play a guy with a tin can on his head) and venture forth into this wonderful world! You kill a few creatures, kill a few thugs and ding! - you have leveled up. Imagine the joy when you open the character tree and see that - is it even possible? - even some of the hunter's skills are disabled. Unless you've paid even more money for the game, that is. Yeah, no.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing or Great Expectations (game review) - Hello, fellow hunters!!! As for me I was looking forward to the date of Van Helsing release with great expectations and even pre-ordered it on Steam. Frankly speaking I motivated by two things: I had already walked through Torchlight 2 several times (choosing a new character class every time) and I generally liked the videos the developers placed at Steam, Youtube and Facebook. So I bought it about two weeks before the release date. And finally I have downloaded the game and played it. I can say I have some mixed feelings about The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  As for the plot it is rather simple and can't boast of some depths. I mean if you happened fortunately (or unfortunately – it’s up to you to decide) to have a name of Van Helsing and your prominent father was a prominent vampire hunter – what are you expected to do and earn your living and reputation? Naturally, to kill vampires and other (numerous) various monsters. So our character goes to some imaginary country of Borgovia where something is going definitely wrong. As you guess Van Helsing is to put the situation to rights. By the way he is helped by Katarina – a ghost who has her own abilities and skills. But generally it is not the storyline that disappointed me. I never expected it to be exciting. What I wished was exciting gameplay.Read more at http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/incredible-adventures-van-helsing-great-expectations-game-review-3359/ "

												I could tell you so many things about this game.How it is charming, funny, addictive and actually has combat that is satisfying and weighty.I could tell you how this is the anti-Torchlight and anti-Diablo 3 in that it actually improves the ARPG genre by its mere existence.  That it isn't a cashgrab and it harkens back to the days when games were actually designed and had love and care put into them.How it is neither an ""evolution"" or ""revolution"" of the genre (or any other buzzword for that matter), but just a damn good game for once.But the only thing I need to tell you is that Abed from Community is the final boss.Happy hunting.

It has qool mechanics, lots of diffrent ways to build your character and nice world (I loved ink locations).But one day... Almost at the end of the game... All story NPCs in the Secret Liar disappeared and there was no way to fix it. We tried to play on my bf's save but portal to the next location crashed. So... that was the end of our playthrough. We weren't even angry or something. We were sad.I'll play Van Helsing 2 or 3, but I can't reccomend Van Helsing 1 when bugs prevented me to finish it. Twice.			"

THis game  could have easliy been a lot better. One of the silly mistakes that they did is they have 3 classes to choose from But they are all Van Helsings just in different clothes.. They Might as well have stuck with one character and given him a tree allowing he to learn everything..In my opinion this game is  like a budget Diablo 3 But no where near as good. I will compare it to Diablo 3 throughout this review to give you a gadge since you have most probably played Diablo 3. Only really one character to choose from with a different skin and different item & skill setsIn Diablo 3 there are about 5 or 6 charactors to choose from The graphics are no where near as good as Diablo 3.The game gets boring a lot quicker the Diablo 3 did. As you can see I only have 1.7 hours on record.. That is because I  really could'nt be bothered playing any further Because its not a good game.Even if I try to justify it not being at the same level as Diablo 3  By saying this game only cost $14.95 and diablo 3 is $90, there are still better free options like path of exile and much better options at simular prices like Torch light 2..  I took a chance on this game because I got it for a $1 from HumbleBundle.com in one of their weekly sales so I dont feel bad about buying this game. But I would feel a but annoyed if I had paid $14.95Therefore I can not recomend this game.   If you really want to try it even after reading this review maybe buy it if it pops up again in one of the charity bundles or goes on sale at the steam store for 80-90% off or something.But don't pay full price for this or you will be disapointed "

												Now I know I may have given this game a thumbs down, but there is no “Meh” rating to give and I certainly wouldn’t give a whole hearted thumbs up.Let me start off by saying, I knew this game was going to be badish. I fully expected this game to be pure crap, but was pleasantly surprised that it was just slight crap. The voice acting, wow, its just so bad. Like they hired three people based on the number of silly voices they can make bad.I did however purchase this game Wanting to hear bad voice overs and just see how bad this game could be. So in that respect I was not disappointed.I do have to say the game functions just fine. There is nothing technically wrong with the game, the gameplay is boring and repetitive the same as the quests and missions. They crammed in some sort of tower defense game that seems a bit out of place. I purchased the expansions as well. The mage (or whatever they are calling the mage) seems ok, but if you are doing it right you will always be a glass cannon. If you spec into more durability then you wont do nearly enough damage to kill stuff and you end up taking more hits so it’s a wash.The engineer seems fun and has a flame thrower or ice thrower and lots of robot pets that run around attacking stuff.The loot however seem to be mostly geared toward the default vanilla character. Im not sure if it was just my experience or not, but it seem like most of the items dropped are geared towards the hunter class. Oh well at least my annoying ghost has a wide range of things to wear and use while she constantly talks and annoys me.Ultimately I liken playing this game to watching cheesy B minus movies, a guilty pleasure, but ultimately it will get old and you will long for a better experience.

												Okay, I can't really decide whether I for or against this game and I have valid reasons for that.First of all, as soon as you start the game there is already a in-game microtransaction thrown in your face (actually two of them) and this is if you want to change you character class (mage, hunter etc.) and I don't agree with that at all, you should be able to choose what class your character is without having to pay for it (DLC).The second thing about this game is the voice acting, It may or may not just be me but the voice acting in this game infuriates me, it's not that it's bad, it's just that there is clearly no effort put into the voices nor the dialogue, it is barable but that it one of the main reason why I stopped playing this game and requested a refund (I know it's a stupid reason but every player has their critism about a game and each player is different).Also, this game, oh my, it is UNBELIEVABLY hard, even on the 'normal' difficulty or I may just be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥at this game lmao..Another thing, the mechanics. Now i've played a few MMORPG games, such as, 'Path of Exile' 'Diablo 2-3' and I know what to expect when it comes to in game mechanics. The movement of your character is clunky, boring, slow and just confusing, controlling your character isn't as smooth as you'd like it to be and the skill tree, points, leveling system are absolutely rubbish. The game doesn't explain them in enough detail for you to completely understand them, basically throws you right into the deep end expecting you to understand it all as soon as you start playing. Now on to the good things about this game, the storyline, meh, I wouldn't say it's bad but it isn't the best MMORPG storyline I've ever played, gets really boring after about 1hr and a half and the combat system is great, exactly what you'd expect from an MMORPG game such as this. That's practically it, this game isn't worth the full price of £10.99, I got it in the sale at £2.74 and I still don't think it is worth it. If you're thinking about getting this game, check out 'Path of Exile' it is pretty much the same game but with a different aspect..also, it's free ;)!So unfortunately, i'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down, some people may or may not agree with my review but I think a lot of people do.

												I'm having a bad weekend for games. First Saints Row the Forth was disappointing and now this. Its essentially a Diablo ripoff with drab boring monsters, linear hollow gameplay and no story whatsoever. You sometimes happen upon one-dimensional quests, like escort 'this' guy to the camp on the other side of the map. The combat quickly became boring and easy. Dreary and unimaginative.			"

BUYERS BEWARE! There are alot of issues and bugs with this game, in terms of technical status, it IS unfinished.I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really enjoyed Victor Vran so I was interested in The Adventures Of Helsing, despite the recent horrible reviews, I decided to give it a shot anyways. Boy, am I sorry I did! From te moment it booted up and I went to the video options to configure everything, I noticed that the most common and standard resolutions (1080p to 4k) were missing when using Direct X11. However, when I switched to Direct X9, those resolutions were suddenly available. Theere are 'guides' to try to find a 'solution', by creating CustomResolution.Cfg text file in the games local files, however none of things have worked for me or other people who have had this problem with the game. Actually it made the game worse, now textures were missing and the bugs within the game seemed to be magnified.Since that didn't work, I was told that I had to re-install Dirext X11, so I did. Nothing happened, perfmormance stayed the same, next the dev told me to try it on a different monitor to see if that helped so I ended up trying it on 3 different monitors and 2 different pc's, both pc's being pretty strong in specs. Nothing changed, I think the developer knew that none of tis would really help... as others before me seemed to have this problem and never got the issue resolved.Finally, I reached out to the community, someone told me that the problem wa son my end, which is pretty ignorant considering that (a.) I rarely have any problems with games - when I do, they're easily fixed (b.) Other people are having this problem, not just me. THen they told me that I should re-download the game 3 times - as if the game had some sort of superstitious ritual to make it work correctly. Let's look for a second at how ridiculous this is getting.Needless to say, I refunded the game and won't be trying it again... ever. I spent nearly an hour of trying to fix this game and running in circles like a chicken with my head cut-off. I've done .ini and compatability altering for games before, so I knew what I was doing, but this... GETTING THIS GAME TO WORK WAS THE REAL MONSTER I WAS TRYING TO SLAY! The poor optimiaztion and lack of ease of use made this a bad experience. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, even at the low price of $3.74, save your money for a game that actually works the way it should and supports your desired resolution.Yes, I know that it works right for some of you fanboys out there but there are far more people having problems with this game and I'm not just talking about the horrible Mac build, I'm on Windows! Git gud developers or go home!			"

												If this game would actually load set up screens, and you know....work. That would be really swell. So far, I haven't been able to get this to load on my Mac ( 2013 PB ) or with Windows emulated on the Mac, on my beefy Dell 690, or my win 7 gaming system. I like the concept, the clips on steam are nice. But for me, it's useless so far. Sure would like any suggestions anyone has on getting this to work. Support is useless of course, since they treat everyone like they just learned how to turn a computer on prior to asking support a question. Then, I might change my opinion.			"

												There's really nothing incredible about this game... It should be renamed to the mundane, boring, been done before adventures of some guy who looks like Van Helsing. It's been patched more times than Diablo 3 and D3 is still a much better game than this... which is a sad thing to even admit.Near the end I had to just stop playing it because it turns from a Diablo clone ARPG to a lame tower defense game that completely sucks the life out of you...

												It's not the game for me. Not even worth the $6 I paid for it, and the DLC. I don't understand why it has such a positive rating. Yes, the hours on record are correct. I only gave it half an hour's review.Edit: I played the game for half an hour. That's all I needed to determine I didn't enjoy the game. The max you can play a game before asking for a refund is 2 hours, I believe. I didn't ask for a refund. I didn't ask for a refund because, as it's been pointed out, I didn't research the game before I purchased it. That was my mistake, and I paid for it ($6). But my use of this feature is not improper. Had I done research, I wouldn't have liked the game anyway. It wouldn't have changed that. And I would have told people 'I don't like this game'. Since I did buy the game, I have access to this feature, and I used it. There are no facts here, this is opinion. Whether or not a game is good, is subjective.			"

They asked me, what platform im using and That´s all... That´s END from DEVS. Already im waiting around 39 days and still nothing, no fix no solution. I payed 10 euros for this game and no really i will not play this game in singleplayer. Well Im so angry already and probably this is  last game from NEOCORE DEVS. I can´t believe them. These guys are not the right Devs. Just my opinion, 39 days and still i must write them to they did something already. Summary:Lazy Developers= Broken game. Thumb down for me.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a mildly fun medieval style RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Call me a ""filthy casual"" if you will, but that sort of bugs me because it takes me out of the game a little bit. For example, the town portal system is called a ""wishing well"" a.l.a. Harry Potter with their magical fireplaces. So they make a joke about it saying that it is a fake & they should just call it a teleporter. I'm trying to get really into my medieval fantasy world here, guys! Why would you crack these little inside jokes like that. I get sort of a campy ""Monty Python comedy sketch show"" vibe from it. That is not a bad thing but it's just a different mentality I suppose.A positive aspect of the game is that it is sort of along the lines of Diablo II or Diablo 3 but is set in 1700's Transylvania, instead. That is well & good but for a guy who has a couple hundred hours into D2 & a hundred or two into D3, that doesn't cut anything & doesn't seem impressive or convincing in the least. Basically this game is a disappointment if you are looking for some sort of alternative to the Diablo franchise of RPG games from the company Blizzard, Inc, but better. I suppose it is ok for what it is. Not a popular game.Final conclusion can be summed up thusly: ""Meh, it's OK."" Not really a showstopper or barnburner or ""game that changed the WORLD forever"" or anything like that. The graphics are a bit dated. I haven't played a whole lot of the game. 6/10 would buy but only if it were HEAVILY discounted & there was nothing going on on a Saturday afternoon or Friday evening after working the ol' day job. It does go good with a Starbucks Latte, so that's something I guess. On second thought, save your money. DON'T buy the game reviewed here!			"

Be Van Helsing, monster-hunter extraordinaire and save the day with your charming and beautiful companion, Lady Katarina (who happens to be a ghost, by the way). Explore the savage wilderness in the mountains and the soot-stained brick districts of a grim metropolis twisted by weird science, and don’t forget: you might never know who the real monsters are!

												I lasted 30 minutes then uninstalled this game . Why? it was not fun . Basic requirement of any game in my opinion. Also, it does not actually show you how to play it. I wasted my money on this. Torchlight 2 is just light years better and more fun! Get torchlight and skip this.			"

												Relatively uninteresting Diablo clone.  The visual look is unappealing. The game play is clunky, with response to my XBox 360 controller erratic. For a 2013 game it feels 10 years older.  The colors are dull, the design uninspiring.  It's using almost none of the capacity of my GTX 1070.  This is too bad, the backstory in particular is interesting - an alternative European history mixed with steampunk tech.Ultimately uninspiring - especially compared to Diablo III.			"

												Hunter is a decent class to play, but early on, the Thaumaturge, even on normal, is really boring, and difficult.. Slow single target spell casts, fighting packs of 5+ enemies.. The main attack can take 3 to 5 hits to kill each enemy.. The hunter on the other hand, has the ability to melee, or range.. Default melee swings, or gun shots.. I enjoyed the game playing as the Van Helsing iconic class (Hunter), but really dislike how the Thaumaturge (spell caster) plays..There also arent that many abilities that you will be able to use.. There is an overly confusing, andf cumbersome Rage meter, that is used to enhance each ability at the click of a button, for a single use.. Each ability can be enhanced with  up to 3 boosters, and are activated by pressing spacebar.. Its just too much to try to deal with in the heat of combat, and ive never used them.. They take up precious ability points in the skill tree, and even when i tried speccing into them, never used them at all.. You initialise the boost, then click whichever ability you want boosted (and which boosts you want), and its used in the very next ability.. Can be reinitialised until rage is empty.. Its just too cumbersome, and the button layout is pretty bad as well.. It is customizable atleast, but once in game, youll see what i mean.. Its soo many keys to hit.. I think each class has like 9 abilities to choose from, a dozen of so tricks, and some auras.. All of which require the same ability points to rank up, and you must start at the top of the trees, and work your way down.. You will be aquiring skills whether you intend to use them  or not, to get to the more powerful ones below.. The music is almost non existant, and the ambient sounds are your basic birds chirping, etc.. The lack of sounds also adds to the dull atmosphere, inevitebly putting you to sleep..I wont get into the ""story"" as its pretty pathetic, for what could have been amazing.. Its Van Helsing, afterall, and this is so generic, and this ""Ink"" just makes it worse.. I really dont have much good to say about this series.. I really would pass on it..Is really badly optimized.. Im far above recommended specs, and the game gets below 20fps often.. Skimming through the discussions, theres dozens of people asking for help with the same issue..It really pisses me off that i have to turn off all the deent settings to play this game, which isnt really great looking to begin with..All in all, i would say pass on it, unless you are a di hard arpg fan, and absolutely need another title... Because theres not enough of them apparently, lol..  Poor performance is the killer here..			"

												Though this game appears to be perfect from the outside, i was severly dissapointed with the memory loss that occurs during multiplayer.  My 3 friends and i bought this game together to play, we dug about 3 hours in then unexpectly disconnected, losing all of our progress.  We looked up online soonafter to find other people having the same bad experiences with the data loss.  Do not buy this game unless you are willing to only play the solo story mode.♥♥♥♥ this game, waste of money, waste of time, and unneccessary frustatration. This game would be enjoyable if they would fix this damn glitch.			"

												Not bad overall, but gets boring after a while. Diablo clones are hard to do right, because its all about balance. Balance between amount of items dropped, amount of monsters encountered, etc. Van Helsing almost nails it, but still lacks a few touches. For instance, the amount of monsters is just ridiculous! Some skills tend to be useless, while some are overpowered. There is nothing to tell about the plot. Its a huge cliche with cheesy Holywood lines. Waste not your time if your after it. There are some nice innovations - the tower defence mode in which hordes of monsters come is ingineous addition. Also, lVan Helsing is a solid choice for those who like Diablo clones, but not if you're not into the genre.			"

												let me start by saying that this game is loaded with issues. This game uses all of the mechanics of torchlight... except that theres only one class unless you buy all the dlc. That said the single player drops loot for said dlc classes even when you arnt playing them, half of my epic drops were for the other two classes. Next although you can respec all your attribute points and skills there is no way for your to respec perks, and you dont know if you should wait because they are unlocked at certain attribute levels. they give you an ally but i found it best to put them in passive mode and suck up a third of the damage i took, as they die pretty easily even on the lower difficulties. the skill system encourages you to get only two active skills and put the rest into passives, auras, and tricks. by the end of the game i was a walking pile of passives with a single target ability, an aoe ability, and a heal. the game starts off a little boring, and continues that way until you reach the end, which luckily isnt very far as this game felt pretty short as i found myself skipping most enemies in the later levels just because i wanted it to be over. they added a rage system then discouraged me from using it by giving me buffs when i was full rage so i ignored the entire system which says that it was a bad system. in short this game is a bad copycat of torchlight with dumbed down skill trees and classes that you have to pay for. skip this game and go play torchlight.

												The Incredibly Long Title of Van Helsing is a fun 10-12 hour (main campaign) hack and slashy romp. What's there is good, though the melee could use a bit more... oomfph.The skil tree is a bit shallow and some of the abilities don't scale too well at higher difficulties. While the power up system is a unique gimmick, it boils down either feeling too clunky to use on the fly or becoming an automated left or right click with the auto option turned on.The humor is very tongue-and-cheek and often breaks the fourth wall. Voice acting is pretty good overall with hilariously stereotypical vampire and mad scientist voices. Environments are well used. Even though you spend half your time in a forest, each one feels unique.The inventory management and itemization in this game is one of the best in this genre. A simple thing like automatically reorganizing if you pick up something and logically have the space to do so if not for one stupidly placed sword is a godsend.Overall if Van Helsing had a deeper and more complex skill tree along with a Newgame+ instead of just a pure endgame, this would be a worthy competitor to the big ARPGs. As it is now, it's still a decent romp for its price.			"

Aided by your companion, a ghost named Lady Katarina, the two of you work together to try and find out what causes such strife in the land of Borgovia, and how you can solve the issues of the folks there plagued by dark horrors.Do not buy this game for the combat, graphics or anything like it. You're really only buying it for two reasons: Multiplayer, and the dialogue between Helsing and Lady Katarina. Beyond that, nothing interesting.			"

												Let me start off with by telling you what type of game The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is; its an ARPG. This is similar to  games such as Diablo and Torchlight. So essentially, top down camera, lots of monsters, and most importantly lots and lots of loot. So why should you get this game. Van Helsing takes elements from many different sources in the fantasy and science fiction genres. The includes everything from Lord of the Rings to Monty Python for fantasy and Star Wars to Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy for science fiction. This is a game that knows its target audience very well and caters to them, but not so much as to take away from the actual game. Still you will notice nods to different things and they fit within the theme of the game very well. The gameplay is very solid, but it may take some getting used to if you don't play this game very often. It still uses WASD just not for movement, you use only the mouse for movement and attacks. However it is pretty intuitive and takes no time to get used to. The mobs you fight are a bit of challenge and you will die quite often in the early stages but its enjoyable to get better as the game progresses. To summarize this game was made with the thought of the player in mind and it really shows in the final product. There are some bugs here and there but the developers, Neocore Games, is very responsive to player issues and timely with patches. If you are on the fence about getting this I would reccomend this game to anyone who is up for a good adventure.			"

												Maybe not a got Mac port?This is not an easy review, because I like the game. It is fun, when it works. But here is already the problem. I experienced graphic problems, crashes and sometimes the game slows down for not so obvoius reasons. Before you read on, please note, I have friends who played this game without any problems. I therefore assume that this might be a problem just for Mac users. My computer is an iMac and shouldn’t have any problems to run this game. Still I had plenty of problems in the short time I own this game.Do not get me wrong. When it works it is fun and I think the story is fine. Sure the game does reminds you of Diablo 3 a lot, but it is in my opinion also unique enough to be different from it.I got the game in a sale for just $6.50 so I am not to disappointed, still sad I couldn’t finish the story at least once. To many problems for me to keep trying.My recommendation is therefore not easy. I would like to give it a thumbs up, but unfortunately I can't. You might be fine when you are a PC user. As mentioned, my friends who own this game on PC were not running into any problems. I, on the other hand, as Mac user had lots of them.			"

												I am a big fan of isometric RPG with a lot of hack'n'slash, and there are not a lot of available titles on the Mac. I absolutely love this game, and would warmly recommend it to anyone who appreciate games like the old Baldur's Gate, Torchlight or Diablo. Furthermore, the steampunk universe make this experience stand out from the competition. For the price, it's a rela steal!			"

												A fun and fast game. The diablo clone games are a favorite genre of mine and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing does not disappoint. Fast action, lots of cool monsters and a fun story filled with great voice acting and amusing dialogue both from the main character and his trusty side kick the ghost Katarina. This game has a lot of great style and the soundtrack is AMAZING! Very fun game.			"

												Was the Diablo series one of your favorite games in the early 2000's? Do you like steampunk? Gothic monsters? Parodoxical references to literature and pop-culture? If any--or, especially, all--of these questions have a positive answer, this game is for you. It features witty voiced banter between a monster hunter and his ghostly companion, levels of damage that could be considered ""Too Damn High"" and quite an array of interesting monsters. The main storyline is about 15-20 hours long, depending how effecient you are at killing things, filled with traditional hack-and-slash murder, plus a couple tower defence scenarios. While the story is a bit short, there are scenarios for higher-level players, with bigger and better loot, and also a never-ending story mode, which starts you back at the beginning, just with tougher monsters, better items, and even moar damage.If you're looking for a ARPG with good replay value, decent mechanics, and some cool gimicks, this is the game for you. (Even more so because of its price tag. $20 for the game +all dlc)			"

												Remember back in the 90s when you would still discover new things about the characters you played halfway through the game? The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing takes you back to those days. The skill-and ability systems are layered and complex and will require you to think them through and test them out thoroughly. Even on normal mode, this game is a challenge, even more so when you are joined by friends. For some players this complexity will be a turn-off, but for others it will be a welcome challenge.Great design, over-the-top but funny voice-acting and a nice challenge for those who wish it.			"

												The game Diablo 3 wanted to be. It has a number of moments that I actually laughed out of pure stupidity. The graphics are suprisingly good and the voice acting fits the mood. In my opinion this is one of the best hack and slach games. Way better than Torchlight which just got boring really fast. It's fun. Not too hard and not too easy on normal diffuclty. I like the idea of the talking ghost companion. Adds ""chemistry"" to the game (a bit). I highly recommend it			"

												A fun and fairly accessible game, this is really very well made considering its price. The combat is quite fast and punchy and you get into the systems of the game surpisingly fast. In the long run the fairly limited skill trees may be a problem - the included character has one for melee and one for ranged, and the other characters are DLC and only have one tree each - but for a casual rampage this is very good indeed.

Dungeon crawl, at least its based around the hellsing mythos, for a premade and easy to follow and hard to screw up story.

												Well this definitely wasn't Incredible.And for a lack of a better pun it could be just as well renamed to Van HELLsing.First of all - I nearly ruined my mouse on this pointless hack-n-slashery.Second - too many traits and skills and you STILL have a snowball's chance in hell of surviving.Third - often the enemies swarm you so densely, that the whole thing turns into one big ugly clusterf**k.Fourth - You have to pay a subscription fee or whatnot to get better drops and toughen up? Excuse you, but that's just dumb marketting if the game is unentertaining to begin with.Fifth - Let's not even get started on the wannabe-witty story and dialogue.Sixth - woo graphics. However, the gorgeous setting and design gets outweighed by crappy gameplay and everything else.Seventh - savepoints/checkpoints are far between. If you need to stop playing sooner for any reasonable reason, everything respawns and you can start all over again.Eighth - A game shouldn't motivate you to hoard ALL the items dropped just to sell them off.Ninth - When you get repeatedly swarmed and cannot survive a full 10 seconds upon entering a new location that's poor level design.and last - don't. waste. your. money.

												Diablo meets Torchlight... and the outcome is good. Good game with nice plot. Graphics is pretty good, gameplay is fun and intuitive, classes are fun. Katarina as a companion is great add as a support(with her own stats, skills and equipment), but even better are her comments during the game and dialogues with Van Helsing (you). Playing tower defense levels are nice add (like isometric Orcs must die!). Lots of parodies on...everything.The rest of stuff is typical in this genre - different clasees, skills (divided in few categories), thousands of items (common, rare, epic etc..), different kinds of enemies, mini-bosses, sidequests, crafting, enchanting...Overall: if you are tired of Diablo, finished Torchlight and don't have other games in this genre to play, this game is the right choice for you.

												Pleasantly surprised by this one. Neat little ARPG with some replay value. Voice acting and story was decent with a few cringey actors here and there. Unfortunately, the skills system makes it pretty much impossible to have more than 4 active combat sklils at once, and 2 auras with no way to switch them unless you want to spend thousands of gold reseting your skill points. While gold is plentiful at the end of the game, it still seems like a poor design choice. I also felt the level limit and skill points available to be very low. I understand this was for balance reasons, but you really don't feel truly powerful at max level, and your skill options are limited due to the UI and skill tree designs. Overall, still enjoyable and well worth the $6 sale price I paid for the complete pack.			"

												Very fun Diablo/Path of Exile style game but with a few things that improve on that. The control you have over your companion is beautiful. You can set them up to fight melee or ranged style combat and even switch stances on the fly. You can also have them pick up loot for you and even decide which kinds of loot and quality level of the loot. Graphics are very good with big chunks of body parts flying when you explode them and building pools of blood if you fight in same area for a battle. Very original and fun storyline with great bits of humor thrown in.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an action role-playing video game Diablo clone that focuses on the trials of young Van Helsing and has nothing to do with the movie of the same name. It is set in a fictional gothic-noir steampunk 19th-century Eastern Europe.Graphics wise, while it will not be taking any awards, it is still pleasing to look at, and quite atmospheric looking especially when portraying the haunted misty looking fictional eastern european forests. The character models however look quite crude. In short, the graphics is serviceable, but unremarkable.Gameplay for the main campaign will take about 13 hours depending on your playstyle and is basically the same as most other Diablo Clones. It borrows alot of the mechanics and ideas from other games especially from the Torchlight series in its use of Pets. Instead of having pets in this game however, you will have a female ghost companion called Lady Katarina who not only helps you sell items like the pets in Torchlight, you can actually level her up as a very formidable helper who is surprisingly very useful in the game.Another interesting part is a mini tower defence game at the later part of the game, which I thought was quite refreshing as I have not yet seen any Action RPGs that adds this mode yet. While it doesn't really add much to the game, and only serves as a side distraction, it is a nice addition.Music consists mostly of slow and sombre pieces which complements its setting very well, and is competently done. Voice work for both Van Helsing and Katarina is competent and i enjoyed their witty banter with each other. The voice work for the other NPCs however feels like they're overacting most of the time, trying very hard to fake that Eastern European accent.Now as for the downsides, the backstory of the game is very unremarkable and completely forgettable. While other games of this genre also suffer the same issues storywise, for some reason, I just cannot immerse myself into this game. Maybe its because the game doesn't take itself seriously or maybe its the fact that for a game called ""Van Helsing"" you never actually get into a combat with a single Vampire, not even the last boss is a vampire. (Actually there is only 1 vampire in the entire game, and he's only a friendly NPC.)Enemy AI are also very simplistic, and most of the time, the game's only challenge is to simply throw lots of creeps in huge group at your face forcing you to kite 90% of the time.Loot is very bland and lacks in variation visually. It seems that there are only a very limited selection of items that visually alters your characters and most of them just look the same as any other.The other bad point is unfortunately the overall play control which is especially bad because play control is probably the most important aspect of any Action RPGs. While this game allows the use of WASD movement via keyboard (probably one of the rare ones that allow this), the execution is just downright terrible. Example: Lets say if you were to try to move in one direction, then press the Shift key to stand in place and attack incoming mobs, the next time you release the keys, you may actually find the character automatically continue to move forward on his own and can only stop when you press the corresponding movement key. More then once this caused me to die unnecessary deaths because I simply couldn't move away from mobs when they start swarming me. This bug also seems to happen if you use only mouse clicks to move, and is extremely frustrating and almost destroys what enjoyment i had from the game. There is also a Co-op mode, but I haven't had a chance to try that with a friend so I cannot comment about if it functions well or not.Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10An average Action RPG, while not as polished or as refined as the Torchlight or Diablo Series, does show some promise. Its worth a look if you can get it at a cheap sale. The movement bug I mentioned in the review is really very frustrating and I hope that they can get it resolved soon.			"

												Was the Diablo series one of your favorite games in the early 2000's? Do you like steampunk? Gothic monsters? Parodoxical references to literature and pop-culture? If any--or, especially, all--of these questions have a positive answer, this game is for you. It features witty voiced banter between a monster hunter and his ghostly companion, levels of damage that could be considered ""Too Damn High"" and quite an array of interesting monsters. The main storyline is about 15-20 hours long, depending how effecient you are at killing things, filled with traditional hack-and-slash murder, plus a couple tower defence scenarios. While the story is a bit short, there are scenarios for higher-level players, with bigger and better loot, and also a never-ending story mode, which starts you back at the beginning, just with tougher monsters, better items, and even moar damage.If you're looking for a ARPG with good replay value, decent mechanics, and some cool gimicks, this is the game for you. (Even more so because of its price tag. $20 for the game +all dlc)			"

												Remember back in the 90s when you would still discover new things about the characters you played halfway through the game? The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing takes you back to those days. The skill-and ability systems are layered and complex and will require you to think them through and test them out thoroughly. Even on normal mode, this game is a challenge, even more so when you are joined by friends. For some players this complexity will be a turn-off, but for others it will be a welcome challenge.Great design, over-the-top but funny voice-acting and a nice challenge for those who wish it.			"

												I got this over Halloween during one of the sales.  I have to admit for the money it is a beautiful game.   A great feel to it, I loved the atmosphere and the whole feel to it.  They did a great job.  I found myself buying a bit of the DLC and playing a few of the additional characters, and some of the extra content after you finish the story line.I have to admit that my major complaint is that I wish there was more of it!  I loved it, and wanted to keep playing.  I hope they continue to expand this game, which I believe they could.  If you liked Torchlight and Torchlight 2, this is a must have for you.  The minion dynamic and game feel is very similar, but she is a lot more fun than a dog.  I tend to play my games with the sound off, but found myself turning it on so I could hear her banter.A definite fun game, well worth the money.			"

												The game plays similarly to other ARPG's such as the Diablos and Path of Exile. The story is unique in the sense that it draws strongly from the Van Helsing lore and the steampunk styling of it doesn't appear in many other ARPG's. The game is still quite buggy as there are many skills that quite inbalanced (looking at you fire pillar and electro ball) and some classes are definitely better than others but it seems that the developers are still actively pushing out updates and fixes. Definitely worth getting and playing through if you're interested in the styling of the game, the story, or are a big fan of ARPG's but don't expect it to be a perfectly polished product.			"

												I think fans of ARPG's will be at home here, but it's not the prettiest or most quaint of homes. A lot of work needs to be done for this franchise to even be close to the league that Diablo and Torchlight are in. It is extremely obvious they adapted features and qaulities of the big boys of ARPG's, but they execute them akwardly. It is also disappointing that there is only a single class in the base game, although it's somewhat versatile between ranged and melee. However, players who own the DLC can expect a mage exclusive class, and a ranged dexterity type class.7/10			"

Really? You put more champion monsters in the game than you can actually rank up with?Final boss fight and ending lackluster.

												Awesome Diablo/Torchlight clone, great atmosphere and backstory and it is PACKED with easter eggs. References are made to a certain game that is similar.....very funny too..However i have one issue with this game; Level caps at 30, which is kind of strange. The maps are not procedural, maybe that is why, i dunno. .The skill tree is set up in such a way as to make you think you'd get to about level 50-80, It just seems way too short. I barely managed to work my way half-way through *some* of the skills. Once you get your character to level 30 it's pretty much game over unless you want to fight progressivly harder monster but remain at the same level while trying to improve your gear.... Thing is though, the gear you finish up with is usually about as good as it gets anyway. and the fights are exactly the same, same monsters, same maps, just takes longer... for virtually NO reward. .This is a single play-through game. Once you finish it you will probably put it aside. Great game though for what it is.			"

												After playing 10 + hours, I guess that I'm able to judge this game.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is hack n slay RPG in the style of Diablo or Torchlight.I recommened this to you if you like those kind of games! It has some good things like the skill system and different kinds of enemys. Plus you have 95 achievments to unlock, of which the most are quite easy but some are also quite challenging. Also it isn't too expensive and it is definitely worth its price, especially if you're getting it during a sale.What I also like about it is the overall world and the atmosphere, plus it has some humor in it which will probably make you smirk from time to time.Plus the game is quite player friendly, you're able to reset your skills easily for Van Hellsing and Katharina and identifying items doesn't require a spell (which lead to the question why they actually implemented that feature because now you're only required to right-click and wait 2 seconds)Things I don't like are for example the huge hordes of enemies you can encounter. Although the battles are fun (which is important because this the main thing you're doing) I was sometimes feeling like the developers just smashed as much enemies as possible in an area which sometimes leads to exhausting long battles against 30 or more enemies at a time. Also, the story isn't really exciting but that doesn't matter that much in that kind of genre. Graphics are also quite good and support the atmosphere of the game.All in all: 78/100, worth buying! "

												TIA of Van Helsing is a surprising game. The maps and the enemies are very well made and it is obvious to me that the creators paid a lot of attention to details. However, while scoring high on the graphics I would say that the gameplay is somehow mediocre. It doesn't give that thrill the way Torchlight does and is not quite as diverse(loot) as Dungeon Siege or Titan Quest (btw even if the game is huge ~20gb it is nowhere near as long as TQ). The loot is a bit disappointing mainly because there are not many types of items, most having the same name with slightly different bonuses. The skills don't offer very rewarding fights (I played as a mage and hunter) and might actually be the main gameplay issue.I know I have pointed the negative aspects of the game, but that is only because there are already a bunch of amazing games in this genre. It still proves to be an addictive game with reasonably good storyline and very good dialogues especially between Lady Katarina and Van Helsing. It is also one of the few games which is reasonably priced.			"

												Torchlight 2 is a lot better and has better replay abillity. Skill balance is just lame. Overall game balance is really weak. Last boss extremally easy. Gold drops and prices just make no sense since you can get 100,000gold within one short run and upgrades cost 5-10k gold (which is said to be a lot)12-15 hours gameplay and it's all the same since level one. Fight tons of mobs constantly. AoE AoE AoE. You will have max 4 skills. No quick spell changing. Power up only on active 2 skills LMB+RMB, which makes no sense with other skills you use. (4) Leveling up skills > anything else.Not really worth the money. If you like this type of games you'll love VanHellsing, however the plot is weak, no end game, no real open space, Hit and run AoE spam all game long. Fun for max 8 hours then becomes a boring SPAM 1 skill and run game.Comparison to Torchlight 2 :+ better graphics+ fun power-up system- item-readabillity (T2 lot better)- experiance grid (leveling is really slow after 28)- no plot really- no end game thank you or anything- 15 hours gameplay vs 80 hours gameplay (T2)- HORDES OF MOBS NON-STOP makes game boring- Gold balance is extremaly bad- Stats/skills balance is bad- DLC sadness.

												For the low price of £12 you get a Diablo 3 killer that is fun to play and very addictive.  The skill trees offer lots of replayability.

I love playing on HC so a trap that's meant to throw you on your back instantly kills you is a bit annoying. Reported that and got a responce that it's going to get fixed on next patch. That's fine and all but still. One year old game and bugs like this forcing me to start the game again.Why do I recommend this game? It's fun. Just wait for a bit before playing it so they might be able to fix some of the bugs.(September, 2014)			"

												The Future Generations of what we used to know as kids- Diablo Game.In this great graphics game, you will never feel bored or that alone playing it as this is mainly a single payer game.What makes it this way is all thanks to the character development of the katarina 'ghost' who follows you around and assist you in battles. She was designed to be a humorous and engaging companion throughout this game. The voice accent and story is quite well planned out. Its her interaction with you that makes the game a whole new level unlike in diablo where you wander around in the woods with yourself and your erm, mud monsters who doesn't talk.I started with the complete pack demo kit on 'normal' mode'. Which was great since the monster aren't too overpowering that might make you give up playing the game. Afterall, you wanna just enjoy playing & finish the game story not engraging yourself trying so hard to kill the monsters. Or actually, them killing you. Another great thing is that you can respawn on the same spot you died by paying 'coins'. Gone are the days where dying means restarting the whole mission and having to walk all the way back for the same battle. In saying this , note that you will be a invisible ghost for few seconds, allowing you to move around before respawning as a human and meanwhile still being chased by the monsters that once killed you before...Weapons & skills are fun & have a pretty acceptable range to choose from. The abilitys and skills are too not advanced nor complicated, to me as a 21 years old (Girl) gamer.  Another plus point.Recommended for people who don't want to go for the games that is too addictive such as team fortess which you can play hours after hours trying to kill people without any objective really. For somewho like me who have a full time job commitment but is a young adult that would like to enjoy a simple yet satisfing & engaging game, this is the one. P.S i searched so hard on steam & finally found it <3P.S [Part 2] I finished the game within two weeks. So i must say the story is kinda short. And there is not point purchasing those arcane classes stuff. Becos there isnt really a 'never ending story'. They said that becos in reality , it means restarting the game with different class but same map, monester & story. And God, that is boring as hell!!			"

												So here is the deal... this is a 9 out of 10 game that currently only gets a 7 out of 10 on the Mac due to an abundance of memory leak crashing bugs that make the game rather frustrating at times, especially around Gallowsbog and the Abandonded Research Station areas.  Luckily the game autosaves very regularly and I have not had to repeat alot of sections after each crash as in other games.  This means if you grin and bear it you can get thru the troubled sections fo the game and then it seems to stabalize and play very well.  Truth is, it is a very fun game and at least for me was worth the effort to get thru the bugs.  While I hated Diablo 3, this game built on their game engine is a blast filled with steampunky goodness and very much worth a play... and get the DLC, the Arcane Mechanic is exceptionally cool.			"

												A surprisingly enjoyable hack n' slash aRPG experience. Steals many of the best ideas from the Diablo and Torchlight series, and adds its own unique twists. It's from a Hungarian developer, and shows some obvious signs of its n0t-astronomical budget: some janky animations and snaggy terrain textures, terrible voice acting for minor characters (caveat: the voice work for the main characters is actually quite good), and a rough looking (and feeling) UI. However, the game redeems itself with its creative combat and level design, surprisingly good art direction, and plot/dialogue which vaccilates from serious to snarky to self-effacing. An aRPG that takes itself seriously, but not TOO seriously. Worth a playthrough if you're fond of the genre.			"

												This was a pretty fun ARPG/hack-n-slash. The game story is interesting and the mechanics are pretty fluid which is important I think in these types of games.I just played a run through on normal kind of taking my time and experiencing the story. Very possible to finish the game in 20-30 hours or less. I thought the end was lack luster and didn't even know I ""beat"" the game until I didn't know where to go next and looked online for a tip. Apparently that was it. Only thing left to do is maybe play on a harder level or treasure hunt or achievement hunt.I also thought that the mechanics of not being able to re-kill bosses in the story mode was a bit strange and you would have to go into endless story or something. TL;DRGame was fun to play, story was interesting, nothing extraordinary but worth it if you like hack-n-slash killin' loads of monsters.			"

												Very fun Diablo/Path of Exile style game but with a few things that improve on that. The control you have over your companion is beautiful. You can set them up to fight melee or ranged style combat and even switch stances on the fly. You can also have them pick up loot for you and even decide which kinds of loot and quality level of the loot. Graphics are very good with big chunks of body parts flying when you explode them and building pools of blood if you fight in same area for a battle. Very original and fun storyline with great bits of humor thrown in.			"

												Not a bad game, much like Diablo 2 and similar style games, complete with tech/skill trees - my one big issue is that instead of fighting a couple tough monsters at a time, you fight a horde of wimpy ones most of the time.  I find that boring and it requires less strategy, it's more of a click-fest  than I'd like.  Still, for 15 bucks I can't expect TOO much and the game isn't bad so far.			"

But in general not bad at allSound 7Combat 7Story 7Character progression 6 - I maxed out my character at lvl 30, that means no more skill advancement. Maxed Perks lvl 10. all about 80% of the way through the game. I like a game that leaves alot of room to grind and add new abilities before you finish.  General game mechanics 8 - Lots of small ways to improve items and add enchantments. Getting around is easy(quick). And you can reset your and your companions skills and base numbers at certain vendors if you see that you made an error.Overall 7 of 10...			"

												I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.Story:I was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a  instead of a  was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old ""hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)"", but there's nothing wrong with that.Gameplay:If you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.Graphics:The graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.Music:While playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.The voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the ""Mantis Bug Tracker"" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.But all in all, a really good game.

												I don't want to compare it to Diablo II beyond the fact that the game play is nearly identical (is that a bad thing?). The game itself is completely different in any other aspect (atmosphere, art, music, dialogue). I have almost 20 hours clocked with this version, I completed it and I have exactly zero complaints. If you like the point and click attacking, crafting weapons with bonuses, quest type games like Diablo or Torchlight, you need to add this to the list. The developer has proven themselves as far as I'm concerned.			"

												Just great game, better voice acting than every other Hack & Slash game around the market. i had extreme fun time with Thaumaturge. Only negative point of the game is short game play time. If you compare this game with other same genre games you will find it this game is not repetitive.			"

												Thought I done a review for this already? Anyway a quick one, like Titan's Quest but better, funny dynamic between Van Helsing and his Ghost chick buddy, solid controls, nice amount of level up / skill tree optios with a good pacing to the points. Good visual variation and plenty of good quests / side quests / toughy enemies to keep you busy!			"

												Summary: Guide Van Helsing the famous monster-slayer through a tounge and cheek adventure killing baddies and looting corspses.Time until completion: 15 hours.Pros: - A pretty game.- Controls well. KB/M or gamepad.- Servicable enough story that doesnt take itself too seriously.  It even throws in some pop culture references i giggled at now and then.- Loot.- Fun skillsCons:- Camera. The camera is static and the geometry never becomes transparent in the slightest if your character goes behind it. - Crafting. While you can combine runes to make new runes or slot runes in weapons, it in no way tells you what you can or cant combine. It just leaves you constantly trying combinations until something works.  This made me basically just never use it.- Skill tree. While the skills themselves are fine, the max level is 30 and you have to have certain skills to unlock others. Because of this, there is simply no way you can diversify your skills if you want to be effective by the endgame. It seems like the max level should be almost double so you can actually use all the skills. You can reset them and re-allocate them, but you are still limited to so many points going into all skills.- Difficulty spikes.  Probably my biggest complaint.  There were so many times i would just be almost 1 hot killed going into a wave of enemies. It never seemed like there was an alternative way to approach these situations.  You simply die and re-start at the last checkpoint (or base) and keep hacking away at the same group of enemies until they die. This seemed silly. I thought I would be recommending this, but I find it hard to with the difficulty issues in particular. You would be better off playing Titan Quest or another APRG that is better balanced.Overall, I would give this a 60% or so.  The few issues I have really impacted the game too much.			"

												So, this is a diablo clone. Alright. It is what it is, and for what it is, tt's fairly polished. The monsters, being selected from slavic myth, are interesting, the dialogue between Van Helsing and the ghost is moderately entertaining, but...it's just lacking some of the intangibles that make diablo work.Also a couple of tangibles, like being able to retreat from an optional dungeon if you find out it's beyond your abilities. There are things like that, but really, it's just missing that special something that made the diablo games work. Even Diablo 3 had more of the old magic than this, unfortunately.			"

												Set in the supernatural world of steampunk monster hunting, you play as one of the ""nameless"" offspring of the legendary monster hunter Van Helsing. Aided by your companion, a ghost named Lady Katarina, the two of you work together to try and find out what causes such strife in the land of Borgovia, and how you can solve the issues of the folks there plagued by dark horrors.Do not buy this game for the combat, graphics or anything like it. You're really only buying it for two reasons: Multiplayer, and the dialogue between Helsing and Lady Katarina. Beyond that, nothing interesting.			"

Posted: January 4, 2014
												Let me start off with by telling you what type of game The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is; its an ARPG. This is similar to  games such as Diablo and Torchlight. So essentially, top down camera, lots of monsters, and most importantly lots and lots of loot. So why should you get this game. Van Helsing takes elements from many different sources in the fantasy and science fiction genres. The includes everything from Lord of the Rings to Monty Python for fantasy and Star Wars to Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy for science fiction. This is a game that knows its target audience very well and caters to them, but not so much as to take away from the actual game. Still you will notice nods to different things and they fit within the theme of the game very well. The gameplay is very solid, but it may take some getting used to if you don't play this game very often. It still uses WASD just not for movement, you use only the mouse for movement and attacks. However it is pretty intuitive and takes no time to get used to. The mobs you fight are a bit of challenge and you will die quite often in the early stages but its enjoyable to get better as the game progresses. To summarize this game was made with the thought of the player in mind and it really shows in the final product. There are some bugs here and there but the developers, Neocore Games, is very responsive to player issues and timely with patches. If you are on the fence about getting this I would reccomend this game to anyone who is up for a good adventure.			"

As I tell my friends ""the voices aren't as bad as Oblivion"" and if you played that game then you know what I mean.			"

												After debating back and forth many times, this game cannot be recommened. Even with notable RPG elements, there was always a promient drawback. It is very obvious there is a lack of skill and character variation. The maximum level is 30 which greatly restricts the overall gameplay, making combat EXTREMELY repetitive. Sadly, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is not the game that will reimburse its buyers with endless hours of enjoyment. ARPG fans will find a much better experience with other similar, but much better, titles such as Torchlight II.			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic game, and an incredibly well-crafted ARPG. Katarina is easily one of my new favorite NPC companions. The subtle little jokes are just the ice cream on the cake, and some are snuck in pretty well.Combat is intense and rewarding, sorta like Diablo on crack. The skill trees and perk system flow together very well, straightforward and to the point. Though there plenty of room for customization and easch playthrough could be vastly different from the last.Picked this up during the holiday steam sale and I wish I had bought it at full price to better support the developers. Easily worth every penny, one of my personal new favorites. "

												Brief review:The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a really solid action-RPG with the same level of polish and story as other post-Diablo 2 games in the genre such as Titan Quest and Path of Exile. Highlights for me were:* The power-up system that had you do a little more thinking about what buttons to press when;* Your companion, Lady Katarina, who not only offers more customisation options, but also provides grin-worthy banter with your protagonist; and* The various design decisions that lead to a much more streamlined ARPG experience, including being able to toggle monster respawn, sending Katarina back to town to sell weapons, the 'sell all' and 'organise' inventory buttons, and much more.Recommended for any fans of the Diablo series that were disappointed with D3 and are looking for a cheap, well-themed alternative (and don't want to be part of the hardc0re ARPG scene with Path of Exile).Podcast:To hear a podcast with extended impressions on this game, tune in to its episode onTim and Phill Talk About Games: http://www.timandphill.com/2013/12/24/taptag-006-bram-stokers-brains-edition/ "

												Gostei:1. História: bom trabalho de roteiro;2. Grágicos muito bons;3. O personagem pode ser evoluído do modo que bem entender (skills e atributos);4. O NPC pode ser configurado para colher itens que caem no chão automaticamente;5. O sistema de comparação de itens sendo utilizados e no inventário é excelente, no melhor estilo que já vi;6. As batalhas são bem feitas;7. Há conversas entre o personagem e o NPC, depois de um tempo fica um pouco repetitivo, mas gosto mesmo assim.8. Há momentos no jogo que o jogador só podefazer uma escolha correta se explorou detalhes de placas ou papéis com texto em parede (perguntas feitas por wisps), podia até aparecer um pouco mais;9. Boa variedade de monstros em cada nível;10. Não há uma base disponível logo no início do jogo, se chega a ela depois.Não gostei:1. Não tem cliente nativo para o Linux;2. Mapas são sempre iguais e não gerados ao criar o jogo, e pior: ocupam a maioria do espaço em disco utilizado pelo jogo, vários gigabytes;3. Demora bastante para carregar os mapas;4. Há somente uma base principal, eu acharia mais interessante se houvesse mais bases intermediárias;5. Máximo de somente 4 jogadores em modo multiplayer;6. Não se pode controlar ao mesmo tempo do teclado/mouse e do joystick, aliás, se o joystick estiver ligado, não há opção de usar o teclado;7. Ficou um pouco curto. Não cada fase, os mapas tem um tamanho bom, mas ficaria melhor com mais mapas.Não gostava mas modificaram:1. Agora os monstros de fases já completas voltam ao começar um novo jogo, antes não voltam;2. O suporte a controle era muito falho, agora está ótimo exceto por não poder mudar para teclado/mouse se este estiver ligado no momento que o jogo é iniciado. Ainda assim acho mais fácil teclado e mouse devido a maior facilidade e disponibilidade de configuração e comandos imediatos.Conclusão:O jogo é legal e vale seu preço, cerca de dez dólares.			"

												I love this game, I beat it with the original hunter class but right now I'm going through it with the Tharmaturge class, and might I say it is the best DLC I have ever purchased, although it should have been in the game in the first place. I love the combat and the balance to the games items, giving you just enough power in the new guns, swords, gauntlets, ect... You feel like a total badass after you have your favorite setup throughout the skill tree, powers, auras, and perks. For instance I have both of the Ice and Lightning skills maxed out (which is simple but effective), I have a dash to get away from danger since as a Tharmaturge I am easy to kill and the secondary power allows me to expend all of my mana in order to do a significant amount of damage. Almost everything in this game, I love, the only bad thing to me is that the second part isn't going to be out for a little while. So Neocore please make the game soon and if possible have to where if we played the first one we can bring over our character, oh and add some randomized dungeons, more customization options and more character classes i.e. Frankenstein's monster, Werewolfs, and Vampires. (They all exist in the lore) As you can see I love this game, and do I reccomend it, HELL YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to play with me send me a friend request we can play.			"

												A surprisingly enjoyable hack n' slash aRPG experience. Steals many of the best ideas from the Diablo and Torchlight series, and adds its own unique twists. It's from a Hungarian developer, and shows some obvious signs of its n0t-astronomical budget: some janky animations and snaggy terrain textures, terrible voice acting for minor characters (caveat: the voice work for the main characters is actually quite good), and a rough looking (and feeling) UI. However, the game redeems itself with its creative combat and level design, surprisingly good art direction, and plot/dialogue which vaccilates from serious to snarky to self-effacing. An aRPG that takes itself seriously, but not TOO seriously. Worth a playthrough if you're fond of the genre.			"

												tldr story and voice acting make this enjoyable for some time.This game is fun for exactly 20h i.e. the first time you play through the story. It has some nice humor. The skill set is kinda meh. I think Torchlight is a more polished game, even though you use at most 2 skills there. The bugs are mostly fixed by now. But the difficulty is not balanced.			"

												I can recommend this game mainly because it is fun and easy to play. I played with an XBox controller but found a couple of glitches where I had to unplug to get to the next level.  Compared to torchlight it is just slightly lacking imo the overall quality is down a little.  Cool special abilities but nothing really new.  I got my moneys worthy and enjoyed most of my time with this title.  I would play agian if I didn't have so many other game in my library that haven't been touched.			"

												I have played PoE Beta, Torchlight 1 & 2, Diablo 1, 2 and 3. This game beats them all except for maybe Diablo 2 with Expansion during its heyday. Van Helsing is fun and unique with witty dialogue and snappy writing. You actually get rewarded for exploring your entire map. The loot is fun (no AH). You can play offline if it's just single player. You can also play online (public or steam friends only) with up to 4 people in co-op (password or sans). Your companion picks up stuff like potions, crafting mats and different levels of unique or common gear depending on how you set her. She can also be sent to town to sell, as well as buy a specifically designated number of potions; She's sassy too. You have enchanting as well as alchemy for upgrading your gear. You make decisions in dialogue even that impact your gameplay more true to table-top role playing games! Yes, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is addictive and yes, the story is fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys top-down action rpgs. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is what Diablo 3 should have been.[ Also, I just go the DLC tonight and I am enjoying my Arcane Mechanic, which can be played with pets. I have yet to try the Thaumargist (sp?), which appears to be a steampunk version of a mage. I do like the steampunkish feel of hte game. The artwork is quite good. ]			"

												If you like ARPGs, you can't go wrong with this game.This game is a well done, ARPG. Katarina, your companion throughout the game, is extremely useful and a valuable tool. The game has three classes, but I've only done the basic hunter class. It was a pretty fun experience. I played on heroic though, and some times it could be very difficult. Since when is that a bad thing though? However, I found myself stuck at a few points, having to grind for better gear or level up more, just to advance the story. For someone who doesn't have the patience, that can be a draw back. Graphics are great, sound is great, dialogue and story is ok, though the twist with science gone mad is pretty neat.7/10			"

												A great game for hardcore dungeon crawlers. It requires you to masterize a complex set of abilities and skills and get a deep understaning of their benefits and usage. It takes time, but you can fully configure your character to make it fit your gaming style and strategy. I've played it with a friend in coop, from start to end, and we decided to specialize in complementary abilities to get an edge in battle. It was really fun, specially in the Tower Defense sections. If you are a Diablo3 lover, get this one, it won't disappoint you.			"

												The game Diablo 3 wanted to be. It has a number of moments that I actually laughed out of pure stupidity. The graphics are suprisingly good and the voice acting fits the mood. In my opinion this is one of the best hack and slach games. Way better than Torchlight which just got boring really fast. It's fun. Not too hard and not too easy on normal diffuclty. I like the idea of the talking ghost companion. Adds ""chemistry"" to the game (a bit). I highly recommend it			"

												A fun and fairly accessible game, this is really very well made considering its price. The combat is quite fast and punchy and you get into the systems of the game surpisingly fast. In the long run the fairly limited skill trees may be a problem - the included character has one for melee and one for ranged, and the other characters are DLC and only have one tree each - but for a casual rampage this is very good indeed.

												Weird little title I picked up at half price. I've played maybe a 1/3rd of the game, not 100% sure. The game's massive size of 20 gigs would imply thre is a lot of content. Here's the Pros: Good Aesthetic, clearly steampunk but not in a funky sort of way because they don't just add cogs to crap. A top hat, is well, just a top hat. A gun is a gun. No need to add a bunch of wierd junk to it! Gameplay is intense, without feeling like you're going to get gibbed the next second and can course correct if things start going downhill. (Negative on Diablo 3.) Story is simple, but fun type. You're the son of the legendary monster hunter, which has a Dutch name but lives in England... who's been called back into service to hunt down not monsters, but mad scientists in an Eastern European country. It's simple, but they keep the narrative up through the story. I'll mark this up for: It's a hack and slash RPG. Diablo 3 did better, but Torchlight 2 story lacks an clear overarching goal (Kill... the alchemist maybe?) that makes the game difficult to play after a while. Finally, the companion is optional. If you don't want her to particpate, you can turn her passive which gives a passive bonus and all her auras, but she doesn't particpate and you can just act like she's not there. Also, the game understands it swaps you with guys and provides you with ample abilities to counter that. Cons: I'll say the skill tree is limited. Very limited. There's about four viable paths, and two sets of focuses. Ranged or Melee, each with a physical and magical option. I think there's a mixed physical/magical option down the center, which would imply a third tree. If you could play as maybe other famous monster hunters or characters from the period it might help! Voice Acting is... sub-par. Not abysmal, thankfully the two main characters, Katarina has an acceptable voice actor and Van Helsing's is actually decent. I could listen to the dude talk at me for a while! THe villagers just seem unmotive. The Vampire's voice actor is worth a few lols at how overthe top he is. I will admit I do like the voice acting on the Robot-Line Infantry. They sound approiately distorted yet mechanical for magical robots. Music: Is there music? I don't know, I don't remember it well. I'd say that's a problem, because when I love music. I love it, a lot, I don't forget it! So clearly not much there. Weapons are limited to swords (Two hander or dual wielding) and guns (Rifles, shotguns, or Dual Wield pistols). I think that's more to do with Van Helsing lore and his training, but still, again, limitation of ability isn't a positive in a game like this.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is not a long game, about 15 hours or so all up to complete the storyline, but it is time well spent in my opinion.  In a nutshell, you are the son of the famous monster hunter and vampire slayer, who answers a call for help (sent to your father) from the fictional eastern european country of Borgovia.  Van Helsing travels with the Lady Katarina, a ghost bound to the family's service and it's the byplay between these two characters that I extremely well done.  While Katarina assists Van Helsing in combat with her abilities (which can be upgraded and new ones learned as the game progresses), she also has a number of things to say about Van Helsing's actions (as guided by the player) throughout the game.  There are some wonderful lines she comes out with that made me laugh.  There are also a number of references to other things (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy being one of them), all of which are neatly tied into the narrative.  The game does finish on a cliffhanger after you confront the mad scientist, so if this game does appeal, you will probably want to invest in the second and third installments to continue the story.   As for mechanics, it's pretty simple and straight forward.  I used a controller and for the most part had no issues though there is one thing that I feel was badly designed.  The D pad has 4 functions, down to bring up the map, left and right to use a healing or mana potion and up to teleport to the current ""home base"".  The first time I teleported I had no idea what I'd done (or that I'd managed to hit up on the D pad).  Once I'd worked out what was happening, it became a bit of a bugbear in the middle of combat - go to drink a healing potion, miss and next thing you know you've teleported back to base.  While at times it got me out of a nasty fight, it was frustrating, so it's something to be aware of and you may want to investigate changing the keybind to either the Left Trigger or Bumper.Overall I really enjoyed The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, it had a good mix of environments, an engaging narrative with good characters, particularly Katarina who is think was just brilliant.  There aren't any puzzles to tax your mind, but if you are looking for something where you can check your brain, hack and slash your way around Borgovia and have a ghost pick on you, then I highly recommend it.

												This game is awesome, really, it's very much like Diablo but fun. I haven't played the multi-player just the single player story. It's engaging, it is full of random film references the fights are challenging without being unfair and there is plenty of hidden content to get on with.It also has a tower defense element to it later in the game where you have to defend your base against swarms of enemies by placing traps and fighting off the horde. OK you only have 1 class to play (Van Helsing) and a skill tree which means you will either specialist in Melee or Ranged with a bit of magic thrown in. If I was honest, this is a much better game than Diablo 3, it doesn't force you to play and complete the game 3 times just to get to the challenging levels. A worthy purchase.			"

												4/10Szóval hol kezdjem ....A játék ""jónak"" indult a grafika nem nagy szám de megfelel nem anyira látványos de ezzel nincs bajom ezér meg kapja a 10 pontból az első 2-et. Szóval haladjunk sorjába. A játék elmeséli a történetet bár közel sem anyira látványosan mint ahogy gondolnánk pár kép kocka 30 perc duma és kész.. a történet elmegy ""egész jó"" de semmi egyedit nem kecsegtett de + 2 pont jár neki ami igy már 4/10 . Most jön a kérdés..: akkor mi a helyzett? 4/10 és a többiről nem is beszéltél.. akkor most mivan? Ezt a játékok nagyon túl becsülik. kezdetben 1 karaktert készíthetünk amit különbözőképpen építhetünk. Testreszabás lehetőség kimerül a 10 féle színű ugyanolyan ruhából. +2 karkter fizetős dlc-ből jön. Ez nagy pofátlanság máshol alap a minimum 4 karakter itt meg 3 van és abból is 2 fizetős.. (hozáteszem maga a 2 dlc drágább egyenként mint a maga a játék),Nem baj mindegy lehet ettől még jó nem? hát nem, következő hibák 2013 ban megjellent játék-ban nehogy már netudjanak egy-egy szörny/ember/valami -ből legalább 3 fajtát csinálni.. szégyen jön 2millió ugyanolyan ember Klón megölni egy harcban. Pazar az a tény is hogy minimális animációk vannak 3 féle ütés + 6 féle varázslat.... ÉS a Magyar fejlesztésű játékba nem fért bele Magyar szinkrón de MÉG EGY NORMÁLIS MAGYAR FELIRAT SEM. Anyám elnézést de mi az hogy félig magyar félig nem ??? a szöveg közepén angol az előt meg utána meg Magyar?? Úristen, a játék elvileg online Játokot is tudd de ezt felejtsük el mert azon kivül hogy néha müködik néha bemongya a halált ,... ha még is sikerül elindulni akkor is ROHADTUL BUGOS, Igy 2 év távlatában is amikor megvettük 2 -en a haverommal a 3 . küldin nem tudtunk tovább menni mert a bug nem engedte ,,, az adott szőrny csoport amit lekellett volna kaszálni mindig újá éllet és az ami előidézte meg 3 millio HP-ja volt. (akkor még kb 20-akat csapsz) Singleplayerbe tovább lehet menni igaz.. de multiba nem és ez nem mentség .. és amikor kikerültük külön-külön singlibe ezt a buggot akkor meg egy másik jőt. Az online funkció ""Uslees"" . Singlibe is rengetek bug van az átvezetők elcsusznak mintha tört játékkal játszanék.A karakter fellet a a felirat elcsuszik a kamera fekete kockákat mutatt -- olykor nem látn isemmit. Azon kivűl egy - egy pozitivum ,hogy az Angol szinkron király és a párbeszédek sem rosszak.. de ez egyszerüen nem elég. Vannak secretek de azok inkább unalmasak mint érdekesek. Már javítani tuti nem fogják szóval ezt érdemes hagyni. A 2. résszel nem játszottam azt hallotam az nagyon jó lett . De ezt az élményt kihagytam volna. Még ugyis hogy mind össze 5 dolláromba azaz kemény 1000 per száz FT-ba fájt a game. hiába Magyar fejleszésű egyszerüen ez sajnálatos... Nem értem miért vagyok én az első aki ez leírja..			"

												Bought this game as I love top down games and this one reminded me greatly of Diablo as I started the game I thought I could play as a purely melee character but I quickly found out other wise you need to find some spells that you can use to your advantage the story is great but has abrupt quest ends I found that I was fighting the final boss with out even knowing but none the less a great game the intergretion between number 1 and 2 is nice being able to import your character so you can pick up where you left off			"

												Pretty entertaining with great visuals and soundtrack, steampunk art style and smooth combat. Some interesting features which I've not come across in the ARPG genre before. All together an interesting game, albeit with a pretty poor loot and economy system compared to the more popular games in the genre - hence online play is a ghost town.			"

												I'm posting this review after I've just finished the game in Normal mode. Yeah, this is not a review for those Professional/Hardcore gamers who want difficulty at every step.TL;DR Good Hack and Slash Game. 7/10 . But buy this game during sales. I bought it at $5.09. In my opinion anywhere below $10 is worth it. Above it, not so much. Broader Explanation:I personally view these Hack and Slash kind of games as either of the two things:a) A tool for some excellant story telling.orb) Stress relief where I'm simply entertained after playing this game.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is pretty good at both of these categories.Not a bad story line with decent continuity and fun enough game on the destroy-everything-in-sight front as well.A few points:Story line and Ambience is Good- 7/10Re-Playability is lower than that of Torchlight II. Meaning its average- 5 /10Item Complexity, enchanting, Visual effects of items- 6/10Skill Points, Ability Points and general Magic/Ability in-game- 6/10Graphics/Visual Ambience- 5/10 in some parts and 7/10 in some parts. Satisfaction- 7/10So I would put this game on a solid 7/10			"

												Another Diablo clone kiting simulator. People say Potion spamming is exploitative but I say so is kiting. Not to mention kiting is tedious. If you want tedious this game is for you. Idk how people can support these games claiming to be ""ARPG"" but farming items and kiting thousands of worthless mobs is not action. Maybe there should be less mobs in general so when you do get swarmed by a lot it's actually interesting or at least a surprise. Overall game intensity starts kind of high but then never changes and that too contributes to the tedium. If you love diablo 3, 8/10. If you love to be entertained when playing a game 2/10.			"

												Not bad for an indie game, but if you liked RPGs like Path of Exile, Titan Quest or Diablo, I'm not really sure u will enjoy this game.Character's build personalization is really poor and objects give no variety to the game; Also, imao it's not challenging enough: enemies are really easy to defeat... Another thing I don't like is the fact that the games forces you to have a ""pet"" (Miss Always-in-front-of-your-balls Katarina); a feature i really don't like.In the end-If you're interested in an easy adventure story, buy it.-If you like Hack n' Slash/RPGs like Diablo or Titan Quest and you like farming to get a crazy build, avoid this like a pestilence.

												The Incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a great RPG that i would definetly recommend .The narrative is intersting , the dialogs are well written , the graphics are pretty good but the environment is really what made me love this game . My brother bought it for me so we could play together which we did but my computer couldn't handle it and i got bored quick . But when i got a new computer i re-installed steam and the game , that i was finally able to play in full quality with 60 FPS and i really got into it , i finished the game on my own ( turns out me and my brother didn't make it really far) and i like the game so much that i bought the dlc characters and finished the game with them aswell . The game really reminded me of my favorite RPG to this day : Champions of Norrath that i used to play on PS2 with my brother and that's what i really liked about it , the talent tree is very complete and there are many ways you can customise your character ( style , items , skills , talents , and of course same goes for lady katarina ) I would reccomend the game (i liked it even more that Diablo 3 for a reason still unknown to me , maybe the nostalgia factor ) but only if your PC can manage to make it run smoothly , because there are plenty of loading screens that can get frustrating if it takes you 30 secs to load .

												This game is honestly nothing new, but takes what is established, and runs with it exceedingly well. It is very willing to kill you right out of the gate, but its a good thing. Plenty of options, tough foes, super hard bosses, and what makes the action rpg setting good. It runs smoothly, looks very nice, and uses the titan quest style approach to your skills. All good points. The nature of perks, adds some nice options, innate aura's and spells to adjust or not, as you want. All and all, this is a well done action rpg, its nothing new, but it makes sure what is fun, what is good, is polished and smooth for gameplay.			"

												I can say after giving this game and it's sequel the old college try that I cannot recommend this game. At first, the game was light and funny, but the big aspect of this game (what with being a diablo clone) is combat, and if you are lacking in that aspect, then the rest of your game is going to suffer; and that is almost exactly what happened to this game. The game is quite laggy almost all the time, and the game swarms you with so many enemies with so much health that fighting them feels like trying to knock out a mountain with nothing but a toothpick. I'm not saying that fights should be easy, but even on normal mode, trash mobs take way too much damage before they go down, and more attacks should have more effective AOE.I chose to play as a ranged character after giving the game a few early tries, and found I was nothing but frustrated. Enemies which were basically living artillery were able to instakill me as soon as they saw me, and I found myself running around like a madman taking 5-8 shots to take out a single enemy which had 20 others just like it right behind. In brief, combat was long, tedious and I would see future mobs coming at me not with the glee of popping their heads off, but with resignation as they were just another obstacle between me and my final goal. An obstacle which, I had wiped out at least 12 of in the past play session.In short: Even after putting all my skillpoints into body and dex, I still didn't have enough health to survive encounters, or enough damage to make fighting monsters not feel like a chore. In Diablo, I can wipe out a dungeon in 15 minutes on high torment levels. In this game, I'd be lucky to wipe out a map section in what feels like three times that.And as a final tip to the developer: writing achievements is fine, but DO NOT make an achievement that says ""Don't kill a monster type"" in a game where you have been patting my back for killing everything that moves, then putting that monster type all over the map, then having them attack me with flamethrowers doing an insubstantial amount of damage, and when I do kill it not allow me to go back and un-kill that monster. Same goes for that ""Fight the final boss without destroying any spawn towers"", because I sustain Fulmugati will be almost indestructible if you don't. "

												I decided to play The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing after viewing the trailer, and getting some exhaustion from Diablo III and Torchlight 2. This one seemed to be a decent Hack & Slash, with a nice twist regarding the setting of central Europa and possibly legions of blood-sucking foes.In this game, you play a single character, Van Helsing, who is followed by a ghostly teammate, Katarina. You don't have to choose a class before playing, and just develop your character along the way, using several skill trees.Basically, you can eradicate a significant amount of monsters by using either a sword or a gun. Each weapon has its specific skill tree with numerous styles of slashes and shots. Each one can be leveled up, or customized with additional powers, triggered by Rage. Also, you can wander in the side of magic by learning strikes blending physical and magical damage, even pure magical damage. If not enough, you can learn passive abilities and active spells, that can take advantage of some specific situations or simply save your butt - leaving you with a fair amount of combinations to craft.The amount of damage you do or can endure is proportional to basic weapon and armor stats, plus the different levels of your character stats and skills, combined with the multiple bonuses you can get from gear. Very similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. So don't fall in love with that particular weapon or gear if the next one is seamingly up a notch, the impact could be tremendous.On top of that, your translucent female sidekick is not only witty, but can be used either as a melee fighter, a ranged shooter or a decent support. She also can level up and has her own gear and skill tree to become a tactical partner or a stat multiplier.At this point, it's pretty clear that this game targets an audience that loves to analyse how hundred skills relate to each other, carefully crafting the most badass character possible, something like ""hit once, obliterate many"". It's a good thing to have a significant amount of depth that way (remember Titan Quest !) but for me it was just like ""too much"". So I decided to focus on a restricted number of skills, low enough to keep me focused on the actual map cleaning.The game is linear, with some quests on the side. The levels are not really beautiful but varied, and the enemies compensate lack of intelligence by sheer number. Luckily, the dialog between Van Helsing and Katarina are funny so you can have a good time playing them.Something that kinda puzzled me was the introduction of a micro-game of Tower Defense. Not that it wasn't interesting or refreshing, but it seemed that the developers decided to put everything remotely cool in the game, thus pushing it in the Land of Blended Genre where chances of survival are slim. Luckily, the Tower Defense micro-game is nicely done, but too much thin for consideration. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good Hack & Slash, that can satisfy seasoned players, but could be daunting to newcomers.			"

												Okay starting with the basics, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a action role play game where you play the role of a demon hunter that is no less than the son of Van Helsing to stop the evil plans of a mad scientist, you will be able to choose between diferent classes that will define your combat style while fighting the forces of evil, this game will definitely provide you with a good experience for those looking for games like Diablo or Torclight, it has a very good environment that fits very well with the background music, depending the difficult that you choose before starting the game you may either be whining about how easy the game is or crying frustrated because of the hardcore difficulty, though the game lacks a bit of story since is the classic generated storyline, you will often find yourself in a conversation 1 minute long and then 1 hour killing minions, then another 1 minute conversation and killing again, some may say it is still a nice opening for the second game,  also it has  funny situations that makes you want to play more and more, and there's a talking cow!!! it's definitely worth your time as it was with mine, wana know if I'm lying? try it yourself.I hereby give permission to play this game as it passed the test.

												I will say the early versions were pretty buggy and I had one that wiped my save and bugged the DLC forever. Just recently I will say I reinstalled and everything seem to be working as it should. Gameplay wise it great, with a awesome mini-tower defence game that shakes things up, esp if you don't own D3 or don't like PoE. Haven't tested multi to see if that's still bugged or not, but i'd say a 3.5-5 only due to the DLC feeling more microtransaction like than dlc really. Bu then again we live in a era where DLC is spelled MICRO...			"

Decent graphics and effects.Cons: Lame story, the ending was disappointing and abrupt. Not too much feels cohesive. The main plot seems to be a device to get you from one location to the next.Recap, if you like playing a game for the mechanics, it's an enjoyable ride. The character and story development is weak, the quests are bland, which is a shame because this could've been easily a fantastic game with a little more help on the writing side. Still a fairly fun game, just unsatisfying ultimately.7/10			"

												This game is bugged enough to annoy you while playing, but at least you want to play it. Unfortunately, I've run in to so much nonsense that I can't really stand to play it sometimes. 1. Using a controller, for some reason here and there it just can't seem to get to certain slots on the inventory. Of course they had to be annoying and make it a stupid circle. They couldn't be bothered to make it up and down. This gets really frustrating when your inventory is full or you get a good item and you want to equip it... might as well forget it. 2. Randomly my attacks don't work, they stop firing projectiles or making the animation and I have to either teleport to town or restart the game. 3. Sometimes can't connect, and sometimes horrendus lag. I look at how many people are playing and theres roughly 400 per day... and I imagine some of those aren't even online. 4. They've updated this game many times but never fixed these issues, and if you play you know they exist. So either the developers don't play or they don't care about their game. Don't bother playing this one, you aren't missing anything.			"

												A disclaimer: I have only attempted to play this game in co-op.So far this is a tale of two things:1) A very enjoyable ARPG which brings a very good set of monster smashing tools to the fore, and then inhibits your ability to enjoy them with a non stop loot lottery which takes considerable time to manage.2) Bugs. Bugs. Bugs.  Trying to play in co-op has been so incredibly painful with crashing, failed connections and myriad other inconsistencies it feels very much like an early beta feature.  This is very disappointing because point #1 spurs my friend and I to play and then point #2 rears it's ugly head and smashes all that desire down.Overall, if you are planning to play solo, I recommend the game to any fan of ARPGs.If you were hoping for a co-op smash with your friends?  Come back in a few months.			"

												This is a great game. Some of the things I like: controller support so I can sit back with my XBox 360 controller, plus with the Blue Blood DLC your companion becomes a very effective tank. It also works well with nVidia 3D but the text becomes a bit hard to read. The game is very well balanced (and frequently patched). I am working on a mage build. A couple of things I don't like is having to buy classes as DLC, also Town Portal is broken. You can town portal out of combat - even with bosses. Also when you return back from a town portal, you are likely to be mobbed by every enemy in the area - very painful if you exit the game after clearing an area out and then restart it.			"

												For the genre of ARPG this game stands out among those like Path of Exile and Torchlight as the spiritual successors to Diablo 2.   What makes this game more unique is its story, and its skill system.   It takes the story of Van Helsing and throws you into the very midst of a gothic era where monsters rule the landscape.    With only the basic class to choose from unless you get DLC there isn't much variety in the terms of classes, but in my opinion the DLC is worth the price because it gives you two other, very unique classes to play that give a very distinct flavor to the game with each class you play.  With a full fledged multiplayer system, friends make this game even more enjoyable as you go on a monster hunting romp through a forest with your buddies.All in all, 8/10. Would Play.			"

												Reviewing this after more than 300 hours of play and after the XBox fix that ruined level reqs  for all farmed gear, etc.(since patched) and after finding out there is no character import feature in VH3 and all the other negatives there, etc.  I still love the game, and I still give it the highest of ratings for replayabily, skills system, quests, characters, artwork and location maps. The coding...not so much, but the game is quite unbuggy and playable in the main at this time. I definitely recommend it as one of the best aRPG's I've played since Diablo1&2  and TQIT. I also think the developers have consistently patched and fixed and improved both VH1 & 2, and give them props for that. I have high hopes they will fix the newest game and integrate the three chapters into one consistent experience before it's all over. That said, I would definitely wait awhile before buying VH3.			"

												Me and hubby bought this whilst it was on sale.I do like my hack 'n' slash games, i loved Diablo 2 with its expansion LoD loved that so much i have two copies.. original disks and the battle chest... but as i was saying i do like the HnS genre so when hubs saw this and even he was interested in it, i was like yup get it!Its fun, the story line is awesome, the mobs are interesting to say the least all be it short but it has replay value, thank goodness for no random map generator and the fact you can turn OFF mob spawns so when you return to an area you dont have to deal with the pesky buggers again.Sometimes the dialog is a little squiffy IE sounds like some of the NPC voices where bored as sin reading there script, but VH's voice is delish, Kats quips are funny, and the amount of references through out the game play is friggin awesome!All in all i do recommend this game. I have yet to run into any bugs or glitches, crashes nothing.			"

												This game is a shame. It starts quite well, but as soon as you are progressing through the game, the flaws appear very clearly.The maps are very small and therefore, instead of creating more areas, the devs have favored the overfilling of the few maps with thousands of monsters. Yes that's true it's a H&S, but in this game the maps are literally overcrowded by unimaginative packs of monsters.Second disappointment is when your realize that the game mechanics are botched up : adding strength also add life (good for melee fighters). If you choose to play as ranged characters, you'll have to split your stats between dexterity (ranged) and strength (for not being insta-killed by the endless swarms mentioned above), and therefore preventing your ranged character to dispatch efficiently the monsters (who are packed tight).Therefore the game is heavily favored and unbalanced at best. Combat versus the final boss is also a freaking pain to play : you have to run around in circles for literally 20 minutes (check the videos on youtube), praying that the boss and the sarm of werewolves-on-steroids will not one-shot you, as you can't save during this combat.Avoid this game by all cost, this deceiving game is not worth your trouble.

												I really wanted to like this game.  It has a very setting being in the Van Helsing Universe. As well as great production value. But the core mechanics of the game are very lacking.  Every time I engage in combat the frame rate drops rather considerably despite what setting it is on. Also the combat lacks a tactile feel to it making it feel rather shallow instead of engaging. The menues are not as well developed or organize then they need to be.  And I find the map and quest design to be somewhat generic. I  don't find this game very enjoyable because of these faults. Maybe the sequal recify these problems that I have but this version dissapointed me. :(			"

												It's a good game and for the price you can't really go wrong. Don't expect anything genrebreaking. But it is thoroughly enjoyable. It's a pretty easy game (although i only play on normal, so i guess it would be harder on higher difficulties.) The surroundings are pretty beautiful and diverse, although the graphics are not amazing. But thats okay for a ARPG. The battle system is pretty funny, there are a lot of different skills and attacks and auras. There are a lot of diverse enemies with a lot of different skills, but still you dont really need different tactics to defeat them. I play as a ranged character and basically you just shoot the enemies and run circles around them, most engagements can be won very easily, and even if you should have problems, you can buy infinite potions and you will have a looooot of money. (Like every game really, i don't understand why there never is a game where money is scarce). The game is missing a real tutorial, in the beginning there are a lot of things you will not immediately understand, but after some hours you will. But yeah, 10€ for well over 10 hours of good gameplay should be a no-brainer. "

												A decent ARPG, similar to the Torchlight series in that you have a helper NPC who will fight and sell loot for you. The setting is gothic, in the sense of Dracula and Frankenstein, with strong eastern European mythological trappings.Be warned that it can be weirdly buggy (stashes in both off-line and on-line play have been known to eat items) and the devs are not the fastest at producing patches. There's only one playable character, but with three melee skill trees, three ranged, an array of passive skills and a system of 'perks' that unlocks with a secondary XP system called 'fame', there's a lot of room for customization.

Great combat and really awesome setting. The best feature has to be the expansive skill-trees. This really is the perfect game for stat monkeys. Just one thing I have to add: Buy one of the DLC Classes, cause the standard-one gets boring really quickly. This game also has an online aspect to it but I mostly played it offline so I can't tell if it's good or not. If you are looking for an alternative to DIABLO pick this one up!			"

The most appealing thing about this game is certainly the humor and the atmosphere. Even during my second play through I was still laughing at the same comments, particuraly those of the sexy spectre Katarina. Music is also amazing. Would rate this game as a wooden block out of six. Would certainly play.Overall Rating: 8/10			"

												Because there was only two recomendations for the game, yes or no, i couldn't express a mixed view. A good game but there are some really anoying element to be aweare of. The first is you can't have a break from the game half way through a level. If for example you exit from the game half way through the level, switch off the comp and them go back to it later then all the monster you've killed are back there again. It means you're pratically starting the level from scratch and that is very annoying. All your previous good work gone to waste. Second. Some of the protals, actually most of the portals, drop you right in the middle of a horde to monsters and you usually get slaughtered because there are so many. This is partially caused by the provious problem but could be solved by not having any monsters around the portal.The third. It takes so long for VanHelsing to regenerate HPs that you spend a fair amount of time waiting to heal before going to your next fight. You could remady that problem by using the command cheats some say but i have them and they don't seem to work. So it another 10 minuites for the HP gague to fill up.			"

												This game I picked up on a whim, and it turned out to be one of my, if not my absolute, favorite dungeon crawlers ever! The combat is visceral and has loads of impact and tons of play styles. Creature designs are interesting and varied. The loot system rains equipment upon you as frequently as the gore of your fallen foes.Graphically, for a 3/4 view dungeon crawler, this game looks fantastic! Character models are noticeably detailed and the environments look great. I'd say they are on par, and in some places, better than Diablo 3. Sound design is fantastic as well. The voice acting, while sometimes almost purposely cheesy, is very well done. The music, while not memorable, is not BAD. It just often gets drowned out by screaming and explosions. Story is decent as well. Not the games strong point, but no one plays dungeon crawlers for the story. However, I will say the story is significantly better than most I've played.Has several multi-player modes, but I haven't had the opportunity to play them, so I can't say how they are.The game has 2 glaring down sides, neither of them deal breaking:1 - I don't know if the game is optimized poorly, or what, but when you start the game, there is a very long pause, almost as if the game has frozen. There is no indication that anything is loading. After the first time it isn't an issue, but initially, it's jarring.2 - A similar problem happens with the loading screens. It takes quite a while for the loading ""bar"" to start to fill and the whole screen just reeks of ""frozen game"". I've nearly Alt+F4 many times because I assumed it had frozen.Only other bad thing I can think of is the game is pretty short. A max level cap of 30 and a 10 hour campaign feel prematurely ended. I wanted more of this game very badly, but for $15, I can't complain to much. I will definitely keep an eye out for Neocore games in the future			"

												I really enjoyed the twentyish hours I put into this game ( altho for some reason after killing the last boss it didn't trigger the ending cutscene ). Tried to start from beginning with the neverending story mode but didn't really feel like playing it through again. So the replayability isn't that good and I don't consider buying the DLC. I still recommend this game to all of you ARPG fans out there :)			"

												Without a doubt, my favorite dungeon crawling game. Everything is done right. It has a linear story with slight control over a few things for the immersion factor. The UI is highly functional and easy to understand. The skill trees have no pitfalls and let you build the player as they want, yet it won't give you everything. On normal mode, it's a perfect balance between easy and hard, always providing a challenge. The characters are charming and offer a lot of humor. It has some easter eggs referencing Lord of the Rings and Monty Python, but does it in a way that won't make you shake your head in disappointment, like some other action RPGs.... *cough* BL2 *cough*. Even the achievements gave off of the right kind of vibe to where you feel actually accomplished by getting one, and have the motivation to get others. The art direction is fantastic, and the graphics look beautiful. Though, it's endorsed by NVIDIA, so it may not run as smoothly using AMD parts due to some sneaky hardware lock-outs. I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves Diablo or Victorian/Gothic fiction. You even get a spunky ghost sidekick			"

												Van Helsing is a great loot based game akin to Diablo, Torchlight and games such as those. Probably what makes it stand out is that the character you play, Van Helsing, has such a more engadging personality than most almost voiceless heroes of other similar games. There's some great chatter between him and his AI companion who is incredibly useful and easy to set up. In addition to this the people you meet are voiced well, over the top in so many ways and also fun to interact with (We are talking Vampires with the oh so wonderful Transylvanian accent.). Combat is about to be as expected. I've gone with a ranged firearm build. it works well and hits hard. But likle most ranged characters in this genre you are always limited to what you can see on the screen. So you usually only have a chance of having a real ranged battle with enemies in the top right and top left portions of the screen. Probably one of the best things when it comes to loot in this game is that you get an incredibly useful breakdown of how it will increase your stats. Unlike Torchlight II which I have also played recently, it does all the maths for you and will say how much your DPS will be improved for everything that increases damage in some way. i.e Damage, Extra Elemental Damage Bonuses, Critical Chance, Critical Damage, Attack speed, Stat increases and so on. The same goes for things like protection and so on. This means less time agonising over what new weapon or armour to equip (I'm looking at you Torchlight & Borderlands) and more time getting stuck into the action. The skill trees are straight forward as well and you can reset your stats in the game almost whenever you like back at the main hub.One of the biggest drawbacks of the game is that it frequently crashes. I've been playing for sometime now and have had over 50 crashes to my desktop. The majority of the crashes are usually when you teleport to a location or you accept a quest which automatically takes you to a new area as well. But there are a number of other minor causes as well. Automatic save points are frequent though so you never feel like you have been cheated out of a quest. But nevertheless it happens over and over again. Other things to mention are neat features like a Tower Defense game that pops up later into the game which is fun to play and simple management of upgrades for your main hubs and shops. This game also has multiplayer which I have yet to play but I have not heard great things about. I recently got a 50% off voucher for the next game in the series. So I am eager to pick it up once I have completed this one! Overall I recommend this game highly if you see it at a reasonable price and you enjoy the genre!			"

												Excellent game in the vein of Diablo I&II, Path of Exile, and Torchlight I&II.  Very smooth gameplay.  Patches have come out, and more are planned to take care of the kinks.  The skill trees are complex and offer a variety of options.  Your companion ghost adds to the humor with witty dialogue.  Her combat skills are also a great boon.  Drops are plentiful for weaponry, with a variety of pistols, rifles, and swords to hack, slash, and gib the enemies of humanity.  Each level offers a nice variety of monsters, and is crafted to give you a sense of being in another world where monsters are possible.  The many allusions to other games, movies, and novels add to the fun.  For the price, it's a steal of a game that you should enjoy. Grab a sword and pistol to complement your wide-brimmed hat and go slay some monsters!			"

												The incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a hack and slash type game and a very good one in my honest opinion. It does seem to be a bit heavy on the hardware side and to be fair it is not bad on the graphics side. It has a wide variety of skills to choose from, and where it really gets a plus from my side is the ability to choose between ranged and melee combat depending how you distribute your points. The game has a nice difficulty not too easy and not too hard and I quite enjoyed myself completing it. It does have multiplayer, which I have not tried out yet, but I could imagine it only gets more fun playing with friends.Story wise it is not perfect but it is all right and a nice gimmick is the tower defense based game you experience in the game.All in all a solid game that does what was intended and it has a buttload of DLC if you want expand on it.Buy it you will not regret it...

												To be honest, I got this game in a bundle and had no real intention to play it. On that note, I recently got a wired 360 controller again after trying to fiddle with an off-brand controller. After popping in the new controller, I wanted to quickly test it on a few games. This was one of the many that support the official xbox controller, and it worked great! What was going to be a quick five minutes of controller testing turned in to a couple hours of solid gameplay. I cannot speak for the mouse/keyboard feel of this game, but on controller, it is highly addicting. The art style and mood of this game really isn't over the top, but doesn't feel like crap, either. Comparing this to D3 would be futile as they feel like different games. From augmenting the several abilities and powers to the power interaction with your ghostly companion feels great. If you are looking for a game that is more skill-based instead gear-based, this would be a solid choice. If you'd love to sit back and play a decent rpg with multiple classes, get this with a controller. It looks nice and plays well. Really, those are the main two things I look for in a game.8/10			"

												So got this game not knowing what to expect, other than its kind like diablo.  But it's a ton of fun, the loot, the monsters, the places you go, all great.  Not far into the story at the moment, but I can tell its gonna be deep. Got the second one on sale, lookin forward to playin that too!  If you like diablo style games rpg dungeon crawling with tons of loot, you will like this a lot.			"

												This game is an ARPG, which means fixed areas you explore, with tons of loot raining down. The strong points are the graphics, the story and humor/voice acting. The weak points are the loot and gameplay. The gameplay is somewhat fun, but just seems monotonous after awhile. I've yet to finish the game, because I simply lost interest around the end. I'll probably go back some time to finish it. The loot is so-so, you never really find anything that gets you super excited.			"

The graphics are good, the gameplay is fun, and holy crap you're playing as a monster hunter fighting werewolves and vampires. That's awesome! At the moment of writing ths the game and it's DLC are about $8.50 which is a freaking great deal. I highly recommend it.			"

												The incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a hack and slash type game and a very good one in my honest opinion. It does seem to be a bit heavy on the hardware side and to be fair it is not bad on the graphics side. It has a wide variety of skills to choose from, and where it really gets a plus from my side is the ability to choose between ranged and melee combat depending how you distribute your points. The game has a nice difficulty not too easy and not too hard and I quite enjoyed myself completing it. It does have multiplayer, which I have not tried out yet, but I could imagine it only gets more fun playing with friends.Story wise it is not perfect but it is all right and a nice gimmick is the tower defense based game you experience in the game.All in all a solid game that does what was intended and it has a buttload of DLC if you want expand on it.Buy it you will not regret it...

												Pros: Very fun gameplay. Tight, funny, flirty companion dialog. Action-packed fighting, and loads of loot. Decent graphics and effects.Cons: Lame story, the ending was disappointing and abrupt. Not too much feels cohesive. The main plot seems to be a device to get you from one location to the next.Recap, if you like playing a game for the mechanics, it's an enjoyable ride. The character and story development is weak, the quests are bland, which is a shame because this could've been easily a fantastic game with a little more help on the writing side. Still a fairly fun game, just unsatisfying ultimately.7/10			"

												I decided to play The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing after viewing the trailer, and getting some exhaustion from Diablo III and Torchlight 2. This one seemed to be a decent Hack & Slash, with a nice twist regarding the setting of central Europa and possibly legions of blood-sucking foes.In this game, you play a single character, Van Helsing, who is followed by a ghostly teammate, Katarina. You don't have to choose a class before playing, and just develop your character along the way, using several skill trees.Basically, you can eradicate a significant amount of monsters by using either a sword or a gun. Each weapon has its specific skill tree with numerous styles of slashes and shots. Each one can be leveled up, or customized with additional powers, triggered by Rage. Also, you can wander in the side of magic by learning strikes blending physical and magical damage, even pure magical damage. If not enough, you can learn passive abilities and active spells, that can take advantage of some specific situations or simply save your butt - leaving you with a fair amount of combinations to craft.The amount of damage you do or can endure is proportional to basic weapon and armor stats, plus the different levels of your character stats and skills, combined with the multiple bonuses you can get from gear. Very similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. So don't fall in love with that particular weapon or gear if the next one is seamingly up a notch, the impact could be tremendous.On top of that, your translucent female sidekick is not only witty, but can be used either as a melee fighter, a ranged shooter or a decent support. She also can level up and has her own gear and skill tree to become a tactical partner or a stat multiplier.At this point, it's pretty clear that this game targets an audience that loves to analyse how hundred skills relate to each other, carefully crafting the most badass character possible, something like ""hit once, obliterate many"". It's a good thing to have a significant amount of depth that way (remember Titan Quest !) but for me it was just like ""too much"". So I decided to focus on a restricted number of skills, low enough to keep me focused on the actual map cleaning.The game is linear, with some quests on the side. The levels are not really beautiful but varied, and the enemies compensate lack of intelligence by sheer number. Luckily, the dialog between Van Helsing and Katarina are funny so you can have a good time playing them.Something that kinda puzzled me was the introduction of a micro-game of Tower Defense. Not that it wasn't interesting or refreshing, but it seemed that the developers decided to put everything remotely cool in the game, thus pushing it in the Land of Blended Genre where chances of survival are slim. Luckily, the Tower Defense micro-game is nicely done, but too much thin for consideration. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good Hack & Slash, that can satisfy seasoned players, but could be daunting to newcomers.			"

												The game has a unique gothic atmosphere, smooth and detailed graphics, dynamic combat and some witty and amusing dialogue.  Unfortunately the game can get a tad repetitive due to the limited character development system and the way the monsters spawn. The multiplayer has some shortcommings and the storyline is pretty weak. Still Van Helsing isn't a game visibly worse, than other hack'n'slashes out there. If you like action RPG's like Diablo or Titan Quest  but with some lesser polish, it's definately worth checking out. U can play this game on your couch with your xbox controller since the UI has a different scheme for it.  "

												I really wanted to love this game.  It has atmosphere, it has action and the vampire theme is great.  I did not go in expecting anything as that always sets up for disappointmen but after a bit of play I'm going to weigh in.  As I said, it is a very good looking game and fun to play as an isometric RPG.  I probably could have played it for a good long while but then the problems bleed through and they are, in my opinion, game breaking.  The main issue is that the load times are insane.  Time is precious and I don't want to sit there for minutes at a time waiting for an area to load.  This is excacerbated by the fact that you always have to start at a hub and then teleport to the area you want to be in.  That is two load screens too many.  Also, there is a really ridiculous death penalty.  You pay out of your character's coin purse to either start where you died or at the begining of the area.  If you want to save your coins you are sent to the hub.  More load screens!  My machine loads massive AAA titles in no time, so the problem is in the programming.  Anyways, I can't handle this stupid design so I'm ditching thi game.			"

												Keeping this one short: THE INCREDIBLE ADVENTURES OF VAN HELSING (what's up with those long titles recently) is a great ARPG in the vein of DIABLO and TORCHLIGHT. Great combat and really awesome setting. The best feature has to be the expansive skill-trees. This really is the perfect game for stat monkeys. Just one thing I have to add: Buy one of the DLC Classes, cause the standard-one gets boring really quickly. This game also has an online aspect to it but I mostly played it offline so I can't tell if it's good or not. If you are looking for an alternative to DIABLO pick this one up!			"

												while the dialog between you and your sidekick is quite funnly and setting is quite interesting i really cant recommend this game since the attack animations are really weak. Unlike diablo or torchlight your attacks seems to have no meaty animations. To be frankly most of the time i really cant tell my attacks are hitting the enemies or not.Also another really big major issue is the size of the mana and health indicators. They are too small for comfort, you have to actually take your eyes of the combat and check your hp and mana. There is a auto drink hp potions option on the menu but since i liked managing my potions myself i really didnt enjoy the game when this option is turned on.			"

												The game plays similarly to other ARPG's such as the Diablos and Path of Exile. The story is unique in the sense that it draws strongly from the Van Helsing lore and the steampunk styling of it doesn't appear in many other ARPG's. The game is still quite buggy as there are many skills that quite inbalanced (looking at you fire pillar and electro ball) and some classes are definitely better than others but it seems that the developers are still actively pushing out updates and fixes. Definitely worth getting and playing through if you're interested in the styling of the game, the story, or are a big fan of ARPG's but don't expect it to be a perfectly polished product.			"

												This Van Helsing game is great...if you look pass the bugs, that areas lag when you start them up because there're so many monsters in there (lag reduces as you kill them off), wierd glitches with your character (lag based once again), that certain quests doesn't work and you sometimes can't progress forwards and needs to type something in console 'cos the developers released a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game.Ok I might be a tad too harsh, 'cos really, they're fixing alot of bugs every second week or so, but it really reduced my positive experince to more of a ""meh"". I played this game 'cos I didn't want to play Diablo III, and to be fair it can be alot of fun (massive amounts of monsters, overwhelming sometimes actually, that you have to shoot/cut your way through, VERY satisfying, nice enviroments etc), but all the bugs, the lag, and lack of optimisation really gets to ya after a while.So final verdict: If you want to slay a billion monsters whilst also being tactical about it (or you get swarmed!), this is the game for you. If you want the game to run super smooth whilst doing it...nah, prepare to adapt. To me this game is a 5.5/10. Cheers!			"

												Buggy game on a 64bit system. The 2-3 hours I have above was almost purely for troubleshooting, getting the game to run and DLCs to work, and a bit of moving around in-game. The UI font is near unreadable. The animations are odd and unnatural. The skill trees are lackluster.If you're a fan of high quality ARPGs like the Diablo, the Torchlight games, or PoE, you'll probably feel disappointed.			"

												It's basically Torchlight.  Skill trees, HP and mana, a pet, color coded loot, etc. Some highlights:Skills have powerups you can enable per use that are fueled by a third resource called rage.  These do things like more damage, more targets, heal you on hit, and similar bonuses. You get rage when you kill monsters.  It's a nice little system I wouldn't mind seeing elsewhere.Easy respec on abilities and skills.  This was great for me when I realized investing heavily in the first skill wasn't a good long term solution, and when I realized one of my passives wasn't needed anymore.  You can also refund some of the starting skills if they aren't useful for you.   You can't respec perks for some reason, so check a guide before investing. Some of the late-game ones are straight out better than the early ones.Some meh-lights:The writing I found to be adequate.  Nothing exceptional, but it didn't pain me.  The core combat started out kind of bleh.  Slow, low damage attacks and limited mana.  It picked up after a little while, but the start wasn't great.  When I got the laser skill, it was just as fun as it was in Torchlight.I started to get some loot fatigue near the end.  There's a lot of items, and even with the summary tooltips it's sometimes hard to parse which item is really better.  One downer:A certain boss is one of the more frustrating bosses I've faced in a diablo-like.  He has a charge attack that could one-hit me, and he would do it from offscreen so I had no chance to dodge.  He also had homing missiles and infinite ranged attack mooks.  I did not enjoy that fight at all.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of the best ARPG I've ever played. Why? Let's start with the graphics. It looks beautiful. In my opinion, it's the best looking ARPG I've ever played. Finally some ARPG that overcome Titan Quest in this part. The soundtrack is also very good.I also like the enviroment. The game takes place in a country called Borgovia. It's similiar to the one you've seen in the original Van Helsing film. The nature and the village you will visit seems to be inspired by medieval Hungary and Romania. In most of the cases, the enemies you will face in the country will be monsters- wolves, spiders, but also Rusalka, a beast from Slavic myths. The situation will change once you enter the capital city, Borgova. The city contains more steampunk elements, e.g. robot soldiers or mutants, than the countryside. Some of the buildings there are inspired by buildings from our world. What I like the most about this games is the humour. In addition to the easter eggs, the dialogs between your character and Katarina are also well written and amusing. There is also a tower defence minigame. In this minigame, three waves of enemies would like to get into your base and you must stop them. In order to do that, you can put traps on the way to your lair. It can be a platform that will activate once an enemy will step on it. Or you can place various towers next to the path leading to your base. And of course, you and Katarina will also take place in preventing your enemies to get there.What I don't like very much is the fact that skills needs mana and they also have cooldown time after you've used them. I think it is not necessary. If you ask me, I believe that only one of those should be used. I would rather use only mana, like it is done in Torchlight. And also the fact that you can shoot enemies that are below or above you is not very good, in my opinion.			"

												Okay, yes, it's a Diablo clone.  And admittedly, it's not as good as the Torchlight games (get those if you haven't btw), but man are these games fun.  There are a lot of different methods of attack, lots of sarcasm, plenty of monster busting, and in general, it's just plain fun.  I really don't know what else to say.  I just plain love 'em.			"

												Mac support is a joke.""Full controller support"" is a blatant lie on OSX, since the devs themselves have said on the steam forums it has yet to be implemented. Same thing goes for the second instalment. I can't wrap my head around how you can release a second game without properly resolving **known** issues on the first one.And then there is also the thing about the UI scaling. All the UI is scaled down and the texts are almost impossible to read, making the game unplayable.I have been patient, asked for updates, stalked the support threads looking for any updates and posted my own issues there. Nothing.I'm still left with this game that I will have to play on Windows at some point. When the whole point was to play it with my wife on our macs.Sorry devs, you adverstised something and simply did not deliver.			"

												Acquired it with some bundle I don't recall now. Decided to try it since I've played Diablo 3 and Path of Exile a lot. Compared to free PoE it doesn't really stand a chance:comparatively short (HC normal 1st walkthrough - 12 hours)annoying controls - especially the way ""walking"" is handled: lots of ""grey areas"" aka ""unclickables"" resulting in botched kiting or even moving in the direction you intendeddifficulty level only scales up HP: no extra attacks for mobs, nothing special except larger HP poolskite or go to hell - died 3 times with melee, rerolled that mage class: set up firewall and run in circles, bosses includedgets boring super fast: each fight (bosses too) looked the same for me (firewall + circling)Overall if I bought this game ""solo"" I would be disappointed. If you want a hack n slash / aRPG - play Diablo 3 or Path of Exile. If you are a fan of Van Helsing, well - have fun I guess.			"

												Great game. Difficult to judge or compare.It's most frequently compared to Diablo and Torchlight, obviously. As it is a top-down  ARPG with Diablo-pioneered mechanics. I'd just try to point out the most striking qualities. (Oh, and when I say Diablo I mean 1 and 2. 3 doesn't exist for yours truly) In the setting, artwork and ambience it seems much closer to Diablo than Tordhlight.  Monsters, some grittyness et al et cetera. Yet Van Helsing tries its own in having more dialogue, and quite cheesy-yet-aware-of-it humorous based-in-vampire-themed-cultural-stuff style. In comparison to Torchlights it feels certainly more authentic and serious. Aside style, in the mechanics and stats-things. Yet it does fall a tad boring all in all.We arrive at a most apparent gripe, lack of stylistic variety. Whilst gameplay has the neatest ideas and mechanics, there's nothing really ""wow"" in Van Helsing's art direction and design. So aside some neat little mechanics, like trap-placing in Borgova, it doesn't feel too fresh or inspiring. So in the art, setting and overall originality department it's not as strong as was Diablo. And only a bit preferred over Torchlight. Yet it also falls short in a variety aspect that both Torchlight and Diablo have - classes. There isn't much replayablility and experimenting as there's only one character available for play, albeit with diverse and flexible specializing. Tho thanks to this, it does win some story and dialogue points over Torchlight. (since I wrote this, a DLC was made, now the game has 2 classes :)Torchlight, however, has a moddibility to it Van Helsing won't dream of achieving. Yet that's not as high in my hierarchy of idealized game aspects. :)All in all I'd give Van Helsing the same score as Torchlight 2. If objectively speaking. Personally I enjoy Helsing much much more tho. Plus I'd have to take into account that its starting price was 10 euros. There's vast quality for such a small price.So I'll compromise between the two and write it an 8 in a scoring system where Torchlight 2 would get a 7,5.			"

												Many would call it another Diablo clone, but for me its just another action RPG/Hack'n Slay type of game which is on the better side of the genre. It is always hard to find games in this genre which manage to keep the balance between challanging and fun and in my opionion Van Hellsing does a good job in this regard. The gameplay is fun and at times really challenging (or at least at the harder dificulties, havn't tried the lower modes yet) and you are always on the lookout for better equimpent.One thing i really liked about the game was the fact that it mixed in a the genre of tower defense at one point which was really really fun and I would have loved to see more of this in the game, or at least as a standlone challange mode or something.The Graphics are not great or groundbreaking, but hey neither is the gameplay, but it provides a nice atmosphere one would expect from a set in the Van Helsing univers. The few things I would critzize are the lack of enemy variaties, you encounter some enimies over and over again and again, and the companion, while you she provides a nice sidekick and humour i couldn't figer out if she was usefull or not (I don't own the DLC). Oh and the Story is, in like most of these games, flat and forseeable but better than some other things that I've seen in this genre. But really who plays a game like this for the story...I don't.Overall I recommend this game to all fans of the genre who need something else besides the to heabyweights Diablo and Torchlight			"

												Van Helsing sits in an odd gray area in the Diablolike genre. It's not as in depth as Diablo II, it's not as expansive as Sacred II, you don't have nearly as much build flexibility as Titan Quest, your companion isn't as relevant as it is in Torchlight II, the action isn't as fast and furious as Diablo III, and the systems in general aren't as deep and flexible as Path of Exile.If you're looking for one or more of the above, get any of those games instead. If you've played them all, or just like the Van Helsing mythos, it's worth it if on sale. Van Helsing tends to focus more on the story than most Diablolikes. The banter between your character and your companion is worth listening to; it's worth following the storyline and talking to NPCs. The setting is charming and unique. It just doesn't execute as well as other games.Oh, and you get one class to play. The other two are DLC.			"

This is the kind of bug that grows old fast and therefore I suggest you stay away from buying this game (unless it gets patched).			"

												A legitimately fresh look at the genre, with all the upsides of recent advancements and few of the flaws. Skills are varied and scalable, and can be modded on the fly to whole new ends. Passives are valuable, abilities easy to use, weapons fresh and fun. Your companion is equippable, has her own skills and passives, and has an AI you can customize to any style. Combat can be difficult, not fake difficult but truly hard. And the visuals and audio are good... Although the music can get slightly repetitive. All in all, one of my favorite new games of 2013, especially at this price point.			"

I found myself buying a bit of the DLC and playing a few of the additional characters, and some of the extra content after you finish the story line.I have to admit that my major complaint is that I wish there was more of it!  I loved it, and wanted to keep playing.  I hope they continue to expand this game, which I believe they could.  If you liked Torchlight and Torchlight 2, this is a must have for you.  The minion dynamic and game feel is very similar, but she is a lot more fun than a dog.  I tend to play my games with the sound off, but found myself turning it on so I could hear her banter.A definite fun game, well worth the money.			"

												I have played PoE Beta, Torchlight 1 & 2, Diablo 1, 2 and 3. This game beats them all except for maybe Diablo 2 with Expansion during its heyday. Van Helsing is fun and unique with witty dialogue and snappy writing. You actually get rewarded for exploring your entire map. The loot is fun (no AH). You can play offline if it's just single player. You can also play online (public or steam friends only) with up to 4 people in co-op (password or sans). Your companion picks up stuff like potions, crafting mats and different levels of unique or common gear depending on how you set her. She can also be sent to town to sell, as well as buy a specifically designated number of potions; She's sassy too. You have enchanting as well as alchemy for upgrading your gear. You make decisions in dialogue even that impact your gameplay more true to table-top role playing games! Yes, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is addictive and yes, the story is fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys top-down action rpgs. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is what Diablo 3 should have been.[ Also, I just go the DLC tonight and I am enjoying my Arcane Mechanic, which can be played with pets. I have yet to try the Thaumargist (sp?), which appears to be a steampunk version of a mage. I do like the steampunkish feel of hte game. The artwork is quite good. ]			"

												Super fun ARPG. Smooth, great loot, the skill system is brilliant, and the quirkiness between Van Helsing and Katarina makes the story very enjoyable.			"

												This is a great hack n slash adventure. If you like games like torchlight and diablo then you'll love this one. The voice acting can be weak at time, but the lush and detailed environments more than make up for it.My one gripe is the last boss is near impossible to defeat and then you are rewarded with a quick cut scene that makes absolutely no sense and the game abruptly ends. Way to give your players the middle finger on that one.			"

												Great game. Difficult to judge or compare.It's most frequently compared to Diablo and Torchlight, obviously. As it is a top-down  ARPG with Diablo-pioneered mechanics. I'd just try to point out the most striking qualities. (Oh, and when I say Diablo I mean 1 and 2. 3 doesn't exist for yours truly) In the setting, artwork and ambience it seems much closer to Diablo than Tordhlight.  Monsters, some grittyness et al et cetera. Yet Van Helsing tries its own in having more dialogue, and quite cheesy-yet-aware-of-it humorous based-in-vampire-themed-cultural-stuff style. In comparison to Torchlights it feels certainly more authentic and serious. Aside style, in the mechanics and stats-things. Yet it does fall a tad boring all in all.We arrive at a most apparent gripe, lack of stylistic variety. Whilst gameplay has the neatest ideas and mechanics, there's nothing really ""wow"" in Van Helsing's art direction and design. So aside some neat little mechanics, like trap-placing in Borgova, it doesn't feel too fresh or inspiring. So in the art, setting and overall originality department it's not as strong as was Diablo. And only a bit preferred over Torchlight. Yet it also falls short in a variety aspect that both Torchlight and Diablo have - classes. There isn't much replayablility and experimenting as there's only one character available for play, albeit with diverse and flexible specializing. Tho thanks to this, it does win some story and dialogue points over Torchlight. (since I wrote this, a DLC was made, now the game has 2 classes :)Torchlight, however, has a moddibility to it Van Helsing won't dream of achieving. Yet that's not as high in my hierarchy of idealized game aspects. :)All in all I'd give Van Helsing the same score as Torchlight 2. If objectively speaking. Personally I enjoy Helsing much much more tho. Plus I'd have to take into account that its starting price was 10 euros. There's vast quality for such a small price.So I'll compromise between the two and write it an 8 in a scoring system where Torchlight 2 would get a 7,5.			"

												Many would call it another Diablo clone, but for me its just another action RPG/Hack'n Slay type of game which is on the better side of the genre. It is always hard to find games in this genre which manage to keep the balance between challanging and fun and in my opionion Van Hellsing does a good job in this regard. The gameplay is fun and at times really challenging (or at least at the harder dificulties, havn't tried the lower modes yet) and you are always on the lookout for better equimpent.One thing i really liked about the game was the fact that it mixed in a the genre of tower defense at one point which was really really fun and I would have loved to see more of this in the game, or at least as a standlone challange mode or something.The Graphics are not great or groundbreaking, but hey neither is the gameplay, but it provides a nice atmosphere one would expect from a set in the Van Helsing univers. The few things I would critzize are the lack of enemy variaties, you encounter some enimies over and over again and again, and the companion, while you she provides a nice sidekick and humour i couldn't figer out if she was usefull or not (I don't own the DLC). Oh and the Story is, in like most of these games, flat and forseeable but better than some other things that I've seen in this genre. But really who plays a game like this for the story...I don't.Overall I recommend this game to all fans of the genre who need something else besides the to heabyweights Diablo and Torchlight			"

												Van Helsing sits in an odd gray area in the Diablolike genre. It's not as in depth as Diablo II, it's not as expansive as Sacred II, you don't have nearly as much build flexibility as Titan Quest, your companion isn't as relevant as it is in Torchlight II, the action isn't as fast and furious as Diablo III, and the systems in general aren't as deep and flexible as Path of Exile.If you're looking for one or more of the above, get any of those games instead. If you've played them all, or just like the Van Helsing mythos, it's worth it if on sale. Van Helsing tends to focus more on the story than most Diablolikes. The banter between your character and your companion is worth listening to; it's worth following the storyline and talking to NPCs. The setting is charming and unique. It just doesn't execute as well as other games.Oh, and you get one class to play. The other two are DLC.			"

												It seems to be a pretty cool game, sort of a Diablo 2 clone, skill tree is there, champion mobs, companion you can equip with gear etc.  The problem is I have been playing less than an hour and the game has already frozen twice (both times when talking to npcs).  This is the kind of bug that grows old fast and therefore I suggest you stay away from buying this game (unless it gets patched).			"
