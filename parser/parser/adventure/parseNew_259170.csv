												Metascore: 55/100??????? Seriously???? Like reading the reviews wasn't bad enough...I don't get what's everyone on about... It may not the best game out there, but it’s still so damn brilliant!!!! I’m a big survival horror fan, I’ve played a lot of games and Alone In The Dark deserves to be applauded for its innovation. I’ve played it when it was released in 2008 and it was the first of its genre and I've been gaming since I could walk. This franchise started the survival horror genre. This is most probably the most underrated title in the history of video games. Because even though it has flaws like the broken mechanics,  tiring controls and camera, and most probably Atari not testing it. There are also crashes when you try to edit  the display settings, their fault aswell . But those who are able to deal with these flaws, that aren't easy to ignore, may end up living a very very rewarding action adventure. Alone in the dark is a survival atmospheric horror game built in episodes. Each episode begins with a video summary of the previous episode, and ends with an epic scene to rattle our nerves.  You are an amnesiac Edward Carnby who is a paranormal detective who disappeared back in 1938, awakening from an exorcism in 2008. After over hearing a bizarre conversation between men in robes,  you start to wander a collapsing building for a way out. You will witness several people being killed and possessed by demonic forces. You will meet a woman and an old man who has all the answers. But there isn’t time. Because Lucifer is trying to bring the end of the world using a stone that’s been held by Edward for decades, that contained his soul after he’s been cast out of heaven. And you must stop him before it’s too late. So you start your adventure in a beautiful, picture perfect New York city. Driving to out run a raging apocalyptic earthquake with giant fissures wiping out the entire city, trying to make it to central park. And that’s where you begin to unravel so many mysteries and experience even more epicness! Brilliant events and a gripping story that keeps building up to a whole new level every time as you progress and keeps you wanting even more. With an ending that leaves you with questions more than answers.The graphics are great, the atmosphere, the lighting, the ambiance, gameplay, the characters and dialogues… All are featured wonderfully. The story is well scripted and provides many intense dramatic moments with beautifully composed soundtracks. Gives you a great feeling of novelty, as you try to heal your wounds, like literally look down to heal a bloody gapping wound through your jeans or jacket. The game also allows you to use your jacket as an inventory which I found pretty cool, like to fit in as many objects as the pockets and belts allow you. As well as combining them and creating fire weapons, explosives and light sources. Also how objects can interact with the environment. Like grabbing a chair or a wood plank and place it near other objects, then set the plank on fire. You will see the fire eating the plank slowly, turning it to ashes and moving to the other objects. Quite cool.Alone In The Dark has many flaws that can kill the thrill sometimes. But it won’t kill the thrill of the story and puzzles. If you’re into survival horror and atmospheric games, then you should definitely give it a try. It might be too primitive for 2008 standars, but it’s still quite enjoyable.			"

												Just a warning to users: I tried to run the game, and Securom gave me an error that it couldn't activate -- looking into it, the error was because I monitor the cpu usage of my PC using a process explorer.  Looking into the matter, Securom states blatantly that they don't like that process explorer software can monitor what Securom does, and therefore, they will never allow Securom applications to run while a process explorer is open; not only is that shady, but it's downright crap.  So buyer beware, this product still has Securom and still requires Stardock activation.  And yes, this is the old rootkit securom that will actually close your process explorer software after it's been installed and activated.That having been said, Alone in the Dark itself is a bit of a mess of a game.  The controls are pretty bad, this is in part due to their choosing to make arm controls based on the right-hand joystick on a 360 gamepad (it's even worse on PC if you don't have a gamepad).  The graphics are good, really good (especially considering this game came out in 2008).  The gameplay can be questionable at times, and some mechanics are used for the first 5 minutes after they're introduced, and then never again.  An example of this is the blinking mechanic, it's used to clear your vision when you start out the game, but after this point you won't be using it again.The physics puzzles often involve moving Edward's arms to manipulate certain objects in certain directions, and while this was a good idea in theory, it should have had a toggle button for this type of manipulation, as it translates poorly to combat.  Edward will often♥♥♥♥♥♥the object back as if to swing it, only to slowly lower it because of how clunky the controls to this particular function work.The game assumes you've played previous games and gives no introduction to Edward or Theophile, only mentioning events from previous games in passing, as well doing nothing to inform us what happened in the months and hours leading up to the game.  The game starts off in the middle of the story, and you as the player are given little exposition until nearing the end of the game on what is actually going on.The good portions of the game are non-gameplay portions, and involve the inventory, as the player selects items and combines them in Edward's coat, such as combining a glowstick with a piece of tape to make a sticky glowstick that you can throw onto walls and ceilings to help illuminate the area.  Likewise one can combine gasoline and handgun ammo to make incendiary ammunition (which is needed to kill demon enemies).The game uses a location-based damage system similar to Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth (although that game did it better), and the player applies bandages and healing spray to repair these wounds.  The problem is that wounds often require multiple items per wound, and you don't get anywhere near enough of these, and if you suffer a bleeding wound you'll be forced to use up the majority of your healing items to repair it.There was a lot of things about Alone in the Dark that were good ideas, but with bad implementation, and unfortunately Eden Games and Hydravision Entertainment got liquidated before they could release the patch that was supposed to make the 360 and PC versions play like the updated Alone in the Dark: Inferno for PS3.  The game itself can be enjoyable, but it's hard to make a recommendation to buy any game that requires a person to install and activate a rootkit to play.  So this combined with all the negatives (of which there are plenty) is why I do not recommend this to people; instead try and get your hands on the PS3 version.			"

												Alone in the Dark is a 2008 action survival-horror game, and fifth game in the Alone in the Dark series. It is also one of the most profound and fascinating examples I have ever played of something akin to a glorious train-wreck.There's a story here, I'm sure of it. There are definitely cutscenes with unforgettable hammy acting and dialogue, with such excellent writing and voicing execution like ""I don't have your stone, and ♥♥♥♥ you anyway,"" or, ""I'm the ♥♥♥♥-ING UNIVERSE!!"" However, I couldn't rightfully tell you it without looking up a synopsis. I guess New York is in trouble, so there's that.Alone in the Dark is daring, different, and truly there is no other game quite like it. In this game, you'll find yourself doing everything from racing a car through Central Park as giant bats tear your car apart as you drive it, only to form themselves into a literal giant bat tornado.You will learn the importance of tape with a surprisingly complex crafting system that existed long before Minecraft. You'll drive a forklift through a cave and pick up rocks and bridges. You'll literally be♥♥♥♥♥♥out by a giant worm.If anything, I can say it was ahead of its time. For a 2008 game, it tried things that would later on become parts of much more successful and bigger games, and gaming elements that have become popularized. Climbing segments with things crumbling apart ala' Uncharted before Uncharted. The after-mentioned crafting item system the game features. First-person 'experience' walking simulator sections. This game was ahead of the curveball on what would be hip several years from the time it released.It just pulled off most of them pretty poorly.Honestly, the task of things you'll be doing before this game is up is ridiculous. The developers clearly had huge ambitions, but didn't have the time or budget to polish off its ideas. So what you have is a game that controls a bit weirdly, suffers from some hilarious glitches, and somehow tries to wrap up every ridiculous thing that happens into some sort of logical story. Sometimes the game wants to be an atmospheric horror game, other times it wants to be an action game, others a surrealistic platformer, or why not take a moment to take part in a firefighter simulator?The game even went ahead of itself and made it into an episodic gameplay experience. Split into episodes, the game will literally let you play almost any episode or part of an episode from the very beginning of the game. At any time you are free to skip ahead (or go backwards) in the games storyline... With one exception. You have to complete all the episodes (and partake in one quest involving burning roots in an open-world hub world of Central Park) to play the last episode. I can only think the reason they did this is because they realized a few parts of their game were needlessly difficult, usually because of controls. This game also has a Soundtrack that it honestly does not deserve, but adds so much to the experience. You'll be listening to over-the-top child orchestras and epic tunes as you drive in a collapsing New York in a taxi that controls like butter. And most of the soundtrack keeps this epic, mysterious tone full of orchestra songs and some just excellent pieces of music that make it feel like the game is telling some deep epic, when most of the time you'll probably have no idea what's going on. The music just adds to the glorious train wreck that this game is.If you're like me, you'll be playing this and telling yourself that this is a terrible game, and just exclaim out at some new element that baffles on why they decided to go with THIS direction on something, but all the same you'll find yourself both curious, and even excited on what may be around the next bend.The game isn't all bad, it has interesting ideas, sections, and I would even say the game has some good fun to be had, but it is plagued with problems, and just goes so hilariously and over the top off the rails its almost awe-inspiring. Its problems are somewhat front-loaded, so if you can bear through some sort of dull beginning sections, the game has several loaded guns of things to experience ahead for you, and if you can get past the beginning, you are almost certain to enjoy the crazy ride this game provides.If someone ever asked me to point them in the direction of the purest B-horror game ever, I would point them to this game. It is the hammiest, corniest, most over-the-top horror game I've ever played. It is ridiculous from start to finish, and it is for this reason I'd recommend this.Know though the PC version suffers from some problems, mainly some people have trouble running it. Solutions to get around, but still. And the 'best version' of the game is actually on PS3, as it contains an additional chapter and fixes several problems and inputted some better controls.Still, if you want a B-Horror game, look no further than Alone in the Dark.

												Alone In The Dark was a promising game when it first came out in 2008; it had a great storyline and some cool game mechanics that involved playing with fire (which is awesome) but the main problem it had back then that still holds true now, unfortunately, is the control itself. The game uses fixed camera angles where the player controls Edward Carnby like a tank and the game mechanics as a whole feels stiff and outdated. It's as if the developer tries to emulate the controls from the original Alone In The Dark and bring it to the next-gen and although it sounds like a cool idea on paper but in reality - it's not.The supporting characters are mediocre as well with an annoying female partner named Sarah and an uninspiring antagonist named Crowley. Everything about them is boring and they just don't provide any sense of motivation into the story. It reminds you of that abysmal movie adaptation by Uwe Boll, which was originally supposed to coincide with the game but thankfully, it didn't happen.Despite its flaws, Alone In The Dark is still fun to play. If you get pass the fact of its stiff controls and awful driving sequence (good luck trying to finish the earthquake scene on your first playthrough), you'll learn that the soundtrack is outstanding and the weapon manipulation is really intuitive. It's incredibly satisfying to blow up stuff with a fire-induced gun and home-made explosives. It's just too bad the publisher has not released any patches to fix these problems until now. But then again, it's Atari; what do you expect? For me, I appreciate Alone In The Dark for what it is so I give it a thumbs up for an ambitious attempt. If you really want to experience the game in its entirety, I suggest getting the PlayStation 3 version that addresses all the gameplay issues found in the PC and Xbox 360. If you don't have any consoles at all, then you're stuck with the PC version. Either get it when it's on sale or don't get it at all. Your choice.			"

												I wish I could write a proper review about the game itself - there are things about it that are done right, despite the thing being a complete design mess.Instead, I'm going to warn people to not purchase this game because it has an unfixable resolution bug on Windows 7 which locks your game to 1152x648, in full screen. There's no way to fix this - attempting to set the resolution in the game will cause it to crash, and modifying the configuration file directly may cause the game to lock you out of the main menu.Oh, this also has limited installs through Securom. Fun!If you want to experience this game in all its trashy glory, get it for consoles instead. Don't spend your money on this awful, rushed up port that won't even work right.			"

												Alone in the Dark is unlike any game I've ever played. Both innovative and frustrating, to call this game anything but unique would be a crime. I'm a huge horror fan (both games and film) and this was definietly an enjoyable ride. Yes, this game has it's quirks (both good and bad) but if you can look past 'the bad' then you are sure to have a fun time.Just think of this as a PS1 game with new graphics. If you can enjoy old games and not get hung up on some control frustration then you should pick this up. I pad $2.50 and was very pleased.I played this on Windows XP so I had no issues with changing resolution in-game. I read a lot about the 'display options crashing' and counted myself lucky to have both Win. 7 and Win. XP. Not once did the game crash.My biggest conplaint is the ending. DON'T expect a solid conclusive ending. The ride was worth it though.7.8/10			"

												Alone in the Dark (2008) is a big production survival horror game turned linear adventure with a story that plays out through cut scenes and big car chases. At its core, its still a survival horror game. The controls are awkward and maybe too overly detailed. The camera is a struggle with your player consuming a third of the screen and you need to switch between over the shoulder third and first person views to get things done. Its cumbersome and awkward, but for any ill will toward the controls the game certainly makes up for it with its production.Evil tremors that tear through buildings and city streets are turning people evil. Similar to zombies, but they have a lot of self preservation and they can talk too. You play as a Robert, something a former evil inhabited and you meet allies along the way. You'll be rescuing several short term and long term characters so the game never truly feels alone. Sure you do all the work, but they're with you most of the way. You're never in the dark for too long either.There's a lot of interesting mechanics in the game that feel alien in a way. The first of which is a blink your eyes mechanic that is only in first person. Go figure. You blink to reduce the blurriness and by the first ten or so minutes you'll see fine until a blood spitter covers your eyes. Then just blink it away!Fire will spread from object to object and you need to catch chairs, lamp shades and bats on fire to use as weapons against the evils. So stiffly hold the weapon in a fire and hope it catches. You can only carry a weapon in third person, so the character will obscure the weapon being held out. So hope that it catches fire. Then you need to hold an analog stick or something else if you're using keyboard controls to charge your attack. Hold it back, then flick the other way to swing. Other games have done this better and its slow enough where the enemies can run away when they see your flaming board of justice. Fire is the only thing that can kill inhabited humans and kill them instantly. With a chair lit up you can use it to sometimes illuminate an area. Other times the game decides that you failed so it raises the lights on the entire area.You can use a fire extinguisher to slowly put out fire in first person or switch to third person, hold the stick back and bash down a door. If you're unable to bash a door down, then you can shoot through the lock. Again, interesting and detailed mechanics yet slow, cumbersome, awkward and deliberate. It turns a typical adventure game into something with a slower pace.The game has a grand scope. You'll go from humble beginnings of bashing down doors and tackling issues to get from point A to B. You've got a gun, healing spray, a lighter, duct tape and you can pick up melee weapons. Then get to hang off the side of building by wires and hand holds. Its the adventure syndrome of modern games. Truth be told, I'd rather go on an adventure in the guise of survival horror that I would a straight up survival horror game.There are puzzles such as three bloody finger prints on a keypad. Loading a fire extinguisher onto a lift, jumping and pulling a rope to launch the extinguisher to the floor it needs to be. Getting two wires close, but far enough apart to hot wire a car or a power generator.The inventory has a unique thing going for it, because you open your coat to reveal all sorts of compartments that has you carrying ten pounds of gear. Just think what could be accomplished if he uses his pockets too! Selecting from the array of duct tape, ammo, and flashlight batteries becomes a chore trying to accurately select something with the analog stick then push a button. When you dig through your inventory, the game is still playing.1Alone in the Dark plays out in chapters like television episodes that have credits at the end and a ""previously on"" reel to start each chapter. This can be good and bad. The credits signify that its time to shut off to the game and come back to it later. The reel is a good way of recapping everything if you come back to the game years later. If you chose to keep going, then you just have another cut scene to sit through that you probably remember. Speaking of cut scenes, you're stuck watching them with no way to skip them and that alone becomes my driving force to push through the game rather than take a brake.Driving plays out like a lot of other games with forward and reverse, but once you get up to top speed its easy to fishtail at a ninety degree turn. So you learn to slow down, but if you slow down too much the ground will crack and swallow you whole. The first driving sequence is crazy in a good way once you break out of a garage. Buildings are falling, roads open up to create jumps. Other vehicles on the road become hazards. There are plenty of visual cues like a taxi driving through a glass storefront to indicate that you should do the same.Its amazing to look at and see, but without checkpoints a fun thrilling ride turns into a frustrating challenge. It only reaches a frustration when the game glitches and locks you in the ground. In normal circumstances this is remedied by waiting for the ground to collapse and suck you in. Other times the ground never collapses and you're forced to restart the chapter rather than the last checkpoint. The odd thing is while it looks as if you can rewind to the last checkpoint, I was never able to. Instead I had to quit back to the main menu and then select the chapter and checkpoint.I encountered a few glitches such as the game crashing when I went to the display settings. I was supposed to run down possessed people in a car, but I failed to do so in time, so I fought them on foot which triggered a lot of things that were supposed to happen in the car. Other times voice overs would play after they should have like explanations. Speaking of explanations there are a lot of tutorial prompts. If you take too long, they forcefully take over the screen and you need to push a button to send them away. Some of these prompts have images of the controller, which is great, it shows you what you have to do, but other times there's no image and no text indicating what you push.The glitches are forgivable for the most part, other than the few that crashed or prevented me from advancing. Even a few times is still too many. Despite the flaws, glitches and cumbersome controls the game has great visuals and that makes all the difference. Some of the textures look super high quality on the default settings, while others look low quality such as the protagonists leather jacket is torn and rather than having tears in it, the skin textures on the jacket itself. Everything looks crisp and clean even among fires, destruction and chaos. There needs to be some atmosphere in the world rather than just the sky boxes.The character models and hair are good just as the voice acting, but the problem is that its tough to care about the characters. I'm into the story yes. Evil taking over New York City, sure give me that, but I know nothing about them other than their look. A haggard drifter with no memory, a woman who is the normal commoner and a priest who knows more. There's no reason to like or care for any of them.Alone in the Dark is still an interesting game despite the controls and the fact its more adventure than typical survival horror.			"

												This game is a little disaster. It shows what an uninspired port can do to what might have been a decent game. Slowly I begin to understand why Infogrames/Atari went downhill so fast.I've been playing AitD back then in 1993 and loved the atmosphere, the puzzles and how the story did unfold. But this sequel discouraged me to play even before it started. Technical issues (resolution has to be set manually in a config file) gave me a bad feeling right from the start. But it got worse when I realized that the effort put into porting it from console to PC was minimal at best.The greatest flaw is the hoplessly overcomplicated and unintuitive UI and control system. You are confronted with a myriad of keys needed to do things which you'll quickly forget afterwards, just to wonder what might have been ""blinking"" (no kidding) once your eysight is blurring again.But even worse is the way you have to move around. Pressing W to move forward while needing A and D to steer left and right might have been a decent input system for 1993. But it isn't really working for a game which forces you to walk on thin ledges while all kinds of debris is raining down on you. To make it even worse, the 3rd person cameras are so bad, that you feel like a drunkard stumlbing disorientedly around when you try to navigate even a small room. The puzzles are illogic. In one situation you need to lift a fire extinguisher to a collapsed floor above you. Now every sane person with two working arms would simply lift the extinguisher to platform one, climb up and repeat it.Oh no! The developers of this game thought it natural to put the extinguisher on a platform, which is connected to a rope, which in turn is dangling down from the ceiling... so all you need to do further is to climb up the collapsed floor to leap 2 meters above the ground to the dangling rope to grab it somehow in midair, just to pull the platform (remember, the one we put the extinguisher on?) up so the extinguisher is airbone to land on the second floor.Phew.Okay... seriously?Annoyed as I am I don't even wish to mention the mediocre voice acting or the clicheéd horror snippets happening to anonymous people all around you. It's really not worth the effort, you know them all. Or the music which tries to create suspense, but is quickly starting to annoy you, because it's nowhere close to be dynamically linked to the action on the screen.Anyways... don't buy it, unless you are a die hard AitD fan who just needs to know what happened to the series by first-hand-experience. Hope you got a gamepad then.			"

												!!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!!If you have a video card with more than 1GB of VRAM, this game WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE YOUR RESOLUTION. You'll probably get as far as the Options screen, but if you click on Display the whole thing will crash to desktop. Given that Atari as a company has dissolved and its assets stricken to the four winds, the only solutions available on hand are:1) Play this game on a PC with more modest videocard specs2) Download someone else's ""res.aitd"" resolution config file (or make one of your own), copy-paste it into the appropriate user AppData folder location and hope you won't get stuck on a looping intro screen animation with no menu items3) Purchase Alone in the Dark: Inferno on PS3 instead4) Grit your teeth and accept that some things in life are just not meant to beFurther details:http://steamcommunity.com/app/259170/discussions/0/611701999519746944/Additionally, while the game does support Xbox360 controllers, it will NOT automatically detect it at game start up. Instead, you need to go into the Options -> Configuration screen, click on one of the default keyboard control keys as if to rebind it, and then hit any of the buttons on the controller: whereupon the game asks if you want to rebind the controls to the controller and will do all of it automatically if you click on ""yes"". And you will still need to use the mouse to exit the Configuration screen because the controls won't take effect until you leave that particular menu item. Fiddly, but easily solvable.Now as for starting an actual new game itself, I have two words: good luck. You might be fortunate enough that the game will start if you change your speaker settings from 5.1 (or what other setup you may have) to Stereo. Which is a silly thing but it's worked for some people. I am not one of those some people. I am one of the 4) people whose moderately beefy machine specs have rendered an 8+ year old game unplayable. Apparently upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 might help but that requires upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10.Well, this is a good a time as any to build an archive machine for playing older Windows games, I guess...

Of course the game has negative points being the most relevant camera and aiming in first person, other than that there are more than 10 enemies, 5 bosses, various combinations of items and of course intelligent puzzles.

The default resolution is just ugly and you can't change the resolution settings, if you do the game goes into a continous intro loop, with no menu option. The controls are unresponsive and frusterating. I really wanted to like this game, but its so broke that its unplayable. 0/10			"

												This game needs some love. This game is AWESOME. Yes it has some bugs, but its very enjoyable. I had so much fun on xbox 360 that i bought it on steam. The PC version is good too. It takes a bit of time to get use to the controls but its worth it. The game is fun, totally recommend it!			"

												I played this game on Xbox 360 before. The game itself isn't very good, but I played it in a room with friends and we had a blast. The bugs and glitches this game has along with stupid animations made it hillarious.Small list of hillarious things:1. When swarms of bats attack your car, the safest thing to do is get out and back in, this resets the bats for some reason.2. When hotwiring a car, you slam the gas and your foot goes through the pedal.3. Your main adversary is a crack.4. A chair on fire is a better weapon than a sword or gun.5. The crafting system is insanely stupid. (Strapping bullets to a molotov cocktail makes a bigger explosion)6. All wounds can be cured with bandages or healing spray.7. Healing spray repairs clothing.8. Your inventory is your jacket, the game doesnt pause when you open it, but they kind of wait around for you to finish.Anyway, these are just a few of the laughs we had. Theres a ton more.Definately a game to play in a group. 1/10			"

												I don't get all the hate... yea this game has lots of downsides, but it has lots of positive sides too, atmosphere, music, decent looking graphics and quite unique mechanics that still plays fresh. My biggest issue is contols, default keybinding is awful, even after remapping buttons it still take some time to get use to. To be fair controls isnt that bad, for example Dark Souls 1 plays absolutely horrible on K+M and port overall is much worse, but i don't see any mass hate there.			"

												What the hell happened to this franchise? Alone in the dark was a classic survivl horror and was the basis of what would become the popular Resident Evil franchise, however, newer games with new ideas started coming out and Alone in the Dark was left out in the dust. Atari quickly put their minds to work and decided to resurrect this forgotten franchise but make it fit in with the new demographic of gamers by taking out everything that made Alone in the Dark great and adding in every sort of cliche in horror game history.Gameplay is the biggest thing that's been butchered in Alone in the Dark as it literraly doesn't live up to it's name. You're not alone because there are tons of people that will follow you around at some point and you're rarely in the dark. You can play the game from a first or third person perspective but the controls for both of these perspectives are terrible. When in first person, your sight is limited to what you can see an you'll most likely get stuck on something and half the time, you won't even know what you're stuck on. In third person, the controls feel restricted and you'll struggle to pull of basic actions in the game. The camera is awful in the third person view because your mouse is terrible for controlling the camera and it constantly fights with you. I failed doing a certain jump near the beginning of the game and it took me 6 attempts to get right because the camera switched perspectives when I went to jump. There are a few gameplay elements which seemed like good ideas but weren't used up to their full potential. The inventory management is one of them. In game, when you want to look through your inventory, the game doesn't pause and you need to look down at your shirt and actually select the items you want to use which is a great idea but, you might be shocked to hear this, the controls suck in the inventory screen. You will constantly try and navigate over to a certain item that you want, only for the game to take you to an item that you've never needed before. The game is also buggy as hell and some bugs will prevent you from proceeding with the game.The story is that Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character wakes up shortly before he is meant to be killed by some men for whatever reason and the thing is Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character can't remember anything about himself. However some weird creatures stop him from being killed and he escapes the building with a little bit of information about his task and he also escapes with Ms. Obvious girlfriend for unlikeable and forgettable main character. So the 2 go out and try and complete the task he's been given and also figure out who he is. By a horror stand point, this plot has been done to death but most horror games add a unique thing to it to make their specific telling of this plot memorble. Alone in the Dark doesn't. It literraaly takes the bear bones of a plot structure and uses it as it's final product.Graphics are a mixed bag and the graphics is probably the best thing this game has going for it. Certain things in Alone in the Dark look amazing. The fire looks brilliant and it's great just to watch the fire spread across more of a surface. The game overall looks OK but there are quite a few badly textured things you will come across throughout playing Alone in the Dark. Sound is relatively bad aswell, mainly because some sounds are actually missing from th game, mainly in the SFX. Some sounds cut out randomly and for no reason at all aswell.The game is quite short for a horror game and you can complete it within about 12 hours (my timer counter is broken for this, probably because my steam account had mercy on me and it didn't want anyone else to know that I had played this game for 12 hours.) There is no reason to replay Alone in the Dark either because there are so many bad things that are included in this that youwill not want to put yourself through this torture anymore.This was meant to have been the great return of a classic survival horror video game series but instead we were left with a buggy, ugly and unfinished messFinal verdictPros+ Some great ideas+ Decent graphicsCons- Awful controls- Buggy as hell- Forgettable story- Unlikeable characters- Missing sounds- Some ugly texturesFinal verdict: 2/10Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

												So Alone in the Dark. The series that inspired Resident Evil. Never really got into them. And I'd heard about this game for years and how terrible it is, but like always, I was like ""how bad can it possibly be?"" I mean, it was published by Atari and it ain't no crapass indie turdfest with its head shoved up its♥♥♥♥♥ Luckily, I am one of the few who can get this to run on Win7+, if the reviews on steam are any indication because it was a really halfassed port of a console game in the first place.Anyway, this game is amazing. It's a perfect storm of completely insane design decisions (tank controls in a game from 2008, mind boggling control scheme, ""press x to blink"" mechanic (???), among others that i'll get to later) that combine into a sort of weird fever dream of impressive stupidity that made me laugh almost the entire time I was playing.You start the game drugged and you have to press x to stop the screen from blurring, but it blurs so quickly you have to basically spam x, which means your screen is black 75% of the first five minutes of play, and some dude leads you up to the roof in order to execute you.♥♥♥♥♥♥goes south, and the first major part of the game is Tomb Raidering and fire fighting your way through an exploding building. Yes, fire fighting.You have to switch back and forth between first and third person in order to use items, and both modes control completely differently. When in first person mode, it controls like a standard FPS, but when you switch to third, it switches to static camera tank controls like in the original survival horror games. No biggie, I thought, I'll just use first person mode the whole time. But you can't do that, and it just jarringly shifts you out of it without warning when it doesn't want you to use it. I died about five times in one of the first areas because of this sudden shift and the resulting change in controls.The game is also super proud of its destructible environment mechanic so you spend a lot of time trying to smash through doors with a fire extinguisher. Unfortunately, the dude swings the thing in such a wide, awkward arc that you almost always slam the fire extinguisher into the wall next to the door. I figured out that the best way to do this is to face perpendicular to the door and kind of wiggle the fire extinguisher around until the door decides to swing open. It's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic.The first time you encounter an enemy, you run out of bullets almost immediately since it IS a survival horror game, and you spend the rest of the fight running around trying to find chairs to smash over her head. I finally found a lamp that i used to awkwardly pummel her into submission. Then I kicked her corpse into the rapidly spreading fire. And by kicked, i mean awkwardly shuffled around behind it until it triggered the next scripted event.I stopped because it crashed, but this♥♥♥♥♥♥is a wild wild ride and I've never played such a spectacularly stupid (but entertainingly so) trainwreck in my life.

												I can't even start the game, apparently when launching it is unable to proceed past a window stating due to an issue with ""Skylake CPU's"", however on further inspection shows an issue with Windows 10 and the game's DRM ,Securom. I have been unable to play it and had an even harder time finding a soultion to this, leaving the game currently unplayable. I believe its deplorable firstly that Atari and Eden games left this game in its shockingly broken, and in my case unplayable, conditions and two that Steam allowed this to be sold in said condition. My regret is buying this off♥♥♥♥♥and not being able to refund this useless software.			"

												Here are some things that happened when I tried playing Alone in the Dark (2008)First things first – accessing the Display menu inevitably crashes the game unless you do a lot of resolution fiddling. I just left it alone, and played the game without subtitles, which I don’t generally do. You wake up as three guys with machine guns threaten you and some old guy. The old guy is led to the elevator, while you are to be taken past him, to the roof, to be executed. You’ve just suffered a concussion, so you have to keep pressing a button to blink your eyes so that the screen does not dissolve into a blur. This is not the least bit annoying.Your captor insists on you never turning to see him, eventually threatening to shoot you. I managed to turn around just as he did so, and it’s because he’s holding an uzi gangster-style, which looks hella uncomfortable.As you go up to the roof, the walls open rip open to display some supernatural nastiness. Your captor freaks out, but not enough to actually do anything. The uzi-wielder shoves you against the wall and opens the door to the roof.  The darkness was waiting for just that moment to rip open the walls and devour him. This naturally causes the floor to collapses, dumping you in an unlit abandoned corridor.The corridor leads to a mirror. You walk up to it and scream “my god…who the hell am I?” Then you punch the mirror and shatter it.At this point you've gotten over your concussion, and the blinking mechanic is abandoned.You eventually make your way to the elevator roof, just as the old guy and his captors step in. The older one has to tell their captive – called Paddington – that Paddington is the only one who can manipulate “the stone”.  If he won’t, his suffering will be… legendary.  “About time”, says the younger one (referring to the fact that you’ve had time to walk to the roof, get a guy eaten and walk back before the elevator arrived), and then the darkness eats him. The elevator collapses, taking Paddington and the old guy with it, and you jump off.“To climb up (when on a ledge) SPACE” the game tells me. A moment later its prompt just goes “^” displaying an arrow as I face a ladder. It’s Space again, by the way.At this point the game keeps telling me to arrow things. It’s alternately E and Space.I unfurl a fire hydrant hose (?) into the elevator shaft and use it to rappel down. The elevator shaft starts to explode and burn down.I’m told to use Space to jump past obstacles, and die three times trying to move past a grate getting electrified by a loose wire. At this point the game remembers to tell me that I should use my body to move obstacles aside. The wire no longer a problem, the fire opens a hole in the wall, which I jump into.I grab a fire extinguisher and am told to spray the flames away. The controls don’t work. I redefine them in the options menu, and they still don’t work. Grabbing the extinguisher puts you in third person mode, and apparently you need to be in first person mode to spray the extinguisher, rather than use it as a melee weapon.Thankfully, the flames have died down on their own, without the need to spray them. I’m told to break down the door using the extinguisher. I can’t melee in first-person view, and random third person swings just won’t hit the door.There’s a flaming gap in the floor. As Edward drops his extinguisher and obligingly dangles on the edge of the gap, I’m told that I can’t jump with melee items equipped.As Edward pulls himself up from the gap, he faces the camera. Whether I hit forward or back (though I haven’t tried first person view) he simply slides back to dangle over the flames. Eventually the damage kills him.			"

From bad controls, to automatically changing to 3rd person CONSTANTLY, to those things leaping on your car and no matter how much you serve they don't get off, it's just horrid and to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. a ♥♥♥♥ing pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥Buy this only if it is on a very low sale. The controls are horribly annoying, it keeps switching back to third person automatically, sensitivity with or without a controller is really slow. Checkpoints are horrible, so far apart, you could kill a boss fight which is what i just did, go for a bit of a drive in the car, and if you hit load, because you made a mistake, it takes you back before the fight and cutscenes. Driving a car is fun but annoying. There is glitches here and there, I got glitched and was being dragged by the dark line thing for 8 minutes before realising i was glitched and the checkpoint took me way backIt is a fun game for a survival horror though, but it's just kind of annoying to play			"

												Ohh my, this game!Before I start my review I would like to point out I palyed this game on my pc without a controller. The PC port of this game is downright terrible in terms of controles. Maybe you sould get youself a controller before playing this. Presentation:So the game begins with awfull music and starts with an amnesia plot. So original! Afterwards you are running aound, trying to find out how anything works in the game. All the butttons are displayed with the X-Box controler icons so you have no idea how the controles works on a PC. After running around some time, and thinking the controles are bad, I incounter and enemy. The enemy is easely beaten, but dosen`t die! I figure out you have to burn the corpses in order to really kill anything in this game, and trust me they play on this fire thing alot in this game. From the begining I was afraid I was not gonna like this game, and I was right after all.Gameplay/Controles:To be honest there is a great aspect I like about this game, the crafting. You can find items all over the game, then open your inventory to combine items in order to make a bomb, or molotoves etc. This aspect was great but here comes the bad aspects. The camera can be switched from 3. to 1. person and the other way around. Sometimes I really think to myself, that the developers really did not know, if they wanted to make a 3. or 1. person game. They also switctes between these to modes some time, so I really wished they had just keept one or the other. The 3. person camera is either locked in a cinematic wiev, or right behind you and flies around if you get close to a wall. This togehther with clonky movement, makes the game So anoying to navigate.The combat is really stiff. Eventhough you can move the weapons you have in hand around, they still seem to do one of two attack animations. The pistol is so underrealming, simply becouse you need fire to kill anything. And the bad combats goes on, and is the main part of the game. When a charecter is knoked down, you either need to have some fire, or find a nerby firesource, if you have none, you are going to fight the same enemy over and over forever.There are driving in this game, but it is beyond bad. Eveything is so stiff, and you fell like you have no real contole over the car. There are even some driving porstions of the game, that took me SO long to complete becouse of the bad contoles. There are also puzzle accpetcs to the game, but only one stands out, and that was the ghost puzzle where you have to find objects to spell a sentecne for you, the rest is really generick but it all have a problem. The game is really not giving you any information how to do any of the puzzels in the game. Even when the anwser is not at all obvious. There is some dark floor you have to light up in order to walk past it, but the game dose not tell you how you can deal with it in other ways that are way smarter and easier. There even is a part where you have to make a really complicated bomb, in order to open a door by sticking it to a minion and there has been no indecation that you are able to do tihs.The gameplay is really focus around fire, so everything get`s boring fast, becouse you only have to think of one way to win. There are many options to make weapons, but you simply choose the simples one, becouse any other way is either too complicated or too wierd. You can also rewind time in the menu. It`s a really pointless feture. Just wanted to mention it. Charecters:I could start by saying, ""what charecters?"" All the charecters are so badly wrinten and the only way to get anything from them, is by reading SMS`s you get on your phone throught the game. Even this informatiuon is not interesting. So here are the charecters steriotypicall: main good guy with an atitude and amnesia, worthless girl charecter that works as loveinterest, old guy that knows whats going on and helps amnesia charecter, evil guy and evil force. The dialog for all of them is so badly written and you care about no one in the story. Overall the charecters are so bad the game really makes you ask youself ""why am I playing this?"" ""what do I get out of helping charecters I hate?"" Visuels:This game is very ogly. The graphics really look to pixeld eventhough it`s a never game. It tries to have a seriuos look sometimes, but the graphics really kills it. Only a few moments and a boss looks ok, but why could they not make the whole game look like that? The game takes place in Central Park, and therfore everything looks the same. Eventhough you laster in the game can explore, you find out how doll and gray everything looks. The coloursceam is a big minus here.The animation for the game is also very wonki and glitchy. Sometimes the enemies can jump in the air and fly after your car eventhough you have driven far away. All in all the game look badSound/Music:The main theme of the game I think is bad, but you can of couse like it if you will. The rest of the sound is nothing to write home about. Story/bossesThere will be no spoilers here, but I will comment on the ending. So this is an amnesia storry. Your charecter has no idea who he is, and has to find that out. He finds an old guy and a girl and starts to figure stuff out. Then an evil guy shows up and want to kill the manin charecter. The goal of the main charecter and the evil guy is to either stop or let out the devil. And by the way the devil destoryes a huge part of New York, and is aperentlly hitten under Central Park.The story is really boring, and all of the charecters fells like they are totally ok with everythign that happens around them. You are just running around from one location to antoher while the girl is trying to find anything out about you. This leads to lot of traveling and a lot of bad combat in order to find the portal to the devil. Eventhough the concept sounds cool it is executed in such a bad way, that you really losse interest of the story early on.I have to mention there are boss fights but only one good. The rest is just plain bad and they are really few too.About the ending. You have to make a choice, but trust me NONE of the choices makes for a good or even decent ending to this game. Conclution:So you kinda know now what I think about this game. I see it as a bad port from the X Box and a bad game in general. As a person that loves good carecters and story this game tries way too hard to have a good story and it just makes all the flwas shine even more.Combine this with bad graphics, bad combat, anoyng puzzels and overall bad everything and you got youself a bad game in my opinion.

This game was obviously made to be played with an xbox controler because it would tell me to press 'A' and when I do on my keyboard nothing would happen! The fact that you can play in 3rd person or first person is okay, but when I play in first person, the character will go back to 3rd person randomly, which can get really annoying.			"

												The story is good so far, but I haven't been able to get past chapter 2 very much due to terrible controller issues. I am not a 3rd person view kind of guy, unfortunately, the game is practically FORCING me to use 3rd person. Not really a point to keep putting it back into 1st person every time. Plus, the X axis mouse sensitivity is WAY too high, and the Y axis mouse sensitivity is WAY too low. I tried changing these options in the settings, but they did not do anything. Another thing is that the resolution is screwed up. If you change the resolution any higher than the default, the game crashes. On top of all this, the saving system is messed up. Bad. I got pretty far into Chapter 2, but when I saved, got on it the next day, it reverted back to the very beginning of chapter 2.I'm just gonna enjoy a let's player play this (hopefully without a microphone). I'm sorry. I just can NOT play under these conditions.			"

												An average survival horror game that shows more flaws than should be.First of all, the adventure is interesting but at the same time also features lot - and I mean LOTS - of clichés. The gameplay is fairly linear and whatever puzzles there are are uninteresting. Initially this was planned to be the first in a set of episodes, but it looks like all further episodes were canceled. What we end up with is an unfinished story that leaves plenty of things out in the open.The best of the game is probably its atmosphere: it really does its best to convey the ""haunted house"" setting to the player, but unfortunately is only partly successful in this due to the graphics not being up to par and some badly chosen mechanics (""press x to blink""). Also, but this is fairly subjective, I find the ""horror"" element to be too much in your face - for this type of survival horror I prefer a more subtle approach that intensifies as the ending nears.The worst of the game are its technical issues. It is an Atari game for the PC, so you know what that means ... Everything about this game betrays its console origin.The graphics are only meh, not bad bud also not great. Large polygons, repeating textures, sudden transitions in animations, ... Despite its average looks, it uses a lot of resources on your machine so people who meet the minimum requirements may suffer.The controls are clunky and very console-ish, giving you far more buttons to press than actually necessary while also combining several functions under one key - something that is not needed on a PC! Cutscenes are unskippable.Then there are the crashes. I was lucky and able to get the game working quickly (a lot of peeps on Steam can't even get that far). But, yes, trying to change the display options crashes the game very time. A gamepad works unreliably as well with this.To make matters worse, the game comes with additional DRM: the much hated SecuRom protection.And it would not be Alone In The Dark game if the camera hinders the players whenever it can.Summary:If you really want to play this game, get it on your favorite console but avoid the PC version at every cost. This game on PC is the definition of a horrible port.			"

Changes won't take effect until after restart. Okay, no problem.4. Restart game. Can't get past intro screen. Annoying.5. Force quit and try again. Display is back to the default low resolution.6. Change settings again. Make sure I apply them.7. Restart. Still can't get past intro. Controls not working... Sigh.8. Try playing at default resolution. All control tips are pictures of XBox buttons.

												Intro starts, you can skip it, go in and change graphic settings from default 800x600 to 1920x1080.It says game needs a restart, which you do.As game restarts you cannot skip the intro or else the game will exit, if you dont try skip it, it just plays through on a loop until it decides to crash.Upon restarting the game, the settings are all back to default.I read the reviews here and to my own fault largely ignored them as I have played it on PS3 and like the game.Ok after finding you have to manually edit configuration files to get the game to work, I dont see how a major publisher like Atari can still release what is essentually a broken game, the game is that old now you would think it'd be patched by now.Now playing it, wow the controls are soooo annoying, it just all clunky as others have said, there is an awesome FPS view that when ever you do an action like open a door, you change out of, then manually have to change back too.And I am playing with a gamepad and ok so D-Pad is walk left analogue is open inventory, what the hell?

												Oh well. After so much rumor about the game back then, I just had to buy it when it was finally on sale for 2 bucks. And what a mistake it was.This game seemed to be so promising on Xbox 360/PS3 back then, but the PC port is just horribly bad.The graphics are just meh, with crappy animations and low res textures (even if you crank the settings up to max, in first person it just stays ugly). But since this game is over 7 year old, this may be forgiven. What I can and will not forgive though, is the fact that it's FOV-locked and has no support for any other aspect ratios than 16:9. There's not even a hacky fix to be found around the internets, so you're out of luck if you don't have a 16:9 display.The gameplay has some interesting bits to it, but generally it smells due to a ridicoulus keymapping (it basically requires you 3 hands to play), really bad movement in third-person, and a wonky fighting system. But not only that, at every point where they try to scare you, there's usually a build up over 20 seconds, in which you will nearly fall asleep murmuring ""oh, the horror"", until the actual scary event happens. So, horror game? Maybe, but not in the sense of a spooky setting.The game might be a tad better when played with a 360 controller, but I have yet to confirm that.Sound wise - well, there isn't much  to be heard. Effects are ok, the few lines of synchronization are not too bad, and the soundtrack tries to keep you excited, but ultimately doesn't do much for the game (mostly because it only sets in with scripted events).I was really hoping that this game could somewhat live up to it's hype back then, but it completly failed - and although it might sound harsh, it's understandable to blame this game for Atari's insolvency. It was just such a huge mistake to give this project to a studio, which only had developed racing games (which were actually decent, see Test Drive Unlimited) previously.So, should you buy this game? No, if you're interested in good graphics, good gameplay or a good setting. No, if you were hoping for a good horror game. But yes, if you're a die-hard-fan of the old AitD games and really got a thick skin to bear it's flaws.			"

												Having heard a lot about the classic Alone in the Dark series, and being a fan of the horror game genre in general, I decided to try out the newer instalment of the series.Alone in the Dark, or Alone in the Dark Inferno as it has now been reprised, is not a particularly good game - nor is it particularly bad for that matter.It works with a few very interesting concepts and mechanics.The game's mechanic that allowed you to combine items in your inventory can be used quite creatively sometimes - and as such allows for a lot of player choice when tackled with certain scenarios. The biggest flaw in my opinion is not the game mechanics or the visuals as much as it is the story. It did have some really good concepts, but overall it feels as if the climax was underwhelming compared to the intriguing build up.Either way, a 6/10.Not too good a game - but not bad either if you have about 10 hours to spend for a mediocre horror game.

Got realy angry on the controls - couldnt find this 'to spray use 0' button to put fires out... Nowhere in settings, the notification in game of what key you need to use is all in triangles, squares, circles , you know XBox bullcrap. This is hevily console game and it shouldof stayed that way. I cant stand console games and stupid controllers.Thats my take on this game. I dont know if its good or not. Graphics seems to be OK for 2008 game.

												I'm sure this would be a great game, if only it would let me play it properly.First thing I did when I opened the game was to go to the Options Menu and look for the Video Settings. Nope, can't do, game crashes. Apparently this is a common problem. Ok, fine, let's leave the video settings as they are.When the game started, I thought it was cool that it lets you switch between first person and third person view. When in third person, it moves like the old Resident Evil games, which I loved back in the day... playing with keyboard? Frustrating as hell. The controls are very unresponsive, and non-intuitive.The game looks nice, and it's interesting, it makes me mad that I can't enjoy  it because the broken controls.Also, seeing that is uses Securom for activating the game, so that is gonna be bothersome too when installing in another system.

												Finished this game twice on the 360, and barring some bugs and control weirdness on the PC, it's still such a cool, strange game. Alternating between stupid and staggeringly ambitious, AitD remains possibly the most singular survival horror game ""genre piece"" made to date. Systems upon fiddly systems of needless simulation that nonetheless serve to give the player a wonderful sense of agency in the world. My recommendation however; *use* the ability to fast forward. There are sections of the game that are almost unplayable, such as the early car escape. Skip it! The game lets you! To get to the ""actual game"", fast forward to the chapter immediately following the car escape. AitD is by far at its best when it's a free-form open world roaming ""sim"", so play it that way. Experiment, poke at it, laugh at it. It's a rube goldberg device masquerading as a horror game. At this price, I cannot recommend it enough.			"

The story is dull, controls are clunky (you will do the same move, once it works, two times it won't)...and above it all, if it starts consider you self lucky. Mine dont want to start. Cracked exe files for pirated version did the trick and game launch, but the question is if i need pirated version to play, why did i pay for this sh**. I emailed Atari but I didn't get any reply. All in all, avoid this game unless you are collector and don't care if it works or not. If you really want to play it, get it elsewhere because with all not functioning and all bugs, this is not worth it. Oh, and it still uses SecuRom protection on top...			"

The graphics are ok so far, not much to shout about, think quake era I guess.Allows for 1920x1080 resolution thankfully.Maybe a patch will sort out the sound mess so I won't have to keep switching back and forth for my other games to have better sound.

												Wow. I've never seen a game this glitchy....The framerates are really bad which I can live with, but I've already encountered a game ruining bug causing me to be unable to progress 20 minutes in. You need to smash down a door right at the beginning of the game with a fire extinguisher and I've only been able to cause the attack animation 2 times out of about 70 attempts (to do it you just click the attack button in third person view btw)Anyways, I failed to hit the door with both attacks. Even if I make it past this part, I can only imagine the further horrors to come. Gonna just write this purchase as a loss. I really thought this game was great on ps3 a few years ago tho. It's funny that this game was considered horrible at that time due to the bugs, but I managed to make it really far before I had to return my 1 week rental without any snags at all. I really wanted to finish it on steam but this is the true nightmare edition lol. According to the reviews this game is working for some peeps tho. Buy it if you're feeling lucky :D			"

OverviewJust like the PlayStation 3 version, this Alone in the Dark is a poorly optimized waste of your money and harddrive space. Graphics are slightly improved over the console version, but that’s about it.You might notice my playtime, less than half an hour. Don't let that dissuade you from an incomplete playthrough. This is identical to the console version, and not worth the second play through.TL:DRDon’t buy it. Even if on sale. If it comes in a bundle you purchase elsewhere, that’s fine; just don’t install it. Avoid it, as it does the Alone in the Dark name a grave injustice.The Good+ Environment. It has a few jump scare moments that are unexpected.The Bad- Graphics. They’re horrible, even at max settings. The PlayStation 3 version looks identical, like Atari did absolutely nothing when porting it to PC.- Controls. They’re also horrible. Carnby controls like a tank, but not in a good way (like the original Resident Evil games). Whether you’re in first-person or third-person, they’re horrible.- Sound. The sound effects are boring. The acting is bad. The music has a few good moments but is very generic. Speaking of generic…- The story. It’s been done a billion times before. The original Alone in the Dark had a fairly interesting story. Atari did not try, at all, when it came up with the story for this game. It’s like they used one of those online generators to plug in a bunch of info and had it spit something out.- Replayability. None. Not like you’d want to play it through once, much less multiple times.The Rest+/- Technical issues. There are a lot of issues. Disclaimer: Despite having the game in my library for a few years, I’m going through my backlog as of early 2015, so playing a 2008 game on a Windows 8.1 system may cause issues. With that said, I can’t necessarily hold technical issues against the game, as they may not have existed when the game was new.			"

												First of all you got to browse the community hub to get this piece of dirt to work in a state of the art resolution, otherwise you will be left with a dead exe or an infinite intro video loop. Then it runs like absolute garbage even on way overpowered hardware. I originaly bought it because it looked like a cool fps, but it is a 3rd person adventure with a lousy 1st person vision added to lure that extra % of audience. The x axis has twice the sensivity as the y axis, rendering good aiming or even fluent navigation impossible. I would not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This game is a bunch of interesting tech trying to be a game.* Fire Propegation* Physics based smashing of doors and other things the environment* Thumbstick control of the characters hands instead of an attack button (Ok, Fight Night was out at this time everyone giving this stuff a go).* Episodic content (Which can be skipped)* Scarring and wounds that carry with you throughout the entire game..  This is cool, but finding a bunch of healing things with the clunky controls is not.. * Opening the jacket to arm yourself and craft things. Again, seems human right, but it would be better in menus.* BlinkingEden made some really good Test Drive games and I suggest you try them out and have fun there. The poker in TDU 2 was really quite fun. There is an awesome little car section in this game which shows promise... But back to the review..I tried playing this on console when it first came out and it is not better on PC.I can understand what they are attempting to do with this game but I can not recommend it to a friend.

												Seems like a neat game, unfortunately the controls are awful and you'll be fighting with them the entire time.  In about 40 minutes of play the game has frustrated me at every turn.  I'm constantly accidentally jumping off things to places I don't want to be ( or my death ), melee is awkward, and the game keeps putting me into 3rd person when I want to be in 1st person.The shining moment was when I found a katana on the ground and then promptly threw it through a hole in the wall into ""never gonna be seen again"" land by accident.Also, the frame rate will stutter like crazy for no apparent reason.  I have far beyond what this game requires in terms of hardware and the game will sometimes just completely stop being able to handle life.			"

												The people that ported this game onto the PC should be shot in the dark. Totaly unplayable, 1/10 (only because it had a decent opening).			"

												The game that started the popular survival horror genre returns better than ever! Players control Edward Carnby, the main character from the original Alone in the Dark, on a thrilling journey through a dark and terrifying re-creation of New York's Central Park where Carnby must discover the truth behind a dark conspiracy. With inspiration from the presentation style of popular action TV dramas, Alone in the Dark will be split into a number of distinct episodes. With approximately 30-40 minutes of gameplay comprising each episode, the structure of Alone in the Dark pulls you into world that delivers a fiercely gripping and terrifying experience. Each time the player launches a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players' nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more. Alone in the Dark will provide a complete next-generation, action packed experience within a highly detailed, free roaming environment, featuring a mixture of real-time physics and full environmental interaction. The game will mark a new beginning for the Alone in the Dark series.			"

												During back then, I didn't have a gaming pc as an ordinary teenager,and I do really like Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare at that time on PSone. And now, after saw this game in a sale, I thought I'd give a shot regardless of negative feedbacks concerning this game. Suprisingly, I have only few issues concerning this game (FPS and annoying control issues). Other than that are just fine.I would like to render this a neutral rating, however since that option is not available, I have to say yes yes for this game. However try to get this game during sale since it's in a terrible port condition - unless fixed by developer.			"

												I...alright. So originally, when I first started playing this, it was pretty damn cool. Weird mechanics, some neat storyline. That quickly changed. In the very beginning, blinking is a key game mechanic. I thought that was neat and would be the main difference between other games, until the inventory system, item handling, action buttons, and overall controls were introduced.This game would have been so much better if there was one main different game mechanic, but there are tons of them, and it confuses the player and makes the game feel like a chore. Walking, in itself, uses tank controls, and some of the mechanics aren't even used (for example, blinking to clear your eyes of blood during combat is useless because combat is in third person).The story is great, the idea is awesome, but I couldn't go more than two chapters in without shaking my head and telling myself to give up.

												it's decent stuff.Pros:* game plays better in first person view.cons:* should have been enterely a first person view game, but it's by default in third person and game can give more hints like this* non intuitive gameplay and puzzlesif you can go past very bad controls, then a try is good on a sale.

												Another exceptional console game with an awfull port.Do i recommend the game? Yes, by all meansIts so advanced for 2008 game, even today, almost 7 years later. It puts big focus on physics and creativity to survive. It lets you explore freely most of the time so you can look for supplies(even tho they are mostly easy to come by ""along the way""). It has very interesting enemies and melee combat system, amongst other interesting and unique features, like closing your eyes to see some things better(yup, its a thing, you will also have to blink manually at times) and combining everything with everything to get a tool best suited for you current situation.Games story is really good and even tho some people will say its ""just another post-apocalyptic zombie game"", this is not the case, first of, its not post-apocalyptic, its apocalyse preventing one and there are absolutely no zombies here(although some enemies do look like them :P).Also what i would like to point out is that this game is made in a way to resemble a tv show. What i mean by this is that every time you resume your previous session, a ""previously on alone in the dark..."" will play and highlight key moments that happened to that point , also, every time you complete main objective for that chapter, end credits will roll, but, in adition to this, game is playable in 1st as well as in 3rd person, and 3rd person is very cinematic, with great movie like camera angles while 1st is very immersive so, pick your favourite.Do i recommend the PC version? Absolutely not!If you have XBox360 or PS2/3, play it on one of those instead, because, PC version is just bad, mouse and keyboard controlls are not that good, new PC's and systems cant run and/or configure it properly, visuals are glitchy at places and the game was never and never will be patched because the complany went bankrupt from what i heard.All in all, amazing game, bad port, but since im reviewing a game here, imma hit ""Yes"" for recommended, an as for the port itself, you have been warned			"

												Me estoy poniendo al dia con algunos games viejos y no queria dejar pasar la oportunidad de probar este alone in the dark luego del 4 para Playstation.El juego en si no esta malo tiene mecanicas interesantes y resolucion de situaciones muy copadas. Cosas como el inventario que es la chaqueta lo hacen reales al igual que romper la puerta con objetos y demas (situandome en el año que salio)EL tema que tiene un punto en contra fundamental que es la jugabilidad.....Que tosco que es moverse por momentos podes usar la primera persona que alivia un poco las cosas pero cuando estas en 3º persona es muy duro para moverse. La historia es aceptable, pero tampoco te da demasiada intriga como para seguir a ver que es lo que pasa mas adelante....De todas formas creo que merece un postivio ya que seria un 5 casi 6/10			"

												A very different approach from previous Alone in the Dark games, innovative in some ways specially the inventory system and i really enjoyed this game despite being so different than the new nightmare.But beware! The PC version is a complete disaster regarding hardware compatibility.Only get this game if you have a PC with Windows XP or Vista and a GPU with 2GB of VRAM or less.			"

												The game does not run on windows 7. Probably won't work on Win 8 too. But i have Windows 10 and latest AMD drivers for R9 380 and i can run this game without any problems about resolution.Not many people might like this or even read this review, but i will write down my thoughts.In this game, you play as edward carnby, who wakes up to an amnesia, and try to identify yourself and the events going on around you. After a very nice introduction to yourself you will find yourself in the horror that shadows the whole world and you will try to solve mysteries with some allies.Short review:This is my favorite game. Very nice ambiance, exciting story, strong characters, thrilling survival and good looking visuals for its time, 2008. There are few glitches of the game but i think i can tolerate them. Resource and inventory management is crucial to survive. Music is fantastic. Controls are complicated but it creates variety of actions in gameplay. A very depressing open world game with a relatively big map for its own time. The story may not be much appealing or interesting for everyone but i think survival is enough to keep you playing.Long review:- Alone in the dark is a horror game. But the horror is not cliche jumsp scares or chasing. This is an openworld game with a very depressing and shivering environment. And conviniently the game takes place in the night :)- The rpg element of this game is edward carnby. He is trying to remember his past while also trying to run away from bad guys and creatures around him. The story of edward carnby is not only about his memories. It is also about his destiny with a shocking ending. There are also allies and enemies in the game and they all play a role in the story.- There is a very nice central park as the openworld in this game. You can drive cars around but some areas requires you to walk in. This is nt a walk in the park, i think this is a pun :D There are monsters cruising around just like you.- In this apocalyptic survival horror, you will need a weapon obviously. You only have one handgun but you can utilize it with other inventory objects. Inventory plays a very big role in this game. For example there are explosive bottles and you can throw them on to the enemy and shoot it in the air to blow it up. You have a lighter and you can use it with mosquito spray to creeate fire like a dragon. You can create a molotov with a piece of colth and an explosive bottle. Even more, you can wrap it with a bandage to make it stick on a surface or enemy. You can use your knife to penetrate the blood bags and create a path to a trap. Because some creatures are blood thirsty. And there are other inventory items and possibilities as creative as these. You will find items in the trashes or cars or in buildings or jsut in the middle of nowhere.- There is a healing mechanism in this game. If you take a critical hit, you will start beleeding. You should stop beleeding with bandage. If you get hurt, you can heal your wounds with a medical spray. Use and store it wisely.- The enemies in this game have a weakness. They show a specific fissure-like wounds and those places can be set on fire. So yeah you are basicaly burning zombies :) This is the efficient way of killing them. Your X-Ray vision is required to progress through the game and it gets enhanced as you kill evil roots of evilness. You will now what i mean if you play the game.- Fire is a usefull element. You will need fire extinguishers to extinguish fires.- There are 2 different cameras. First and third person views.- There are nice riddles in the game. You have to be creative to solve them.- The game is chapter based. There are 8 chapters with severals checkpoints. The good thing is that you can play or skip any chapters at any time. If you are stuck in a riddle, just skip that chapter or checkpoint. I did this in my first gameplay and completed all over again without skipping. There is a ""previously on alone in the dark"" kind of introduction at the beginning of every chapter. Which is another awesome aspect of this game. This game is the most cinamtic game i have ever played. Second is max payne 3. A not: James McCaffrey is the voice actor of both this game Edward Carnby and Max Payne 3 Max Payne.- The inventory items can be coupled with a shortcut. There are 4 shortcuts available and each one can be assigned to a specific button while pressing "" key. For example, a lither and a mosquito spray is a good combination. You can make a shortcut for these two by selecting them and assigning them. This way you will not have to switch hands or search your inventory, you will get your equipment ready to use if they are available in your inventory. Another example, you can mix your bullets with explosives and they can become burning bullets. You do not have to mix them everytime you reload your weapon. Just assign a shortcut with your gun with fire bullets. If you have explosive liquids, they will be automaticaly mixed with your weapons magazine.- The objects like a pipe can be weaponized in this game. You get a baseball bat or a peace of wood and swing it with you mose and hit the enemy with mouse click. You can also take a wooden chair, light it up by holding it into the fire, and strike the flammable enemies with it.- The game has the best music of all games i have ever played. Definitely suits for the ambiance and escence of the game.- The stroy is an end of the world apocalyptic scenario, which sounds lame, but it has revealing connections to people around you. This makes the game interesting. You will wonder what will happen and you will be shcoked at the end.And only one downside of this game as i can see. There are glitches and cheap deaths. Not much frequent but can be anoying sometimes. But i have never complained about anything because game is fantastic.This game has revolutionary ides of its time but i don't think much people even know about it. I loved every minute of it. It is cheap and if you have windows 10, just give it a try.			"
