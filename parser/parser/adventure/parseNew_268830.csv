												In my opinion the best Doctor Who game, considering that there aren't many good ones.Pros:+Music (Murray Gold's awesome incidental music fits perfectly into the action)+Voice Acting (Provided by the original actors, it somewhat lacks the energy from the show but is forgivable)+Story (Doctor Who games almost never fail to bring a good story, with its great monsters and never-ending possibilities)+Atmosphere/Setting (Doctor Who can run wild with its locations, thus it can place random things at random times and places without being questioned for it)+Characters (Standard friends/baddies from the show, and perhaps a few new faces)+Modelling (Every character looks very alike their real life counterparts. Except Rory, god they ruined his face)+Cards (This one is kind of cheating but if you're a Doctor Who fan, you would have always wanted this. Plus, card designs are nice)Cons:-Gameplay (Controls are somewhat messy, mechanics are too easy)-Graphics (Not all that important, and considering it was made in 2011)-Replayability (Playable for about 2-3 times to collect everything and before getting bored of the story)-Length (Episodes are about an hour or so each, so this game can be complete in under around 6 or 7 hours)-Crafting rewards (Another cheat, basically cancels out the above pro. Expected better badges, emoticons and backgrounds but hey, Dalek emoticon)Basically, 8/10 for Doctor Who fan (familiarity is what this game relies on, as the fans would understand and forgive all the cons to make way for the pros)6.5/10 for non-Doctor Who fans (non-fans most likely would not understand much about the show, characters, music, stories, and monsters, and therefore the pros would not affect them much, and the cons would overpower the good aspects. Go watch the show!!!)Wibbly-wobbly, but still worth playing at its price.			"

												Thumbs up, but definitely not a perfect game. The episodes themselves are fine, story and voice acting seems like proper Doctor Who episodes. Sadly the game has a few impractical things in it, low graphics and a few bugs. The mouse seems laggy in the buzzer game puzzle, which is pretty annoying. I also feel they overdid the stealth thing a bit; there's a lot of it. The music is great, ofcourse, the game uses the music from the tv show.The sound in this game really bugged me; the voices did not seem to come from the characters properly and it didn't sound like the voices came from the place the character was; they sounded like they were in a sound studio (which they probably were) and whoever managed sound didn't do a good enough job to put the voices in their proper setting. The sound effects are also off; knocks on doors, for example, is randomly played and does not match the characters hand hitting the door. In the last episode, for some reason,; probably supposed to sound like wind or water; the sound sounded like a crap microphone sound over skype, like someone put their volume on too high and didn't speak, but the mic kept running. The game has a fairly low quality on the graphics, but most characters have a good likeness, with the exception, I feel, of Rory, who looks rather bland and not too recognisable. Amy's face makes her look 12, which is an awkward mix with her short skirt and the whole being married thing.I experienced a few bugs; in one episodes it's possible to fall into the water, but you spawn on the harbour again almost instantly so no harm done. Another bug I had was starting the game from the main menu into a particular savepoint where there is a puzzle with lasers spawning in hallways that are timed and you have to move between corridors to dodge them. For some reason when spawning into this savespot from the menu one laser was on all the time and the other lasers never showed. ""Fixed"" by suicide, but annoying again. I also had a few times npcs would get stuck; mostly random npcs wandering around, but at one point an enemy as part of a stealth puzzle (made it easier so I shan't complain too much), but most annoying; when you are in a stealth puzzle and have a companion with you, your dumbarse partner has a chance of getting stuck and if you're reeeeally unlucky they will get stuck in a point where they are found by an enemy and killified and you have to start over.Another impractical things; you cannot see your collection from the main menu in the main episodes; you have to quit to the menu to see it. The game has 2 options when opening it; either run the first 4 episodes or the longer Gunpowder episode. The first 3 episodes has 3 acts and when you have completed it you can start in any act, which is nice if you forgot a collection item. For some reason the Gunpowder episodes does not have this option and you have to start over from the beginning of the episode if you missed something. Is it for fans only? Probably yes; as with all the bugs and minor nuisances you can probably find a better game in the genre. Most episodes have enemies already seen in the Doctor Who universe, but nothing a newbie can't handle, with the exception of episode ""Tardis"" where you get a quiz about some things from the show (even from pre-2005). Nothing google can't fix and the questions don't change should you fail and have to try again, so you can always guess your way through.Overall a decent game if you want to feel part of a Doctor Who episode or five, but not the best game for its genre and a non-fan should probably look elsewhere for p&c adventure.Edit: Typos			"

Doctor who the adventure games is a game based of Doctor Who and has a set of episodes.which include minigames, stealth, and pretty good stories.Its more enjoyable if you like doctor who also i recommend watching series 5 atleast first.The gameplay.The gameplay is mainly stealthing around or collecting items and doing minigames.The minigames are pretty simple but sometimes annoying or boring, ill give some examples.You havea minigame whre you have to get a part to the middle but if you touch any lines it resets,You have a minigame where you use you're sonic screw driver to open doors by getting on the same signal.There are also collectibles with facts.The stealth does what its supposed to do its not anything special,the game does have a companion dies you die mechanic which kinda sucks.Sometimes you just have to pick up stuff from the ground and use them on other things.Story.The game has 5 “episodes” some are better then others.The Main characters are voiceacted by the same people they are on the show.I dont want to spoil the episodes so ill just give the order i like them the most3-4-5-1-2GraphicsThere not much to say here theyre decent and it has proper resolutionsOnly complaint i have it you have to press a arrow to see the higher resolutions took me a while to find out.Music.It uses some show music like when you complete a puzzle or at the end of a episode,again not much to say here.Final verdict.Its an decent game with basic mechanics and mainly has its story going for it.Buy it if you like doctor who if not maybe you shouldnt.

												This game is Octodad levels of bad controls. It's JUST as jinky, hilariously frustrating and absurd to try and control at points. I actually found this to almost be a positive. If you found yourself seriously ENJOYING Octodad, the controls in this aren't quite as complex but just as hit and miss at multiple points.Graphics wise it's about 6-8 years old despite being only 4 years old. Clipping issues and some rather gnarly graphic glitches do exist, but overall it's a fairly sound PS2 game. The storylines and voice acting so far have been fairly good, and overall it has been very fun to poke about and enjoy some between episode shenanigans.  That said, I am a huge Whovian nerd, and this game is delightful to me. I am having a blast with it, and actually really enjoying the retro feel. It's not a AAA title, it's not groundbreaking or incredible.It's a Doctor Who game, with decent to great writing, hilariously bad controls and rather nostalgic graphics obviously done on the cheap and holding a very firm sense of the absurd. Basically it's like Classic Who and Nu!Who had a video game love child.I'd honestly have far LESS fun if the graphics were AAA level and the controls were smooth and reliable. It's the very rough corners that make this FEEL more like Doctor Who.If you're a Whovian, I highly recommend you grab this when it's on sale 10-25% off. If you're a nominal fan, I recommend this when it's on deal of the week or 70+% off. If you're a giant kid inside who adored both the old and new Who? Get this now. Just do it. Don't argue. Enjoy the game for what it is- a little jaunt into the marvelously mad world of Dr. Who.			"

												Normally I don't play these kind of games, but since I do like Doctor Who I gave it a shot.The controls be clunky at times, and it's not the most beautiful game, but the voice acting and story are top-notch, as expected from the BBC. I can recommend this game, but do keep in mind that the controls are a bit meh at times.9/10EDIT: Forgot to say that the camera is also well designed, and the humor is really awesome, which is something you can expect from Doctor Who :)			"

												The gameplay is pretty ok, the graphics look like they were meant for the PS2, and Matt Smith lacks the explosive enthusiasm that is so important to his protrayal of the 11th Doctor. All in all, the novelty of playing as the doctor is enjoyable and gameplay is pretty decent. Fans of the series might find some enjoyment in this game. 0 out of 5 no Tom BakerEdit: After an overwhelming amount of comments about getting the game for free on the BBC website I decided to add this edit. If you don't live in the UK you either have to buy it from here or get it from a cheap bundle like I did.			"

												This is one amazing game. At least, if you're a Doctor Who fan. The stories are well written and the dialog is witty so anyone might enjoy this game. But for those who love Doctor Who? This game is a must. There are five Doctor Who stories in all which tie into the show. Every story is presented like a television episode including the opening theme song and credits. But YOU get to play those episodes! The main characters are The Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond. The character models for the game look just like the actors AND are voiced by the actors. All in all, it's a pure pleasure to play. I'm about halfway through all the stories and I still marvel at their high quality. Maybe the character movement isn't quite as responsive as it could be but everything else is topnotch and I am giving this 5 out of 5 stars. Just as I will rewatch Doctor Who episodes on tv, I will replay this game again as well. This is one of my best buys on Steam!Oh, Additional: Gameplay - a mixture of stealth and puzzles. If you want action, I believe the other Doctor Who game on Steam supplies that.			"

												If you are a Doctor Who fan, you will love this game. This is the ONLY reason this is getting a thumbs up. Its everything Doctor Who. Enemies, the use of the Sonic screwdriver, Tardis and the occasional british humor. The plus side its the actors actually voicing the characters.However please keep in mind the following:- Mouse controls are wonky. Some puzzles take longer because of this.- You can NOT skip cut scenes. Don't fail something as you get to sit through the whole thing again. This also applies to replays.- Climbing, jumping and doing actions seem to take FOREVER as the character needs to line up to preform the action- In the Gunpowder Plot you get the oppertunity to fall through the enviroment.... over and over againThere were a few places where locating things became annoying. Overall I enjoyed the stories and the game seemed to at least progress at a decent pace. If your a Doctor Who fan this should end up in your game library.			"

												First i was affraid to play this game from my personal experience with games based on the movies.The most of them are terrible but fortunately Doctor Who: The Adventure Games isn't this case.If you don't have this game yet maybe you asking ''What's this game about? Is it good? Should i buy it?''.In this review i'll try to answer those questions.The strongest part of this game is story.Earth is in troubles and only Doctor and his companion Amy can save the situation.Sounds easy enough?Well,unfortunately your greatest enemies will try to kill you.Will you prevail against Daleks,Cybermen and others and could you stop their evil plans before they conquer the Universe?Gameplay is interesting-mixture of adventure,stealth action and puzzles.Together they work surprisingly well and keep you enterntained in entire game.Graphic is very good,it could be better but also it could be much worse.I'm not that type of guy who judging the game for graphics, in fact it's the least thing i care.In this case i could tell the grapic is solid and well made.Sound is awesome.Some songs are from show itself others are very similiar and make perfect atmosphere.Last thoughts: The game is great for every Whovian and not just for them.Even if you never watched the show you can easily get into it thanks for Facts and information from Cards which you collecting through game.So the answers for my questions from the first part of this review are ''Doctor and his adventures.Hell yeah and Sure thing.''Thanks for the reading and i hope this review helped.Summary- pros: epic story,incredible sound,collecting informations and cards,funny gameplay (specially puzzles) and wibbly wobbly timey wimey....stuffcons: maybe too short (i just want another episodes to play ^^')Final verdict 8.2/10 -it's a fantastic game.

												The adventure game format is  a great fit for Doctor Who, as are the stealth sections.The short length might not be to some players' tastes, but it fits the story. I find it takes about two hours to play through an episode the first time, which puts it on par with most other adventure games.The real-time re-creation of the show's title sequences are beautifully done, and it's overall a good demonstration of how to go about making a game based on a TV show.That said, it does have a few flaws.The characters are rather lacking in facial animation. The developers would do well to take a leaf out of Valve's book in that department. Their mouths sync up with the dialogue and they blink occasionally, but their faces are otherwise largely static, making the game seem a lot older than it really is.The controls are a bit sluggish, though they are somewhat improved in Episode 5, due to it having been made later.The music has a tendency to get a bit too loud when string-heavy action sequences are playing, resulting in the sound effects and speech getting masked a bit.Finally, the sequences which are explicitly about solving puzzles (typically involving modifying some kind of device) tend to be much too easy, and even then the challenge is usually about actually going through with the solution, rather than figuring it out in the first place. I'm sure this was meant to give the youngest members of the audience a chance at solving them, but it would have been nice to have an option to make the puzzles harder for older players like myself.Overall, though, it's a good game and it's worth dropping $10 on when it's on sale if you're a fan of Doctor Who.

Low budget game dedicated only to Doctor Who fans, if you are not one of them, stay awayEven though I love Doctor Who series it breaks my heart to say I do not recommend this game. Doctor Who: The Adventure games consits of 5 separated stories, which are plain and simple, but still interesting. However if you are not acquainted with the doctor who universum there is a minimal chance you'd like it. The game is strickly focused on facts and details from the Doctor series. The gameplay and walkthrough is alike plain and simple, ""grab this and carry it there"" system combined with a range of minigames is not the best combination.Pros✪ You can use sonic screwdriver✪ Full of interesting facts (mainly about Doctor Who series, but also e.g. about history)✪ Series authenticity (same actors' voice, atmosphere etc.)Cons✪ Plain and simple both the story and the gameplay✪ Repetitive and far too easy minigames✪ Game mechanics is sometimes too weird, but nothing underlying✪ Austere background and graphicsIn a nutshell the game made me very disappointed for there is nothing really special and catchy, but who knows what it could have been with more care and higher budget.5/10 Average Adventure			"

												The Adventure Games, when first released for free online, were the closest we we would get to a true Doctor Who video game. Then they disappeared, before later appearing here on Steam for the hefty price of £14.99. I ignored it for a while, but then they were part of a sale. As a Whovian, I couldn't ignore a game set in the main Doctor Who continuity, with the actual actors, at such a cheap price. So, I bought the game, and prepared for some heavy nostalgia.These games are difficult to review; they aren't very good, but they're not bad either. The levels are repetitive, and the graphics leave a lot to be desired. However, the series is fun. It's addictive collectable gameplay  prevents gamers from getting bored, and for software clearly targeted at children, the material does have mature moments and clever references. Plus, unlike some recent Moffat scripts, it actually has the balls to kill somebody off.I suppose the game is fun, and I would recommend buying it, but only when it is in a sale. The game is worth spending money on, but not fifteen quid. However you acquire the game, I hope that it brings you some wibbly wobbly, timey wimey banter.			"

												Fans only type game.If you're not a Doctor Who fan, you'll have little patience for the dated, simplistic graphicsand gameplay.If you are a fan, you'll get 4 charming, roughly hour long episodes. The graphics are datedand the puzzles and gameplay are simplistic but entertaining, and there are several sets of ""trading cards"" hidden throughout to keep things interesting. Technically there are 5 episodes, but the 5th episode(which you have to launch seperately through the Steam interface) is just awful, it's much longer and frustratingly tedious, and although they included Rory in episode 5, he looks like a zombie with his neck stretched out by some horrible accident.The only real sticking point is the price...if you live in the UK you can pick these up for free, but here in the US Steam wants you to pay 20 bucks for the package. I picked it up on sale for 10 and was satisfied (10 bucks for 9 hours of gameplay, pretty good) but there is 0 replay value (unless you miss some of the collectibles).			"

												Normally, when games have Mixed reviews on steam, I generally avoid them. But considering it's a Doctor Who game and I LOVE Doctor Who, I was willing to give this game a chance.I was so wrong.Let me start by saying this: The concept of the game is not bad. Voice acting is spot on and with the way they set up ""episodes"", it makes it seem like you're actually directing/in an episode.HOWEVER, the controls mess everything up. The controls are so bad that enemies catch you so easily and so often! You run into♥♥♥♥♥♥you didn't mean to run into! The characters are slow unless you push HARD on the controls.Puzzles are not that tough and you can find collectibles rather easy. Graphics also aren't that bad, considering when this game was made.Another thing they should add is more emoticons and wallpaper. Why isn't there a TARDIS emoticon? It's Doctor Who for crying out loud! You need the Blue Police Box!If controls weren't so bad, this game might actually be worth something.But holy shiza, it is almost impossible to properly control the character with these controls.Animations, graphics, and controls are the things that DEFINITELY need to be improved on.If I knew how to make a game, I would totally try to remake this one.5/10. Please remake it.			"

												As a massive fan of Doctor Who I decided to try out this game to see how it was.  Let me tell you that one of the things they got right here is the dialogue of the characters.  Everyone's in character here and the dialogue can range from dead serious to openly hilarious just like in the show and I have to say that it's great to see that here.  Also, they have the soundtrack from the show in here which is ear candy.  Whether or not you find that great fan service or just plain lazy us up to you to decide.Unfortunately, that's where my praise ends.  I'm not one to usually rant about graohics, but you have to admit that the visuals could have been a lot better here.  Also, the controls are incredibly wonky and awkward.  It's awful that the Doctor has to take a walking start before he actually runs.  And your companion: Amy is a major handicap to play with since her AI is just awful.  And the stories that takes place in the game are...okay.  They're just okay.  Nothing major to run home about.  The stories are nowhere near the gems that take place in the show such as Vincent and the Doctor or The Doctor's Wife.  But still, they are nowhere near as bad as other stories such as Angels Take Manhattan or Nightmare in Silver.For recommendations, I would only recommend it if you are an obsessive die hard Whovian.  But for the majority, I just can't recommend this game.  I probably would have been more leniant on this game if it was free like it used to be in the UK, but on Steam where it's worth $10, it's just not worth your money.			"

												Why I like it? The storys are great, they could be an episode with a little tweaking. The graphics are amazing, everybody in the show looks like themselves in the game (apart from Rory, who looks completely different). If you think it's just like the first Doctor Who game on Steam don't. Every problem in the Eternity Clock is not in this game. You get five storys, 4 with Amy, and then one that's a little bit longer and includes Amy and Rory called ""the gunpowder plot"". I spent 12 hours playing it through, but there is a lot of replay value. You get everything thing you pay for, and I don't regret my purchase one bit.			"

												I only recommend this game if you are an ultra fan of the Doctor Who. It´s like see some episodes of the TV Show, the game is easy to complete.Annoying replayability, there is no option to skip the LONG dialog scenes in case you want a second playthrough to get the achievements / collectibles. USE A GUIDE TO AVOID SECONDS PLAYTHROUGHS, they are as long as the first one (so much linear maps / histories).But if you don´t care about achievements and you are a good fan of the Doctor Who, the adventures are interesting (like the show) and is nice to play as Matt Smith and Amy Pond.

												I enjoy Dr. Who as a T.V. series and was excited about this game. I enjoy the voice acting, the episodic levels and the iconic humor. The only downside to this game is during stealth activities my companions are too derp and get caught when following me and I can't see them, resulting in starting at checkpoints/cutscenes repeatedly. (Maybe I have been too spoiled by Last of Us A.I., where the enemies only react to you breaking stealth/getting caught) Although frustrating so far, that is the only thing about this game that is making it less fun for me. Derpy companion A.I. aside, I recommend this game to Whovians everywhere in any timeline :P			"

												I think this is my first formal reviews because this game is really complicated to reviewMy first thought is the control...is way too smooth and frustrating, you will regret this at the endIt makes this game sounds like a rage gameGraphics is OK, definitely looks like development doesn't know what is shading.Gameplay looks little awkward and the puzzles are really mess you up.BUT you still play on it because :-the STORY, if you watched Series 5-7(part 1), you know that drill. But too bad No Steven's story in this game.-the MUSICS, is kinda obvious, right?-the VOICES, guarantee are from real actors, trust meIs really worth it to Whovians who still miss Matt's StoriesEdit: Episode 5 have changed aside of the others, the control improved but the gameplay is giving a lot of problem.

I tried 2 different keyboards. But anyway I managed somehow to enter my name :D It does not matter at all anyway..Well I recommend this game , even you are or you are not a doctor who fan :)			"

												Do I recommend this game? Yes, if you're a fan of Doctor Who, episodic-style games, and especially yes if it's on sale. No, if you're not a Doctor Who fan, and especially no if it's not on sale. Do not buy it at full price. The first four episodes are a good mixture and balance of everything you like about Doctor Who:  the dialogue, the stories, the villains. And the balance between narrative and the mini-games is appropriate. Avoid playing Episode 5:  The Gunpowder Plot at all costs. Seriously. They ruined a great opportunity at building a great episode around a great moment in history. I swear, the ratio of narrative to interaction is entirely unbalanced. In episodic-style games you HAVE to have a balance. 80% of episode five is interaction and mini-games. They will make you want to tear your hair out. You switch back and forth WAY too much between Rory, Amy, and The Doctor. 20% of the episode is the dialogue and the story. I wanted more of THAT. This epsiode was longer than it had any right to be. I finished the first four episodes in about eight hours, give or take. The Gunpowder Plot took me almost five hours to finish. One freaking episode. So if you want to keep your sanity, don't play episode five. Otherwise, cook yourself some fish fingers and custard, get the game when it's on sale, and enjoy the first four episodes. :)			"

												Only recommended to diehard fans.  As someone completely indifferent to the series, I saw it and thought ""hey, you know what?  A point-and-click in the Doctor Who universe, what could go wrong?""  Ugh... everything, apparently.  TLDR: It's beyond mediocrity and overall, the only way you could like it is if you were the most fanatic DW fan out there.  Then again, if you are that person, nothing I could say could possibly deter you from buying this, so have fun with that.I won't focus on the small things, like the Bethesda-grade visuals and lacking optimization that makes it run worse than Crysis.  40 FPS is still playable, bad controls can be put up with, and the lifeless animation and Xbox era visuals are acceptable if you grit your teeth a bit (noting this game wasn't made in 2001, but 2010).  I'll focus on the legitimate issues with this game, the ones you can't just grit your teeth and put up with.What I ended up with in playing this was a Telltale game with none of the charm.  The entire game is EXTREMELY linear (it literally tells you ""Wrong Way"" and forces you to turn around with any deviation from the path, LucasArts is literally rolling in its digital grave right now), and the entirety of the content is so barebones that, much like a Telltale game, the only thing that could save it is a fantastic story.AAAAAAAAAAAAnd that's not what it is.  It's Doctor Who fanfic, basically.  The writing is okay, and the actors (possibly impersonators, no clue) did a pretty good job of coming close to the usual acting, but it's hardly The Wolf Among Us here.  Five episodes of 'eh.'When the game does give you freedom, it's through awful stealth sequences in which you can only right-click to move in the camera direction (the arrow key controls are sickening, to say the least), and I was able to cross a hallway with a guard simply by hiding behind pillars AFTER it noticed me and waiting for the heat to blow over, with NO INVESTIGATION.  Or, the guards are all-seeing and will spot your braindead companion with ease.  Even if it had a fantastic story, these sections singlehandedly ruin the game.It's free directly from the BBC's website if you're in the United Kingdom.  If you happen to be a real Brit and not a 'Murrican wannabe, go right on ahead.  As for paying for this game?  There are plenty of high-quality adventure games you can buy instead, like Grim Fandango or Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.In the meantime... there are better things to do with your money.  For example: "

												The voice acting is so terrible. Fine, you have Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill, but they sound like they are falling asleep. The dialogues are just as bad: I guess they are meant to be funny, but I couldn't smile about any of them.But then again... it's Doctor Who. It feels like you play a short episode of the series. The gameplay is simple, you have some stealth parts, riddles and minigames. It is never difficult and the environments are rich in detail, the secondary characters are great. If you like Doctor Who, you will find those four episodes very enjoyable.However, I didn't like the 5th episode, The Gunpowder Plot, at all. It has as much story as one of the other episodes, but it is as long as the four of them combined. The checkpoints are horrible which makes its stealth segments extremely frustrating. The atmosphere of 1605 London is great and the last of the three chapters is quite exciting, but that's it. It scarcely feels like an episode of Doctor Who, it is rather an educational game about the 5th of November. Oh, but the Silence freaked me out.			"

												Disclaimer: Do NOT play this game if you are not already familiar with Doctor Who, at least up to Series 5 (new Who, in case you were wondering). Otherwise, none of this will make any sense whatsoever. If you are, however, this bundle of games, excluding maybe the first one, can be quite enjoyable. Don't expect too much - these are basically bonus episodes to Series 5 and 6, set up as adventure games with stealth and minigames - but they are (usually) just as well written as the tv programme itself, and get better as they go on. The continuity cavalcade going on in the third one - TARDIS - is especially lovely; and not only that, both the Doctor and Amy explain what they understand of the TARDIS controls, and you actually get to have a go yourself! Definitely makes the scenes in the tv programme where he's flying ""Sexy"" more interesting to watch. So, if you're a Whovian, and this happens to be on sale, don't think, BUY IT. You won't regret it. And you'll have fun looking for all the collectibles...			"

												Erm... I'm not sure what to say about this game to be honest. It's. Good? To be honest I can't tell. It's just a mix of good and bad, I think it's the most 'meh' game I've ever played. It captures the feel of the Doctor Who series, but at the same time it doesn't. Mainly because of how it looks. It looks... Bad. Just. Bad, but the daleks are in it! But the stealth system is on the verge of being broken... But look it's the vashta nerada! But the puzzles are terrible... But OMG it's the cyber men! But there are random facts that if I wanted to know, I would play and educational game (Which I would never do anyway)...But there's the... Thing that sucks the time energy out of you?

												Great stuff!This is a very good value title for 10 hours of action and adventure and 5 Dr Who episodes.Of the 5 adventures, the best by far is the last one, The Gunpowder Plot, with a lovely atmosphere and a fine (but rather too clean)  400 year old London to walk around. I spent about 6 hours on this titele, with the first 4 episodes lasting around 4 -5 hours in total.There is a lot of stealth and repeat puzzles, which are all pretty easily solved, but the storylines are very enjoyable. Daleks, Cybermen and many more await. I started watching Dr Who at the end of the 3rd doctor, just before the best, Tom Baker, and these 5 episodes easily rank with the tv shows, though it's a bit sad to have to listen to the politically correct rubbish in there (a blackboard is a bloackboard, not a chalkboard etc etc) but this was made by the BBC, so you are bound to get the subtle indoctrination of the Loony Left in there too.Recommended for 10 entertaining hours.

The voice acting, if not the actors themselves, is SUPERB. It makes me miss Matt Smith as the doctor. It gives you that nostalgia type feel to the game. The trading cards are cute and fun. I think this is a fantastic game for any whovian. The only thing I was a little upset about was the one where you would have to get the part through a maze as things that zapped and ""killed"" you moved around you.

Posted: March 20, 2014
												This game is simply baffling to me. I really, properly don't even know what to make of it, or what my opinion truly is on it.It's strange because sometimes I absolutely despise it, with it's glitches and it's lack of polish. And other times I find myself really enjoying it! Completely immersed in the world of Doctor Who and completely freaking out over the fact that I GET TO FLY THE TARDIS or the tiny, little thing that is USING THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER.Let me go into a little bit more detail... This is a bundle of 5 games that were originally release in 2010 and 2011 episodically. They are all set during the early Matt Smith era of the show, back when he was travelling with Amy and, later, Rory. Each 'episode' is about 2-5 hours long, and is a unique plot written by several of the show's writers, such as Phil Ford. The script's are perhaps the best part of this game, as they are, for the most part, as interesting and well-written as the script for an ordinary episode of the show. This sense of authenticity is enhanced by the use of the show's actual cast to provide all the voice acting. Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill all do great jobs and slip back into their characters without any effort whatsoever.So, that's the good. Now, for the bad... And brace yourself, because there's quite a lot of it to get through.This game was made on a teeny, tiny budget by a very-inexperienced team. So the whole thing look's, quite frankly, appaling. There are just 4 graphics settings in the main menu, and none of them look at all comparable to even the most low-budget game released in the past 5 year's. This lack of polish also extends to the gameplay, where glitches and clipping abound. The otherwise-excellent cutscenes also, unfortunately, suffer because of this.Oh, and then there's the gameplay... Now this is the bit that baffles me. As I said before, sometimes I will find myself having a lot of fun with this game, and that's mainly because I am a massive Doctor Who fan and there is a certain thrill out of doing things like exploring the TARDIS or outwitting the Daleks. I am a big fan of this series, and it's obvious the developers are too. The amount of love that has gone into this game is obvious right from the outset. The enviroments, while ugly to look at, are packed with details and little, obscure refrences. But, as fun as these bits are to play for me, they still can't save the rest of the game from falling into the pit of mediocrity. Take the stealth's sections for example; They're okay, mechanically, but a lack of depth really holds them back. Basically all you do during these sections is wait for the enemy's cone of vision to pass, before running past them to the next bit. There's you formula, rinse 'n' repeat 4000 times. People have been saying this reminds them of Metal Gear Solid, but I don't see the resembelance. At-least MGS actually has some amount of depth to it's mechanics. And doesn't merely consist of simply waiting for an enemy to pass, before bolting to the exit.Then there's the puzzles. Some of which are clever... Other's? Not so much.The one's that require you to explore the enviroment and mix multiple items together to solve problem's are good fun and really highlight the attention to detail that the devs have paid. Not to mention, they also harken back to old school point 'n' click games, which is great. The more basic, minigame-like puzzles however, can be fed to a pack of hungry Yeti for all I care. (And yes, that was a refrence to The Great Intelligence's footsoliders during the late 60s.)So, overall, what do I think of Doctor Who: The Adventure Games? Well, I'm really torn about the whole thing. As a fan, I certainly got a kick out of certain sections, and the game can be a very fun experience at times. But as a game critic, I have to admit it fails to live up to my standards for a modern video game... Or anyone's, for that matter. While some portions of the game are a lot of fun, other's are just poorly-designed and realised. And these sections drag the whole experience down.Should you buy Doctor Who: The Adventure Games? If you're a Doctor Who fan, and this may suprise some of you, but I'd say 'yes'. If you love Doctor Who and are prepared to put up with some shoddy design and lack of depth, I think you'll have some fun with this. The experience is very true to the show, to the point that it often feel's like you are simply playing an interactive Doctor Who episode, rather then a tradional 'game'.So, yes. If you're not a fan of Doctor Who, you'll think this is an absolutely abhorrent attempt at a game. If you are, then I think you'll be able to look past the flaws, and see this game for what it truly is.			"

												It was hard to look at the characters in the game...Are they on some sort of informerical face cream?Ok, let me set something down.I LOVE Doctor Who. I love season 1 all the way to season 7. (Not a fan of the seasons after that.) Yet, this game has some major issues.Pros: The stories are pretty original, even though I haven't played all of them yet. The controls aren't too shabby, and the music is good.Cons (oh boy): The graphics are pretty bad, everyone is WAY too calm, the camera is spastic, the levels are tedious and very simplistic, talking to Amy is like talking to a brick... What's the point? And finally, the game is just generally boring.So, if this game is on sale and Doctor Who is your life, then get this game. Under any other circumstances, DO NOT get this game. Get Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock instead. It's a much better game.5/10 stars, this game needs a bit of work.			"

												The adventure games that used to be free on the BBC site. I'm not going to complain about the price overmuch because I got this as a part of a very cheap bundle, but it's definitely not worth the full Steam store fare.  It's a pretty simplistic series of adventure games. Clumsy controls, simple puzzles, some stealth segments. There is enough running through corridors to feel like authentic Doctor Who. Authentic voice actors too, but they could have used some better directing. They sound bored for the most part.Last game, the Gunpowder Plot, is a slightly improved version. Longer too. As a whovian I might have given thumbs up if it was just about that game, just might have. Some redeeming qualities in that. The rest of them are worse and have very little meat on them.If you are a whovian and a big fan of eleventh this might be worth getting on a big discount, otherwise avoid.			"

												I find it very hard to say this but I do not think you should buy this game unless you are a die hard Doctor Who fan.The voice acting is poor and the game play is subpar. The graphics and game play style are rather reminicent of much older games like the Summoner. This game came out the same year as Skyrim but looks like and plays and looks like a much shorter and simpler Morrowind.There are a handful of minigames that are repeated and every level feels the same, avoid the bad guys seeing you and get from point A to point B to click on item C. There are some puzzles that can be difficult to figure out since you have to be standing in just the right spot to click on the right item in the right way.I found it entertaining while I played it but as I said, don't get it unless you are a hardcore Whovian.

												Doctor Who is a show that captivated audiences, not by the flashy special effects, because there were not many in its early days, but due to the story. This holds true for this game. With the voice actors being the ones from the show, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman, and the story being very strong, the game captivates in the same. Its not a very flashy game, whether its due to a lack of combat or strong mechanics, or interesting controls, so the story is the glue, and any Doctor Who fans should try it out for that reason. Side note: if you can only play games with mouse only controls, this game works well for that.			"

												A Fantastic, possibly the best game based on Doctor Who. It contained good enough graphics to satisfy my whovian opinion. It contains 5 episodes including the special Gunpowder Plot. My favourite  episodes were Blood of the Cybermen and Vasta Nerada. It gave me the creeps whenever an enemy walks past. If your a Doctor Who fan, you should definately get this.			"

												Well i played the whole game back in 2012 when it was published on bbc page. But i didn't have a good pc back then so i wanted to play it again this time smoothly. And having DW game in your steam library is a plus,too. So i bought the game. And instantly regretted it. It wasn't like how i remembered. Graphics, lip-syncs, controls, unskippable scenes and dialogues and so on...But still it was DW. So i played it through. Didn't change a thing about the way how i see the game. At least We got to use The Tardis. Summary: Like others said an ultra fan's must have. But don't expect so much			"

												This game is not good. Terrible as a game, actually. It all looks and feels unfinished, especially the last episode (The Gunpowder Plot) which felt really rushed. While the characters do quite look like their real life counterpart, the rest of the game looks like it was developed 2005. Some rather bad controls as well.You run around interacting with things, solving puzzles in the enviroment. You do have an inventory, but it's rarely used. There is some puzzles in form of mini-games, and they're pretty bland and uncreative. There's also some stealth sections, which can be pretty frustrating, since the field of vision on the enemies on some parts are just unfair, and they can also shoot through walls. Oh, and you have Amy with you as well, and if they see her, they shoot her and that's game over. So be careful, and make sure she keeps away from their line of sight.This game has some redeeming qualities though. It gets hilarious, due to the glitches and bugs, and the lack of enthusiasm in the voice acting makes it funny as well, especially in the more tense parts (well, it was supposed to be tense anyway) of the game.All through the game you can pick up collectible cards that features things from the Doctor Who universe, such as enemies, friends, and companions, to name a few. There's also some objects that you can interact with so you get some facts, both taken from the real universe and the Doctor Who universe.This game will be interesting to the whovians. If you're not a whovian, avoid this game. Score based on being a whovian: 7/10 Score based on being a gamer: 4/10 "

												This is a rudimentary stealth game with a sprinkling of mini-games.I am a Doctor Who fan. This game is not bad, for a 5 dollar laugh, but not full price.Pro's:- Original cast voice acting- Mini-games are fun- Graphic and Animations are better than expected (but I wasn't expecting much)- Chapters are short... this is good because it drives you to see what the next one is about rather than dragging out the experience needlessly- Amy's skirt is very short (I know that's a weak PRO but I was running out of good things to say which leads us too)...Con's- Instant death... again and again and again- Amy's super power is to get caught on objects while following The Doctor in the stealth sections to trigger the instant death sequences. EXTERMINATE!!!!- The Doctor control's like he's got a cloaked 10,000 pound hippo stuck on his back- Mini-games (this is always an adventure game crutch - so it's a PRO for not sucking and a CON for existing at all)- Extremely linear - A then B then C. If you try to explore it just turns you around- Since when can the Sonic NOT open a locked door? (When it's important to the plot, that's when!)- Over the top dialogue - Graphics aren't good enough to enjoy the fact that Amy's skirt is very short6/10(5 out of 10 + 1 for referencing John Carpenter's The Thing)			"

												These Doctor Who games used to be avaliable for those to download for free in the UK, I think they aren't anymore, and that's why they're on Steam. These Doctor Who games are educational, they have interesting plots, and they have very enjoyable game-play.When the TV show Doctor Who first started up it was meant to be educational, but the plan for it to be educational soon went down the drain as they introduced more and more aleins, they started to make the show less about history and more about science fiction and more about the future. Doctor Who was the perfect vessal for education, as it had the excuse for being in the past with time travel and it was facinating with the aliens it had in it. The game is educational and does it really well, it gives you facts about everything, which are things you can collect, it puts you back in time to certain places and teaches you about Guy Fawkes, and it puts you somewhere cold and teaches you about ice and snow and such. This game contains five different stories for you to explore and play. It contains the classic Cybermen, the Daleks, the interior of the TARDIS, The Vashta Nerada, and the Gunpowder Plot. These plots in the game feel like Doctor Who epsidoes when you are playing them, they are packed full of dialogue, action, and puzzles. Each story has the characters of The Doctor (11th), Amy Pond, and Rory Williams as playable characters. All three playable characters in the game are voiced by their actors in the show, which is quite nice to have in a Doctor Who video game. The gameplay is quite different than a few Doctor Who games, this is not a platformer, instead you can roam around and control your character outside of a 2D path. You can use the Doctor's sonic which will bring up a puzzle, because no Doctor Who game is complete without an annoying puzzle. The puzzles aren't always extra things that comes up on screen, sometimes you have to do a stealth puzzle and try not to be seen, and I must say there are a lot of stealth puzzles, most likely because the Doctor is passive and if he comes across a threat there's always the option to sneak by it.Overall this is a very nice game, the graphics are a bit old, and there are a few glitches, but it is playable. If you are a Doctor Who fan you will enjoy this much more thyan if you weren't, as it does have a lot of references, and even quite a lot of references to Classic Who. And if you're not a Doctor Who fan, you may enjoy it, but you might end up being very confused and have a bad introduction to Doctor Who.			"

												A set of games that I remember playing when I was a bit younger, but nice to relive some nostalgic memories. These games, while maybe not leaving the biggest mark, are still fun and full of great story and enemies. From the Dalek city of Kaalaan on Skaro, to an arctic base overrun by Cybermen, to the TARDIS where a malevolent Entity is loose, to an underwater base swarmed wth Vashta Nerada, and finally 1605 where Sontarans and Rutans are getting caught up in the Gunpowder Plot. This game has endless bouts of facts on the show as well, and provides the Doctor, Amy , and Rory in the fifth one, with clear personalities and qualities. Very disappointed they didn't continue, but all good things must come to an end.			"

												In my opinion the best Doctor Who game, considering that there aren't many good ones.Pros:+Music (Murray Gold's awesome incidental music fits perfectly into the action)+Voice Acting (Provided by the original actors, it somewhat lacks the energy from the show but is forgivable)+Story (Doctor Who games almost never fail to bring a good story, with its great monsters and never-ending possibilities)+Atmosphere/Setting (Doctor Who can run wild with its locations, thus it is can place random things at random times and places without being questioned for it)+Characters (Standard friends/baddies from the show, and perhaps a few new faces)+Modelling (Every character looks very alike their real life counterparts. Except Rory, god they ruined his face)+Cards (This one is kind of cheating but if you're a Doctor Who fan, you would have always wanted this. Plus, card designs are nice)Cons:-Gameplay (Controls are somewhat messy, mechanics are too easy)-Graphics (Not all that important, and considering it was made in 2011)-Replayability (Playable for about 2-3 times to collect everything and before getting bored of the story)-Length (Episodes are about an hour or so each, so this game can be complete in under around 6 or 7 hours)-Crafting rewards (Another cheat, basically cancels out the above pro. Expected better badges, emoticons and backgrounds but hey, Dalek emoticon)Basically, 9/10 for Doctor Who fan (familiarity is what this game relies on, as the fans would understand and forgive all the cons to make way for the pros)8/10 for non-Doctor Who fans (non-fans most likely would not understand much about the show, characters, music, stories, and monsters, and therefore the pros would not affect them much, and the cons would overpower the good aspects. Go watch the show!!!)Wibbly-wobbly, but still worth playing at its price.			"

												If you are a fan of the television series, Doctor Who: The Adventure Games should prove to be pretty enjoyable. The actors from the series were brought in to voice act their respective characters and do a decent job. The graphics are passable but not so intense that you should worry about computer performance. Everything works pretty good for an adventure game. I did however find myself stuck in a reload into death situation once or twice so multiple save files are recommended. Overall the price is a wee bit high for what you're actually getting here. These are pretty fun for fans of the show, but pick them up on sale.			"

It's a simple adventure game with story that respect the timing and story telling of an episode of the series. These are clearly made for yougers and even have an educational purpose (especially in the Gunpowder Plot), but DW fans should enjoy it nonless.Pros : - Good story overall- Simple gameplay accessible for everyoneCons :- Too simple gameplay- Voice acting is not that good, even if the original actors are hereSo, here it is, I highly recommand The Adventure Game for DW fans, but clearly not for any other people.

												Despite the fact that its plots are childish and filled with deus ex machina, the Doctor Who television series remains a pleasant vice, so I was thrilled to learn that the Timelord had finally made his way to video-games. I was even happier to learn that this translation was into an adventure game rather than some sort of hackneyed action arcade; the Doctor has always been about exploring nooks and crannies and conversing with strange characters, and the traditional adventure format fits that style perfectly.Actually two adventures - the first made up of four smaller episodes -, the game captures the feel of the television series very well, although some of the voice acting (performed by the original cast) is a bit underwhelming. I encountered many of the usual Whovian villains - Daleks and Cybermen and Sontarans and more - with locations ranging from 1605 London to strange alternate dimensions. I even got to explore the Tardis and - even better - fiddle about with the levers and knobs that sent it spinning off into the time-vortex.The actual gameplay is less impressive; obviously aimed at both the younger set (well, Doctor Who is a children's show after all) and casual gamers, its puzzles ranged from simple ""use item A on person B"" to even simpler tile-matching challenges. There were a few stealth sections too, but these were equally forgiving. The graphics weren't high-end but were pretty enough and got the job done. Both episodes combined clocked in at about 8 hours length.The end result wasn't a particularly memorable /game/ but did make for a nice addition to the Doctor Who canon, so I generally was happy with the purchase.

												Doctor Who: The Adventure Games is an excellent game for all Doctor Who fans and puzzle game fans alike. If you're not very good at puzzle games and not a Doctor Who fan, I highly suggest looking somewhere else for a good game to purchase because this game can get REALLY frustrating at times. I'm not a particular fan of puzzle games, but the story really drew me in and made me feel just like I was watching Doctor Who. Every episode you play actually has an intro and outro based on one from the show! I was really excited to see all of the fan-favorite Doctor Who monsters that appear in this game (especially the Vashta Nerada). The puzzles mainly involve sneaking around the monsters without being detected/killed while they're walking in a constant pattern or re-wiring interfaces so that they're usable for you (among other things, those are just the most memorable for me).Each episode should take you about 45 minutes each if you aren't looking for the many collectable trading cards scattered around throughout the episodes. Each card has facts that revolve around the character(s) on the card. There's also some pretty interesting Who Facts that you can find in every level, keep an eye out for those!Overall, I'd say you should buy it just to hear Matt Smith and Karen Gillan being their characters (and doing it well) in this awesome Doctor Who puzzle game. I can't think of a reason that a Doctor Who fan could/would not enjoy this game, so don't pass it up!			"

												I should preface this by saying, it's a thumbs up if you get it cheap (I got it for $4 in an IndieRoyale bundle with 6 or 7 other games). This is great for those who want some more Matt Smith & Karen Gillian content. This game should be seperated into 2 seperate reviews. One for the first 4 episodes and one for the Gunpowder Plot. The difference in quality is massive.The first 4 episodes are hindered by very janky controls, short and rushed episodes (Episode 3 takes roughly 30 minutes) and none of the stories themselves are memorable. They are serviceable at best. It's rather uninspired stealth held together with some very poor puzzles. While not unplayable these episodes just feel empty. You can definitely tell that these were games made on a low budget. Considering they are free to citizens in the UK through BBC's website, I can understand why the quality isn't that high.Gunpowder plot is  definitely a major improvement. This one takes a good 2 hours (close to 3 if you get everything) to complete. It's a very nicely written Doctor Who story that is based aroundGuy Fawkes & The Gunpowder Plot (Hence the name of the episode). The controls are much more responsive, the tacked on puzzles and stealth are also much less prominent. The pacing is a bit too slow for my tastes but this feels like a legit Doctor Who adventure in video game form that's actually worth the time and money spent. If you're considering picking this game up then it's for this episode alone. It's shockingly solid.So for $5 or less you can't go wrong, but at their core these are very very simple and short little adventure games. Don't go in expecting brilliance and you will probably enjoy your time with them assuming you're a Doctor Who fan. It just has a disturbing lack of rock quarries.			"

												Well, the adventure games tell reasonably Doctor Who-ish stories. Various game mechanics tend to repeat quite a bit, like the puzzles, or sneaking through areas guarded by enemies, which doesn't really happen all that much on the actual TV show.The first four episodes were comparatively short, and very linear. Sometimes you play as the Doctor, sometimes you play as Amy, but the character you're not playing is either standing around somewhere or following you, so it's still very linear.The gunpowder plot is considerably longer. They've added Rory into the mix, and they made the switches between characters more meaningful as characters might split up to do different things. It's still linear progression, and switches between characters happen when the game says so. As for the game itself, it's still the same: Doctor Who-ish enough to be enjoyable, but more repetitive than the TV show would suggest.It's not the must-have AAAAAAAAAAAA game of the millennium, but it's certainly a game to consider for a Doctor Who fan. You might want to pick it up on a sale, though.Controls aren't the greatest achievement either, but it's not an action game of any sort so there's no actual issue with that.Hint: try to search the areas carefully if you want to complete achievements. For example, if you're missing a ""card"" from the first four episodes, there is no hint where that card might be, so you have to replay all of them (at least until you find the missing cards). For ""facts"" you do at least know the episode where you have to search, although you still don't know which of the three acts you should be searching.The Gunpowder plot, being considerably longer, gives no hints where a ""fact"" might be missing, and it has no way to start somewhere in the middle. So, take your time to search every spot for ""facts"" on your first playthrough.			"

												I've watched the series something like 5 times, have quite a few merch t-shirts and an inflatable, remote controlled dalek. But this game is just clumsy, buggy and not the slightest bit funny. It even tries to educate you with Nice To Know Britain Facts - like public transport buses. But without them, there would be only few interactable objects.The game is that much linear, that if you, by mistake, do something wrong, you might end up in an unsolvable situation. Hooray. Oh yeah, and it has only auto save. So start over from scratch then.Feels and plays like a very bad done console port.Worst: even the voice acting is bad.Not worth 1 cent. Buy&try&refund seems ok, don't waste your money otherwise. It's feels like crap to me.			"

When I saw that this was a puzzle game/point and click I hoped for more of a Sam and Max type game but instead I was given a set of instructions that I exicuted by clicking my mouse ounce and winning immediately. This game had a great concept that was very poorly exicuted. "

												Well. Sigh. I'm giving this a thumbs up, but reluctantly.As sooo many others have pointed out, if you are a Doctor Who fan, you will probably like this. But that might be because we Doctor Who fans have learned to, ahem, lower our standards. It hasn't always been an amazing adventure in time and space...This game is OK, but has a lot of problems.You get the content of what would be five Doctor Who mini-episodes, but they're not very good. The plots are trite and predictable, the dialog weak and clunky. You meet some interesting characters, but because it's so short, they are skin-deep and do not develop.The game is very, very easy, to the point of being boring. Go here, get that, push that button. You are always told exactly what you're supposed to do. There are mini-game ""challenges"" that are trivial to solve on the first attempt. And they repeat several times. The level design is linear and unimaginative: there is almost no exploration. There are some stealth scenes, but they are repetitive and trivial. The levels are also very sparse: no objects to examine to enrich the game world, no intriguing designs to delight the eye, almost no attention to detail. Unless you try to find all the collectibles, there's nothing rewarding about looking around, even when it's possible (rare).The controls are wonky, sluggish, and annoying. The Doctor and Amy turn around like oil tankers moored in a shallow bay, and then run in a straight line like Forrest Gump. This isn't a big problem, though, because really all you need to do is run in straight lines.The graphics would have been mediocre even two decades ago. That said, this game works very well in NVIDIA 3D Vision. If you have that setup, everything becomes so much better! There are issues with the text converging at the wrong depth, but otherwise it's terrific. Make sure to play at minimum depth setting, though.In terms of fun things for Doctor Who fans, even that is disappointing. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan are not at their best here. The tidbits from Doctor Who's history all appear as ""fun facts"" that you just read as little cards, and there's nothing new to learn. You can't use them or interact with them: they are not part of the game. At one point you get to play with the TARDIS controls, but unfortunately it's been reduced to something like manipulating a tractor.All that said, it's playable, and a casual way to spend ~3 hours if you've really exhausted everything else Doctor Who has to offer. But few of us have. :) If you're a real fan looking for more content, do yourself a favor and go back to the classic episodes. I recommend the Jon Pertwee era (early 1970s) as eminently watchable and fun, a great way to dive into the past.So, it ends up being another flat merchandising effort from the BBC. Not awful, but very far from great. If you're not a fan of Doctor Who, steer clear.			"

With that being said, if you are a fan of the show, I highly recommend it. You get to see some of the great DW villians like the Cybermen, Sontarns, and of course the Daleks!			"

												Doctor Who The Adventure Games is a point and click adventure game. Yeah, an adventure game, shocking, isn't it? But seriously, if you're not a fan of Doctor Who (why are you here in the first place) and not a fan of point and click games, stay away because this is not for you. If you are a Doctor Who fan but are not a fan of point and click games, maybe watch a bit of gameplay on YouTube and decide for yourself. But if you're a fan of both Doctor Who and point and click games, you should give it a go. It's nothing amazing but it's eterntaining. As said eariler, there's not a lot of emphasis on gameplay here, it's mainly solving puzzles, timing movements and sneaking around. The main emphasis is on the storylines. I personally find them (I can't really say for The Gunpowder Plot as I haven't completed it yet) to be an average yet entertaining story compared to those on the show. It's nothing as great as Day of the Doctor for example, but it's still entertaining at the least. Now, the puzzels are interesting, but I can't help but feel I keep doing the same one again after every 3 puzzels, which can get a bit repitive. And finally, the graphics aren't that groundbreaking or breathtaking but the environments are still visually interesting a give you something nice to look at whilst playing. Overall, I give the game a 7 or 6 out of 10. I'd only really reccomend it to those who are fans of the Doctor Who show and don't mind the point and click genre.			"

I personally find them (I can't really say for The Gunpowder Plot as I haven't completed it yet) to be an average yet entertaining story compared to those on the show. It's nothing as great as Day of the Doctor for example, but it's still entertaining at the least. Now, the puzzels are interesting, but I can't help but feel I keep doing the same one again after every 3 puzzels, which can get a bit repitive. And finally, the graphics aren't that groundbreaking or breathtaking but the environments are still visually interesting a give you something nice to look at whilst playing. Overall, I give the game a 7 or 6 out of 10. I'd only really reccomend it to those who are fans of the Doctor Who show and don't mind the point and click genre.			"

												I know this may sound nerdy but I have always loved Doctor Who and for them to make a game about it well lets just say I was over the moon with excitement, I remember being a kid and downloading them off the internet then one day they disappeared then to find them on here really made me happy. Always fun to play and very fun to look for the character pointsWould rate this game a 10/10			"

Instead I got a game with sluggish controlls, terrible graphics, bad lip syncing, horrible audio quality, and very little replay value. If you are a Doctor Who fan, I would reccomend sticking to the show, or buying The Eternity Clock and trying that.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!			"

												Ok to be clear.I'll review this game from the view as fan and gamer.+Fanreview:+ lots of different locations+ many known characters such as daleks, cyberman, companions and other.+ soundtrack. gotta love the soundtrack+ its a doctor who game...so.. full fangirl mood♥BUT from a gamer point of view- Gamerview- the controls are horrible.. i mean seriously horrible D:- i played with my controller and keyboard/mouse and its just awful- the AI of the companions is .... well.. ever tried to communicate/play with a potato?... its as useful as that.But let me tell you something.. it doesnt matter. Its Doctor Who. Buy and play!The lack of proper controls in this game is easly to ignore. This game rewards you with lots of backgroundstory, stunning soundtrack and the unique feeling to be the doctor himself.Enjoy the universe.""You were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

												""Doctor Who"" the show, if we are being honest, has low production standards but still manages to be enjoyable none the less. This philosophy does not translate to video games. Poor voice acting (despite allegedly being done by the actual cast), a vague-at-best idea about what an ""adventure game"" is, bad controls and forced stealth sections come together to make a truly unpleasant gaming experience.It is sad really since they probably could have built a better Doctor Who game by going over to the Adventure Game Studio forums and announcing a competition to create puzzles worthy of a character like the Doctor. (A character who literally survives by his wits.) Lots of people over there are huge Whovians.			"

												I played the first episode ages ago when I got a copy of it from PCPower magazine. All 5 episode were free to the people in UK to celebrate the new season. The game was made by a company in UK.I curently have played episode 1 and 2. They feel like animated interactive episodes of the show. It feels exactly like a Telltale Game. Each episode took a bit longer than an hour to beat. So you'll get around 6 hours out of this game. But you can always replay it to get all the collectables. And replaying it isn't boring and doesn't feel like a chore. Since I had already played episode 1 I played it again on Steam and it's still as exicting as when I first played it.			"

												I'm a major Doctor Who fan, and this game is entertaining for that reason...however it's still not the best game out there. Here are my reasons for not recommending this game to anyone who isn't a big fan.1. The controls can be very wonky, especially when playing the puzzles. Deffinitly a rage-inducing aspect of the game for me.2. The graphics are subpar, though I can give it a pass only on the fact it was produced as a free downloadable game in the UK a few years ago. 3. The voice acting is very badly done. It sounds like it was recorded and slapped on to the game. It may have the original cast, but they don't seem to have the enthusiasim for the game that they have during the show.Overall I'd give the game a 4/10, mainly because I enjoy it as a Dr. Who fan, but if I wasn't I wouldn't be playing it.

												Doctor Who: The Adventure Game, aka Doctor Who: The Easiest Game of All Time, is in fact, the easiest game of all time.I can't help but feel that Doctor Who has the potential for a good point-and-click adventure series (get on it, Telltale!). Instead, we have this poorly written mess, in which about 90% of puzzles solved by pointing the sonic screwdriver at the obstacle, while the remaining puzzles are so simple they could probably be solved by a drunk toddler. Most of the game goes like this: move from point A to point B, point sonic screwdriver at something, repeat ad nauseam. There's no challenge, no variety, and no fun.I might overlook the shoddy design if the stories were interesting. The first four episodes are all very boring. Something something daleks. Something something Cybermen. This is going to be a big call, but I'd rather watch terrible episodes like Fear Her or Daleks in Manhattan on repeat than sit through these again. The final episode, The Gunpowder Plot, was a bit more interesting, although it runs too long.The voice acting! The actual actors voice their characters! That's gotta give the game some credibility? Nope. Matt Smith delivered his lines with all the enthusiasm of a crusty, old mop. And yet, Karen Gillan somehow managed to be worse than that. The disdain she shows for voicing a video game... it's almost impressive.Pros: - Getting all 30 achievements is pretty easy.- There are no more pros. "

I think this game is more meant for kids, than Tennager, so expect to have it really easy. If you liked the Doctor Who series, you could try this game out.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Fun franchise game for any Whovians out there. Broken up into ""episodes"" you'll see familiar enemies, find trivia along the way and collect virtual trading cards with familiar faces and fun facts. You even get to explore the Tardis a little bit in one of the episodes. Lots of voice acting and tv show music included to immerse you a bit. The graphics aren't great, but it's not that bad either.. just a bit lifeless but still very faithful recreations. The only real issue with the game is the god awful clunky controls coupled with relatively bad pathing. It's annoying but bearable for the Doctor Who fans out there.All in all, I'd give it a 7/10.

The game lacks in looks and the controls are really bad but it seems like it has solid and simple gameplay.			"

												As a Whovian this game is amazing, as a gamer it is ok. The acting is great, it truly is Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. The gameplay could be more expansive and different but it just feels like a bunch of mini games.As a Whovian though, it is an expansion on Matt Smith's run as the Doctor with stories we haven't heard or seen and its really cool to be back in the Doctor Who world with my personal favorite Doctor and experience more stories with him in it.

												I waited to write this review till after I completed all the episodes of Doctor who. As I played, I have come across some remarkable nods to the mythology of the show, like describing the doctors' past selves and companions and teaching you how to drive the tardis. On the other hand, I have experienced certain glitches; however, the glitches do not break the adventure games easily. In fact, the glitches can be fixed by restarting what you were doing and fix your mistake. Also, I only experienced glitches in episodes two and five, which has different movement controls and includes Rory. The overall experience of playing the adventure games is like playing an average video game with 2000-like graphics: on the other hand, ""Doctor Who: The Adventure Games"" is a perfect opportunity to see THE tardis on your computer screen without moving to the UK.

												'Doctor Who: The Adventure Games' is a welcome sight for Doctor Who fans who have waited a long time for a game based on the show that is actually worth playing (anyone old enough to remember 'Dalek Attack' or 'Destiny of the Doctors' will know what I mean).  Set during the Matt Smith era, you guide the Doctor and Amy -- and during 'The Gunpowder Plot', Rory as well -- through a series of adventures that require different types of puzzle-solving to complete.  This, to me, is exactly what a Doctor Who game should be: an adventure game with puzzle-solving.  Sounds simple, but when done well, it can be really fun.The puzzles themselves are not that complicated.  Some involve matching symbols quickly, others are a fancy version of 'Operation', and others involve connecting wires without crossing other wires.  Again, not very elaborate, but at least it's something.  There will also be multiple instances where you have to sneak past enemies without being caught in their field of vision.  These parts are a little more complicated, but still only require a few attempts to succeed.Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill all lend their own voices to their respective characters.  This is a great touch as it enhances the feel of a Doctor Who episode.  However, the voice acting could be a little better.  Voiceovers for a game are not the same as acting out a scene for a camera, and unfortunately there are times where they sound flat and uninteresting.  But this is only a minor complaint, as I am simply happy they did their own voices.Other reviews have mentioned that the controls are a bit awkward to use.  While I agree they get clumsy at times, I never really felt like the controls were hindering my progress.  Granted, there were times where I was trying to sneak past an enemy and Amy would get stuck on a corner, but thankfully that didn't happen too much.Each episode is rather short, probably about 90 minutes each.  However, there are several collectable items in each level.  These take the form of cards and world facts.  Many are easy to find, but you'll likely have to replay parts of each episode to get everything, so that extends the life of the game somewhat.Overall, this game is worth picking up, but not at the full price of $19.99.  I got mine on sale for $4.99, and I'd say it's definitely worth that much.  Even at $9.99, it's at least worth considering, but I certainly wouldn't go any higher than that.			"

												It's hard to recommend this game to anyone but a Who fan. It's not exactly because it's a bad game, but rather that it doesn't really have anything going for itself other than the setting. The Adventure Games is made up of 6 pretty short episodes featuring the 8th doctor and his companion voiced by Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. The stories themselves are pretty decent but nothing to write home about. They are rather 'run of the mill' and for the most part not that original, but they have their moments. I'd say the voice cast is what drives this game forward. Matt and Karen manage to put a lot of charm and character even into the weakest of lines and it's great fun to listen to them interact. It's a shame that the stories aren't a bit more interesting and inspiring - otherwise the game could have served as a worderful entry for people new to the series. Unfortunately the game (obviously) had a low budget and it suffers a lot from it. The graphics are pretty basic, not really terrible but out of date. The character controls feel awkward and wonky which makes sneaking around (which you'll be doing a cosiderable amount of) pretty frustrating. The puzzles are all very basic and are also plagued by the awkward controls and which can make some of them somewhat irritating. Why the positive review then? There's enough Doctor Who juice to keep a fan happy for a short time it takes to beat the game (about 5hrs I'd say). It's certainly worth it if you can get it in a sale. If you're not into Who look elsewhere because as far as adventure games go this one is pretty weak.			"

												As a video game itself this is a terrible game. TERRIBLE. It's along the lines of point and click games that were popular circa 3DO and Sega CD. You have no control over running, crouching, jumping, only walking. This game was truly made just for the fans of the show. And not even that but fans of a specific section of the show. Namely the seasons featuring Matt Smith and Karen Gillian. A MAJOR downside for me was that David Tennant was by far the best Doctor out of the last several to play the role. And Rose was definitely the best companion. With neither of those characters making an appearence I think the game loses a lot of its appeal to people like me who aren't the biggest Matt Smith fans. Don't get me wrong I liked Matt Smiths version but only after  a long while. He had to grow on me like mold. Whereas I immedietly loved Christopher Eccleston and David Tennants versions. The game replays through several episodes that appear to be from the show though I don't specifically remember these shows. To me they seem more like an amalgamation of several of the shows. The game is entirely based on puzzles. Movement puzzles to avoid being seen, logic puzzles to rewire this or that, and finding items to combine and use to solve problems. This to me gets really tedious after a while. I love that the Doctor is a pacifist (sorta considering he's wiped out entire species or at least tried) but not being able to fight back in a video game is very cumbersome. If you are a fan of Matt, Rory, and Amy, then this will be a game you enjoy I think. If you don't watch the show or know anything about Doctor Who the majority of the game will be lost on you and you shouldnt waste your time or money.			"

												Warning right now if you're not a whovian who watches the show you shouldn't buy this game. Even as a whovian who got some enjoyment out of it so far. (I've finished the first episode and started the next one.) I still think whovians should buy this at a price drop. Doctor Who: The Adventure Games is pretty average. The controls take a while to get used to and the A.I at times can be pretty stupid. I have died a couple times thanks to Amy walking into a dalek's range of sight or into dangerous obsticles. It can be enjoyable, but I've had fun for about a couple minutes and just played till I finished the episode or act. I can see a nonwhovian buying this and finding it a waste of time. Which I find kinda sad really. A video game should be something anyone can pick up and play, no matter if they're a fan or not. Heck they might become a fan after playing it. However this is not the triple A Doctor Who video game we've been waiting for. Although I do appreciate the actors voicing their roles and these stories being canon to the show. Its hard to recommend this to anyone who isn't a fan. If you're a gamer, but not a whovian I suggest skipping. However if you're a whovian who loves the show I highly suggest this title. I've heard its one of the best Doctor Who games out there, although I suggest waiting until its on sale. I just wish Telltale or Bethesda could work with the Doctor Who license and create that super amazing Doctor Who game I'll be waiting for. For now though this will do.			"

												Seems a little simplistic at times, frustrating at others, you can play with wasd keys tho.   Assuming you dont make too many errors plays a bit like watching a Dr Who Episode; with a little less depth.   Pretty good for a Dr Who Game I suppose.Frustratingly there are a few areas that you can miss unless you deliberately ignore items or doors, requiring another playthrough to explore, but otherwise reasonable for passing an hour or two.In so much as plot goes, has similar story twists to watching an actual episode; just dont be expecting arching storylines and photo realistic graphics and you will enjoy it in small doses. Recommend for kids perhaps.			"

												For everyone who hasn't seen anything of Doctor Who and who just isn't into the show just keep your fingers off of it. Whovians may continue to read:The Adventure Games contain 4 episodes (+ The extra episode the gunpowder plot which is significantly longer than the other 4) serving as mini episodes (about an hour playtime each) during the 11th Doctor and Amy Pond era of the show. The mini episode aspect is even more evident with a pre opening teaster, the well known opening of the TARDIS flying in the time vortex and closing credits.While the stories themself are nicely written and there are many injokes in the dialogue and what not. As an interactive story the game does a nice job.Where it fails though is game play: very repetitive mini games such as avoiding enemies, wiring up some stuff or guiding stuff in and out of mazes. On top of that navigation is also not very well and more often than not glitchy. In terms of game play this is just a total failure. Therefore if you are a Whovian and can cope with the above points, go get it when you get a bargain on it. Otherwise not really worth the price. Everyone else better keep clear off of this game and try some other original adventure game.			"

												Great game! I really enjoyed this game! Recommended for any Whovians & anyone who's Doctor was Matt Smith (like me as well as David), Some of the levels I found hard & struggled with but wouldn't pay for the game to be super easy! Worth the money I say! :)			"

												Edit: After playing through the Gunpowder Plot, a lot of the issues I had as far as janky controls and length were solved, however I could only recommend that part of the game.Original Review: First off; like many others the game captures the feel of the show as it was obviously meant to do.That being said, everything about the game other than it's writing and audio aspects is absolute garbage.Graphics wise it looks like a early playstation 2 game, which admittadely doesn't bother me all that much but where there's a lot of clipping and sort; that's when it starts to bug me.Control wise, the game is kind of weird. It uses WSAD, or the right mouse button for movement. Which I can appreciate given that sometimes I just want to be lazy and use only the mouse. That being said, the character's movements are as if they tried to add momentum to their steps to make it seem more realistic when running, but it just makes it feel sluggish and at times unresponsive. The mouse control during some of the minigames can be teeth grindingly aggravating, especially with the wire minigame. Now, gameplay wise it's an adventure game. You go around (sometimes in stealth mode). solve puzzles, do minigames, collect items etc etc. It's barebones and has just enough variety to call it a game.So, the game has a stealth mechanic which involves either The Doctor, Amy, or both hunched over in a crouch trying to avoid whatever the enemy is at the time. Often times, it's easy to deal with as the enemies either patrol or just stay in one area. The only time I had a pain with it was during tight corridors where the partner's A.I. would act up and either get caught on something or decide to take a few extra seconds getting into the hiding spot, causing them to be seen and having to restart. Another problem I had involved the enemy A.I. as sometimes trying to lead them into certain positions can be a pain due to them getting caught on walls or objects. It's especially aggravating considering you have to lure a couple of enemies into the same room in order to continue, only for one to constantly walk away after getting it near the door time and time again.Would I recommend the game? Sure, if you wanted more of Matt Smith's Doctor and the episodes quit doing it for you. The game has a nice variety of facts from both the real world and the Doctor Who universe which made getting all the collictibles actually worth it. The episodes are pretty well written and the sound design is good enough for my eyes.That being said, I wouldn't buy this game for $20. Even if it has several episodes, the gameplay can be frustrating to the point that it's a chore to get through certain sections. If anything, I'd get it at $5 maybe $7.50.Doctor Who fans, you deserve a better game than what you've been offered so far with this and the Eternity Clock.			"

												11/10. 360 no scope Sonic Screwdriver shot. Take on Cybermen and Dalleks with clunky controls and 2001-era, first-gen Xbox graphical assets. Just pretend that you travelled in your Tardis back to 2001 and be blown away. This is a great way to continue your adventures with the Eleventh Doctor, Amy & Rory. Recommended but for Whovian's only.			"

												For everyone who hasn't seen anything of Doctor Who and who just isn't into the show just keep your fingers off of it. Whovians may continue to read:The Adventure Games contain 4 episodes (+ The extra episode the gunpowder plot which is significantly longer than the other 4) serving as mini episodes (about an hour playtime each) during the 11th Doctor and Amy Pond era of the show. The mini episode aspect is even more evident with a pre opening teaster, the well known opening of the TARDIS flying in the time vortex and closing credits.While the stories themself are nicely written and there are many injokes in the dialogue and what not. As an interactive story the game does a nice job.Where it fails though is game play: very repetitive mini games such as avoiding enemies, wiring up some stuff or guiding stuff in and out of mazes. On top of that navigation is also not very well and more often than not glitchy. In terms of game play this is just a total failure. Therefore if you are a Whovian and can cope with the above points, go get it when you get a bargain on it. Otherwise not really worth the price. Everyone else better keep clear off of this game and try some other original adventure game.			"

												For a Game made in 2011 the graphics are pretty poor, they couldn't be bothered to iluminate the intirior od the Tardis, lights dont aline properly, textures are missing on the Tardis during the begining cutscene, characters and NPC's Clip through random things like phoneboxes and taxis.Gameplay wise each episode is disharteningly short and lasts for barely an hour, most missions rely on you using ""Stealth"" (dont walk into thegreen noitice area of the NPC's with a pre determined path) there are also many stupid ""gude this through the maze games"" which are fun to start with but appear constantly throughout the game and just become repetative and obnoxious.Overall the game isn't as horendous as others that were released in the same year however, it could also have been so much better than it was. As an avid Doctor who fan i was fairly disapointed with the game. But i would still recomend that you buy it during a sale and try it for yourself.			"

												This game is really fun actually, usually games based off tv shows aren't the best but this is an exception. This game features The 11th Doctor, Amy Pond, and Rory Pond, I would wake up at 5 am so excited to play this game. This game is about 8 hours long if you include The Gunpowder Plot and don't include a lot of collectables			"

												I am a huge Whovian (fan of Doctor Who) and when this game went on sale I jumped at the opportunity. I really like the story and how the controls are set up but I would not put the price at $20 or more. I would say $10 or no more than $15. This is because you get 3 episodes which wouldn't take too much time for someone who games a lot. I know I have very little game time but my brother is nearly all the way through after only playing a couple of days. Hopefully more will be added to make the price more worth while.			"

												Utter dog toffee. Dated graphics, sluggish unresponsive controls that really make the stealth component more of a pain than it should be, shallow forced storyline and ""puzzles"" that you have seen a million times before. Not challenging in any way. I am sticking it out for the voice acting but that is about all this abomination has going for it.			"
